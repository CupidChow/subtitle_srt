00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,600
I finally left this place.

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,400
Assassin Liu!

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,120
Brother, who are you?

Qi Guang, let's have a taste.

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
It looks good and smells good.

9
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,000
Qi Guang, let's have a taste.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,400
Put it back.

00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
is the only one left in the Imperial Kitchen.

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,600
No, I'm not from the Imperial Kitchen.

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,000
Be careful.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,400
I'm not from the Imperial Kitchen.

00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,400
This is his best record.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,800
He died 70 times in a month.

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,200
This is the only time he lived until the death of the former king.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
It's also the closest to the first level.

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,800
The record of leaving the Cold Palace.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,200
How could this be?

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,400
If he can't pass the level,

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
what will happen?

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
If he can't pass the level,

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,200
he can't repair his mental health.

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
All the mental health will die.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
There's no difference between a patient

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,000
who can maintain his life by relying on his device.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,200
It's just a waste of resources.

31
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
He usually plays games at home.

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,600
How could he not pass the first level?

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,600
Don't say that.

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,200
You really shouldn't say that.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,400
He is a qualified life-gamer.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,600
He has been doing this for more than 70 times.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
He has planted corn in the Cold Palace 40 times.

38
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
He has learned to make money from it.

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
He has become a meat-growing expert.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
But in this world,

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,400
if you want to do these things,

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
it's impossible.

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,400
Let's not talk about anything else.

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,600
Jiang Tao, have you ever seen real corn?

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,600
Have you ever seen a piece of pork

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
turn into bacon?

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Have you ever tasted a real tomato?

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
In our time,

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
it was just a normal thing.

50
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
But now,

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,400
isn't he a rich and idle person?

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
He might not even have seen a sword.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I guess he must have read some related books.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
If it wasn't for saving his life,

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,200
he would have been living in that world.

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,200
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,400
So sorry.

115
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
I'm sorry.

116
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
I'm sorry.

117
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,680
I'm not dead.

119
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,880
Your Highness, you're awake.

120
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Longqian,

121
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,340
what happened last night?

122
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,160
I don't know, either.

123
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,360
Mrs. Xiao sent you the new clothes.

124
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,440
She said you were poisoned.

125
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,760
But she cured the poison.

126
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Did she hear everything?

127
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,080
Oh, no.

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,520
I think the poison was made by the new clothes.

129
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,200
She's so selfish.

130
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,400
We can't defeat the princess.

131
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,240
The princess can't defeat the new clothes?

132
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,360
A king who can't kill his own princess

133
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,360
turned his head and ordered the best master

134
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,760
to beat a maid.

135
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,600
Ridiculous.

136
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,440
Long Xi.

137
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,120
Kill him.

138
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,960
Your Majesty.

139
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
Where's the maid?

140
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,560
I don't care.

141
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,560
Do it.

142
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,000
It hurts.

143
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,600
It's easy to discuss.

144
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,040
I'm not talking about you.

145
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,680
What's wrong with your temper?

146
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,120
How about this?

147
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,640
You give me the bamboo slice.

148
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll share the share with you if I find the money.

149
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,880
What do you think?

150
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,280
I don't need the money.

151
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,520
And the princess said there's no money at all.

152
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,440
What's behind this is the imperial jade seal.

153
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,760
Imperial jade seal?

154
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,720
What's the use?

155
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,160
Imperial jade seal.

156
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,360
It's a national treasure.

157
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,480
The emperor's treasure.

158
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,360
The one who gets it can rule the world.

159
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,280
Since the late dynasty,

160
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,440
our ministers have been losing their faith

161
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,240
and sending secret guards to guard the palace.

162
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,480
But they never got it.

163
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,880
Not only Chen,

164
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,560
Wu also has been looking for it for decades.

165
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,080
Even Zhitong knows

166
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,680
that the emperor of Qin ruled the world

167
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,720
and broke the Zhao state's stone and treasure box.

168
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,320
He ordered Li Si, the prime minister,

169
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,080
to carve it into a seal with a small drill.

170
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,000
Just a broken jade seal

171
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,520
and Wu has let it go?

172
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,320
Then the Minister of War and the Prince of Wu

173
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,760
can listen to me?

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Then do you think

175
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,840
the Princess Dowager can kneel down and beg me?

176
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,040
I think so.

177
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,160
What do you think?

178
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,000
If you want me to kneel down and beg you,

179
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,320
it's impossible.

180
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,160
What do you think?

181
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,440
It's useless.

182
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,960
You can break it.

183
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,760
Don't regret it.

184
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,760
Wait.

185
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,440
The imperial jade seal.

186
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,920
Jade seal?

187
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,040
What's the use of jade seal?

188
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,080
What's the use?

189
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,040
A jade...

190
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,720
Isn't it a jade seal?

191
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,600
A jade seal?

192
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,480
It's so big.

193
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,480
It's so big.

194
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,320
If I can find it,

195
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,520
I won't be late no matter how hard I try.

196
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
It hasn't rained for months.

197
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,520
The land has been dry and the grain has been unsold.

198
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,120
The three cities of Yan, Lu Ming and Xiang

199
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,120
have suffered the finalemed duststorms.

200
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,400
For the refugees to leave and the treasury to be empty,

201
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,040
the cover ofNS is needed.

202
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,600
Your Highness, you are to read this...

203
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,280
Reflect on your mistakes.

204
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,320
Want to be punished?

205
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,960
Get lost in your death.

206
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,880
Your Majesty.

207
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,600
Before the civil officials

208
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,200
head to your palace,

209
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,500
Recite upon your

210
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,020
Yes.

211
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,700
Minister Da,

212
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,820
what do you want to say?

213
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,700
I'm clear about it.

214
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,020
Do you know why?

215
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,540
Because I'm a man of the heaven.

216
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,500
Your Majesty,

217
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,020
what you said is indeed a critical moment.

218
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,700
The people are in a panic.

219
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,180
There are no soldiers or soldiers outside the gate.

220
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,380
I think

221
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,140
the people's safety is the people's wealth.

222
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,460
But the treasury...

223
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,140
The treasury is empty.

224
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,620
The people are in panic.

225
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:14,980
Minister Lin,

226
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,220
since you really love Chen,

227
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,580
why don't you donate your family's money

228
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,420
to the treasury?

229
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,420
Minister Da is so ambitious.

230
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,140
Guards, take him out.

231
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,100
Kill him.

232
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,860
I'll see who dares to do it.

233
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,780
Yes.

234
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,500
No one listens to me, right?

235
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,900
Then why are you

236
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,460
begging for help?

237
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,860
Why are you drunk?

238
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,900
You don't listen to me.

239
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,340
How can the God listen to me?

240
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,180
I'm not going.

241
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,740
Three shots.

242
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,420
Team up.

243
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,300
distributed them inubaingly.

244
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,140
The hands of Zhang Xiang Er

245
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,180
took it away right after

246
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,580
I returned to the palace.

247
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,940
Just explain the contents

248
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,620
of the bamboo slices.

249
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,860
Madam Xiao,

250
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,540
don't touch them.

251
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,140
I can't move in Chen State.

252
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,140
She is the legendary female Martial God.

253
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,140
Female Martial God?

254
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,140
Without ten percent, there is nine percent.

255
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,140
If she is really a female Martial God,

256
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,140
Lian'er,

257
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,140
you must be careful.

258
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,140
I will be careful.

259
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,140
Don't let me worry about you.

260
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
What should I do?

261
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,140
The days of the six or seven guards won't be long.

262
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,140
When the time comes, I will take Chen State

263
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
and help you to the throne.

264
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,140
Then no one will teach us the snake roots.

265
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,140
You really don't mind that I have a child?

266
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,140
I will tell you the truth.

267
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,140
The person I love is you.

268
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,140
Your past made you become the person I love.

269
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,140
I only want you.

270
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,140
The truth is the truth.

271
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,140
Is it true or not?

272
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,140
I don't know.

273
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,140
I don't know. Shut up.

274
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,140
The ghost mountain is dark under the light.

275
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,140
What kind of ghost mountain is it?

276
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,140
I know the ghost mountain.

277
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,140
It is a place.

278
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,140
Place?

279
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,140
Yes.

280
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,140
Between the mountains of Chen State and the two states,

281
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,140
there is a lot of steam.

282
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,140
It is a place.

283
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,140
It is a place.

284
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,140
It is a place.

285
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,140
Between the mountains of Chen State and the two states,

286
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
there is a lot of steam.

287
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,140
There was a war a hundred years ago.

288
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,140
So the people were more thin.

289
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
It is said that the ghost of the dead soldiers

290
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,140
wandered in the mountains.

291
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,140
Then it became an isolated island

292
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,140
where the two states were in.

293
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,140
It attracted a wave of death and death.

294
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,140
Let's get to the point.

295
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,140
It is dangerous.

296
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
You are talking about places that are dangerous?

297
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
Your Majesty, you can't go there.

298
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
The mountains are high and the water is far.

299
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,140
It is not realistic.

300
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
Relax.

301
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,140
Don't always show your face.

302
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,140
Didn't the Grand Tutor say

303
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
the more dangerous the place is,

304
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
the more it is safe and quiet.

305
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Safe and quiet?

306
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,140
You don't understand the metaphor.

307
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,140
The metaphor?

308
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,140
Here.

309
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,140
Give Yan Xiao one.

310
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
Be more natural.

311
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,140
Your Majesty,

312
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
you can't go to the mountain.

313
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,140
But if I don't go,

314
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,140
how can I find the jade seal?

315
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,140
Your Majesty, you just said

316
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,140
the ghost of the dead soldiers wandered in the mountains.

317
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,140
The ghost of the dead soldiers wandered in the mountains.

318
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,140
Then this thing

319
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,140
is not in the mountain,

320
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,140
but in the darkness.

321
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
In the darkness?

322
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
What does it mean?

323
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,140
In the darkness,

324
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
it means that

325
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,140
the place below is the darkest.

326
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,140
That means the jade seal

327
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,140
might be

328
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
right in front of the palace

329
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,140
in the Chen State.

330
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
That's why it's called the darkness of the dead soldiers.

331
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
If you hide the thing

332
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,140
around you,

333
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,140
where will it be hidden?

334
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,140
It's in the dark room under the bed of Linghua Hall.

335
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,140
No.

336
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,140
I've used up all the places

337
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
that can be hidden.

338
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
What if I hide the thing

339
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,140
in the Chen Palace?

340
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,140
Where can it be hidden?

341
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,140
Your Majesty, show me the bamboo.

342
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Where is this?

343
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,140
This is Fengxian Hall.

344
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,140
Let's go.

345
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,140
Zeyi.

346
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,140
You...

347
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,140
You go there.

348
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Long Qing, you go there.

349
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
I'll go here.

350
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
Long Qing.

351
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,140
Long Qing.

352
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,140
Wang Shenye made a mess

353
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,140
and smashed Fengxian Hall.

354
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,140
It's a mess over there.

355
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,140
I can't punish you.

356
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,140
I can't hurt you.

357
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,140
But the servant next to Wang

358
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,140
will beat me to death.

359
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,140
I don't care about it.

360
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,140
Where is Wang Shenye?

361
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,140
Stop.

362
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,140
Stop fighting.

363
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Stop.

364
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,140
I arranged all this.

365
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
I asked someone to give the bamboo to His Majesty

366
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
and let him come to Fengxian Hall

367
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,140
to find the so-called jade seal.

368
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,140
The jade seal of the Chen State.

369
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
Did you find it?

370
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,140
No.

371
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,140
Chen Xiaohua.

372
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
Chen Xiaohua.

373
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,140
The Chen State has no land to live in

374
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,140
and the refugees are everywhere.

375
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,140
There are also the invaders.

376
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,140
You just want to find

377
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,140
the so-called jade seal of the Chen State.

378
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,140
You smashed Fengxian Hall.

379
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,140
I'll tell you.

380
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,140
Three days later,

381
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,140
I'll start the Qiyu Ceremony.

382
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,140
You have to read the criminal record

383
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,140
and settle the case with peace.

384
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,140
Can you do it?

385
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,140
I...

386
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,140
He can.

387
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,140
I can.

388
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,140
Good.

389
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,140
If you can,

390
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,140
that's all for tonight.

391
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
Yuling Jun.

392
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,140
Yes.

393
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,140
Take Wang in and face the case.

394
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,140
Who dares?

395
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,140
Minister.

396
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,140
You openly hit my secret position today.

397
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,140
And you want to close me off.

398
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,140
Are you confused

399
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,140
and forget that I'm the king of Chen State?

400
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,140
You think you're the king of Chen State?

401
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,140
I...

402
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,140
Honey.

403
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,140
What does he mean?

404
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,140
If you think you're the king of Chen State,

405
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,140
you should know what you should do

406
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,140
and what you shouldn't do.

407
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,140
Xifang.

408
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,140
Xifang.

409
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,140
Du...

410
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,140
Whether it's a closed wall or a prison,

411
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,140
I think you're right.

412
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,140
What if?

413
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
I'm not.

414
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
What if?

415
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,140
You wanted to kill me, didn't you?

416
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,140
Don't forget our agreement.

417
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,140
Between you and me,

418
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,140
there's only you and me.

419
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,140
You've made progress.

420
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,140
You know how to care for others.

421
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,140
You're smart.

422
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,140
You can help others.

423
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,140
Three days later,

424
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
the king will ask for the death penalty.

425
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,140
He will announce the death penalty in public.

426
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,140
He will admit that he's incompetent.

427
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,140
And Chen State will be in trouble.

428
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,140
It's not his fault.

429
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,140
Your Highness.

430
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,140
The message from 800 miles away.

431
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,140
Your Highness.

432
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,140
Did something happen?

433
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,140
Your Highness.

434
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,140
Your Highness.

435
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,140
Your Highness.

436
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,140
Your Highness is seriously ill.

437
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,140
According to the palace's situation,

438
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,140
the crown prince is still in Chen State.

439
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,140
But

440
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
the reason Chen State was in trouble

441
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,140
was because its ancestors

442
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,140
were looking for the jade seal.

443
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,140
It's called the world's rightful owner.

444
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Now Chen Wu Heng is dead.

445
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,140
Our state is in a state of crisis.

446
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,140
It's not easy to deal with.

447
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,140
When it comes to our state,

448
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
our state will be in a state of shame

449
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
for a hundred years.

450
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,140
It's time to end it.

451
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,140
So,

452
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,140
you mean

453
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,140
Chen Xiaohua doesn't deserve the throne.

454
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,140
As long as we can get the throne,

455
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,140
it means that the fifth prince's adoptive father,

456
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,140
the son of Princess Zhang,

457
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,140
is the real king of Chen State.

458
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,140
Our state will obey the will of the heaven.

459
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,140
If we send troops to help him,

460
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,140
it will be a good thing.

461
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
Your Highness.

462
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,140
I'll leave for the capital tomorrow.

463
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,140
Wu Zhong.

464
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,140
Keep investigating

465
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,140
the whereabouts of the jade seal for me.

466
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,140
If you have any clues,

467
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
it's useless.

468
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,140
Yes, Your Highness.

469
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Your Highness.

470
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
Your Highness.

471
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
Your Highness.

472
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
Your Highness.

473
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,140
Your Highness.

474
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Your Highness.

475
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,140
Your Highness.

476
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,140
Your Highness.

477
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,140
Your Highness.

478
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,140
Your Highness.

479
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
Your Highness.

480
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
Your Highness.

481
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,140
Your Highness.

482
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,140
Your Highness.

483
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
Your Highness.

484
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,140
Your Highness.

485
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,060
Go.

486
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,860
Be careful.

487
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,500
I don't know

488
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,300
when we'll meet again.

489
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:23,980
Don't worry.

490
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,980
It won't be long.

491
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,580
When I come back,

492
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,140
We don't need to live in secret anymore.

493
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,140
These past years,

494
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,140
I've wronged you.

495
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,140
It's not wronged.

496
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,140
I have a traitor in my heart.

497
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,140
It's not wronged.

498
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,140
I'm sorry.

499
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,140
I don't think it's good to eat secretly.

500
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,140
Otherwise, I won't eat it.

501
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,140
Can you be more serious?

502
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,140
This is the tenth piece you eat.

503
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,140
You're so ridiculous.

504
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,140
Chen Xiaohua.

505
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,140
Wife.

506
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,140
Give it to Long Qi. Help him apply it.

507
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,140
Thank you, my lady.

508
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
Chen's country is located on the mainland.

509
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,140
It's far from the sea.

510
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,140
The air that's wet can't reach most of the workers' areas of Chen's country.

511
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,140
In addition, Chen's country is located in the highlands.

512
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,140
The highlands belong to the hot springs in summer.

513
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
The surrounding areas belong to the cold springs.

514
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,140
Cold air flows through the highlands,

515
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,140
which makes the water vapor less.

516
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,140
That's right.

517
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,140
My wife is right.

518
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,140
You didn't understand, did you?

519
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,140
Anyway, it's not your fault if it's not raining.

520
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,140
Whether it's raining or being drunk,

521
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
you're asking for the people's peace.

522
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,140
It's your duty to make the people's peace.

523
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,140
Think about the bamboo slice.

524
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,140
Why did the late king leave it to the descendants?

525
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,140
Gong Xi.

526
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,140
Does it hurt?

527
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,140
It's okay.

528
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,140
I don't move, so it doesn't hurt.

529
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,140
You said you were doing my security.

530
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,140
I'm the one who's being controlled every day.

531
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,140
You must regret it.

532
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,140
I never regret doing security.

533
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,140
Yes.

534
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,140
But what if you have a chance to choose not to do security?

535
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,140
I've never thought about this question.

536
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,140
But my life is king's.

537
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,140
Your life is yours.

538
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,140
My life should have been gone long ago.

539
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,140
If it wasn't for...

540
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,140
Forget it.

541
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,140
Anyway, I'm the king's man in this life.

542
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,140
I'll do whatever the king asks me to do.

543
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Why?

544
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,140
Why?

545
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,140
Because the king is good to me.

546
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
Are you stupid?

547
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,140
But don't say that.

548
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,140
The people of Chen State are really pitiful.

549
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
This drunkenness is really something to do.

550
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
It's really something to do.

551
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,140
You said,

552
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,140
what about food?

553
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
There's no water.

554
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,140
He's still a man.

555
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,140
It's true.

556
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,140
The ancestors of the Zhang family are above.

557
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,140
I, Zhang Jinlong, have been single-handedly and only live for Chen State.

558
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,140
But the great enemy is in front.

559
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,140
Before that,

560
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,140
the king of Chen, Chen Xiaohua,

561
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,140
mixed martial arts.

562
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,140
Three days later,

563
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,140
Chen State will hold a chess competition.

564
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,140
Then the king of Chen will be the most poisonous.

565
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,140
What if...

566
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,140
What if he's still like a rotten fish on the floating cloth?

567
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,140
