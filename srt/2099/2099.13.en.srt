=Episode 13=
(Retreat in Order to Advance)

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,920
(Yizhan Deng)
Straighten out the carpet on the stairs.

3
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:43,639
(Yizhan Deng)
East...

4
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,319
Sir.

5
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,920
Grand Marshal.

6
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,319
Warrioress.

7
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,439
King Chen.

8
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,040
Antiquarian master.

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,400
We must thank him

10
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,799
for his wholehearted support.

11
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,519
My pleasure.

12
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,120
My informant told me

13
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,999
that news about the auction
of the Imperial Seal

14
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,519
had reached the Wu Army.

15
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,319
King Wu will come in disguise.

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,920
But I just don't understand.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,120
Why is King Wu
so concerned about this item?

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,120
It may be the Imperial Seal,

19
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,560
but after all, the Wu Army
can secure victory on the battlefield.

20
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:25,919
Grand Marshal.

21
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,919
I know better than to pry.

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,319
I won't ask questions
I'm not supposed to.

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,239
Anyway, the venue

24
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,159
is almost set up.

25
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,120
We will wait for the show to begin

26
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,919
at the Hour of Si tomorrow.

27
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,599
Alright.

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
Thank you, sir.

29
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,959
You're too kind, King Chen.

30
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,760
One more thing.

31
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,719
Yes, Grand Marshal?

32
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,120
Unexpected things

33
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,560
might happen at the auction tomorrow.

34
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,479
So we hope you can

35
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,520
buy us some time once King Wu

36
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,199
enters the venue.

37
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,319
Please kindly

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,120
keep the auction going

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,319
smoothly

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,639
until we take down King Wu.

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,800
You're right.

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,960
It makes sense.

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,319
You can never be too careful.

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,319
Everything is ready.

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,319
But there's still one item missing.

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,879
What is it?

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
The Imperial Seal.

48
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,439
I have all of them here.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,199
Feel free to choose.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,039
Guishan truly lives up
to its reputation.

51
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,120
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,479
The Imperial Seal.

53
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,159
Does it look right?

54
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,319
It's made of gold.

55
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,400
Are you kidding me?

56
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
This one will do.

57
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,160
This one could be the Imperial Seal.

58
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,199
Alright then.

59
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,360
Leave the rest to me.

60
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:42,688
(Yizhan Deng)

61
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:58,880
(Yizhan Deng)

62
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:01,696
(Yizhan Deng)

63
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,560
People from Chu and Yue are here.

64
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,519
He brought only one guard?

65
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,160
So arrogant, huh?

66
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,720
Whatever.

67
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,240
It's better if he underestimates us.

68
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,120
He's here.

69
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,399
The auspicious time has arrived.

70
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,319
My distinguished guests,
welcome to Guishan.

71
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,640
(North, East, West, South)

72
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,839
(South, West)
I have been

73
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,680
searching the world
for rare treasures for years.

74
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,119
From famous paintings and calligraphy
to rare antiques,

75
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,800
everything is one of a kind.

76
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,879
I can assure you

77
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,399
that you will find this trip

78
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,199
worthwhile.

79
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,799
I have news.

80
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,240
The secret guards are in place.

81
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,319
But King Wu only brought one guard.

82
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,160
We only see Chu and Yue's forces

83
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,279
but no Wu Army.

84
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,680
It doesn't make sense.

85
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
But we've confirmed it.

86
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
There are no ambushes.

87
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,199
Stay on watch with Long Qi.

88
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,079
Wait to drive away

89
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,279
the Chu and Yue forces.

90
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,360
Understood.

91
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,359
You are all esteemed guests.

92
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,199
I don't care if you're royal kin

93
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,080
or wandering rogues.

94
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,679
All I care about is money.

95
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,399
My lord.

96
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,720
King Wu didn't bring troops.

97
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,519
Secondly, once the bid is finalized,

98
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,239
we will present you
with the item for verification.

99
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,519
Something's fishy.

100
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,960
Erlang.

101
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,639
Keep scouting.

102
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,639
See if there are ambushes.

103
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,679
Understood.

104
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,639
I never liked

105
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,320
to create suspense.

106
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,719
I have collected

107
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,719
several treasures for this auction.

108
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,799
He's going to drink it.

109
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,440
Early last month,

110
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,199
I happened to acquire

111
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,599
a treasured artifact.

112
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,360
I decided on the spot

113
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,280
to put away all the other items

114
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,919
and auction nothing
but this piece of artifact today.

115
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,799
Drink it.

116
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,688
(East, South, West, North)

117
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,559
This is

118
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,719
the treasure that provokes contention
among different forces.

119
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,759
The Imperial Seal.

120
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,840
It's said that the Imperial Seal
is the mandate of heaven

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,799
that bestows longevity

122
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,360
upon the emperor

123
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,519
and that he who obtains
the Imperial Seal takes over the world.

124
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,919
Without further ado,

125
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,759
let the auction begin.

126
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,400
Starting bid:
ten million taels of silver.

127
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,720
Gentlemen, please place your bids.

128
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,759
South. One bid.

129
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,919
West.

130
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,840
One bid.

131
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,679
North.

132
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,120
One bid.

133
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,960
East.

134
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,279
One bid.

135
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,040
South.

136
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,200
One bid again.

137
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,399
North.

138
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,200
One bid again.

139
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,000
West.

140
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,639
One bid again.

141
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,679
East.

142
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,320
One bid again.

143
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,919
North.

144
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,160
One bid again.

145
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,919
South.

146
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,120
One bid again.

147
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,640
West. One bid again.

148
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,480
North.

149
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,480
East.

150
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,960
Double the bid.

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,480
Your bid is no longer covered.

152
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,559
Wish to continue?

153
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,440
Sir.

154
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,879
Your bid is no longer covered.

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,360
Are you sure you want to raise the bid?

156
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,320
That's it.

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,720
I'm done.

158
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
(Yizhan Deng)
Let's go.

159
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,360
The Yue bidder is out, too.

160
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,839
Once I sell this Imperial Seal,

161
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,559
I will never have to work

162
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
for a lifetime...

163
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,159
I mean, for several lifetimes.

164
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,159
Gentlemen.

165
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,759
Will you raise the bid?

166
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,279
Antiquarian master.

167
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,679
Don't bother.

168
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,799
Five bids.

169
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,519
I wonder if my bid is covered.

170
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,759
Can the gentleman across
still afford to bid against me?

171
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,320
Little brat.

172
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,519
Honey.

173
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,559
Why does King Wu

174
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,879
want the Imperial Seal so much?

175
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,240
If I had the money he has,

176
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,799
why would I take part in wars?

177
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,000
I'd just offer tribute to Wu State

178
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,720
to buy eternal peace

179
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,919
and live a happy life with you.

180
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,840
Guest from the West, 21 bids.

181
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,519
Once.

182
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,840
Your Majesty.

183
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,879
Your Grace.

184
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,120
The Chu and Yue people have left.

185
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,399
Everything is ready.

186
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,519
Shall we?

187
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,600
Guest from the West, 21 bids.

188
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,799
Twice.

189
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,720
Guest from the West,

190
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,720
21 bids.

191
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,000
Thrice.

192
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,919
Congratulations, guest from the West.

193
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,440
You won the Imperial Seal.

194
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:46,633
(Save every inch of land)

195
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,200
Congratulations to King Wu

196
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,120
for winning the Imperial Seal.

197
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,279
Grand Marshal.

198
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,639
Long time no see.

199
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,039
How have you been?

200
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,000
King Wu,

201
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,200
surrender now.

202
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,080
If you beg for mercy on your knees,

203
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,759
maybe I'll leave your body intact.

204
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,000
Chen Xiaohua,

205
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,200
do you think

206
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
that you have secured your victory?

207
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,159
There is no personal enmity between us.

208
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,399
It's just that
your father has just died.

209
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,639
And instead of mourning for him,

210
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,960
you invaded our border.

211
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,120
You brought this

212
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,559
upon yourself.

213
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,319
You are King Chen.

214
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,519
I am King Wu.

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,719
Personal enmity matters not.

216
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,039
Anyway, one of us has to die today.

217
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,799
This is fate.

218
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,960
I don't believe in fate.

219
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,000
"My fate is in my hands."

220
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,840
That's correct.

221
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,399
But what a pity.

222
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,360
It should be "Your fate is in my hands."

223
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,720
Still talking tough
when you're about to die.

224
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,559
Everybody, listen up.

225
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:47,320
Whoever kills King Wu will be rewarded

226
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,000
with 1,000 taels of gold.

227
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,440
Strike.

228
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,559
What are you doing?

229
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,159
You're supposed to kill King Wu.

230
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,159
Xu Erlang.

231
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,559
Xu Erlang, you betrayed us?

232
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,320
Grand Marshal,
Chen State is beyond hope.

233
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,200
Besides, the Zhang Army
fought to establish the state.

234
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,639
Just say the word and the state

235
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,880
will bear a new surname.

236
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,080
You shut up!

237
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,120
How dare you mention the Zhang Army?

238
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,320
Who gave you the courage?

239
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,200
I did, of course.

240
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,200
Brother,

241
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,360
haven't you always said
that Chen Xiaohua

242
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,799
is the bane of Chen State?

243
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,200
Why don't you take his place today?

244
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,840
Liang and I have always been
fond of each other.

245
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,399
Come over here.

246
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,360
Soon, the States
of Chen and Wu will be one.

247
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,159
We have decided on it.

248
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,159
We'll kill Chen Xiaohua today

249
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,159
and make your nephew the next king.

250
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,759
You will still hold
the real power of Chen State.

251
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,440
A wise bird chooses
the right tree to perch on.

252
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,359
- Brother-in-law.
- Who is your brother-in-law?

253
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,480
Move!

254
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,319
Who is your brother-in-law?

255
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,440
You shameless couple.

256
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,640
Let me go.

257
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,599
Stop it.

258
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,000
Stop it. Step back.

259
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,839
Brother, get up.

260
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,799
Brother.

261
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,079
Brother.

262
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,519
The former king asked for

263
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,480
all his consorts
to be buried with him back then.

264
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,759
It was you

265
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,000
who went around lobbying and saved me

266
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,079
and the child I was bearing.

267
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,680
Brother.

268
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,680
Side with me today.

269
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,160
I swear I will protect you
as you protected me.

270
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,559
You remember that, huh?

271
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,319
Our family is completely loyal.

272
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,480
Yet you betrayed Chen State.

273
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,480
You are not part of the family.

274
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,559
That's right!

275
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,000
You never considered me
as part of the family.

276
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,680
I am your little sister.

277
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,160
You knew I was in love with him

278
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,680
but you still forced me
to marry that old man.

279
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,960
I hate you!

280
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,799
But I don't blame you.

281
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,000
Brother.

282
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,240
Brother, look at Chen Xiaohua.

283
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,279
If it hadn't been for us,

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,920
Chen State would have fallen long ago.

285
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,400
Brother, please do it for me

286
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,839
and the people of Chen State.

287
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,319
What did we...

288
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,240
What did we do wrong?

289
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,359
Why can't we take his place?

290
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,799
Queen Wu.

291
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,759
You have

292
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,200
captivated me.

293
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,640
Kill me

294
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,839
if you want to.

295
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,359
Grand Marshal.

296
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,559
None of it matters.

297
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,759
The winner is already decided.

298
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,559
It's only a matter of time
before I destroy Chen State.

299
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,400
I don't want people to suffer, either.

300
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,160
The soldiers go to war

301
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,359
and shed blood for their states.

302
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,200
For what?

303
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,519
For three days of indulgence
after the city falls.

304
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,079
But here, I promise

305
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,599
to restrain them

306
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,719
from massacre

307
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,079
and looting.

308
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,799
I don't want people to suffer.

309
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,799
You've led troops before.

310
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,240
You know what I'm talking about.

311
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,759
But the only thing I can't allow

312
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,840
is to let him live.

313
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,359
He, Chen Xiaohua, must die.

314
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,799
I

315
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,319
understand.

316
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,279
King Wu.

317
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,599
Pick up that Imperial Seal.

318
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,799
Grand Marshal.

319
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,160
You've come around?

320
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,079
Yes,

321
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,759
I have.

322
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,720
King Wu.

323
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,680
Pick up that Imperial Seal.

324
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,799
Hail to King Wu.

325
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,720
Please pick up that Imperial Seal.

326
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,319
Chen State

327
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,319
pledges allegiance to you.

328
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,400
Whoever kills King Chen will be rewarded

329
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,480
with 10,000 taels of gold.

330
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,759
Secret guards.

331
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,200
Charge!

332
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,080
Grand Marshal. Grand Marshal!

333
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,200
Your Majesty!

334
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,240
Grand Marshal!

335
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,240
You petty clown.

336
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,440
Look carefully.

337
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,400
The true Imperial Seal
is not made of jade.

338
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,079
It's made of gold.

339
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,799
Chen Xiaohua.

340
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,759
What are you waiting for?

341
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,320
Kill King Chen to get

342
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,519
10,000 taels of gold

343
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,880
and an honorary title.

344
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,519
(I can't interfere.)

345
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,599
Your Majesty, go.

346
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,480
Brother.

347
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,279
Brother!

348
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,279
How dare you fight back

349
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,799
with your mediocre skills?

350
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,599
No.

351
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,920
You mustn't do anything.

352
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:22,519
Chen Xiaohua.

353
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,440
You shall perish!

354
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,519
No!

355
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:55,119
You think killing me will be the end?

356
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,559
Even if you kill me,

357
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,000
someone else will take over.

358
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,319
Liang.

359
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:41,799
Liang.

360
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,200
Liang.

361
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,400
Don't touch me.

362
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,400
I'm poisoned.

363
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,279
Hail to King Wu.

364
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,200
Please pick up that Imperial Seal.

365
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,119
Chen State

366
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,119
pledges allegiance to you.

367
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,799
Yes,

368
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,440
I have.

369
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,519
Are you sure this poison will work?

370
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,599
Yes, I'm sure.

371
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,640
This is the Five Lethal Poison.

372
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,799
With minimal skin contact,

373
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,400
the poison will destroy

374
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,039
the organs within a quarter.

375
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
The poisoned ones will be

376
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,400
beyond saving.

377
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,279
Thank you.

378
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,640
Lian'er.

379
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,480
I came to Chen State

380
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,440
with my father when I was 17.

381
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,119
When I first saw you,

382
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,240
you were like a lotus out of water.

383
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,799
My heart raced for you.

384
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,119
What a pity.

385
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,319
I'm a Wu.

386
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,559
I shouldn't have been so greedy.

387
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:56,559
I kept thinking

388
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,440
that I had to take over Chen State.

389
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,279
Then I would be able

390
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,920
to stay by your side.

391
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,039
But after all the scheming and plotting,

392
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,759
it turns out

393
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,000
we could have been together long ago.

394
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,240
What does it matter how others see us?

395
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,759
As long as we can

396
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,519
be together,

397
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,599
my life has a purpose.

398
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,400
Lian'er.

399
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,400
If there is a next life...

400
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,160
If there is a next life,

401
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,079
we won't go through this.

402
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,119
We will find a nice little place

403
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,440
and live a peaceful life.

404
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,079
Interesting.

405
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,599
Retreat in order to advance.

406
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,599
Good for you.
