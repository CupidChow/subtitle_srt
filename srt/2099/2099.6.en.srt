1
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:09,160
It hasn't rained for months.

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,359
Drought everywhere.

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,359
No harvest of crops.

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,599
It's impressive for you

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:13,400
to issue

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,080
- an Edict of Self-Reproach.
- Edict of Self-Reproach.

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,120
Grand Marshal harbors malicious motives.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,160
Drag him out

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,920
and execute him!

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,199
Who dares!

11
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,839
Beat him to death.

12
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:22,839
No mercy!

13
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,160
The Zhang family can

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,640
find someone to replace me.

15
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:29,120
Anyway, the Grand Marshal
is all-powerful

16
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,039
as the uncrowned king of Chen State.

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,079
I think

18
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,560
Zhang family shouldn't work
for the Chen State anymore.

19
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,079
They should have been the ruler.

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
Chen Xiaohua is unworthy the position.

21
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,960
Our humiliation of paying tribute
for centuries

22
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,159
should come to an end.

23
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,600
In three days,

24
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,640
His Majesty will pray for rain.

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
I need you to perform a ritual

26
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,960
and execute that demoness in public.

27
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,000
If by then,

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,200
he remains that useless...

29
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,880
I, Zhang Jinlong,

30
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,520
must rise up.

31
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,598
=Episode 6=
(Robot Enchantress vs. the Taoists)

32
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:41,879
Your Majesty,

33
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,000
are you alright?

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Three days have passed.

35
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm here to help you change.

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,960
We'll go to the top of Feng Mountain
to do the Rain Prayer Ceremony.

37
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,879
Long Qi,

38
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,919
how are you doing?

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,879
Your Majesty,

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,039
I'm fine.

41
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,479
Just my butt

42
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
still hurts a bit.

43
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,400
Forget it.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,800
You just stay here

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,199
and have a good rest.

46
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,360
Don't worry, Your Majesty.
He will be healed.

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,879
Let's go.

48
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:19,040
Your Majesty, where is Long Qi?

49
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,439
He is still recovering

50
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,279
at the Fengxian Hall.

51
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,760
Just go.

52
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,999
Your Grace.

53
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,520
I...

54
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,159
Skip the explanation part.

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,679
I know you care about him.

56
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,999
At the ceremony scene,

57
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:32,799
you're not required.

58
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,359
People eat when hungry.

59
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:36,559
Sleep when tired.

60
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,200
So when you have a thought,

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,520
just go and achieve it.

62
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,799
I know you're worrying about Long Qi.

63
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,239
Go take care of him.

64
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,999
I'm not, madam.

65
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:45,440
I'm just...

66
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,880
Get off.

67
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:46,640
All right.

68
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,999
Chen Xiaohua.

69
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,440
Today is very important.

70
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:27,200
Today is the first time for you

71
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,280
to face your people as the king.

72
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,520
If you forget what's on
the Edict of Self-Reproach,

73
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,159
just express it in your own way

74
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,400
and be sincere.

75
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,799
Can I really do that?

76
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,520
What if I forget everything?

77
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,640
Then wait for death.

78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,599
Rookie.

79
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:09,919
Why staring at me?

80
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,880
Besides my mom, you're the first woman

81
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,679
who helped me with my clothes.

82
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,479
None of the maids in the Palace

83
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,799
has ever helped you

84
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,919
with your clothes?

85
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,840
I don't have maids.

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,280
Only eunuchs.

87
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,359
And,

88
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,359
it's really weird

89
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,080
that I can't tell

90
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,479
my mother's appearance.

91
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,999
The former king?

92
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,599
I don't remember, either.

93
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,599
I am illegitimate.

94
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,200
What about you?

95
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,599
You ro...

96
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,039
You robots,

97
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:48,479
what about your parents?

98
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:49,880
I have no parents.

99
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,039
Impossible.

100
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,799
Grand Tutor said,

101
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,080
"our body, hair, and skin

102
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,479
are received from parents".

103
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,039
Even a little child knows this.

104
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,999
His words are not always correct.

105
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:03,400
What do you mean?

106
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,919
You are the king.

107
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,799
You should have your own judgment.

108
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,720
Don't always believe others.

109
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,400
They are here to assist you,

110
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,599
not to control you.

111
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,080
Otherwise, they will harm you.

112
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,799
Grand Tutor will not harm me.

113
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,520
He is my teacher.

114
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,840
How could a teacher harm his student?

115
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,960
In this world,

116
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,799
the only one you can trust

117
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,280
is yourself.

118
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,239
Can I trust you?

119
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,400
I'm talking about them.

120
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,559
By the way,

121
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,239
I have one last question.

122
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,359
Say it.

123
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:43,039
You can generate electricity, right?

124
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,039
Today we are praying for rain.

125
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,200
So can you...

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,919
No.

127
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,520
Drizzling?

128
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:50,799
I am a robot.

129
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,440
Robots are not omnipotent.

130
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,359
This is beyond my capabilities.

131
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:57,679
Okay.

132
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,039
It seems today

133
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,039
I can only rely on myself.

134
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:10,599
I'm telling you.

135
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,960
If I was not

136
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,960
hurting,

137
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,999
I wouldn't let you support me

138
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,200
to get drugs at Linhua Hall.

139
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:20,999
I'm telling you.

140
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:21,799
If I was not...

141
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:22,960
Your butt hurts.

142
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:24,119
So rude.

143
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:27,799
If my butt didn't hurt,

144
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,599
I certainly wouldn't let you assassin

145
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:31,800
live until today.

146
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,599
- What are you doing?
- Repeat what you just said.

147
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,200
Even one word that makes me unsatisfied,

148
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,399
I bet you'll be a dead person today.

149
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,599
I...

150
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:48,239
One word.

151
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,399
You...

152
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,720
Two words.

153
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,279
What do you want to hear?

154
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,800
Praise me for my beauty.

155
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,599
What?

156
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,200
Praise me for my beauty.

157
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,680
Is that hard to understand?

158
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,680
I...

159
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,320
I think you're beautiful.

160
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,279
Since when do you think so?

161
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,239
Since...

162
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,680
Since you wanted to

163
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,239
throw a stone at the king.

164
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,800
You've thought so since then?

165
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,040
Say something!

166
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,599
Forget it.

167
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,399
Just let me die here today.

168
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,599
Slow down.

169
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,200
Be gentle.

170
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,999
Silly Long Qi.

171
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:54,879
So stupid.

172
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,119
Can't you slow down?

173
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,599
I can't.

174
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,800
Can't at all.

175
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:04,999
Take it off.

176
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:05,999
I won't.

177
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,119
I'm telling you.

178
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,399
Even if you beat me to death.

179
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,999
Your pants have stuck to your flesh.

180
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,800
It'd a bit hurt.

181
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,080
What if just let it be?

182
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,599
No way.

183
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:19,759
The wounds must be treated.

184
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,200
At the Fengxian Hall,

185
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,359
you got beaten so many times,

186
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,960
yet you didn't make a sound.

187
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,960
Aren't you quite masculine?

188
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:31,080
I really am.

189
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,399
What are you doing?

190
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,200
Stay here.

191
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,359
I'll get some water

192
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,599
to clean your wounds.

193
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,560
Wait for me.

194
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,119
No,

195
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,680
you...

196
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,200
Get down!

197
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,040
Or you want to lie down?

198
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,440
Dowager,

199
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,999
everything is ready.

200
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:12,960
Let's go.

201
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,200
He can even understand this book?

202
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,200
(Records of King Wu)

203
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,879
Dowager,

204
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,279
it's not here.

205
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,920
Where would an absolute fool

206
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:53,999
hide the treasure?

207
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,680
Dowager,

208
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:58,440
why don't we check the inner hall?

209
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,639
Dowager,

210
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,560
nothing here.

211
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,119
Dowager.

212
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:51,040
Dowager, look.

213
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,680
That's a secret cabinet.

214
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,200
Dowager.

215
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,320
Guishan and ghost shadow.

216
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,599
Darkness under the lamp.

217
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,999
Where is this bamboo slip from?

218
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,560
Guishan.

219
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Ghost shadow.

220
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,279
This might be a critical clue

221
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,399
on the Imperial Seal.

222
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:43,320
Dowager,

223
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,560
don't we take the bamboo slip out?

224
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:48,160
It's enough to spread the text on it.

225
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,119
No need to find the Imperial Seal.

226
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,359
Today at the ceremony scene,

227
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,320
if the result of Chen Xiaohua
reading the Edict of Self-Reproach

228
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,119
cannot satisfy my brother,

229
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,920
he and that demoness

230
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:02,920
will both have to die.

231
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,800
Dowager,

232
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,599
Mr. Zhang has reminded us

233
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,080
that we cannot reveal it
before things happen.

234
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,080
Otherwise, it'll fail.

235
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,960
No need to fear.

236
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,599
They have gone to the scene.

237
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,759
Even if the Gods arrived,

238
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,359
things will still happen.

239
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,920
Why can't I understand?

240
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,519
So do they mean

241
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,119
that Grand Marshal intends to rebel?

242
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,160
I understood.

243
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,879
Grand Marshal is going to
kill the king and usurp the throne.

244
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,639
No way.

245
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,119
I must leave the Palace now

246
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,399
to protect the king.

247
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:56,399
You can stand up?

248
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,800
Why did you act so weak just now?

249
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:00,040
I...

250
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,200
What do you mean?

251
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:06,599
Stop asking questions.

252
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,960
Go find me a pair of pants.

253
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,359
Are you ordering about me?

254
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,800
I am not your maid.

255
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,080
Get down. I'll apply medicine.

256
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,999
Time is limited.

257
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:14,920
Just go find me pants.

258
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,080
I said, get down.

259
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,359
Even if you go there,

260
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,479
what can you do?

261
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,279
As you are weak now,

262
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,279
in the fights,

263
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,800
how can you protect your King Chen?

264
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,359
Didn't you hear what they said?

265
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,879
Grand Marshal is confident to win.

266
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,800
You won't change anything.

267
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,399
I still have to go.

268
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,359
A secret guard
have to protect the king to death.

269
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:35,720
Besides,

270
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:36,800
if I die,

271
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,440
won't you be happy?

272
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,800
You're an assassin to kill King Chen.

273
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,800
The development

274
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,399
is exactly what you want.

275
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,680
Didn't I tell you long before?

276
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,999
I did want to kill King Chen at first.

277
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:51,920
But he is so silly

278
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:53,399
that I have given up the idea.

279
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:54,599
It's not true.

280
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,879
You must have a secret plan.

281
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,119
You idiot.

282
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,399
Can't get through to you.

283
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:02,080
Anyway, now

284
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,279
I won't kill him.

285
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,759
I'm even going to save him.

286
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,399
Why?

287
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,599
Because he is silly.

288
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,879
But Grand Marshal is not.

289
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,279
He is far-sighted,

290
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,200
cunning, and cruel.

291
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,800
If Zhang Jinlong
becomes the king of Chen State,

292
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,239
Chen will inevitably get powerful.

293
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,879
Then it will be harmful to Wu State.

294
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,119
What's wrong?

295
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:24,999
What do you mean?

296
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,200
I...

297
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,759
I have no need to explain to you.

298
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,599
Why can't you understand anything I say?

299
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,320
You're an assassin to kill King Chen.

300
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,160
Now you changed your mind

301
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:37,800
and want to protect him.

302
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,599
This doesn't make sense.

303
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,599
It doesn't matter.

304
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,759
Though he is stupid,

305
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
not being a good king,

306
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:48,440
I can tell

307
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,999
he is a good person.

308
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:52,800
He is.

309
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,599
That's enough.

310
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:55,599
Get down.

311
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:56,999
You need medicine.

312
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,119
We are going to protect the king.

313
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,759
Speaking of King Chen,

314
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,400
he indulges in nightly revelry

315
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,440
and ignores state affairs.

316
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,680
As the saying goes,

317
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,200
King Chen doesn't attend meetings,

318
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,239
but only seeks out women.

319
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,239
Days with the queen,

320
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,880
nights with the indulgence.

321
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,519
Take care, sir.

322
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,360
King Chen doesn't attend meetings,

323
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,559
but only seeks out women.

324
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,160
Days with the queen,

325
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,720
nights with the indulgence.

326
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,799
Great saying.

327
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,920
It doesn't look like it's going to rain.

328
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,319
Act when I smash the cup.

329
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:00,319
Yes, sir.

330
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
There he is,

331
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,360
the king.

332
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,440
He's here.

333
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,279
The king is here.

334
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:08,600
Your Majesty.

335
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,120
Your Majesty.

336
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,680
The Rain Prayer Ceremony

337
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,319
begins!

338
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,479
With my modest virtue,

339
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,799
I came to the throne of the State.

340
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:37,920
A year

341
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,279
has passed since then.

342
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,239
Since I started governing,

343
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,759
the law and rules I have constructed,

344
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,519
employments, and administration

345
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,279
can barely look up to

346
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,759
that of my ancestors.

347
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,479
I have followed

348
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,759
Yoohoo?

349
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,479
What does it mean?

350
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,960
I have worked as the king to this day,

351
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,440
but not being diligent,

352
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,239
leading the State

353
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,039
not...

354
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,360
not...

355
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,559
Grand Tutor,

356
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,400
how to pronounce the character?

357
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,039
"Well."

358
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,960
"Well" from well-done.

359
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,960
Don't even know the characters?

360
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:32,279
Leading the State
not being well-governed,

361
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,519
and my people unfulfilled.

362
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:37,999
This is one of my guilts.

363
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,239
Since my

364
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,479
child...

365
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,319
Chen Xiaohua.

366
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,559
What are you doing?

367
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:44,759
I don't know this word.

368
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,200
How did I tell you?

369
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,239
Have you forgotten?

370
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,400
Do you want to die?

371
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,319
Demoness!

372
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,600
How dare you!

373
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,759
Since my childhood,

374
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:03,720
my father has passed away.

375
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,880
I was raised up

376
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,319
and educated by her

377
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:08,920
kindness.

378
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,720
What is he saying?

379
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,239
Forget it, Grand Tutor.

380
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,120
I can't read it.

381
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,519
Take it away.

382
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:14,960
Alright.

383
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,559
Such an ignorant person

384
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,079
can even become the king?

385
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,600
Go.

386
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,319
What is going on?

387
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,360
Take it.

388
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,039
Give it to me.

389
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,799
Invite the Taoists to set the altar

390
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,479
and pray to the heavens for rain.

391
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,559
It starts now.

392
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,759
May the Five Dragon Kings

393
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,759
darken the sky and blow the wind

394
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,479
to extensively spread moisture

395
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,039
and assist the Thunder God.

396
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:48,839
Rivers and lakes around the world

397
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,319
to send water towards here.

398
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:51,999
The God Scrolls let you all

399
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,799
to obey the commands.

400
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,759
Who dares to disobey

401
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,600
will be punished by Thunder Axe.

402
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,200
Fall the rain!

403
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,120
The sky has changed.

404
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,360
Seems like it's thundering.

405
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,799
My Beloved,

406
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:25,519
look!

407
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,839
I have moved the heaven.

408
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,759
I made it.

409
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,479
The demoness brings drought.
Reveal your true form.

410
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,559
Your Majesty.

411
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,319
My Beloved.

412
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,120
Let's go.

413
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,799
Why are you dragging me here?

414
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,440
Your Majesty.

415
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,960
I don't want to hurt you.

416
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:44,319
I will only say this once.

417
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,279
I'm not a demon.

418
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,400
You can deny it,

419
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,440
but you cannot escape
from our trap for demons.

420
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,200
In the royal court,

421
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,160
many have witnessed you
shooting fire through eyes

422
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
at night.

423
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,440
If not for you, the demoness,

424
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,319
Chen State wouldn't be punished

425
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,519
to suffer the great drought,

426
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,759
leaving people in misery.

427
00:24:58,999 --> 00:24:59,600
Me?

428
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,519
Eyes shooting fire at night?

429
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,400
Today,

430
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,120
we will act on behalf of heaven

431
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,039
to tackle you down.

432
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:05,799
My Beloved.

433
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,799
Be careful!

434
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,039
Bring out the weapons.

435
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:10,720
Protect her.

436
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,559
Protect her.

437
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:43,239
What is this?

438
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,640
Black dog blood.

439
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:45,640
Are you scared?

440
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:46,920
Touched by it,

441
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,559
your true form will be revealed.

442
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,079
Playing dirty.

443
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,144
My Beloved, watch out!

444
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,120
Rookie, shut up!

445
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,400
Impossible!

446
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,120
Even sticky rice doesn't work!

447
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,920
Playing dirty when you cannot beat me?

448
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,559
This really irritated me.

449
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,759
She must've lived a thousand years.

450
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:13,640
It seems

451
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,120
I must use my unique skills.

452
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,319
This stinky Taoist

453
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,720
has so many moves.

454
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,640
She is not a demon.

455
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:21,960
She is my wife.

456
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,759
The king was bewitched by the demon.

457
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,720
Do not believe him.

458
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,799
To save the Chen State,

459
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,239
capture this demoness.

460
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,039
Yes.

461
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:29,559
Stop!

462
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,079
Warning: Low battery.

463
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,759
Warning: Low battery.

464
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,920
If you want to kill her,

465
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
kill me first.

466
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,559
Your Majesty.

467
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,400
My Beloved.

468
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Stop it.

469
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,120
Protect the king's safety.

470
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,360
What's going on?

471
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,880
What's going on here?

472
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,999
Honey.

473
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,559
Honey.

474
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,960
Your mission

475
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,759
is to defeat Wu State

476
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,239
and make Chen State prosperous

477
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,440
and peaceful.

478
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,880
I don't want to be the king.

479
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,360
I don't want to be controlled.

480
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,999
Anyway, nobody cares how I feel.

481
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,960
I care.

482
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,559
Chen has had no rain for ages.

483
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,440
Refugees are numerous.

484
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,360
And foreign invaders threaten.

485
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,319
I'll commence the Rain Prayer Ceremony.

486
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,839
You must read the Edict of Self-Reproach

487
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:44,920
to quell public anger

488
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
and reassure them.

489
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,920
Me?

490
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,239
He can.

491
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:54,120
Today is the first time for you

492
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,440
to face your people as the king.

493
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,799
If you forget what's on
the Edict of Self-Reproach,

494
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:00,600
just express it in your own way

495
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,440
and be sincere.

496
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,759
The Heaven,

497
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,160
please just punish me

498
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,880
if you're furious.

499
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,039
If there really are

500
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,479
Gods in the Heaven,

501
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:16,799
if Dragon Kings exist,

502
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
may you just take a look.

503
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Look at the people of my state.

504
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,559
The Chen State

505
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,039
has long undergone drought.

506
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,960
There's been no harvest.

507
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,600
Price of cucumbers goes up.

508
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,200
So do the cabbages.

509
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,960
You don't give us water,

510
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,559
but only food.

511
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,200
Are you trying to choke us to death?

512
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:38,680
How can my people live?

513
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,039
The king's words are right.

514
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,079
I understand all his words.

515
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,640
If it was someone

516
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,559
making some mistake

517
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:49,920
and offending the Gods,

518
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:50,960
I...

519
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,799
I will bear it alone.

520
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,839
I can do nothing.

521
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,239
I'm a useless person.

522
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,839
I can't promise anyone anything.

523
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,960
I can't make anyone happy.

524
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,799
But

525
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,720
it has nothing to do with my wife.

526
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,360
I love her.

527
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,519
I love my state.

528
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,239
This has nothing to do with her.

529
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,360
If

530
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,039
it can bring my people

531
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,239
food

532
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,239
and satiety,

533
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,999
I will take

534
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,400
all these sins

535
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,920
alone.

536
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,039
I'll kowtow to you.

537
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:43,600
This is all for us!

538
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,799
His Majesty is a kind king
thinking of people.

539
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,759
He even scolds himself.

540
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,039
Honey.

541
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:14,400
Honey.

542
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:15,600
Honey.

543
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:16,839
Honey.

544
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:18,960
I promise you.

545
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,039
As long as you wake up,

546
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,960
I'll listen to whatever you say.

547
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,440
Honey.

548
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:24,799
Honey.

549
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:29,799
The wind is blowing.

550
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,680
Look.

551
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,600
The wind is blowing.

552
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,160
It's going to rain.

553
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,720
It's raining.

554
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,239
It's raining.

555
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,319
Honey.

556
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,039
It's raining.

557
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,839
The Chen State is saved.

558
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,239
It's raining.

559
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,839
It's raining.

560
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,279
It's raining.

561
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,519
It's raining.

562
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,400
That's great.

563
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,680
It's raining.

564
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:10,039
Charging completed.

565
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:11,920
Honey.

566
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,079
Honey.

567
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,799
Honey,

568
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,559
It's raining.

569
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:45,680
Long live our king.

570
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,160
The revival of the Chen State is near.

571
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:55,160
Long live our king.

572
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,999
Hail to the King Wu.

573
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,440
The Chen State is saved.
