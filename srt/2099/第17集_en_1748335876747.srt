00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,700
com

00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,040
Xiao視ah

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,600
What's wrong with you today?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I was chosen.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's a good thing.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When will you leave?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Today.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Today?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Today.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Taozi!

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Look at this.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Taozi!

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Taozi!

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I want this.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, wait a minute.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I want a salt-pickled cherry-flavored cake.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Sorry, Miss.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This cake is my limited edition.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I've sold it out.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why don't you take a look at other things?

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No need. Thank you.

23
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Your Majesty,

24
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
the Wu State has crossed the border.

25
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
After the Khenzhou Line,

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
the Wu Army was in Khenzhou to kill and rob.

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Although the enemy was just a young man,

28
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the young man was a strong soldier.

29
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But he was deeply honored by His Majesty.

30
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The young man's soldiers couldn't resist.

31
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The army was determined to stop the Wu State.

32
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There's one more thing.

33
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Wu De fought for the revenge of his brother.

34
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He fought for the country.

35
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The army was in a state of war.

36
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The Wu State fought for the country.

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The Chu State fought for the country.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They were in a good hand.

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No matter it's Wu De,

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
who fought for the revenge of his brother,

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
or the army of the Qin State,

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
but as long as it's in the army,

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll do my best.

44
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
From now on,

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
no matter how late the army is,

46
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll hand it over to Dr. Wang.

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Now that the war is over,

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll hand over the military power.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Xifan.

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Xifan.

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Your Majesty, you're back.

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Your Majesty,

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm still the same.

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I just didn't have enough time to sleep.

57
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Where's Cai Ye and Long Qi?

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They were too tired to go back to rest.

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Your Majesty, you should be careful.

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now that the enemy is in front of you,

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I need you.

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll take care of him.

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You haven't had a rest for a long time.

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Thank you.

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Your Majesty.

66
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Hurry up.

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Only working two days to work.

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How is the character?

69
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Lei,

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
make your signature blank.

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Gu Omni mom.

72
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Get your wrist out.

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,300
More細

74
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,000
more salt.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
As long as you get yours,

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
This is my first time to make this.

77
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

78
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Usually, in your eyes,

79
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,400
I'm definitely not good at making money.

80
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
But as your husband,

81
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
I'm at least

82
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,600
bringing you happiness.

83
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,400
I remember you told me

84
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,000
that the one you liked the most

85
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,600
was the smell of tomato.

86
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,800
And now, this tomato

87
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,000
is no longer in this world.

88
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
But don't worry.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,200
Because Chen Xiaohua is very capable.

90
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,800
I don't believe in this shoes.

91
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,000
I must plant that tomato.

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
My wife, come here.

93
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,600
Look at this.

94
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
It's a seed from a plant.

95
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Although the plant

96
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,800
said that it wouldn't dare to guarantee

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,400
that it will be dead in the future,

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,200
I must try it.

99
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,000
Right?

100
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
Moreover,

101
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,000
it will be your birthday in seven months.

102
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,400
If there is no accident,

103
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
this will be your birthday.

104
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I'll raise the money back to the plan.

105
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,000
The second time.

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The last time I made this,

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,000
it's been 15 days.

108
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,000
But our seed

109
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,600
is not in the seed.

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,600
Why did my shoes

111
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,600
go to the internet?

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I didn't soak.

113
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,600
I'm so stupid.

114
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,200
No wonder.

115
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
I didn't even soak.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,800
So this time,

117
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll try to soak.

118
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,200
Don't be so careful like last time.

119
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
If you succeed,

120
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
you'll see this time.

121
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,200
Come on.

122
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Why did I soak some water?

123
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,600
Why did I go to the market?

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
Your Majesty.

125
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Imperial Physician Wang is in the Imperial Library.

126
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,200
Your Majesty.

127
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
The news is urgent.

128
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,200
The young master is in the palace.

129
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,000
The young master is in the palace?

130
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes.

131
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,400
I thought the young master could last for 10 days and a half.

132
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
The horse of Prince Qi

133
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
can still make it.

134
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,800
What about now?

135
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,600
Now, it's not normal.

136
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
How long does the horse of Prince Qi

137
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,400
need to go to the capital?

138
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,200
They won't come.

139
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
Han Shaokang lost the three pigs too quickly.

140
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,000
The horse of Prince Qi is slower than the bull cart.

141
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,200
They are all in the small village.

142
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,200
They must be in the army.

143
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,400
They are all making plans for the future.

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I understand.

145
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Your Majesty.

146
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,600
I haven't spread the news yet.

147
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
You should get ready.

148
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,400
As long as we get out of the palace at night,

149
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
as long as there is a prince,

150
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
I will have hope.

151
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,800
I will also face the king of Xie.

152
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,600
Your Majesty.

153
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,000
The horse of Prince Qi will stop at the door.

154
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
Let's get out of the palace at night.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's late.

156
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,200
Think about it tomorrow.

157
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,000
Your Majesty.

158
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,000
Your Majesty.

159
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,400
What's wrong?

160
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Are you feeling unwell?

161
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,200
Your Majesty.

162
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,800
What?

163
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,800
Nothing.

164
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,600
Your Majesty.

165
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
What happened?

166
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,000
Did the doctor say anything to you?

167
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,400
Nothing.

168
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,800
The doctor is afraid that I can't rest.

169
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
It's a long time since the accident.

170
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,200
Ziyi.

171
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,800
How old are you this year?

172
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,000
How old am I?

173
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,400
Longqin.

174
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,400
It's easy to have a baby.

175
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,000
But it may take a lifetime to have an old baby.

176
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,400
I don't understand.

177
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
I don't understand.

178
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
I don't understand.

179
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Well.

180
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
It's better to be honest.

181
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,000
You two should get married today.

182
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,600
I...

183
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,400
No.

184
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,000
Ziyi.

185
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,200
What do you think?

186
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,600
The most difficult part of the crime is

187
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,200
when I was talking about your love.

188
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,200
I asked about Cai Ying.

189
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,000
I...

190
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,200
Don't you always think I'm stupid?

191
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,200
You've always been my subordinate.

192
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,400
I...

193
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,200
I like you.

194
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
I like you.

195
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
I like you.

196
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,800
I like you so much.

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,600
Okay.

198
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,000
Now the army is coming.

199
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
We're all in the same boat.

200
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,800
If you don't mind,

201
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,400
I'll be the man of the marriage.

202
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
Nice to meet you.

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Go on a date.

204
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,900
Aren't you getting off topic today?

205
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,600
No.

206
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,600
Wait.

207
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm not ready yet.

208
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,000
I will marry a wife

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,400
from which she is quite responsible and 걸 reptile.

210
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
We'll fight until she's ready.

211
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,800
Ziyi.

212
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,400
Tell me.

213
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,200
Any question?

214
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,200
I'm not successful at steel making.

215
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,600
I have slipped

216
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,680
into aAAAAAAAA

217
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,000
in a crisis.

218
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,800
The best dowry for a woman

219
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
is a warm heart.

220
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
A man's best effort

221
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,600
is to be with him forever.

222
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,200
The most precious thing in the world

223
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,600
is to be free.

224
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,600
The most precious thing in the world

225
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
is to be with him forever.

226
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,800
The moon is high,

227
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,800
and I know you're not a good girl.

228
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,000
Are you crazy?

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,800
Why are you hitting me?

230
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,200
Who are you?

231
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
What are you doing?

232
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm the new royal doctor of the palace,

233
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
I'm protecting His Majesty.

234
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,600
A palace maid?

235
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Why are you a palace maid?

236
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The palace maid.

237
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,800
What do you want to hear?

238
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I praise you.

239
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,000
What?

240
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
I think you're beautiful.

241
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,200
Who drove me to the toilet?

242
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,400
You slept with a pig.

243
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm afraid you'll die.

244
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,200
I like to be impulsive.

245
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
I'm a new royal doctor.

246
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,200
I like you so much.

247
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,000
Today is the first time I see someone's marriage.

248
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
It turns out that

249
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,200
marriage is such a beautiful thing.

250
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
I never thought

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,800
that one day

252
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I will get married.

253
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,200
Me too.

254
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,400
There was Teşekkürated for her.

255
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,600
However,

256
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,400
she said she'd come a few days back and set all those tricks,

257
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
so I sideways was not a good choice.

258
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,600
You knew about this.

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,400
Her Majesty said

260
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,800
that if I saw my daughter

261
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
alive,

262
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,200
then someone would be more important.

263
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Kinda annoying.

264
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,760
What's the matter?

265
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,360
What should I do?

266
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,320
Hello?

267
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,160
Madam.

268
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
If you can see it,

269
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
you will be happy

270
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
with me.

271
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
Right?

272
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Tomorrow

273
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
is the last moment of my life.

274
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
What should I do?

275
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
But if you are here,

276
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I know

277
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
you will let me face it.

278
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Right?

279
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Well,

280
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
you can invite Second Princess

281
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
and I will talk to them.

282
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Okay.

283
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
Your Majesty,

284
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,360
I will escort you out of the city now.

285
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Grandfather,

286
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
you get up first.

287
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
Your Majesty,

288
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
I will not get up if you don't leave.

289
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
I didn't mean today.

290
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
I meant today.

291
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
Your Majesty,

292
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
I am the first one to get over it.

293
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
The capital is not safe.

294
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
The army of the Wu army is not enough to get out of the capital.

295
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,360
It's the best time to get out of the city.

296
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Grandfather,

297
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
get up first.

298
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Your Majesty,

299
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,360
just listen to me this time.

300
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,360
Grandfather,

301
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
I will not let you go.

302
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
I am the king of the country.

303
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
I can't even

304
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
command my beloved minister to get up.

305
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Then,

306
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
can the country of the city not be forgotten?

307
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
You...

308
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Get up.

309
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Get up.

310
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,360
Okay,

311
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
I know.

312
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
Listen to me.

313
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Okay.

314
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
Then,

315
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
let's make it a little easier.

316
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
As I said.

317
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Call the soldiers.

318
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
We will have a meeting

319
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
after half an hour.

320
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Yes.

321
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
You are all here.

322
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Long Qi,

323
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
Cai Yi,

324
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
you two are very good at martial arts.

325
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
I will send three concubines

326
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
to the capital

327
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
and leave them to you.

328
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Just leave now.

329
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Your Majesty, where are you?

330
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Your Majesty, where are you?

331
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
I will follow you

332
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
as soon as I complete the task

333
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
of the minister and Grandfather.

334
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,360
After I discuss with Your Majesty,

335
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
I will chase you as soon as possible.

336
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
But Your Majesty,

337
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
you are not interested in martial arts.

338
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
No need.

339
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Who needs to be escorted

340
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
with our sister's skills?

341
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
I stay here.

342
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
Only one person can be escorted.

343
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Long Qi,

344
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
I have three concubines here.

345
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
I won't be worried about them.

346
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Your Majesty,

347
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
you can leave now.

348
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
I will escort the three concubines

349
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
to the capital with Long Qi.

350
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Okay.

351
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
Let's go.

352
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
Your Majesty,

353
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
why don't you say anything

354
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
even in the farewell?

355
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
What else can I say?

356
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Report!

357
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
Your Majesty,

358
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,360
the imperial guards are coming.

359
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
The army is coming to the capital

360
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
to fight against the martial arts.

361
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
They are coming to the capital

362
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
to fight against the imperial guards.

363
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
Grandfather,

364
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
you are also here to fight against the imperial guards.

365
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
You are here to fight against the imperial guards.

366
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,360
You are here to fight against the imperial guards.

367
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
You are also here to fight against the imperial guards.

368
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Let's go.

369
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Your Majesty,

370
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
I have been living and growing up.

371
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
I have been living and growing up.

372
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,360
I have been living and growing up.

373
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
I have no reason to do that.

374
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Inform the imperial guards to go down

375
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
and prepare to fight against the imperial guards.

376
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

377
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
This time,

378
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
the sword is really coming.

379
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Let's fight against the imperial guards.

380
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Your Majesty.

381
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
Your Majesty.

382
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Master,

383
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Master,

384
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
you really killed my father.

385
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
Yes.

386
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
Dr. Wang is my master.

387
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
This is the gift

388
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,360
from the teacher.

389
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,360
Okay,

390
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
please go.

391
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Give it to me.

392
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
This is mine.

393
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
Don't take my hand.

394
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Let go.

395
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Let go.

396
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Brother,

397
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
don't take it away.

398
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Don't take it away.

399
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Let go.

400
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Don't take it away.

401
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
Let go of me.

402
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Let go.

403
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,720
I'll take all the good things.

404
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,120
Run away.

405
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

406
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

407
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,560
Run away.

408
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Run away.

409
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Run away.

410
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Run.

411
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
Run.

Take them.

423
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,080
My Lord,

424
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,480
take a rest.

425
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,760
Don't drop the weapons.

426
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,560
Take off the masks.

427
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Go.

428
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,160

Where's Wu Jun?

Help us, please help us!

461
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,740
How could this matter happen to me?

462
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:40,420
Hurry up! Let's go!

463
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,440
No crown prince now?

464
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,440
The war won't end

465
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
Now is the only chance

466
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,080
You've all played out well

467
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,920
Yes, father

468
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,320
Don't let it all down

469
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,320
It's all right.

470
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
Master.

471
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Let them go.

472
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

473
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
Since you can live well,

474
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
why did you die?

475
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
Your Majesty.

476
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
Later,

477
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
you and I

478
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
were left alone.

479
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Zhao Wendong.

480
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Xike Siying.

481
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Can you teach me?

482
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
I'm...

483
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Help me.

484
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
I'll go in.

485
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,320
Mr. Wu won't allow you to do this again.

486
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
I can't take it anymore.

487
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,320
I can't let him face this.

488
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,320
He doesn't know it's his last chance.

489
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Calm down, Jiang Tao.

490
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
Even if you go in now,

491
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
what can you change?

492
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,320
You become a Martial Goddess.

493
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,320
You help him to be the King of the Five Kingdoms.

494
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,320
His mind will be in a state of chaos.

495
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,320
He will die immediately.

496
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Wake up.

497
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,320
You can't save him.

498
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,320
He will lose everything you have.

499
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Don't forget.

500
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,320
If your boss says so,

501
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,320
if he really leaves the company,

502
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,320
what will you do in the future?

503
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,320
Even if he dies,

504
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,320
I hope I can be with him.

505
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
What's the point?

506
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,320
He will still die.

507
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,320
But you still have a future.

508
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Maybe we'll be wrong at the beginning.

509
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
Maybe he'll go to the Yao Village

510
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
and live the life he wants.

511
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
An Ping is happy.

512
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,320
He's the most suitable for his life.

513
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,320
There's only one person who can live.

514
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,320
Let me see him for the last time.

515
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
I'll go to the Yao Village.

516
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
