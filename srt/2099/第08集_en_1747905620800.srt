1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ok.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,200
we can drink it ourselves.

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,600
Understand?

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,080
Yes.

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,520
I think

17
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,720
His Majesty was scared by the rain a few days ago.

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Today, this is

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
just a child's temper.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,760
Yes, Eunuch Li.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
Everyone in the imperial court knows

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:10,700
that your

23
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,180
palace is full of

24
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,180
evil spirits.

25
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,900
Tell me what double favor is.

26
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,980
Greetings, Your Majesty.

27
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,740
Greetings, Madam Xiao.

28
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,100
Your Majesty, please have a look.

29
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,940
This is just part of the accounts this year.

30
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,340
Is there a need to check this treasury?

31
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,820
Don't say anything if you don't understand.

32
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,540
I have been

33
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,700
doing business

34
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
and collecting money since I took over the treasury.

35
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,020
I'm afraid that the maids

36
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,100
are wrong.

37
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,220
But in the end, it's not a burden.

38
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,740
Every account is clear.

39
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,980
These are the accounts

40
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,380
from the previous dynasty to this dynasty.

41
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,900
The treasury of the Ministry of Revenue

42
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,740
and the treasury of me

43
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,700
are all here.

44
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,940
Your Majesty, don't worry.

45
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,140
Take a look.

46
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,140
These accounts

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,620
can't be checked

48
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,100
within ten days or half a month.

49
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,620
But don't tire yourself

50
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,580
for this.

51
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,420
I'll go and prepare some tea for you.

52
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,860
Okay.

53
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,660
What are we investigating?

54
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,140
I just want to know

55
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,020
how the treasury

56
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,180
has no money

57
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,340
in such a big country.

58
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,940
The army is here.

59
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,260
The city and the country need money.

60
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,420
Money is not the problem.

61
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,820
The problem is

62
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,300
why there is no money.

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,100
But

64
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,500
the SCHK taxes

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,460
and cutting costs

66
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,100
are over 8,000 gold in total.

67
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,740
That's the last step

68
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,700
of the treasury.

69
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,900
About theWhen you Veyn,

70
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,220
do you want to ask them

71
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,180
to prepare some food

72
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,340
not to a small amount?

73
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,740
Should I send it here?

74
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,100
You're so clean and clean.

75
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,420
You don't have any problems.

76
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,020
I told you.

77
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,940
Every account is clear.

78
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,140
It's clear.

79
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,260
But...

80
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,660
If there's no problem,

81
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,740
that's the biggest problem.

82
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,140
I have no idea, Your Majesty.

83
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,820
Do you want money or your life?

84
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,460
If you really want to embezzle,

85
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,820
there's no point in checking the accounts.

86
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,740
You can just check the accounts.

87
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,060
You're just accountants.

88
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,540
You can do it without money.

89
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,620
If you don't have money,

90
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,340
you can just force it.

91
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,060
Then you'll get the money.

92
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,700
Tell me.

93
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,580
How did you spend the 8 million taels of money?

94
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,060
I really don't know.

95
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,020
You really don't know?

96
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,580
Then tell me.

97
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,380
Who should I ask?

98
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,100
Well...

99
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,060
Chief...

100
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,180
Chief is in the Palace of Vastness.

101
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,860
He should be asking Minister Zhang Chao.

102
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,420
Zhang Chao?

103
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,100
Where is he?

104
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,980
He's supposed to be at Jingyang Gate

105
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,100
and be on duty.

106
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,740
Let's go.

107
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,100
Minister Zhang Chao was a good carpenter.

108
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,300
He joined the Ministry of Works and worked for the Da Sima.

109
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
He's a military officer.

110
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,100
He's from Da Sima again.

111
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,980
You want to investigate it?

112
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,740
I'm sure.

113
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,980
Okay, I'll accompany you.

114
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,620
I've finished the most important ones.

115
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,060
I'm not afraid of anything.

116
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,860
Everyone said on the memorial that

117
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,260
I'm a wise man and a wise man.

118
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,580
I'll show them

119
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,060
what a real wise man is.

120
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,060
What a bad start!

121
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,980
Greetings, Your Majesty.

122
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,820
Zhang Chao.

123
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,820
Yes.

124
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,860
How much did you spend on the palace?

125
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,860
The materials and the manpower

126
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,180
are 2 million taels in total.

127
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,380
How much exactly?

128
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,260
Your Majesty, you're here to investigate the treasury, right?

129
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,140
During the palace's renovation,

130
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,860
all the accounts are clearly recorded.

131
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,660
But I only manage the construction of the Ministry of Works.

132
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,380
As for the expenses,

133
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,180
the payment and the records,

134
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,300
I need to ask the Ministry of Revenue.

135
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Ministry of Revenue?

136
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,500
Okay.

137
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:17,960
Go.

138
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,420
That's the memorialtor

139
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,980
the accounts of the past.

140
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,500
The headquarters of the Ministry of Revenue

141
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,340
and the underwear of me are all here.

142
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,860
Your Majesty, don't worry.

143
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,100
Just look at them.

144
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,060
These accounts

145
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,460
can't be checked

146
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,220
within 10 days or half a month.

147
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,380
But you must not

148
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,540
ruin your health.

149
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,740
I'll go and prepare some tea for you.

150
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,580
Come back!

151
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,940
His Majesty's Residence

152
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,220
There's nothing wrong with the accounts,

153
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,100
that's the biggest problem.

154
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,140
I have no idea, Your Majesty.

155
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,140
Sure enough, you have no idea.

156
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,140
Please spare me, Your Majesty.

157
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,100
I have no idea, Your Majesty.

158
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,340
Let me ask you something.

159
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,340
The annual salary and the taxes

160
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,980
are exactly 8 million taels.

161
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,580
Yes.

162
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,060
Is the head of the Ministry of Works?

163
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,940
Yes.

164
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,500
Is the Ministry of Works outside Jingyang Gate?

165
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,580
Yes.

166
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,860
Let's go to the Ministry of Works.

167
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,900
Your Majesty,

168
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,020
Minister Zhang Chao of the Ministry of Works...

169
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,220
Minister Zhang Chao of the Ministry of Works

170
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,060
used to work for the Grand Minister of War.

171
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,260
He was a soldier in the Southern Front

172
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,900
and was a silver-mining and wood-working man.

173
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,500
He was promoted by the late king

174
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,460
and was appointed to the Ministry of Works.

175
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:11,940
Your Majesty,

176
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,260
how do you know everything?

177
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,100
Of course.

178
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,180
Your king is a son of the Heavenly King.

179
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,660
Right?

180
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,540
I think so, too.

181
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,980
Are you sure?

182
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
Yes, I'm sure.

183
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,140
And we have to catch him

184
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,660
if we can.

185
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,460
Greetings, Your Majesty.

186
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,180
Zhang Chao,

187
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,300
you've built more than 2 million taels of land, right?

188
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,540
Yes.

189
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,940
How much exactly?

190
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,700
You have to ask the Ministry of Works, right?

191
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,780
Your Majesty, I...

192
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,540
Just answer yes or no.

193
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,300
Yes.

194
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,540
Then you arranged the assassin, too?

195
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,100
I asked you if you arranged the assassin.

196
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,460
Your Majesty, I'm innocent.

197
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,020
I have no idea about the assassin.

198
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,940
I'll come back and settle the score with you.

199
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,740
Let's go to the Ministry of Works.

200
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,620
This...

201
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,060
Is this a joke?

202
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,500
Go!

203
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,980
Let's go.

204
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,620
Do you understand?

205
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,060
There's an assassin

206
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,580
lurking in the corner.

207
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,780
He's holding a dagger alone.

208
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
Now, we'll wait for you here.

209
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,820
Go and bring him back.

210
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,580
Yes.

211
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,460
He really has an assassin?

212
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,980
Your Majesty, don't do that.

213
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,820
He's beating us.

214
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,740
Your Majesty, how did you predict that?

215
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,220
You were right about every move.

216
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,860
I told you.

217
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,900
Your King is a man of the heaven.

218
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,500
Tell me.

219
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,980
Who sent you here?

220
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,940
If you tell me the truth,

221
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,580
my King will spare your life.

222
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,700
If you don't tell me,

223
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,100
I'll make you talk again.

224
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,380
Either tell me or die.

225
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,340
Come on.

226
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,820
Give me a good one.

227
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:38,940
Go.

228
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,220
I can stab you with seven knives.

229
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,100
You're still alive.

230
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,380
Are you sure you won't tell me?

231
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,060
I'll tell you.

232
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,700
Please spare my life.

233
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,500
Li Xuan sent me here.

234
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,100
Li Xuan?

235
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,980
I'm the Minister of Works.

236
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:02,980
Li Xuan?

237
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,060
It's him.

238
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,740
It's him.

239
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,380
He's the one who sent me here.

240
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,740
You're telling the truth.

241
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,620
That's right.

242
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,620
Where is he now?

243
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,300
He's not in the palace.

244
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,900
He's in the side yard.

245
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,620
It hurts.

246
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,700
Please spare my life.

247
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,980
I've told you everything.

248
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,380
Go.

249
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:33,860
Your Majesty.

250
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,020
Your Majesty.

251
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,660
Your Majesty.

252
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,300
No.

253
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,980
Your Majesty, please spare my life.

254
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,580
Your Majesty.

255
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,100
Please.

256
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,580
It's really you.

257
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,580
No wonder you didn't let me investigate the meeting.

258
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,740
You're afraid you'll find out yourself.

259
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,460
As the Minister of Works,

260
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,660
you're a traitor.

261
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,980
Who gave you the guts?

262
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,860
Your Majesty.

263
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,780
Your Majesty.

264
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,740
The tax this year

265
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,500
and the taxes of the various prefectures

266
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,900
are all my own ideas.

267
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,620
But someone in my department said

268
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,300
there would be no problem

269
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,300
with the money, the empty account,

270
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,860
the empty account.

271
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
No one will investigate it.

272
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,380
No one will dare to investigate it.

273
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,500
So I...

274
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,300
So

275
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,100
this is the real account book, right?

276
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,380
I...

277
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,500
Who is it?

278
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:29,980
Speak!

279
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,380
Zhang Qiao.

280
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,460
Zhang Qiao.

281
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,420
Zhang Qiao.

282
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,260
Minister of Works?

283
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,100
Yes.

284
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,540
Should we arrest him now?

285
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,100
Continue.

286
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,660
Yes.

287
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,980
Your Majesty.

288
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,060
Here's the thing.

289
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,860
Wang Ting has a big repair today.

290
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,900
The Ministry of Revenue

291
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,420
has a 2 million-yuan discount.

292
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,900
The Ministry of Works

293
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,380
has actually released 1.2 million taels.

294
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,780
The difference is 8...

295
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,740
8 million taels.

296
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,140
When Chenzhou was in crisis,

297
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,980
the difference was 1.2 million taels.

298
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,060
8 million taels?

299
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,180
How much did you steal?

300
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,260
Half of it.

301
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,860
You're more than me.

302
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,020
Tell me how you split it.

303
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,300
I took two times.

304
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,540
Zhang Qiao took 30%.

305
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,460
The remaining 50%

306
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,460
Zhang Qiao said he wanted to

307
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,580
take care of the nobles behind him.

308
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,860
He said we can't afford to bother the nobles.

309
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,940
Did you send the killer

310
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,260
just now?

311
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,260
Killer?

312
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,780
What killer?

313
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
I don't know.

314
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,620
They just let me steal things.

315
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
Your Majesty, I don't know what killer.

316
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,300
I'm 19 years old.

317
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,180
But I don't know what killer.

318
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,060
I deserve to die.

319
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,260
I deserve to die.

320
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,140
Of course, Zhang Qiao deserves to die.

321
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,780
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

322
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,780
Tell me.

323
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,620
Is the nobleman behind this

324
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,540
Da Sima or Grand Tutor Wang?

325
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,580
He...

326
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,460
Tell me.

327
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,900
He...

328
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,580
He is...

329
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,180
He...

330
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,220
He is...

331
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,740
Don't move.

332
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,420
Wake up.

333
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,060
Wake up.

334
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,740
Stop looking.

335
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,700
He must be dead if he was shot in the heart.

336
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,860
How is it?

337
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,780
We didn't catch him.

338
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,580
He ran away.

339
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,460
I'll order the whole city to search.

340
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,860
It's broken.

341
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,380
The clue is broken again.

342
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,860
Which part of the puzzle is the problem?

343
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,700
Eunuch Li of the State Treasury.

344
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,820
Zhang Chao of the Ministry of Works.

345
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,020
Li Xuan of the Ministry of Revenue.

346
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,940
Ministry of Rites.

347
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,660
Ministry of War.

348
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,940
No.

349
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Which part of the puzzle is the problem?

350
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,100
Your Majesty.

351
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,700
Do these people

352
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,180
have no law?

353
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,860
Do they take me as their king?

354
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,100
They kill me

355
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,500
in broad daylight.

356
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,700
How about

357
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,900
interrogating the assassin?

358
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,100
Maybe there is a connection between the two assassins.

359
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,940
It's urgent.

360
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,620
Which part of the puzzle is the problem?

361
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,860
The dead is Minister of Revenue.

362
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,900
Go to the Ministry of Revenue to catch some men.

363
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,620
Maybe there will be some clues.

364
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,660
The key is

365
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,780
Zhang Chao of the Ministry of Works.

366
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,860
He knows everything.

367
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,500
Then...

368
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,540
Your Majesty.

369
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,060
What should we do?

370
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,220
No.

371
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,380
Zhang Chao

372
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,580
dares to let us come to the Ministry of Revenue.

373
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,700
He must have two hands ready.

374
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,700
You are right.

375
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,860
Even if you go to ask Zhang Chao now,

376
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,820
he can say he is innocent.

377
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,700
Let us come to the Ministry of Revenue

378
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,460
to kill him.

379
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,700
It means...

380
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,380
It means I'm right.

381
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,940
Yes.

382
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,220
If we kill him,

383
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,900
we will have no evidence.

384
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,580
Right.

385
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,780
I have to be faster.

386
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,540
I have to be faster.

387
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,860
I have to be faster.

388
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,500
Your Majesty.

389
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,660
You will die soon.

390
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,820
You will die soon.

391
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,260
I'm not tasty.

392
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,860
No not delicious.

393
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,940
He is technically suitable for Jin주'stype.

394
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,140
It doesn't matter.

395
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,660
But they might...

396
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,380
I need some hill,

397
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,100
then come back home.

398
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,900
The maids were wrong, but they were still...

399
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Old man.

400
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,900
You bastard!

401
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
You bastard!

402
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Let's go!

403
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
What are we doing here?

404
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
Greetings, Your Highness.

405
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Zheng Cheng!

406
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Let's go!

407
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
Go!

408
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
There's a thorn down there.

409
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
I'll run first. You guys follow me.

410
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
How did you guess it?

411
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
Can you not ask the same question every time?

412
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Long Qing.

413
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,900
There will be an assassin in that place.

414
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
He's much stronger than the one who took the dagger.

415
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
You, go and set up the ambush.

416
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
I think it's time for him to show up.

417
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Father, you...

418
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,900
I...

419
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,900
shouldn't ask?

420
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
Hmm.

421
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
There really is an assassin?

422
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
Long Qing, you'll be the assassin.

423
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
Let's go in.

424
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
Let's meet Lord Li.

425
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
I'm here.

426
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

427
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
I'm Li Xuan, the Minister of Revenue.

428
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,900
I'm here to see you, Madam Xiao.

429
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Yuan Hen.

430
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
You knew I was coming?

431
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,900
I'll ask you one question today.

432
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,900
Who are you and Zhang Chao's

433
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
concubines behind you?

434
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,900
Are you the Grand Minister of War?

435
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
Or Grand Minister Wang?

436
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
No.

437
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
He's poisoned.

438
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,900
He's dead.

439
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
This is different from the last doctor.

440
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
What last doctor?

441
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
He's dead?

442
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
Tell me.

443
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
Who are the people behind you?

444
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
Father, I just got tested.

445
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
He's a mute.

446
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Mute?

447
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,900
If that's the case,

448
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,900
then let's do it again.

449
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
Father!

450
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
The old slave appears.

451
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
He's always been a pervert.

452
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
This hurts more than last time.

453
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
Your chest hurts?

454
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
It's okay.

455
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
Did you think of any new clues?

456
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,900
That's weird. Why would I say yes?

457
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Wife.

458
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
You know I'll be reborn?

459
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,900
It's okay.

460
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Okay.

461
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,900
You don't have any questions?

462
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
When you teach me with that tone,

463
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
I'd better not talk.

464
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
Because it might hurt him.

465
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,900
You're so mean.

466
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,900
It's you.

467
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,900
Long Qing.

468
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Call the imperial guards.

469
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
Tell them to split up.

470
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
One side, go outside Jingyang Gate.

471
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,900
Go to the palace and get Zhang Chao back.

472
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,900
The other side, go to the house and get Li Xuan back.

473
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,900
It doesn't matter if he's alive or not.

474
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,900
What matters is that as long as you have something with words,

475
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,900
including a note, bring it back.

476
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,900
Yes.

477
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,900
I'm not done yet. Come here.

478
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
Really?

479
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,900
You're not lying.

480
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
Go.

481
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
Aren't you going to check the accounts of the treasury?

482
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Why do you suddenly want to arrest two ministers?

483
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
It's unreasonable.

484
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,900
If I don't check the accounts now, I'll arrest them directly.

485
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,900
I think it's interesting.

486
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
I'll go to the Imperial Mountain

487
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
and prepare some food for you.

488
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Come back.

489
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900
I'm not hungry.

490
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
You don't have to prepare food.

491
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,900
How about this, Eunuch Li?

492
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,900
You come with me and wait for them to come back.

493
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
By the order of His Majesty,

494
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,900
I'll send the Minister of Revenue, Li Xuan, to the palace to ask questions.

495
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,900
Who was I?

496
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,900
Commander Zhou.

497
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
You scared me.

498
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
His Majesty is now calling me to the palace.

499
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
What does that mean?

500
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
Did His Majesty really find out?

501
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,900
And what does the noble man mean?

502
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,900
The noble man means that you should leave now.

503
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,900
He can still protect you.

504
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,900
The carriage is ready outside the city.

505
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,900
The guard at the gate is also ready.

506
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
Okay, okay, okay.

507
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,900
I'll go now.

508
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Go.

509
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,900
You still don't want to confess?

510
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Fine.

511
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,900
No hurry.

512
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Your Majesty,

513
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,900
I've taken back the letter.

514
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
As you expected,

515
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,900
there are also bad people in the Imperial Forest.

516
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
I'll go now.

517
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Where is Li Xuan?

518
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,900
He's dead.

519
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,900
Dead again?

520
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
I'm late.

521
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

522
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Eunuch Li,

523
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
my noble man.

524
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
When are you going to kneel?

525
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,900
The corruption of the tax

526
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,900
and the treason of the enemy.

527
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
The map of the city and the layout of weapons

528
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
of our country was leaked.

529
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Hundreds of officials from all four provinces

530
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,900
have been missing.

531
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,900
The money that the corruption got

532
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,900
was all bought in the place where the country was bought.

533
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
Most of them were transferred to Hanzhou.

534
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
They were protected by the Han State's governor.

535
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Hanzhou is going to be destroyed.

536
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,900
Dacheng,

537
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
who did you do this to?

538
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
Who gave you the guts?

539
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
You're dead.

540
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
You know, the Zhujiu tribe.

541
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,900
You and I were fighting in the battle of the north and south.

542
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
Did you break up?

543
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,900
Why are you laughing?

544
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Da Sima,

545
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,900
why are you asking him?

546
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,900
Now the military power of Dacheng

547
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
is very strong.

548
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
Don't you know?

549
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
If the army is set up,

550
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
Dacheng will be destroyed.

551
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,900
Don't move.

552
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

553
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
I'll just say something.

554
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,900
Okay?

555
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
Okay?

556
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
Okay?

557
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Let him say.

558
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
Let him say.

559
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
Why do you want to be with Wu?

560
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Why do you want to be greedy?

561
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,900
We're just leaving a way for ourselves.

562
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
Because of the power of the King of Wu,

563
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,900
the King of Wu is not moved for the time being.

564
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,900
But he will understand sooner or later.

565
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,900
If he doesn't make a plan for himself,

566
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
he will be like Chen Xiaohua.

567
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,900
He will say a few words

568
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,900
and then he will feel great

569
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
when it rains that day.

570
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,900
How many tricks have you played

571
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
over and over again?

572
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
Have you ever changed?

573
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,900
Change the soup, not the medicine.

574
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
The Ministry of Revenue.

575
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
He has his own reasons.

576
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
What kind of Ministry of Revenue does he have?

577
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
Is the Ministry of Revenue really rich?

578
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
When the King of Wu was alive,

579
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
what kind of glory was the Ministry of Revenue?

580
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,900
When you were the King,

581
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,900
what kind of character was the Ministry of Revenue?

582
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Can he control it?

583
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
He can't!

584
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
What is the level of the ministers and the nobles now?

585
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,900
How long have they not practiced?

586
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,900
Da Sima,

587
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,900
you say it.

588
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
If you don't say it,

589
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,900
I know it too.

590
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,900
Because I have no money.

591
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
You're like a watchman.

592
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
You only care about the skin.

593
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,900
You can't do anything about it.

594
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900
Grand Tutor Wang!

595
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
It's okay if Grand Tutor Wang is not here.

596
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Let's not talk about

597
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,900
his old Zhang.

598
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
He has no money.

599
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
He has no military supplies.

600
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
He can't protect the city

601
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
with his soldiers

602
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
who are about the same age as me.

603
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
He can't!

604
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
I love my country

605
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
without money for a year.

606
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,900
I love my country

607
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,900
without money for two years.

608
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
If we live another year,

609
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
we can't live.

610
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
We are loyal to our country.

611
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
But who will use us?

612
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
Just because he is Chen Xiaohua,

613
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
he wants to resist the enemy.

614
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,900
He has no ability, you know?

615
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,900
He doesn't even want his face.

616
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
He doesn't want his face!

617
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
Chen's country

618
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
is going to be destroyed!

619
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
Shut up!

620
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
I can't die if I'm not in Chen's country!

621
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
You will be destroyed if you're not in Chen's country!

622
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,900
Go ask your sister!

623
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
See how much she has won

624
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
with your number!

625
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,900
Your Majesty,

626
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
I will kill this official.

627
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Let him finish.

628
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Chen Xiaohua,

629
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,900
you are destined to be

630
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
the king of the country.

631
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
The hundreds of years of

632
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Chen's ancestors

633
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
will be destroyed by you.

634
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
The whole country will be destroyed by you.

635
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,900
Let me tell you the truth.

636
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,900
The people of Wu said

637
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,900
they would only go to Chen's country

638
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,900
within half a month.

639
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
Living in such a state

640
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,900
is just a step ahead of you.

641
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,900
I love Chen's country.

642
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
But who loves me?

643
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,900
Why are you all looking at me?

644
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,900
I'm fine.

645
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,900
I'm fine.

646
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,900
I'm fine.

647
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
I'm fine.

648
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,900
I'm fine.

649
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
I'm fine.

650
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm fine.

651
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
I'm going out to rest.

652
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,900
Your Majesty,

653
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,900
the Han State's Jiedushi

654
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,900
has led the army to rebel against the Wu army.

655
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,900
The Jiedushi Wang Kaiyu

656
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,900
has opened the door.

657
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,900
He has invited the King of Wu to enter the city.

658
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,900
The chief officers and officers of the city

659
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,900
have been all in rebellion.

660
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,900
What's going on?

661
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,900
How can they be all in rebellion?

662
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,900
How can they be all in rebellion?

663
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,900
How can they be all in rebellion?

664
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
What a bad sign.

665
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,900
What a bad sign.

666
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,900
What a bad sign.

667
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,900
Your Majesty.

668
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
Dasima,

669
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
should we talk about this

670
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
or that first?

671
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,900
What do you think?

672
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,900
Yulin Army!

673
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,900
Yulin Army!

674
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,900
Go!

675
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,900
Your Majesty!

676
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,900
Your Majesty!

677
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,900
Your Majesty!

678
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,900
Go!

679
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
The silver is gone.

680
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
The officers have taken it.

681
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
Let me think about the rebellion.

682
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,900
Let me think about the rebellion.

683
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,900
Dismiss.

684
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
Minister Li Xuan of the Ministry of Revenue

685
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,900
Minister Zhang Chao of the Ministry of Works

686
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,900
Minister Yi Xiangquan of the Ministry of War

687
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
The six officials of the six ministries

688
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
have been involved in corruption and corruption.

689
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
The corruption of the army is a big problem.

690
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
The people are angry.

691
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900
The people of Chen are suffering.

692
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
The people of Chen are suffering.

693
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900
The officials of the six ministries

694
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
should call the officials up.

695
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
If they believe in the officials,

696
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,900
they should call the officials down.

697
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,900
But Xiaoshan dares not to do so.

698
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,900
The officials of the six ministries

699
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900
should be sent to the police station

700
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
to investigate the case.

701
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,900
Prepare the carriage.

702
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,900
I'm going out of the palace.

703
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
Take my son out of the palace.

704
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
We'll meet outside the city.

705
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
The officials of the six ministries are here.

706
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
Brother will not let me go this time.

707
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
If I don't go,

708
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
I can't go.

709
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
I heard he has arrived in Hanzhou.

710
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,900
I'm going to see him.

711
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,900
When I see him,

712
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,900
everything will be fine.

713
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Yes.

714
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
Hurry up.

715
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,900
Hurry up.

716
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,900
How dare you! What are you doing?

717
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,900
Open the door.

718
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,900
Open the door.

719
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
I want to see my brother.

720
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,900
Brother.

721
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Brother.

722
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,900
I know you're here.

723
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,900
It's my brother's order.

724
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,900
Your Majesty.

725
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,900
He is not bad.

726
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,900
He must have been

727
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,900
taught by a villain.

728
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,900
I don't believe in Si Tongwu.

729
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
I hope that

730
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,900
I can

731
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
spare your life

732
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,900
for the sake of my brother.

733
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,900
Brother.

734
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,900
When did you

735
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,900
become so much like Chen Xiaohua?

736
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,900
You said he was

737
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,900
unreliable and should be destroyed.

738
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,900
Our family is full of loyal and loyal.

739
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,900
We have done so much for our ministers.

740
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,900
We have done so much for our ministers.

741
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,900
But how did Chen Xiaohua treat you?

742
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,900
To tell you the truth,

743
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,900
I'm Tongwu.

744
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,900
Chen Xiaohua.

745
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,900
Do you think the King of Wu

746
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,900
will enter Hanzhou so soon?

747
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
Your ministers' half of their taxes

748
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
have become military supplies.

749
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,900
Shut up!

750
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,900
Brother.

751
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,900
Since you've lost your mind,

752
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,900
let her rest here.

753
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,900
I'm going to the capital.

754
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,900
I'm going to the capital.

755
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,900
I'm going to the capital.

756
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,900
I'm going to the capital.

757
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
