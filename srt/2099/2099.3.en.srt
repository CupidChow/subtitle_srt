1
00:00:05,877 --> 00:00:09,193
(Game Starting)

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,119
What's going on?

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
Someone explain!

4
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:15,960
Your Majesty!

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,839
I suspect she's not a maid,
but an assassin.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,039
Your Majesty, he lies.

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,199
(Oh no, I'm dead.)

8
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,519
I won't let you hurt His Majesty.

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,800
I'm the one who stopped him.

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,359
Otherwise, he'd have made it.

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,960
Reveal your true identity.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,760
You...

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,960
Both of you, shut up.

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,000
If I weren't smart,

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,079
I'd be long dead.

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,320
You didn't help at all.

17
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,047
=Episode 3=
Speak up.

18
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,347
(Rookie's Special Training)
What's the deal?

19
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,319
Confess. Who are you?

20
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,599
You won't believe it even if I tell you.

21
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,560
How do you know
if you don't give it a try?

22
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,759
Anyway, I can't get out of here alive.

23
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,919
I'm a spy sent from Wu State.

24
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,319
I've been undercover here for ten years.

25
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:33,919
I've been

26
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,159
waiting for an order

27
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,639
to kill you, King Chen,

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,879
(Kill)

29
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,520
to plunge Chen State into chaos.

30
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,080
That will be my contribution
to Wu State.

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,039
Interesting.

32
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,319
What's your plan after killing me?

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,240
My plan?

34
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,319
If I kill you, the king,

35
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,599
naturally, I have to die.

36
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,439
What a joke.

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,719
As long as I'm here,

38
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,319
you won't stand a chance.

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,039
Speaking of which,

40
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,159
why did you save me?

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,800
Because you're stupid.

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,719
Keeping you alive serves us better.

43
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,759
Fair point.

44
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,039
What are you waiting for?

45
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,719
Go ahead.

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Long Qi.

47
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,479
She insulted me.

48
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,840
Kill her.

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,719
What's going on?

50
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,639
You agree with them?

51
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,800
You're not afraid of death?

52
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,719
For Wu State,

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,120
I'll sacrifice myself.

54
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,319
Then do you dare

55
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,080
to bet with me?

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,240
Chen Xiaohua
won't remain a fool forever.

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,120
He will become
a wise ruler of Chen State

58
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,919
and lead his people to defeat you.

59
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,080
From my observation,

60
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,000
it's impossible.

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,919
Just tell me if you take this bet.

62
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,120
What is the wager?

63
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,639
You'll be my personal maid.

64
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,120
You'll protect His Majesty

65
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,319
when he's in danger.

66
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,319
Then you won't kill me?

67
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,960
That's right, I won't.

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,079
If you win,

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,319
your work won't be wasted.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,079
If I win,

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,680
whether you live or die won't matter.

72
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,800
Alright.

73
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,079
From now on,

74
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,720
you'll get special training.

75
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,199
What is that?

76
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:37,920
Extremely harsh training.

77
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,279
My respects, Your Highness.

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,920
Wu Zhong.

79
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,680
Rabbit doll.

80
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,800
The ancient text says,

81
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,000
"When the Jade Rabbit appears,

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,920
the Warrioress returns."

83
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,040
Chen State
has been under her protection.

84
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,560
She appears

85
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,560
whenever the state is in a crisis.

86
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,639
Keep an eye on them.

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,240
Keep me updated

88
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,600
if anything happens.

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,879
Understood.

90
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,199
Got nothing else to do?

91
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,639
Why are you drumming?

92
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:32,920
Stop it.

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,480
I don't think that's the outfit

94
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,480
for training.

95
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,120
Change your clothes.

96
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,519
The historical records state

97
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,199
that your father
was a skilled warrior.

98
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,600
As his descendant,

99
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,560
I bet you have the potential.

100
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,319
Today, let's find out

101
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,120
where your potential lies.

102
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,920
What is this for?

103
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,279
Nothing.

104
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,639
It's to cure your laziness.

105
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,120
Let the incense stick burn out.

106
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,800
Then you have no idea

107
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,399
how lazy I am.

108
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,439
I think I'm suddenly cured of laziness.

109
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,160
Lady Xiao

110
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,560
is conducting special training
for His Majesty?

111
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,319
That's right.

112
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,120
What is she up to?

113
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,439
Outrageous!

114
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,040
Outrageous!

115
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,439
She's physically punishing

116
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,639
her husband in broad daylight.

117
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,800
What about his dignity?

118
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,240
What about his majesty?

119
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,920
This training

120
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,439
is about catching the ball.

121
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,399
The thrower and catcher

122
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,879
stand three to four meters apart.

123
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,720
The thrower can throw the ball
in any direction and at any height.

124
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,199
The catcher wins by catching.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,839
This is meant

126
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,240
to train your cooperation
and coordination.

127
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,960
That's way too easy.

128
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,879
So easy?

129
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,519
Here's the thing.

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,519
I can catch whatever you throw.

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
Maybe you can throw

132
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,039
peanuts for me to catch

133
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,639
with my mouth.

134
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,320
Bring it on.

135
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,440
Stop!

136
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,519
Stop!

137
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,399
Stop!

138
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,519
Physical punishment in public?

139
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,759
What about his dignity?

140
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,799
What about his majesty?

141
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,480
Grand Tutor.

142
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,120
Help.

143
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,559
Guards.

144
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,159
Arrest the demoness.

145
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,120
Seize her.

146
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,799
Arrest her.

147
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:23,919
You...

148
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,240
Y-You...

149
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,600
Grand Tutor.

150
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,919
I'm just exercising with her.

151
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,799
Why don't you go home?

152
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,559
In that case,

153
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,639
I'll take my leave.

154
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,679
Carry on.

155
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,080
Grand Tutor.

156
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,840
Grand Tutor.

157
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,879
Go further away.

158
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,919
This is too far.

159
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,720
Shoot.

160
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,799
Oh.

161
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,159
Where are you aiming at?

162
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
I think there's a problem with this bow.

163
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,720
The three points can't form a line.

164
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,200
Left eye closed.

165
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,120
Right eye open.

166
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,080
I give up.

167
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,879
Archery is too difficult.

168
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,200
It's not for me.

169
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:33,879
I can't do it.

170
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,480
Keep practicing.

171
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,320
Find me the best Taoist

172
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,720
in Chen State.

173
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,919
Tell him

174
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,720
I have a job for him.

175
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,960
Understood.

176
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,639
Let me guess

177
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,080
what my dinner is.

178
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,320
Chicken with pork tripe.

179
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,080
Buddha's Temptation.

180
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,879
Chicken with mushrooms.

181
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,799
Tomato beef.

182
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:37,559
None...

183
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,679
Forget it.

184
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,159
I'm both hungry and hurting.

185
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,600
Why bother?

186
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,759
Let me see what I'm having today.

187
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,720
You're not even hiding it

188
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,960
when you try to poison me, huh?

189
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,399
Your Majesty.

190
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,519
This

191
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,639
is made by Lady Xiao.

192
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,120
It's called

193
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,799
healthy vegetable and fruit juice.

194
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,120
What juice?

195
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,440
Well,

196
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,039
I think it's an apple

197
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,720
mixed with

198
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,279
some weeds from the garden.

199
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,679
How dare she!

200
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,840
T-Take...

201
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,440
Take it away.

202
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,919
It really hurts.

203
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,679
Lady Xiao told me

204
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,159
to watch you drink it with my own eyes.

205
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,279
Demoness.

206
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,320
You think I'm a pushover

207
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,799
just because I hold back?

208
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,440
It really hurts when she hits people.

209
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,399
She hits...

210
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,000
Even if

211
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,320
I can't beat her,

212
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
can't I throw a tantrum and roll

213
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,240
on the ground?

214
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,039
That's really impressive.

215
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,639
Lady Xiao is in the study.

216
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
In the study?

217
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,159
Just you wait.

218
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,559
Long Qi.

219
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,080
Let's go.

220
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,399
Teach her a lesson.

221
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,600
I'm not going.

222
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,279
I think you'll sell me out.

223
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,360
Why would I sell you out?

224
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,879
I'm the ruler of a state.

225
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,840
You think I'm afraid of my wife?

226
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,039
Teaching her a lesson?

227
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,840
You're not afraid of her?

228
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,240
Absolutely right.

229
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,440
But Grand Tutor taught me,

230
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,759
"A gentleman shouldn't
fight with women."

231
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,440
Besides, why would I

232
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,440
argue with my wife?

233
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,720
You are just too narrow-minded.

234
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,720
Use your wit,

235
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,759
not your fists,

236
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,480
with women.

237
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:55,759
But Grand Tutor

238
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,759
is known to be afraid of his wife.

239
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,120
How are we the same?

240
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,639
He is afraid of his wife.

241
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,440
And me?

242
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,519
I'm broke,

243
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,759
dumb, and weak.

244
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
I have to rely on the Zhang family.

245
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,080
I think,

246
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,519
to reverse this situation,

247
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,600
we have to

248
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,799
use our wit.

249
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,080
You want to tame her?

250
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,840
Nonsense.

251
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,080
I'll make my beloved

252
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,240
truly admire me

253
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,440
and worship me.

254
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,720
Do you know

255
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,799
how a man can win over a woman?

256
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,759
It requires enough free time and money.

257
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,360
And I

258
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,480
have all the free time.

259
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,679
All I need is...

260
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,320
Money.

261
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,039
That's right.

262
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,159
So instead of confronting her directly,

263
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,000
we should take a roundabout approach.

264
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,600
Accumulate wealth.

265
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,639
Then she will certainly fall for me.

266
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,519
That's not for sure.

267
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,440
It is for sure.

268
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,279
Listen.

269
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,919
Keep an eye on her.

270
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,720
I'll accumulate wealth.

271
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:44,600
Understood.

272
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,679
But how are you

273
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,200
going to do that?

274
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,759
(The wise man has his ingenious plan.)

275
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,759
Again?

276
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,279
What's he doing so late

277
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:02,840
at night?

278
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,679
It's so addictive?

279
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,279
He's breaking into the treasury.

280
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Are we letting him?

281
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,519
What else can we do?

282
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,680
That's his treasury.

283
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,039
But it's not a private vault.

284
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,000
Even His Majesty

285
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,440
shall be punished for this act.

286
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,039
Don't cause me trouble.

287
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,319
What's in there to steal?

288
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:16,960
Let him be.

289
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,920
This treasury

290
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:42,799
is completely empty.

291
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,240
Chen State is so impoverished?

292
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,160
Only one string of coins?

293
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,839
I told you.

294
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,839
I knew I saw someone

295
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,519
sneaking into the treasury at night.

296
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,079
How dare you?

297
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,799
At this point,

298
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,039
I have to confess.

299
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,559
It's me.

300
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,160
Surprise, huh?

301
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,640
I know it's you.

302
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,640
Or I'd have arrested you.

303
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,440
How do you know?

304
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,000
No one is dumb enough

305
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,640
to steal from the treasury

306
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,079
like you do.

307
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,039
I hate it when people call me dumb.

308
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,039
Change a word.

309
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,039
For example,

310
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:41,839
innocent.

311
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,079
Innocent?

312
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,519
You brat.

313
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,759
Stop pretending to be innocent.

314
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,599
You broke into the treasury at night.

315
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,279
Confess.

316
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
What are you plotting?

317
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,720
There's nothing to plot.

318
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,640
This treasury is so empty.

319
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,440
What can I steal?

320
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,240
Are you looking for the Imperial Seal?

321
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,240
What seal?

322
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,720
Playing dumb, huh?

323
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,440
You're lazier than a pig.

324
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,480
Did you break into

325
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,440
the treasury

326
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,599
at this hour just for fun?

327
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:24,720
I...

328
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,720
I...

329
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,720
Fine.

330
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,119
I might as well tell the world

331
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,839
that your embezzlement

332
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,240
emptied the treasury.

333
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,599
The lost cities due to

334
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,559
the lack of provisions

335
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,039
will all be blamed on you.

336
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,359
I would like to see

337
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:41,039
what Grand Tutor Wang can possibly

338
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,119
come up with to save your reputation

339
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,279
and silence

340
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,200
the public.

341
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,599
What a relief.

342
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,559
Thought you'd take my cured meat.

343
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,359
Why doesn't Your Majesty
tell them the truth?

344
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,559
Why are you here?

345
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,480
Where's Long Qi?

346
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,480
What is Lady Xiao

347
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,440
thinking about all this time?

348
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,039
I bet she's worrying about His Majesty.

349
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,240
Your Majesty. You must toughen up.

350
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,640
What truth?

351
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,000
What are you plotting?

352
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,039
Plotting?

353
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,680
Chen Xiaohua,

354
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,680
aren't you here for a donation?

355
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,759
Donation?

356
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,440
What am I donating?

357
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,759
I have no money.

358
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,799
Yes, you do.

359
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,079
My money.

360
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,160
You're destroying me,

361
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,519
body and soul.

362
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,319
His Majesty wanted to do it anonymously.

363
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,319
However,

364
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,640
you found out about it.

365
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:58,319
That's right.

366
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,599
I'm deeply concerned

367
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,160
about the state.

368
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,119
Chen Xiaohua.

369
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,559
What makes you think

370
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,200
you get to say such nonsense?

371
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,160
I...

372
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,519
You believe him?

373
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,920
Do you believe him?

374
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,960
Actually, it's not impossible.

375
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,799
I also think

376
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,079
His Majesty sounded somewhat sincere.

377
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,359
After all, we don't

378
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,640
have any evidence.

379
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,039
Besides, he did leave
some of his... own money here.

380
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,440
Four out of

381
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,759
five people here think

382
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,480
His Majesty isn't here to steal money

383
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,440
but to make

384
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,519
an anonymous donation.

385
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,039
It is clear who is right
and who is wrong.

386
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:42,839
Very well.

387
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,839
The girls in our family

388
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,480
stand by you, Chen Xiaohua.

389
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,440
Then please be generous, Your Majesty,

390
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
and save Chen State,

391
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:52,599
so that my family

392
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,200
doesn't have to reach into our pocket

393
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,160
to provide for everyone
in the royal court

394
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,240
and subsidize the treasury.

395
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
I will take my leave.

396
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,279
Auntie.

397
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,960
Auntie.

398
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,480
Auntie.

399
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,400
Honey.

400
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,920
Honey.

401
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,359
Look who just sided

402
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,200
with their husband.

403
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,039
Why are you following me?

404
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,119
Auntie.

405
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,000
I was going to threaten him

406
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,960
and make him tell the truth

407
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,599
to get some clues

408
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,799
about the Imperial Seal.

409
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,240
Whoever gets the seal

410
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,480
gets the world.

411
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,559
But look at you.

412
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,240
You just married him

413
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,279
and you're already siding with him.

414
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,680
We dare not.

415
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,400
It's just that

416
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,839
Uncle told us to gain

417
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,400
His Majesty's trust and conceive

418
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,640
as soon as possible.

419
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,680
So we have to
side with him in front of others.

420
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,160
My brother has made such a fine plan.

421
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:00,720
But what if

422
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,519
Chen Xiaohua can't even have children?

423
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,440
In that case,

424
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,279
you'll live like widows

425
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,559
forever.

426
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,519
Go back.

427
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,680
Understood.

428
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,279
Get someone to dig through
the state treasury.

429
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,000
I would like to

430
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,480
learn its secrets.

431
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:24,920
But

432
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,319
Grand Tutor Wang and others might use it

433
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,559
for impeachment.

434
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,319
Impeachment?

435
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,640
If that old fool
wants to impeach me, then let him.

436
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,640
This concerns the Imperial Seal.

437
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,559
The Grand Marshal will mediate for me.

438
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,720
A state treasury
without even a tael of silver.

439
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,720
So what if it's burned?

440
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,759
Understood.

441
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,680
Talk to me.

442
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,119
Silent treatment isn't good.

443
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,119
You prefer violence?

444
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,000
Not really.

445
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,680
Aren't you utterly trash

446
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,759
to steal from the treasury?

447
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:02,200
Come on.

448
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:03,960
I just wanted

449
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,599
to steal two ingots.

450
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,400
Or one is enough.

451
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,200
We need money out there.

452
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,359
Think about it.

453
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,599
If we can't stay

454
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,400
in the palace one day,

455
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,319
won't we need money to run away?

456
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,160
But honestly,

457
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,640
I didn't want much.

458
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,160
I just wanted

459
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,960
some petty money

460
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,440
to lead a simple life

461
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,000
peacefully and safely.

462
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,039
But it turned out

463
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,599
that we were broke

464
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,640
and the treasury was empty.

465
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,000
Wait.

466
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,839
If the treasury is empty,

467
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,559
then we're out of money?

468
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,279
In that case,

469
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,759
they can't put food on the table.

470
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,440
I'll have to starve?

471
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,960
Then why should I be a puppet king?

472
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:47,920
What's the point?

473
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,799
Seriously.

474
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,200
Wait.

475
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,799
That's not right.

476
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,279
Where is Long Qi?

477
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,200
Didn't I ask Long Qi to watch over you?

478
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,680
What do you mean?

479
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:04,880
What do you mean?

480
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,200
Come on.

481
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,200
Even if you are my wife,

482
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,599
if you hurt my buddy,

483
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,160
I...

484
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,559
Long Qi.

485
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,799
Long Qi.

486
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,240
Long Qi!

487
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,119
Long Qi.

488
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,119
Long Qi.

489
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:28,880
You're back.

490
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,119
Yeah.

491
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,759
I was thinking

492
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,680
that you had some dirty clothes.

493
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,599
And I couldn't sleep.

494
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,480
So here I am...

495
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,079
Rest early, Your Majesty.

496
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,160
I shall take my leave.

497
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,079
Every man has some

498
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,480
private stash of money.

499
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,039
No.

500
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,599
I didn't open it the right way.

501
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:37,960
(Maybe)

502
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,759
(it wasn't formal enough.)

503
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,720
(I didn't say the spell.)

504
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,319
All things are illusions.

505
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,960
Everything can be redone.

506
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,799
Rookie.

507
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,519
Restart.

508
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:51,960
Let's see.

509
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,559
This is weird.

510
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,640
Why didn't it work?

511
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,400
I did say "rookie".

512
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,440
One more time.

513
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,920
Restart.

514
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,000
What's the problem?

515
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:15,960
Rookie.

516
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Restart.

517
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,519
Long Qi.

518
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,359
Cured meat.

519
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,200
My fate is in my hands.

520
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,799
Envy not the immortals.

521
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:26,920
Follow my decree.

522
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,079
Bala Bala Maitri.

523
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:28,680
Rookie.

524
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:29,759
Restart.

525
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,759
Loving to drink?

526
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,160
Demoness.

527
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,559
Demoness!

528
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,319
Rookie.

529
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,759
Rookie.

530
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,599
Fine, forget it.

531
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,440
Give me back my cured meat.

532
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,839
Give me back my Long Qi.

533
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,000
So noisy.

534
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,119
Gone.

535
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,559
All gone.

536
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,000
My savings are gone.

537
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,680
My buddy could be dead.

538
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,240
My wife is a demon.

539
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,400
I've literally lost everything.

540
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,559
Maybe the spell failed

541
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,039
because I wasn't in grave danger.

542
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,119
Fine.

543
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,160
In that case...

544
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:43,880
(It's okay.)

545
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,960
(No big deal.)

546
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,319
(Eyes closed.)

547
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,079
(Just one kick.)

548
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,160
(Eyes open.)

549
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,039
(I'll have everything.)

550
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,000
(Long Qi will be back.)

551
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,400
(The cured meat, too.)

552
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,519
(Maybe even my wife...)

553
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,559
(would be more gentle.)

554
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,000
(Wait.)

555
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,519
(My mother used to say,)

556
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,079
("Money is indeed valuable,)

557
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,440
(but life is more precious.")

558
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,440
(What if I don't come back to life?)

559
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,079
(It's not worth it)

560
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,079
(if I just die.)

561
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:15,359
(Forget it.)

562
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,160
(I'll find another way.)

563
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,799
Long Qi.

564
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,359
Your Majesty. I've been watching you

565
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,559
and I really don't get it.

566
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,519
What

567
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,880
was the game?

568
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,000
What was the game?

569
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,519
That wasn't a game!

570
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:50,400
Come on.

571
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,799
Where were you?

572
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,079
I thought you...

573
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,359
Wait.

574
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,960
Didn't I tell you to watch Lady Xiao?

575
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:02,559
And?

576
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,119
I was watching Lady Xiao

577
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,680
until the lights went out.

578
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,640
Not even

579
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:07,720
a fly came out.

580
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:08,440
Nonsense!

581
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,160
She's been going

582
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,440
all over the palace.

583
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:14,759
Forget it.

584
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,200
You can't monitor her.

585
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,039
She knows magic.

586
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:20,839
However,

587
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,279
suicide indeed takes courage.

588
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,279
Everyone knows

589
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:29,519
that I lack courage the most.

590
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,119
So that was a suicide.

591
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,279
It has never crossed my mind.

592
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,079
Not to mention you,

593
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,519
even I didn't see that coming.

594
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,359
This is outrageous.

595
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,039
Who did this to Your Majesty?

596
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,079
He must be torn to pieces.

597
00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:49,494
(Memorial)

598
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,920
Stop it!

599
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,359
Stop making noises at night!

600
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,759
How am I going to sleep?

601
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,799
Long Qi.

602
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,519
What is that?

603
00:31:13,982 --> 00:31:17,996
(Save every inch of land)

604
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,319
The engraved text says...

605
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,720
The engraved text says,

606
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,359
"Save every inch of land."

607
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,400
"Save every inch of land."

608
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,119
So unfathomable.

609
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,960
So confusing.

610
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,880
Maybe the second half goes,

611
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,559
"For our

612
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,880
descendants to cultivate."

613
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,880
For our descendants?

614
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,240
Isn't it referring to a land deed?

615
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,839
Land deed.

616
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,559
Brilliant.

617
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,799
As drowsiness sets in,

618
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,000
someone brings a pillow.

619
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,400
With the land deed,

620
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:22,559
why should I die?

621
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,784
Your Majesty. Be careful.

622
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,720
Your Majesty. Are you hurt?

623
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,440
No.

624
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,119
It's just

625
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,160
poisonous.

626
00:32:54,491 --> 00:32:58,672
(Year 2099)

627
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:54,880
Dr. K.

628
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:00,960
Jiang Tao.

629
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,960
Why are you here?

630
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,839
That was Mr. Wu's dog, right?

631
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,359
Yeah, I'm keeping it here.

632
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,079
Come on.

633
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,199
Come on in.

634
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:09,920
Okay.

635
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,480
Come on.

636
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,880
Jiang Tao.

637
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,859
(Immortality Plan Developer, Dr. K)
What brings you here?

638
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,079
I'm here to learn about
the Immortality Plan.

639
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,719
Please.

640
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,679
(Immortality Plan)
The application

641
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,719
to conduct experiments on humans

642
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,320
has been submitted to us.

643
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,440
I've reviewed the data.

644
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,599
Your experiment

645
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,599
has reached the standard
for human experiments.

646
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,239
You co-developed
the Metaverse Immortality Program

647
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,440
with our Lannao Company

648
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
as a game...

649
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's an experiment,

650
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,119
not a game.

651
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,519
Okay, experiment it is.

652
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,320
Humans can upload their consciousness

653
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,719
to the experiment

654
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,480
to achieve true immortality,

655
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,800
infinitely prolonging
their limited lives.

656
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,960
The Earth is now

657
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,239
saturated with people.

658
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:33,800
However,

659
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,519
every year,

660
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,480
38% of people die from

661
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:37,760
radiation sickness.

662
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:38,880
And most of

663
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:41,079
the people alive see no purpose in life.

664
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,920
But in our game,

665
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,360
they can live the life they want to live

666
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,199
and be the person they want to be.

667
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,079
This is your initial purpose

668
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,920
for developing this game with us.

669
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:52,719
Right?

670
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,559
Where are you getting at?

671
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,239
I'm thinking.

672
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,400
Since we can upload our consciousness

673
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,679
into the game

674
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,440
and complete the challenges,

675
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,880
then can we

676
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,800
use this to help humans

677
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,920
repair brain neurons?
