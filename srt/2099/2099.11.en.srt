1
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,239
Is it dangerous?

2
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:54,959
No.

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm just confused.

4
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,519
What is troubling you?

5
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,640
I've actually told you many times.

6
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,719
But I don't think you will believe it.

7
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,439
Whatever you say,

8
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
I'll believe it.

9
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,280
Actually, I'm the chosen one.

10
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,319
You must be.

11
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,840
I can be reborn.

12
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
And in the last life,

13
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,759
I audited the accounts

14
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,439
and arrested ministers.

15
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,680
Afterward,

16
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,520
the Wu State invaded the capital,

17
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,919
and you all died.

18
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,840
In my previous life, the one before,

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,080
and every life,

20
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,120
I actually had a My Beloved.

21
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,599
She was Lady Xiao.

22
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,560
She was different from everyone else.

23
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,280
She believed I could become a good king.

24
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
But in the end,

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,560
I failed.

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Do you understand?

27
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,680
If you don't understand, just ask.

28
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,400
Indeed,

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,560
this sounds

30
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,159
a bit inconceivable,

31
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,000
but

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,120
I believe you.

33
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,479
The point is,

34
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,719
do you really have no impression
of Zhang Xiao'er

35
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,039
at all?

36
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,879
I truly don't.

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,240
I guess you love Lady Xiao very much.

38
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,919
Do you also think I'm crazy?

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,159
So, according to what you said,

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,759
this time,

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,680
is the Wu Army going to invade?

42
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,879
Maybe.

43
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:40,672
=Episode 11=
(I Want to Prove Myself)

44
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,159
He didn't
attend the morning court again.

45
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,960
I thought he could change himself

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,639
after praying for rain.

47
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,159
Also,

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,159
he's been searching for a woman lately,

49
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,960
insisting she is his wife.

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,039
The imperial guards have all been sent

51
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,559
to search everywhere,
but couldn't find her.

52
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,960
Chen Xiaohua

53
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,080
is determined to be the king
of a fallen nation.

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,080
Good.

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
If things go on like this,

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,839
he will come to fetch me

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,399
soon.

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,120
Your Majesty,

59
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,079
what shall we do next?

60
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,120
Fishing.

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,360
And after that?

62
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,639
Still fishing.

63
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,920
Currently, the Wu Army is pressing on.

64
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,480
Shouldn't you come up with a way

65
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,120
to fight against them?

66
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
No need to resist.

67
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,920
Why?

68
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,160
Can't do that anymore.

69
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,360
I thought that recovering tax revenues

70
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,920
could save Chen State from disaster.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,120
But unexpectedly,

72
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,920
it accelerated the Wu State's attack.

73
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,720
I don't want
to see you and everyone else

74
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,040
dying in front of me.

75
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,839
Your Majesty,

76
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,240
don't worry.

77
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,560
I'm

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,279
living well.

79
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,560
Yes.

80
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,439
As people,

81
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,399
we have to live well.

82
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,800
Tell me.

83
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,319
If I do nothing,

84
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,720
will the outcome be different?

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,839
Will you not die?

86
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,439
And will she not disappear?

87
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,680
Your Majesty,

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,120
I don't understand.

89
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,279
But if that day comes,

90
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,079
I will not hesitate

91
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,199
to die for you.

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,600
I will not survive alone.

93
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,480
Enough.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,319
What are you talking about?

95
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,279
You have to live well.

96
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,639
Reel in.

97
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,040
Silly fish,

98
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,279
the most enticing thing
is the most dangerous.

99
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,959
How can you be so foolish?

100
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,920
His Majesty took serious measures
against corruption

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,199
to enrich the Treasury.

102
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,879
I thought he had decided
to become a wise ruler.

103
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,480
But unexpectedly,

104
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,800
he didn't change.

105
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,799
I heard

106
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,680
he buried his fighting cock

107
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,759
and cried all afternoon.

108
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,079
I heard it too.

109
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,639
With enemies at hand,

110
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,959
is he afraid,

111
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,079
or does he have ulterior motives?

112
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,839
Grand Tutor Wang.

113
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,040
You think too highly of him.

114
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,040
Ulterior motives?

115
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,160
For what?

116
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,120
Tell me now.

117
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,759
How to prevent the military catastrophe
from occurring?

118
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,879
Are you hoping King Wu
will retreat his troops?

119
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,840
I just feel

120
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,040
His Majesty is different from before.

121
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,400
I can't express it,

122
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,879
but I can feel it.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,279
He would never have done the thing

124
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,960
he did in the court that day.

125
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,279
What kind of things?

126
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,079
Publicly hugging you?

127
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,400
Grand Marshal,

128
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,720
you shouldn't joke around.

129
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,639
I firmly believe

130
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,680
His Majesty

131
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,480
will not sit around doing nothing.

132
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,519
Let's hope so.

133
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,079
Your Majesty.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,519
There's news.

135
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,319
Sometimes I wonder

136
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,439
if she ever appeared.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,199
Thinking about it,

138
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,759
I am not sure anymore.

139
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,079
Long Qi,

140
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
is it possible

141
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,720
that I only had a dream?

142
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,000
Is she just a person I imagined?

143
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,879
Your Majesty.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,079
After inquiries,

145
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,119
I confirmed this item

146
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,920
is a token

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,439
from Yizhan Deng in Guishan.

148
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:26,879
Your Majesty.

149
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,239
Yizhan Deng of Guishan

150
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,159
is located at the junction
of the states of Chen, Wu, Chu, and Yue.

151
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,360
It's a real motley crew.

152
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,679
Due to its rugged terrain,

153
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,559
it's turned into a wild area untouched

154
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,479
by any power.

155
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,039
It's also a place for various parties
to negotiate, trade,

156
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,000
and fence goods.

157
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,720
Therefore,

158
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,279
the Imperial Seal might be at Guishan.

159
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,840
Seal?

160
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,240
Imperial Seal?

161
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:02,272
(Memorial)

162
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,240
Honey.

163
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,799
Did I do something wrong?

164
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,719
I didn't become a good king

165
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,360
as you expected.

166
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,000
The Wu Army is about to invade.

167
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
Why are you not here

168
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,639
in this life?

169
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,639
Good news.

170
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,440
I just upgraded the entire system.

171
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,520
After you go back in,

172
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,319
you will

173
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,919
keep all your memories
in the real world.

174
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,840
Really?

175
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,080
That's great.

176
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,200
However,

177
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,480
I make it clear again.

178
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,799
You must not intervene anymore.

179
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,879
Got it.

180
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,039
Let me in quickly.

181
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:26,880
(System Upgraded)

182
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,919
Rookie.

183
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,080
I knew you would come back.

184
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,480
You know what?

185
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,000
When you were not here,

186
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,519
they all said I was sick,

187
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,600
and I was looking for someone
who never existed.

188
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
Honey, where did you go?

189
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,159
Do you know...

190
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,440
Chen Xiaohua.

191
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,600
Do you know that you might die?

192
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,039
By then, you won't be able to get out.

193
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,319
In the real world,

194
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,160
it's fine if you waste your time.

195
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,000
But you've been here for so long.

196
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,240
Still, you don't work hard

197
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
or handle state affairs.

198
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,360
Guess how much effort I've made

199
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,639
to save you?

200
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,120
Can't you show some backbone?

201
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,120
Honey,

202
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,320
what are you talking about?

203
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,320
Are you my honey?

204
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,920
Sure, I'm your honey.

205
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,960
You're not dreaming.

206
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,799
Do you need me

207
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,120
to repeat that code?

208
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:47,799
Waist birthmark.

209
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,920
Smacking lips.

210
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,159
You snore while sleeping.

211
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,679
More details?

212
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,600
Enough.

213
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,000
Honey.

214
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,720
Your Majesty.

215
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,679
Long Qi.

216
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,559
Long Qi, I told you.

217
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,480
This is my honey,

218
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,759
Lady Xiao.

219
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,960
Your Grace?

220
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,120
You remember her?

221
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,039
How could I not know her?

222
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,679
Chen Xiaohua.

223
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,120
Wait.

224
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,599
I know

225
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,759
you're going to say again
that I never work hard.

226
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,799
Because you were gone.

227
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,360
Does that mean you can stop trying

228
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,520
and do nothing?

229
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,640
The Wu Army is pressing on.

230
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,120
Did you do anything for that?

231
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,279
Do you want to watch everyone die again?

232
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,879
Long Qi.

233
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,120
Long Qi.

234
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,240
She remembers.

235
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,879
Honey.

236
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,080
Chen Xiaohua,

237
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,679
listen to me

238
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,440
carefully.

239
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,120
Everything here is fake.

240
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,720
It's fictional.

241
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,320
This is a game world.

242
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,719
Long Qi and everyone around you,

243
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,599
including the Chen State, are fake.

244
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,439
They do not exist.

245
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,559
Do you understand?

246
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,520
You must work hard

247
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,000
to win this virtual game,

248
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,799
defeat Wu State,

249
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,799
and be a good ruler.

250
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,559
Only then can you survive.

251
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,480
Game?

252
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,360
Long Qi,

253
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,920
do you know

254
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,840
what she's on about?

255
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,399
I don't know.

256
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,080
I don't know either.

257
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,679
Honey, what is it?

258
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,879
You once said

259
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,600
that when all this was over,

260
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,639
you'd take me to a peaceful place.

261
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,879
But considering what you're doing now,

262
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,600
I feel you'll never make it happen.

263
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:02,799
So, please.

264
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,200
Please be mature.

265
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,000
How am I immature?

266
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,959
Have you worked hard?

267
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,199
Yes, I have.

268
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,200
You ask Long Qi.

269
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,439
I asked him to find the seal.

270
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,719
We made so much effort, right?

271
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,360
Yes.

272
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,480
Have you found it?

273
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,080
Not yet.

274
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,599
But I've thought of a good plan

275
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:22,000
to turn things around.

276
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,120
You?

277
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,799
Can you think of a good plan?

278
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,799
Yes.

279
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,679
I, Chen Xiaohua,

280
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,200
have thought of a wonderful plan.

281
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,000
And this time,

282
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,720
I will prove it to you all by myself.

283
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,559
Long Qi.

284
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,320
Yes.

285
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,519
Let's go.

286
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,279
Your Majesty,

287
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:44,960
I don't understand.

288
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,879
Didn't you always love Lady Xiao?

289
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,879
Don't you think she's very fierce,

290
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,120
completely unlike before?

291
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,480
Wasn't she fierce before?

292
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:53,639
You know nothing.

293
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,360
What should we do next?

294
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,480
The bamboo slip?

295
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,799
It's...

296
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,279
Your Majesty.

297
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,960
Your Majesty.

298
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,279
We must find the Imperial Seal

299
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,200
in Guishan.

300
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,559
Long Qi, do you know the way to Guishan?

301
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,799
You underestimate the secret guards.

302
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,080
We've learned outdoor skills.

303
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
Through the sun and stars,

304
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,479
we can navigate.

305
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,480
Wilderness survival is very easy.

306
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,880
You're bragging.

307
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,199
So, you're a skilled guard?

308
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,360
Sure, I am.

309
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:10,480
Your Majesty, once we reach the foot
of the mountain, we have to climb.

310
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,200
Didn't I already say it?

311
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Once out of the palace,

312
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
don't say Your Majesty.

313
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,080
Call me Young Master.

314
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,559
Yes, Young Master.

315
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,840
Can you climb the mountain?

316
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,960
Are you kidding?

317
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,279
I am the chosen one.

318
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,000
It's so easy for me to do that.

319
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:28,960
We've arrived.

320
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
- Let's go.
- Go.

321
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:06,799
Let's rest for a while.

322
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,519
Your Majesty,

323
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,000
it's a long way to go.

324
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,839
How about I carry you?

325
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,240
No need.

326
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,319
What did you call me?

327
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,519
I'm not a rookie.

328
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,000
Your Majesty,

329
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,119
be careful.

330
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,480
Long Qi, are you sure
this is the right way?

331
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,839
Well...

332
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,319
Something's wrong.

333
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,759
But it should be this way.

334
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,999
Did we take the wrong turn
at the previous fork?

335
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,000
Which fork?

336
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,480
Could it be the one by the big rock?

337
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,400
Wasn't that 20 miles back?

338
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,759
As a secret guard,

339
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,240
didn't you learn outdoor skills?

340
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,079
You're just an assassin from Wu State.

341
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,479
Stop nagging.

342
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,719
Did you ever help?

343
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:54,320
You didn't.

344
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,320
How dare you be picky?

345
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,239
How did I not help?

346
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,080
You make it clear.

347
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,960
- You...
- I...

348
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,080
Hold it.

349
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,759
What?

350
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,400
You want me to carry it?

351
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,079
Also,

352
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,360
the Queen asked me to come

353
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,160
to monitor you.

354
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,519
I'm not here to serve you.

355
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,120
You assassin.

356
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,080
- You...
- What?

357
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,039
Sure, I'm an assassin.

358
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,319
I've never lied to you.

359
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,880
I made a bet with the Queen to see

360
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,479
if His Majesty would always be silly.

361
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,519
And it looks like now

362
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,039
that I'll remain the Queen's maid,

363
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:17,680
and then...

364
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,999
I have to protect His Majesty
for a long time.

365
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,039
How could you say that?

366
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,000
- So what?
- You...

367
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,599
Tell me.

368
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,079
Am I really foolish?

369
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,279
No, Your Majesty...

370
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,160
No, Young Master.

371
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,480
I'm the foolish one.

372
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,640
Caiyi is right.

373
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,119
Your Majesty.

374
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,080
What are you doing?

375
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,439
You're so smart, huh?

376
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,559
Though you think that way,

377
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,839
you can't say it out loud.

378
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,680
I didn't mean to.

379
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,759
It's your fault for being so irritating.

380
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,319
I didn't mean it that way.

381
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,759
What should we do?

382
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,960
We must find the Imperial Seal
in Guishan

383
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,559
to prove to my honey

384
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,359
that I can achieve things.

385
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,920
Young Master, stay close to me.

386
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,240
Young Master, I'll go check first.

387
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,039
Young Master,

388
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,720
I spotted two suspicious persons.

389
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,640
You don't even have any food.

390
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,279
Aren't you hungry?

391
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,080
You're robbers?

392
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,319
We're innocent.

393
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,079
We're just traveling.

394
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,480
No offense.

395
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,440
Please be merciful

396
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,119
and spare us.

397
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,839
Tell me.

398
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,080
What do you do?

399
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,920
Sir.

400
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,359
We are

401
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,119
merchants of Shanning County.

402
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,440
From Kangzhou?

403
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,640
Long Qi.

404
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,599
They don't look like bad people.

405
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,279
It's hard doing business.

406
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,079
Let them both go.

407
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:30,599
Merchants?

408
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,839
There are many calluses on your hands.

409
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,000
Doing business is that hard?

410
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,240
You're either deserters or bandits.

411
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,880
Now, tell me the truth,

412
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,559
and I'll let you go.

413
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,319
Speak!

414
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,480
We're soldiers

415
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,279
from Shanning County.

416
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,440
I heard the Wu Army would invade.

417
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,440
Border was in chaos.

418
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,640
Everyone was saying

419
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,759
that the battle would...

420
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,680
Would start soon.

421
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,039
King Chen is depraved and extravagant.

422
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,880
I'd rather flee than fight for him.

423
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,239
I'll die in a war.

424
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,480
Being a deserter also leads to death.

425
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,119
But at least it's a way to live.

426
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,960
Anyway, I haven't been paid for months.

427
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,480
We all agreed to flee.

428
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,440
Anyway, you don't want

429
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,400
to risk your lives for King Chen?

430
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,200
Exactly.

431
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,440
My wife and children are waiting.

432
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,319
And it's time to farm.

433
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,039
We're unwilling

434
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,880
to die in a war now.

435
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,440
Sure, you are.

436
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,799
Nobody is willing.

437
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,920
Let's go.

438
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,839
Thank you, sir.

439
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,200
Thank you.

440
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,160
Thank you.

441
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,880
We need to hurry.

442
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,359
We're almost there.

443
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,640
How many times have you said that?

444
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,039
Look!

445
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,920
Come on.

446
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,839
I told you
I wouldn't take the wrong way.

447
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,079
Caiyi.

448
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,079
If I rise one day,

449
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,640
don't stab me in the back.

450
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,559
I don't want to die in vain.

451
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,839
Let's go.

452
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:05,376
(Guishan)

453
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,008
(Guishan)

454
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,104
Young Master.

455
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,240
Are you hungry?

456
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,759
Sir,

457
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
are there buns available now?

458
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,400
Sir,

459
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,160
we are from afar.

460
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,160
It's so dark here,

461
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,640
and there's nothing to eat.

462
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,440
Can you make new buns?

463
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,400
The buns are almost sold out.

464
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,960
There are only these three.

465
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,480
I made them this morning.

466
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,279
You decide if you buy them or not.

467
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:24,880
Thank you.

468
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:40,160
You...

469
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,799
Eat this.

470
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,799
Deliver goods?

471
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,880
Yes, we're here to deliver goods.

472
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,039
Thanks.

473
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,480
What does he mean?

474
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,079
I don't know.

475
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,720
But he doesn't look like a beggar.

476
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,359
So, what does he do?

477
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,119
Forget it.

478
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,560
It's so late,

479
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,359
and we're tired.

480
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,839
Find a place to stay.

481
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:24,960
Let's go.

482
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:42,368
(Guishan Inn)

483
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,640
This

484
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,319
is the best inn in Guishan?

485
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,160
This is the only inn in Guishan.

486
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,519
Let's go in.

487
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,720
Sir, three superior rooms.

488
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,279
Adjoining rooms.

489
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,319
All sheets and bedding must be new.

490
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,039
No superior rooms.

491
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,039
No superior rooms?

492
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,119
Then give us

493
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,319
the three best rooms.

494
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Sir, listen,

495
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,559
we are from afar.

496
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,640
We have money.

497
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,000
And we want superior rooms.

498
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,559
There are good rooms.

499
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,880
Do you deserve them?

500
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,119
Rude! Do you know who he is?

501
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,279
I don't care.

502
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:40,799
I'm the boss here.

503
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,880
Sir, we are not here to cause trouble.

504
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,359
We just want to know

505
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,079
how we can get the best room.

506
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,359
You're rich, right?

507
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:49,680
Okay.

508
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,240
Here's a room.

509
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,480
Here's a room.

510
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,560
He just

511
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,799
overcharged us for this room.

512
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:18,960
He's ripping us off.

513
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,719
I'll go reason with him.

514
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,400
Alright.

515
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,519
Don't complicate things.

516
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,799
We are new here.

517
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,160
We need to keep a low profile.

518
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,279
There must be a reason
for his arrogance.

519
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Think about what we're here for.

520
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,079
Your Majesty,

521
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,480
you've changed.

522
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,000
How so?

523
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,880
The old you won't stand it.

524
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,640
Alright.

525
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,440
Go check on Caiyi

526
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,079
in case something happens.

527
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,319
What are you doing?

528
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,799
What?

529
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,759
His Majesty...

530
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,759
Young Master sent me to check on you.

531
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,119
He fears you're hurt by a wolf.

532
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:07,799
But I think even if a wolf comes,

533
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,839
- you'll scare it away.
- You...

534
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,960
Then tell Young Master

535
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,880
that if a wolf comes, just call me.

536
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,360
After all, you're useless.

537
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
I can protect him.

538
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,359
I'm taking off my clothes.

539
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,079
Close the door.

540
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,519
Your Majesty.

541
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,319
Long Qi.

542
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,640
Let's sleep in one bed tonight.

543
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,799
No, that's inappropriate.

544
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,000
I can sleep on the floor.

545
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,400
How about Caiyi?

546
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:42,680
She's quite well.

547
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,039
I feel exhausted.

548
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,839
- Aren't you tired?
- Your Majesty, you rest.

549
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,279
I find this place somewhat eerie.

550
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,440
I'll keep watch tonight.

551
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,279
Yes.

552
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:01,359
This place is indeed strange.

553
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,440
But if you wear yourself out,

554
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,880
who will protect me?

555
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,519
Why are you standing?

556
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,599
Sit down.

557
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,880
Sit.

558
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,039
Your Majesty,

559
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,880
I really think you've changed.

560
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,359
I told you what you should call me.

561
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:32,759
Y-Young Master.

562
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,799
The ministers always said

563
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,519
you were not ambitious

564
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
and not responsible.

565
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,759
Actually, I know you never

566
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,799
avoid your responsibility,

567
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,359
but you can't take it.

568
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,759
You're actually a very gentle person.

569
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,240
You are very kind

570
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,519
and responsible for us all.

571
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,880
But your responsibility is too huge.

572
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
If I were you,

573
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,200
I might not do as well as you.

574
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,160
No,

575
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,360
I didn't mean to rebel...

576
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,119
Alright.

577
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,880
I know.

578
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,920
You never

579
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,960
hit or scolded

580
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,359
your subordinates.

581
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,079
Including the beggar today,

582
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:24,839
you're also kind to him.

583
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,920
I always feel

584
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,839
that in your eyes,

585
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,640
we are all humans.

586
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,480
Of course,

587
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,079
you fool.

588
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,640
You're definitely human.

589
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:37,960
You idiot.

590
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,720
I mean, you've never treated us
as servants.

591
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,680
The girl next door

592
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,279
is an assassin sent
by the Wu State to kill you,

593
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,920
but you are equally kind to her

594
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,880
and truly care about her well-being.

595
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,480
From my point of view,

596
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,319
we are all equal.

597
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,599
You are

598
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,880
responsible for protecting me.

599
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,359
And I just want

600
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,079
to be myself.

601
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,559
Be a good king of the Chen State.

602
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,759
I hope my honey

603
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,599
looks up to me

604
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,079
instead of despising me.

605
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,319
But most importantly,

606
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:16,839
I do not want you all

607
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,640
to die under the swords of the Wu Army.

608
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,759
Grand Tutor once said

609
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,200
that life

610
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:28,896
is like a single season.

611
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,880
Life is very short,

612
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,319
but it can't be lived in vain.

613
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,000
They can kill me,

614
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,759
but if they try to hurt my men,

615
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:43,000
you, my honey,

616
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,359
Grand Tutor Wang,

617

or Caiyi,

619
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,799
I will never let it happen.
