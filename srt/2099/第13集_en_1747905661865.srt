1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The tower on the stairs needs to be cleared.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Old Chao Feng.

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Dasima.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wushen.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Lord Chen.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Old Chao Feng.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This time, we're going to have to rely on you.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm counting on you.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I have some good news.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The Imperial Seal of the Chuang State is going to be auctioned off in Guishan.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's already been sent to the Wujun Township.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Lord Wu will personally come to the town.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But I don't understand why Lord Wu cares so much about this item.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Although it's the Imperial Seal of the Chuang State,

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the Wujun will have the victory.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Dasima.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I won't ask what you shouldn't.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I won't guess what you shouldn't know.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Anyway, the venue is basically finished.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We'll wait for the show to start tomorrow at four o'clock.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thank you, Old Chao Feng.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Lord Chen, you're welcome.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
One more thing.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Dasima, please.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There may be some changes in the auction tomorrow.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So we hope that before Lord Wu enters the venue,

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you can start the auction process

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
until Lord Wu comes to the venue.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There's a word for it.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There's one more item missing.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What is it?

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The Imperial Seal.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's all here.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You can pick whatever you like.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This Guishan is really a rare item.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Your Majesty, the Imperial Seal.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You call this the Imperial Seal?

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You call it the Heart of the Imperial Seal?

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you stupid?

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This one.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This one is a bit like the Heart of the Imperial Seal.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This one.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Leave the rest to me.

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The Chuyue is here.

53
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You brought only one person?

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So arrogant.

55
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't care.

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's better to be so careless.

57
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He's here.

58
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The Imperial Seal

59
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's time.

60
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Thank you for coming to Guishan.

61
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
For many years,

62
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I've searched the world for rare items.

63
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
From the self-portrait of the Ming family to the ancient relics of the Zhenqi,

64
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
everything is rare.

65
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I promise you this time,

66
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
you don't need to do this.

67
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Your Majesty, Your Highness, the security is over.

68
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But this time, I only brought one person.

69
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There are only Chuyue people outside.

70
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No five soldiers.

71
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It shouldn't be.

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But I confirmed that there are no soldiers.

73
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You and Longqi keep watching outside.

74
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Listen to the order.

75
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Clean up the Chuyue people.

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Understood.

77
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The Chuyue people are the top soldiers.

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Whether they are royal family or the bandits,

79
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I only recognize...

80
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Sir, I didn't bring any money.

81
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Second,

82
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
make a decision.

83
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
After confirming the item,

84
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm afraid there's a trap.

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Third,

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
go out and take it.

87
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If the item is worth more than the price,

88
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
let's see if there's any difference.

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He's going to drink.

90
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Drink.

91
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is the world's most precious

92
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and the most important thing

93
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
that the nobles compete for.

94
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The whole country is in danger.

95
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The imperial jade seal.

96
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
They say the imperial jade seal

97
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
is the treasure of the past.

98
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's destined to be in heaven.

99
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's not only durable,

100
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
but also the world's most precious.

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If you don't want to say anything,

102
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
let's start the game.

103
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The price is 1000 taels of silver.

104
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Please,

105
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
get on the horse.

106
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
South, one hand.

107
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
West, one hand.

108
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
North, one hand.

109
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
East, one hand.

110
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
North, one hand.

111
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well LED, one hand.

112
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
A fraction of the trundle piece of solid gold.

113
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Four thousand vilants are Sofia

114
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
as firewood.

115
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Ten thousand innocent people in the Repelling Cr Squ readable in the sky.

116
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,300
Ahhh!

117
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What's wrong?

118
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No more.

119
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Take a rest.

120
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's go.

121
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The moon is out.

122
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,000
After I got this ship,

123
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll light up

124
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and I won't have to work for the rest of my life.

125
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Do you still want to continue?

126
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Old man,

127
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
stop wasting your time.

128
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This time,

129
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
I won't give up.

130
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
It's not up to me to decide.

131
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Can you still play with this man?

132
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You little brat.

133
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Honey,

134
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
what do you think he wants from me?

135
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,000
If I were as rich as him,

136
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I wouldn't be able to play.

137
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
When the time comes,

138
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll buy him a thousand years of peace

139
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
for my uncle.

140
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But you need to rest quickly.

141
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Western Gui Ke,

142
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,500
21 hands.

143
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
One time.

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Your Majesty.

145
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Your Highness.

146
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,000
Chu Yue and Liang Guo have left.

147
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Everything is up to you.

148
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Do it.

149
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Western Gui Ke, 21 hands.

150
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Two times.

151
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,500
Western Gui Ke,

152
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,500
21 hands.

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Three times.

154
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,500
Congratulations, Western Gui Ke.

155
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,000
You have won the national jade seal.

156
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Congratulations, Your Highness.

157
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You have won the national jade seal.

158
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,000
Minister.

159
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Long time no see.

160
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Are you okay?

161
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Your Highness.

162
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Little King of Wus,

163
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
just give up.

164
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,000
Kneel down and beg me.

165
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Maybe I can still keep you safe.

166
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Chen Xiaohua,

167
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,500
do you think you have won the national jade seal?

168
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Actually, we don't have any personal grudges.

169
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,000
It's just that you just died.

170
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
You didn't go back to Wus to keep your filial piety.

171
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And you even invaded our country.

172
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,000
You caused all these things

173
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
to happen today.

174
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
You are the King of Chen, I am the King of Wus.

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,500
It doesn't matter if you have personal grudges or not.

176
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,000
Anyway, it's not about you dying or me dying today.

177
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,000
It's about fate.

178
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't believe in fate.

179
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I have my fate, not the Heaven's.

180
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,000
That's right.

181
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
It's a pity.

182
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
It's you who has your fate, not the Heaven's.

183
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,000
You are still drunk after giving me the seal.

184
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,500
Listen up, everyone.

185
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Whoever kills the King of Wus today

186
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,000
will be rewarded with thousands of taels.

187
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Do it!

188
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
What are you doing?

189
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,000
You want to kill the King of Wus?

190
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Xu Erlang.

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
Xu Erlang, are you going to rebel?

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Minister, the national affairs of Chen have been settled.

193
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,000
Moreover, the whole country is under the control of Zhang's army.

194
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,000
As long as you call out, the country will be called.

195
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Shut up!

196
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
How dare you mention Zhang's army?

197
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Who gave you the guts?

198
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Of course I did.

199
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Brother,

200
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,500
you always said Chen Xiaohua was the problem of the country.

201
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Why don't you use this opportunity to take revenge?

202
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
I have no choice.

203
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I have a mutual affection with Wu Lang.

204
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Come here.

205
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Chen Wu will be a family from now on.

206
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,000
We have already discussed it.

207
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,000
Today, kill Chen Xiaohua

208
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,000
and support your nephew to ascend the throne.

209
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,000
From now on, Chen's power is still in your hands.

210
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,000
A good relationship is lost.

211
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Brother.

212
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Who is your brother?

213
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Let go of me!

214
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,000
Who is your uncle?

215
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,000
You are a dog and a woman.

216
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Let go of me!

217
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Stop!

218
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Stop!

219
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Get down!

220
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,000
Brother, get up.

221
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Brother.

222
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Brother.

223
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
When Chen died,

224
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
all the concubines were buried.

225
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
My aunt was running around.

226
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
She protected me.

227
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,500
And my child.

228
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Brother,

229
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
stand by my side today.

230
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,500
I will protect you like you protected me.

231
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
You still remember?

232
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,000
You still remember?

233
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,000
My family is loyal.

234
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,000
We are loyal to our enemies.

235
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,000
You are not my family.

236
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
Yes!

237
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You never treated me as your family.

238
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,500
I am your sister.

239
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You know I have my own feelings.

240
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
You forced me to marry an old woman.

241
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I hate you!

242
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's not your fault.

243
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
A'Sheng.

244
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
A'Sheng, you killed Chen Xiaohua.

245
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
If it wasn't for our family,

246
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Chen would have died.

247
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
A'Sheng, for Lian'er,

248
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
for the people of Chen,

249
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
our family,

250
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
what's the fault of our family?

251
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What's wrong with our family?

252
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Princess Wu.

253
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Today,

254
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,000
I have made my decision.

255
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,000
I am willing to kill anyone.

256
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,000
I will obey your order.

257
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Mr. Cheng,

258
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,000
it doesn't matter.

259
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,000
The victory or defeat is decided.

260
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,000
I just want to destroy the dust.

261
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
I don't want to be a burden.

262
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Soldiers are fighting for the country.

263
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
They are willing to sacrifice their lives.

264
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
For what?

265
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
For the victory or defeat.

266
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
They can be in the army for three days.

267
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,500
But I promise you today,

268
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I will hold them back.

269
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
I won't let them be the weak people.

270
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't want to be a burden.

271
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,000
You are a soldier.

272
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You know what I am talking about.

273
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But the only thing I can't promise you

274
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,000
is to let him live.

275
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,000
He, Chen Xiaohua, must die.

276
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
I...

277
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
understand.

278
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I...

279
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
will take the jade.

280
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Minister!

281
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,500
You have made up your mind.

282
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
I...

283
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
have made up my mind.

284
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I...

285
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,500
take the jade.

286
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,500
Your Highness,

287
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
please take the jade.

288
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,000
All the ministers,

289
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
return to your posts.

290
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,500
I will take the jade.

291
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The King of Chu killed the King of Chen.

292
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
He will be rewarded with ten thousand taels.

293
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:20,500
All guards,

294
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
go!

295
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Minister!

296
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Minister!

297
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Minister!

298
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Minister!

299
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Minister!

300
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You little thief!

301
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Look carefully!

302
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The real jade is not made of jade.

303
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,000
It is made of gold!

304
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Chen Xiaohua...

305
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,000
What are you waiting for?

306
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,500
The one who killed the King of Chen

307
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
will be rewarded with ten thousand taels.

308
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Go!

309
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Go!

310
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Go!

311
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
I can't do it.

312
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,000
King, you go first.

313
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Go!

314
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Go!

315
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Go!

316
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,500
How dare you to fight with me

317
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,000
with your weak kungfu?

318
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Go!

319
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
No,

320
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
you can't do it again.

321
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Chen Xiaohua,

322
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
you will die.

323
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Be careful!

324
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Go!

325
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You killed my uncle.

326
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,500
You can't kill me.

327
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Oh

328
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
Oh

329
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,360
Yes

330
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Is this poison really effective?

331
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yes.

332
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
This poison is called the Five-Soul Poison.

333
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
As long as you get along with each other,

334
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
you will be buried in six palaces in one hour.

335
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Even if the immortals of the Great Wall come,

336
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
they can't save you.

337
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Thank you.

338
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The Five-Soul Poison

339
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
The Five-Soul Poison

340
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yuan'an,

341
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
when I was seventeen,

342
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
my father came to town.

343
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
When I first saw you,

344
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I was so worried.

345
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I was so worried.

346
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's a pity that I didn't wake up.

347
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I thought about it when I woke up.

348
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I destroyed the city.

349
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I destroyed the city.

350
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I wanted to be with you.

351
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But I was blind.

352
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I was wearing a big dress.

353
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
After a long time,

354
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
we could have been together.

355
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
What do people think of me?

356
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
As long as you and I are together,

357
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
it's good.

358
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Lian'er.

359
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
If there is a next life,

360
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I will be with you.

361
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
The Five-Soul Poison

362
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The Five-Soul Poison

363
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
If there is a next life,

364
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
we will not struggle.

365
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
We will find a beautiful place

366
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
to spend our lives.

367
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The Five-Soul Poison

368
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Interesting.

369
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You are really good at

370
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
taking two or three steps back.

371
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The Five-Soul Poison

372
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The Five-Soul Poison

373
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The Five-Soul Poison

374
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The Five-Soul Poison

375
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
The Five-Soul Poison

376
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
In the recently'll stay兩幼的城 whom I may worry about

377
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,900
I majesty didn't get to see me

378
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
