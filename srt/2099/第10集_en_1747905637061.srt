Hello, welcome to...

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hello, welcome to...

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Today at 2pm, there will be a strong rain.

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Please bring your umbrella with you.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hello, welcome to...

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Is there anything...

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hello, welcome to...

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hello, welcome to...

Hello, welcome to...

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Is there anything...

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hello, welcome to...

Hello, welcome to...

Hello, welcome to...

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hello, welcome to...

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hello, welcome to...

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Is there anything...

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hello, welcome to...

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hello, welcome to...

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hello, welcome to...

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Is there anything...

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hello, welcome to...

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is there anything...

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hello, welcome to...

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Is there anything...

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hello, welcome to...

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Is there anything...

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Is there anything...

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Is there anything...

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
My king, my queen.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I am 14 years old.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I've been in Chen state for 10 years.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
To me,

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Wu State is a place of training.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Chen State is a prison.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Unless I accomplish my mission.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But sometimes I think

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
even if I complete my mission

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
what can I do?

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,240
I'm just a knife in the fog.

66
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,360
I know.

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,800
I met you.

68
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,520
If you want it,

69
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,400
take it.

70
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,160
Aren't you afraid that I'll run away with the bamboo?

71
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,160
You won't.

72
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,680
You can go.

73
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,800
Princess,

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,880
I skipped the explanation.

75
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,800
I know you care about Long Qi.

76
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,080
Go take care of him.

77
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,120
You mean,

78
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,920
you haven't been back for a long time.

79
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
You must be missing home.

80
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,960
Yi,

81
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,480
the war is coming.

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,840
If you don't want to see the result,

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
you should go back.

84
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,160
After being with you for a long time,

85
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,320
I suddenly realized

86
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,480
that my knife was slowly getting blunt.

87
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,520
You made me know

88
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,800
that I'm a person

89
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,840
and I can have friends.

90
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,600
If only time could stop at this moment.

91
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,720
So, in this way,

92
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,160
it doesn't matter which country I'm for.

93
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,240
I'm only for you.

94
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
I'm only for him.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,760
That's enough.

96
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,840
I have no regrets in this life.

97
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
If there's a next life,

98
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,080
I'll be by your side.

99
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,920
You're here.

100
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,360
I'm here.

101
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,720
I'm afraid I'll die here today.

102
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,320
It's okay.

103
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
I'll be with you.

104
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,680
Wang Qi,

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,720
he's in my room.

106
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,080
Kill him.

107
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,800
The world seems to be in a panic.

108
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Who is looking for the answer?

109
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,120
Love and hate are both gentle.

110
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
The past is all empty.

111
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,960
Why are you so close to me?

112
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,840
You want to take advantage of me, right?

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,160
You asked me to see it.

114
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,760
You want to take advantage of me.

115
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,320
The spring water flows into the world.

116
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,600
The sky is too yellow.

117
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,320
Even if the waves are dry and the waves are rough,

118
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,560
it's just a dream.

119
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,520
What do you want to hear?

120
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
You're afraid I'll die here today.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,680
What?

122
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,840
I...

123
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,880
I...

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,280
I'm here to find the answer.

125
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,480
I think you're beautiful.

126
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,120
The past is all empty.

127
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,920
Who is looking for the answer?

128
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Luo Qi!

129
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,000
Luo Qi!

130
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,440
Luo Qi!

131
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,160
Luo Qi!

132
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,640
Luo Qi.

133
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,160
Jia'er.

134
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Long Qing.

135
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Long Qing!

136
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
No matter what magic you know,

137
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
it's a human, it's a demon.

138
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
If I want to hurt King Wu,

139
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
even if I have to live,

140
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
I won't spare you.

141
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
You said you were doing my safety,

142
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
and I was saving you every day.

143
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Do you regret it?

144
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
I never regret it.

145
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
My life is King's.

146
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
I want to kill him.

147
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
I want to kill him!

148
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Your Majesty!

149
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
I want to kill him!

150
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Your Majesty!

151
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
King Chen,

152
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,480
we finally meet.

153
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
I want to kill you!

154
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,480
I want to kill you!

155
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
You are the king of the mountain,

156
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
and you have done a lot of good deeds.

157
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
I don't care about the country anymore.

158
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,480
I only care about my son.

159
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Your Majesty,

160
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
I've read the Book of Life

161
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
for the whole life

162
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
since I was born.

163
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,480
But I didn't see the breakthrough today.

164
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
I died for the country,

165
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
and I'm dead!

166
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Taifu!

167
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Old man,

168
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
see you next time!

169
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
No!

170
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
No!

171
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
I'll fight you.

172
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
You...

173
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Hold on.

174
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
You still don't surrender?

175
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
I'll kill you!

176
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
I still can't hold it in.

177
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
I can't save you.

179
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
No.

180
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
I didn't do it right.

181
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
I was wrong.

182
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
I lost my wife.

183
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
It's okay.

184
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Don't be sad.

185
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
Let go.

186
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
You can't die.

187
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
I can't let you die.

188
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
I didn't do it right.

189
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
I didn't do it right.

192
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
I'm too ashamed to live in this world.

194
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Let go.

195
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
You can't die!

196
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
Do you know, my wife,

197
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
when it was the time of the storm,

198
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
I thought I was awake.

199
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
But when I was about to die,

200
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
I realized

201
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
it was too hard to lie.

202
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
I let you down.

203
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I let you down.

204
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
I killed everyone.

205
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
I regret it.

206
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
I hope

207
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
you remember me in the next life.

208
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
I'm sorry.

209
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
I didn't do it right.

210
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
I was wrong.

211
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
I was wrong.

212
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
I didn't do it right.

213
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
I'm sorry.

214
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
You shouldn't have done it.

224
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
I didn't do it right.

225
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
I told you the first time we met.

226
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
In that world,

227
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
you can't do it.

228
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
If you do it,

229
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
you'll be severely reflected in that world.

230
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
And you'll hurt her.

231
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
In that world,

232
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
I don't remember all of it.

233
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
But you told me

234
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
that I shouldn't have done it.

235
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
But you told me

236
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
that I must protect her.

237
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Because of you,

238
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
her brain nerve repair

239
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
was lost.

240
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
We gave her a golden finger

241
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
to make her life eternal.

242
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
If she loses, she can come back.

243
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
If you do it,

244
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
you'll only hurt her.

245
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Don't forget your purpose

246
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
when you first came in.

247
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
You can only help her change her mind.

248
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
You can't help her.

249
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
I know, Doctor.

250
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
I won't help her again.

251
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
I have to go in again.

252
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
No.

253
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
I don't have much time left for her.

254
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
That's not the reason for you to ruin your body.

255
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
If you go in now,

256
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
she won't come out.

257
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
I can still hold on.

258
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
I have to go in again.

259
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
Tao Zi.

260
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
When you first came in,

261
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
there was a bug in the system.

262
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
I don't mean that I don't want you to go in.

263
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
You broke your own mission.

264
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
You caused a mess

265
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
and a bug appeared.

266
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
So you can't go in if you want to.

267
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
You need to fix the bug.

268
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
It'll take a few days.

269
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Three days.

270
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
You're not the one I'm talking about.

271
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
You're not the one I'm talking about.

272
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Let me out!

273
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
Please choose your role.

274
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Don't waste my time.

275
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
I'll choose...

276
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
I'll choose Romantic Junk.

277
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Okay.

278
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
You can't choose this.

279
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Most people don't have a chance to choose their own life.

280
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
I can't choose you to waste my time.

281
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Let me out!

282
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
We still need to go back to the situation.

284
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
There are many skills.

286
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
We don't have the skill of the General.

287
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
We can't hold the sword.

288
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
But we can hold the pen.

289
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
It's time to go back.

290
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
We can't start the investigation.

291
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Only the Grand Minister has the right to speak.

292
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
I want to fight too.

293
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
But before the army and horses are ready,

294
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
where's the money?

295
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
No!

296
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
Luckily, the enemy hasn't attacked the city yet.

297
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Stop!

298
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Let's go.

299
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Minister of Works Zhang Chang.

301
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Minister of Revenue Li Xuan.

302
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Come out!

303
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

304
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
Where's the army?

305
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
Take them down!

306
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Do you agree?

307
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,480
The taxes in each state are more than 8 million.

308
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
These two adults

309
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
are the nobles of the Lianhe Prefecture.

310
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
They are involved in the corruption

311
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
for the sake of the anti-Han disaster

312
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
and the repair of the royal court.

313
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
They are in charge of the six states

314
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
and the four provinces.

315
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
They are all officials

316
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
and they are all traitors.

317
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
More than half of them are buying land in the five states.

318
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
Most of them are transferred to Hanzhou.

319
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
They will be protected by the Military Commissioner of Hanzhou.

320
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Yulin Army!

321
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Yes, Your Majesty!

322
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Go to the government office and the government office.

323
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Bring all the things with the words back to me.

324
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Yes, Your Majesty!

325
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
Wait!

326
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Eunuch Li?

327
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
No.

328
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
It's a kneeling.

329
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
You should kneel too.

330
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Shut up!

331
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Yulin Army!

332
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Take him out!

333
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Don't move!

334
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Let me go!

335
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Let me go!

336
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
Your Majesty!

337
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
Can I say something?

338
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
Your Majesty!

339
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Enough!

340
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Those who should know

341
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
these things,

342
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
I know them all.

343
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Those who shouldn't know, I know them too.

344
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Now the country is in a crisis.

345
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
The three of them

346
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
are just killing the rooster.

347
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
I hope you all

348
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
know that

349
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
if you participate in the corruption case

350
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
and are involved in the corruption,

351
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
I won't investigate you.

352
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
I can close my eyes and close mine.

353
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
But if you still

354
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
want to question me,

355
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
then don't blame me.

356
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Minister Da,

357
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
let's talk about the rebellion.

358
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Actually, this...

359
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
What Jiang He said...

360
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
I understand.

361
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
No negotiation.

362
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
I'll arrange it and prepare the whole army.

363
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
No.

364
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
The rebellion...

365
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
I have a new solution.

366
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
I'm so handsome.

367
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
So handsome!

368
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
Now,

369
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,480
it's my wife's turn.

370
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
The treasury is empty.

371
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
Everyone knows about it.

372
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
But what you really want to know is

373
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
this year...

374
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
Where's my wife?

375
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
Did I catch her

376
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
without her coming?

377
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Where's my wife?

378
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
I have no idea.

379
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
I'm just a little bit confused.

380
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,480
Let's get out of here.

381
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Go.

382
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Go.

383
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Close the door.

384
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Long Qing,

385
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
is there any smell in the walls?

386
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
It's about jade.

387
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,280
Take the bamboo whip to check outside.

388
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,680
See if there are any clues related to jade.

389
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,280
Okay.

390
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,840
Call him.

391
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,280
Yes.

392
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,120
Wait.

393
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,560
Where's my wife?

394
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,480
I haven't seen her for a long time.

395
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,680
Are you looking for Mrs. Zhen or Mrs. Bao?

396
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,200
Mrs. Xiao.

397
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,760
Who is Mrs. Xiao?

398
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,600
No wonder the doctor said you were a bamboo.

399
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,760
Go, go, go.

400
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,840
Go find something.

401
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,800
Caiyi.

402
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
Who is she?

403
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,480
Wife.

404
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,520
What's going on?

405
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,960
Why is she gone?

406
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Wife.

407
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,720
They're all here.

408
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,120
Where's Mrs. Xiao?

409
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,240
Your Majesty.

410
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm asking you where's Mrs. Xiao?

411
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,920
I don't know.

412
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,080
Your Majesty, who is she?

413
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,440
Who is Mrs. Xiao?

414
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,840
You don't know who Mrs. Xiao is?

415
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,840
You're new here, right?

416
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,320
You don't know the owner of this place.

417
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,680
Your Majesty.

418
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,560
I've been in the palace for years.

419
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,960
This palace has been empty for at least three years.

420
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,240
Enough, wife.

421
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,720
Stop playing.

422
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,680
Isn't it fun to know the truth?

423
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,360
I'm asking you for a serious matter.

424
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,560
Wife.

425
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,560
Wife.

426
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,280
Bao.

427
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,520
Get Yue Lingxuan here.

428
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Your Majesty, where are you going?

429
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,400
Your Majesty.

430
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,680
I've said it before.

431
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,720
I'm not selfish.

432
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,160
I'm just doing my job.

433
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,680
I'm not a maid.

434
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,480
You brought so many soldiers to my mansion last night.

435
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,800
What are you going to do?

436
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,640
What do you mean by what I'm going to do?

437
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,000
What are you going to do?

438
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Where's my wife?

439
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,080
Wife.

440
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,200
Wife.

441
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,880
Come out.

442
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,480
I'll be angry if you don't come out.

443
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,720
You'll be in trouble.

444
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,640
Wife.

445
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,480
Enough.

446
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,520
You don't want to talk?

447
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,120
Wang Qi.

448
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
Let the soldiers go in and search.

449
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,360
You don't understand?

450
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,280
Search.

451
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,000
Wife.

452
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,840
Your Majesty.

453
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,760
There's a rumor out there.

454
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,960
I have a reaction.

455
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,320
They're hoping that we're not a good match.

456
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,840
You searched my mansion this late at night.

457
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,080
If it's spread out, it'll be a big deal.

458
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,360
Da Sima.

459
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,680
I know you're loyal to your country.

460
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,560
You're not a fool.

461
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,560
But my wife is lost.

462
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:30,920
Your Majesty.

463
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,720
We can't let it go.

464
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,160
Your Majesty.

465
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,200
Let's talk in the study.

466
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,720
Okay?

467
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,360
Wife.

468
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,000
Wife.

469
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,240
Wife.

470
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,320
Wife.

471
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,160
Your Majesty.

472
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,680
Your Majesty.

473
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,680
The new military report arrived half an hour ago.

474
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
Now the army of the Wu Army is under pressure.

475
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,200
The King of Wu is ready to fight.

476
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,680
He surrounded the city of Hanzhou and didn't attack.

477
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,600
Your Majesty.

478
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,440
Now the military situation is urgent.

479
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,400
I think the city of Hanzhou will be destroyed sooner or later.

480
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
The military situation is urgent.

481
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,280
Now the danger is imminent.

482
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,000
Your Majesty, don't disturb the morale of the army

483
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,480
because of this mess.

484
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,400
Report.

485
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,960
Your Majesty.

486
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,040
I've searched everywhere.

487
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,600
I didn't see any woman.

488
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,440
Impossible.

489
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,720
There's no one in the palace or at home.

490
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Where can we go?

491
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,800
Your Majesty.

492
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,680
Have you ever heard what I said?

493
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,280
I have.

494
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,120
I've heard everything.

495
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,840
But I want to ask you now.

496
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,920
Where did you hide my wife and daughter?

497
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,920
I don't understand.

498
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,600
But I want to say

499
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,240
that I'm in danger.

500
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,920
Your Majesty, please don't do anything ridiculous.

501
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,920
Da Sima.

502
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,280
I'll ask you one last time.

503
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,000
Where did you hide my wife?

504
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,200
I don't know.

505
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,120
ouse LETTERS

506
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,660
Why was I 스프레 од

507
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:22,840
,

508
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,240
Can it be restored after the system bug?

509
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
It should be fine.

510
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
You're back!

511
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
Honey, you're back.

512
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,840
Why haven't you gone to work yet?

513
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
I'll go to work after you come back.

514
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
Can you hurry up and go to work?

515
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
Don't be late today.

516
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
I'm just watching the night.

517
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,840
Here, close your eyes.

518
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Wait for me.

519
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Don't open them.

520
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Wait for me.

521
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
Don't open them.

522
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Okay, honey.

523
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Open them.

524
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
This is tomato.

525
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
I told you, right?

526
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,840
I'll grow a tomato for you in my life.

527
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,840
You said you liked tomatoes the most when you were a kid.

528
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,840
But you can't find it after you grow up.

529
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,840
So this is the taste of childhood I found for you.

530
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
Why don't you try it?

531
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Try the hard work of your husband these months.

532
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,840
So, you have to work hard every day.

533
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
You have to work hard every day.

534
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,840
I'm not the little girl who can be happy for a tomato.

535
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,840
What I want is a future that can see the future.

536
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
I want a sense of security.

537
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Are you really going to be fired?

538
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,840
And then I'm going to support this family by myself?

539
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Are you not going to be satisfied with what I do now?

540
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840
What kind of life do you want?

541
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
Can you think about me?

542
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
I need someone who can fight with me.

543
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Not a poor man who just wants to lie down every day.

544
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
I'm poor?

545
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,840
Then tell you what, even if I don't know my job, I'm a full-time employee.

546
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
How much can I make?

547
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
I, Chunxiao Hua, really don't work hard.

548
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
But why do I come back to the roots?

549
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Because I can't change the situation at all.

550
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Can I buy a house if I work hard?

551
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
I can't buy it.

552
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
You said it's suitable for a long-distance house.

553
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
I can't do it.

554
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,840
The inspection of the house continues to have a struggle.

555
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
It may cause a violent dispute.

556
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
Shut up.

557
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,840
The inspection of the house continues to have a struggle.

558
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Shut up.

559
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
I think this kind of struggle is particularly meaningless.

560
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,840
In short, I have to leave this flat through my own efforts.

561
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
You cried in the past.

562
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Yes, you work hard.

563
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
You worked hard, how much did you earn?

564
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
I tell you this, I forget it.

565
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
The salary of the two of us together,

566
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
I want to move out of here for fifty years.

567
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Is it worth it?

568
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,840
Have you ever seen your own report last month?

569
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
Look at me.

570
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840
You don't know how your body is.

571
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Aren't you afraid of making this money?

572
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
Enough, enough.

573
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
I have said many times,

574
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
Health comes first, health comes first, body comes first.

575
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
Did you hear me?

576
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Stop talking.

577
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
In short, if you can't work hard with me,

578
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
break up with me.

579
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,840
Break up, break up, break up again.

580
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Is it called breaking up?

581
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,840
The inspection of the house continues to have a struggle.

582
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Do you know why I am late every time?

583
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840
Every time you go to the evening class, I go to the morning class.

584
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Do I have time to accompany you?

585
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
I want to accompany you for a while, I am wrong.

586
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
I am wrong.

587
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
It's my fault, it's all my fault.

588
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,840
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

589
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
The inspection of the house has a serious injury.

590
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
We are calling the medical department.

591
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
To restore the work of preventing rescue.

592
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Please don't go out unless necessary.

593
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Don't go out.

594
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
Chen Caohua.

595
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
Chen Caohua.

596
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
Chen Caohua.

597
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
Your family is not good either.

598
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
It's you.

599
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:48,980
It's the result of the

600
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,340
repetition of the

601
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
happiness.

602
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Your smile has not appeared recently.

603
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
You have big eyes.

604
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,840
You know the name of the picture.

605
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,840
How much I hope you are here.

606
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,840
The way you and I exist

607
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,840
and the lost story

608
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,840
are not far away for you.

609
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:27,840
I am willing to enjoy every day like this.

610
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,840
I imagine we have a lot of dreams tomorrow.

611
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
Wife, where are you?

612
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Why did they all lie to me?

613
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
I said I didn't know you.

614
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,840
For you, I am willing to do anything.

615
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,840
For you, I want Chen Caohua to become strong.

616
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Defeat the Five Kingdoms.

617
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Then, I will accompany you to live a long life.

618
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
You can't die.

619
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
I can't let you die.

620
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
I didn't do it.

621
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
I let you down.

622
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,840
I don't have the courage to live in this world.

623
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
You know the name of the picture.

624
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,840
How much I hope you are here.

625
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,840
The way you and I exist

626
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,840
and the lost story

627
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:52,840
are not far away for you.

628
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:22,840
I am willing to enjoy every day like this.

629
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,840
I imagine we have a lot of dreams tomorrow.

630
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:35,840
I am used to the many years you have given me.

631
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,840
What do I have to end it with?

632
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:48,840
I am willing to accompany you to live a long life like this.

633
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,840
I want to be with you forever.

634
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:02,840
I want to be with you forever.

635
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,840
Even if we meet again,

636
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,840
give me ten thousand choices.

637
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Or do I have to be the one to follow the rules?

638
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,840
I want to be with you forever.

639
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,840
Even if we meet again,

640
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,840
give me ten thousand choices.

641
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Or do I have to be the one to follow the rules?

642
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:01,840
I want to be with you forever.
