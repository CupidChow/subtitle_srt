1
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,640
Delicious, isn't it?

2
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,920
It has a filling.

3
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,359
Rookie Chen Xiaohua.

4
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,279
You ate my cookies.

5
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,599
So, you're mine now.

6
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,239
If they bully you again,

7
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,239
just tell me.

8
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,079
Tell you?

9
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,319
Can you beat them?

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,680
They're taller than you.

11
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,159
They're good at fighting.

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,959
Anyway, I'll protect you.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,879
You protect me?

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,239
When I grow up,

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,519
I'll buy you lots of cookies.

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,239
But cookies aren't my favorite.

17
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,719
What's your favorite?

18
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,120
I like cherry tomatoes the most.

19
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,640
But the director and the teachers said

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,560
fruits are very expensive now,

21
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,200
and our orphanage can't afford them.

22
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,480
When I earn money,

23
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,040
I'll buy them for you.

24
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,120
Tao.

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,920
Have you ever had cake?

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,799
Can everyone eat cake

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,879
on their birthday?

28
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,200
The director only makes noodles

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,719
with one poached egg for us.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,080
When is your birthday?

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,439
I'm not sure.

32
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,919
I know it's in the summer.

33
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,159
The director said

34
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,960
I was born when the peaches were ripe,

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,919
so she named me Tao.

36
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,864
=Episode 16=
(What is Love?)

37
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
This physician is skilled in witchcraft.

38
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,199
It's too mystical,

39
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,240
so other physicians don't like him.

40
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,439
Indeed, it's mystical.

41
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,160
He's like a charlatan.

42
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:04,879
Honey.

43
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,480
Honey.

44
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,560
Honey.

45
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,120
Honey.

46
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,439
She's awake.

47
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,240
She's awake.

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,600
Honey.

49
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,480
Honey.

50
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,839
Honey.

51
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,759
Honey?

52
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,040
Well...

53
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,879
Your Majesty.

54
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,920
I can confirm that Lady Xiao is not ill.

55
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,959
It's that two of the three souls
are absent.

56
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,879
I've tried calling her souls back.

57
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,720
Unfortunately, I failed.

58
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,560
It's as if she's not
in this world at all.

59
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,360
It's beyond my power

60
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,160
to change it.

61
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,959
But is there no other way?

62
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,480
Your Majesty.

63
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,680
No more acupuncture.

64
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,519
No need to feed her decoctions either.

65
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,879
It's useless.

66
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,040
Your Majesty.

67
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,120
Do what he said.

68
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,920
Don't

69
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,120
feed her decoctions again.

70
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,879
You haven't rested for a long time.

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,920
Go back and rest.

72
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,519
Your Majesty, we're fine.

73
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,720
Allow us to stay.

74
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,399
Go back.

75
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,759
Only after you've rested
can you take my place.

76
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,199
Caiyi.

77
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,720
What exactly is it, Rookie?

78
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,560
Abracadabra.

79
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,800
It's a tomato cake.

80
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,000
Where did you get it?

81
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,759
I saved some money

82
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,279
to buy some materials.

83
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,519
Wait a moment.

84
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,439
On a birthday,
it's not just about eating cake.

85
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,360
You also blow out candles
and make a wish.

86
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,679
Master, it's time for your medication.

87
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,439
The medication is ready for you.

88
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,000
Please do not miss the medication.

89
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,279
Today is our one-year anniversary.

90
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,360
Sure, that's why I chose this place.

91
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,639
But to be precise,
it's not a one-year anniversary.

92
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,120
With the previous 15 years

93
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
added together,

94
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,559
it marks 16 years.

95
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,799

00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,880
I heard the Grand Marshal
and the Dowager

111
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,480
died for His Majesty.

112
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,879
That's not right.

113
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,559
After His Majesty came back,

114
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,360
he never mentioned it.

115
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,360
Yes.

116
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,879
Isn't His Majesty wary
of the Zhang family?

117
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,799
You're totally wrong.

118
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,240
The Zhang family is loyal.

119
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,679
They've dedicated themselves
to our state.

120
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,759
His Majesty trusts them.

121
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,039
How did the Dowager
get involved in this?

122
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,519
If they've made sacrifices,

123
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,200
why hasn't His Majesty showed up?

124
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,399
Mind your words before the deceased.

125
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,960
His Majesty is busy with state affairs.

126
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,159
He will come soon.

127
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,039
His Majesty has arrived.

128
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,879
Greetings, Your Majesty.

129
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:18,208
(Grand Marshal's Memorial Tablet)

130
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,840
Your Majesty.

131
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,759
You are the ruler,

132
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,519
and Grand Marshal was your subject.

133
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,679
You don't have to.

134
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,159
I do.

135
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,279
I'm kneeling

136
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,919
to an elder.

137
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,879
Listen up.

138
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:19,120
Grand Marshal,
the general of Chen State,

139
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,919
(was a brave fighter.)

140
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:25,279
(He defended Chen State
against foreign invaders for decades.)

141
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,480
A few days ago, the Dowager

142
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,440
(and the Grand Marshal died for me)

143
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
(in Guishan.)

144
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Today, the Grand Marshal is posthumously
honored as General Pingdong

145
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,759
and Duke of Honor.

146
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,039
(His posthumous name is Zhongwu.)

147
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,320
To be honored
in the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

148
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,720
Your Majesty is wise.

149
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,600
Wu De, the new king,
declared at his enthronement ceremony

150
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,000
that he'd seize our state
and kill Your Majesty

151
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,159
to avenge his brother.

152
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,440
Where has King Wu reached now?

153
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,360
Kangzhou.

154
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,760
In such a critical time,

155
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Grand Tutor,

156
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,840
please ask His Majesty
to return to court.

157
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,639
We beg His Majesty to attend the court.

158
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:19,960
Yes, Grand Tutor.

159
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,679
His Majesty is concerned
about Lady Xiao's illness.

160
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,679
Moreover, now,

161
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,799
the entire country is in danger.

162
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,319
We hope His Majesty
will prioritize state affairs.

163
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,600
I'm taking charge of the court
in His Majesty's stead for now.

164
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,919
I'll persuade His Majesty.

165
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,720
Give the order.

166
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,079
Chenzhou's army marches swiftly
into Kangzhou.

167
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:39,960
Yes.

168
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,159
I will also report

169
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,479
to His Majesty about other matters

170
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,159
to let His Majesty make the decision.

171
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,880
I know what you are all thinking.

172
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,440
Since His Majesty sat on the throne,

173
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,799
he's been somewhat eccentric.

174
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,120
But His Majesty killed King Wu
and fought against corruption.

175
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,159
Those are important, great deeds.

176
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,840
His Majesty and Lady Xiao
have a deep affection for each other.

177
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,559
Everyone,
please give His Majesty more time.

178
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,519
Court dismissed!

179
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,360
Your Majesty, take a rest.

180
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,040
It's been so long since you've slept.

181
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,039
You must be exhausted.

182
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,440
Your Majesty.

183
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,039
Her Grace is in a coma
most of the time now.

184
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,320
So, you rest for a while.

185
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,879
We'll watch her.

186
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,320
I'm fine.

187
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,360
I just hope she can see me
as soon as she opens her eyes.

188
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,559
Don't worry. I'm here.

189
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,679
I will inform you
as soon as she wakes up.

190
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,519
Your Majesty.

191
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,679
You won't want Her Grace
to see you lying in bed as well

192
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,720
after she wakes up, right?

193
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,559
Alright.

194
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,360
Be careful.

195
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,799
Don't worry.

196
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,679
Why are you here?

197
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
You rest. I'll take your place.

198
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,160
No worries,
keeping watch is a delicate job.

199
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,599
I'm afraid you can't do it.

200
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,840
Stop trying to be tough.

201
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,440
You've had a cold for days.

202
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,599
Don't be so stubborn.

203
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm really okay.

204
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,399
Your Majesty.

205
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,159
Stop arguing.

206
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,279
You both go back.

207
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,799
But...

208
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,080
No buts.

209
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,399
Get some good sleep.

210
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,879
Then you replace me.

211
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:32,440
Your Majesty,

212
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,199
you rest.

213
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,840
Enough.

214
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:34,719
Say no more.

215
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,559
Your Majesty!

216
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,240
Your Majesty.

217
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,480
The Grand Tutor is here.

218
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:42,200
Let him in.

219
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,080
Yes.

220
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,559
Your Majesty, I'm sorry
for disturbing you late at night.

221
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,480
It is very urgent.

222
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,880
The new message says

223
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,639
Wu De leads the troops into battle.

224
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Kangzhou has fallen.

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,679
Chenzhou's troops have
been massacred in Kangzhou.

226
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,400
Now, everyone

227
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,880
eagerly awaits Your Majesty's return

228
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,079
to boost the morale

229
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,279
of the soldiers again.

230
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
I didn't expect
that after killing Wu Liang,

231
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,319
another war

232
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,960
would break out so quickly.

233
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,880
There's one more thing,

234
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,640
which I believe is also very urgent.

235
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,480
I know.

236
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,160
It's about producing an heir?

237
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,640
Your Majesty is wise.

238
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,880
Where there's life,

239
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,400
there's hope.

240
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,880
Shaozhou can hold on
for a few more days,

241
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,479
but it will also fall before long.

242
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,360
The Wu Army is coming on fiercely

243
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,600
for revenge.

244
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,239
I am concerned...

245
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,279
You fear King Wu might kill me,

246
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,640
and I have no heir.

247
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,200
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

248
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:58,840
I'm also worried

249
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,000
about Lady Xiao.

250
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,039
But you have more important things
to worry about.

251
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,000
I have my own decision

252
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,039
about that.

253
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,039
I'll attend tomorrow's court

254
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,240
on time.

255
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,160
Don't worry about me.

256
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,720
You may leave.

257
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,519
- Your Majesty.
- Leave now.

258
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,640
Your Majesty, Bao'er and I mean no harm.

259
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,519
We just want to stay here

260
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,039
with you and Xiao'er.

261
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,519
Your Majesty, let us stay here.

262
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,240
We won't bother you.

263
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,960
If you don't want to talk,

264
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,720
Bao'er and I will be quiet.

265
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,880
If Your Majesty is worried
about the battle,

266
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,759
Bao'er and I might help.

267
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,120
After all, we learned

268
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,839
military strategy
from the Grand Marshal.

269
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,680
It's cold outside.

270
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,440
Please come in.

271
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,880
(Your Majesty.
All good physicians have examined her.)

272
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,079
(However, Lady Xiao...)

273
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,200
(Your Majesty.)

274
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,160
Wu De leads the troops into battle.

275
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,120
Now, everyone

276
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,480
eagerly awaits Your Majesty's return.

277
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,319
Please confirm if you
disable the infinite rebirth mode.

278
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,239
The infinite rebirth mode
has been disabled.

279
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,959
After player number 001 dies,

280
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,119
the system will automatically shut down.

281
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,200
Honey.

282
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:48,680
If this is

283
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,039
the only way to save you,

284
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,480
I am willing

285
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,319
to give it a try.

286
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:08,799
Your Majesty.

287
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,039
Your Majesty!

288
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,119
Your Majesty.

289
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,200
What's going on here?

290
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,720
Your Majesty, why did you intend
to kill yourself?

291
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:32,599
I know you don't like Zhen'er or me.

292
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,239
Whatever Grand Tutor Wang said,

293
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,480
you can simply ignore it.

294
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

295
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,999
Though Bao'er and I
can't relieve your worries,

296
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,559
we will not cause you any trouble.

297
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,279
If you trust us,

298
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,239
Bao'er and I,

299
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,319
Long Qi, and Caiyi

300
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:48,519
will help you take care of Xiao'er.

301
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

302
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,400
You must live.

303
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,480
Her Grace will wake up.

304
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,319
Certainly.

305
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:57,640
(Where is my lady?)

306
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,599
I haven't seen her for so long.

307
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Are you looking for Lady Zhen
or Lady Bao?

308
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,400
I mean Lady Xiao.

309
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,799
Who is Lady Xiao?

310
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,880
I don't know who you're asking about.

311
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,319
I don't know Lady Xiao.

312
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,240
You don't know who Lady Xiao is?

313
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,119
Your Majesty, I've served
in the palace for several years.

314
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,839
This place has been empty
for at least three years.

315
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
(I can't die.)

316
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,839
(What if she comes back to life
right after I die?)

317
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,920
(What if I kill myself)

318
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,920
(and reincarnate into a world
without Xiao'er?)

319
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,599
I can't die.

320
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:38,559
Your Majesty.

321
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,839
I know with the Wu Army's attack,

322
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,519
you are under

323
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:44,880
great pressure.

324
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,759
Your Majesty.

325
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,120
You know

326
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,160
why Her Grace

327
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,119
did it all.

328
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,600
Now the Wu Army is attacking,

329
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,519
yet you're thinking of dying
as an escape.

330
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,400
Dying is easy.

331
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,279
But is this what she wants to see?

332
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I really can't die.

333
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
I don't want to die.

334
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,279
Why are you all looking at me like that?

335
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,880
It's quite scary.

336
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,720
Long Qi, prepare clothes for me.

337
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,119
You two prepare food for me.

338
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,200
I'm hungry.

339
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,920
Long Qi, you stay.

340
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,160
The rest of you, go back and rest.

341
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,360
Caiyi, make the arrangements

342
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,400
to take care of her.

343
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,279
Tomorrow, I'll attend the court.

344
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,039
Yes.

345
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,799
Sir.

346
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,000
Get me some buns.

347
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,240
I'll eat some here

348
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,200
and take the rest.

349
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,759
You're up really early.

350
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,359
The buns aren't ready yet.

351
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,400
They'll be ready soon.

352
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,359
Please wait a moment.

353
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,079
The first tray of buns is almost ready.

354
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,319
You have been busy for at least an hour.

355
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,999
Isn't life just like this?

356
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:33,719
There are people

357
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,400
who get up earlier
and work harder than you.

358
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,039
I'm doing it all for a better life.

359
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,799
I have to work hard.

360
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,600
But what if you work hard

361
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,480
in vain?

362
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:47,680
I don't know what will happen.

363
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,720
The key is that I won't regret
if I've tried,

364
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,799
right?

365
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,479
Oh right.

366
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,559
I'll go get the buns.

367
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,680
Your buns.
The soy milk will be here soon.

368
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,199
Sir, two trays of buns

369
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:02,880
and soy milk.

370
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,519
Coming.

371
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,119
The same.

372
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,400
Okay, please sit.

373
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,400
I just came back from the west.

374
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,880
I found that our state
is getting better and better.

375
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,720
People don't lock their doors at night.

376
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,200
At least, it's become safer.

377
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,600
It indicates good governance.

378
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,600
So it's true.

379
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,199
Our new king

380
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,080
is not as ignorant as rumored.

381
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,999
I know.

382
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,400
I heard the Warrioress

383
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,200
was moved by our king

384
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:32,199
and married him.

385
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,759
Warrioress? Really?

386
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,519
Yes.

387
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,119
With our good king

388
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,480
and the Warrioress,

389
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:38,999
if the Wu Army dares

390
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:39,920
to come,

391
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,119
we will beat them all.

392
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:45,400
As long as our king is with us,

393
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,400
we fear nothing.

394
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,199
No matter what,

395
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,479
we will repel the enemy.

396
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,440
Exactly.

397
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,840
We common folks

398
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,360
just want to live a stable life

399
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,680
and have enough food to eat.

400
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,079
I heard the price of rice dropped
by 20 percent yesterday.

401
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,360
It's said that our new king
used the confiscated money

402
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,640
to stabilize the prices.

403
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,320
We have such a good king.

404
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,920
Our future lives will

405
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
become better.

406
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,559
Indeed.

407
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,759
It's so much.

408
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,359
Your Majesty.

409
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,000
The Wu Army has crossed the border.

410
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,440
After Kangzhou fell,

411
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,759
the Wu Army looted and burned Kangzhou.

412
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,400
Then they proceeded to Shaozhou.

413
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,440
Wu State is attacking us

414
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,559
with the secret help
from the states of Chu and Yue.

415
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,400
