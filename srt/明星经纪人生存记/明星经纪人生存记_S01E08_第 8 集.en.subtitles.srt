1
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,952
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,746
GRANTOR: KANG GYUNG-OK

3
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,915
EPISODE 8

4
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,053
So from now on, he's our president?

5
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,555
In name only.

6
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,515
He'll be in the US often for business.

7
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,934
Who's that next to him?

8
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,312
-His secretary?
-I'm not sure.

9
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:07,317
Why is she wearing sunglasses
when she's indoors?

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,943
-She looks cool.
-Plastic surgery?

11
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,743
GRANTEE: KOO HAE-JUN

12
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,046
Holding 60 percent of the share,

13
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,299
Mr. Koo is now officially
the majority shareholder of Method.

14
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,471
Congratulations.

15
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,056
Thank you.

16
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,229
Hello.

17
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:48,691
I'm the new president
of Method Entertainment, Koo Hae-jun.

18
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,612
I'm sure you've all
searched my name already.

19
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,908
My old friend who introduced Method to me,

20
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,576
Ms. Chun Je-suk.

21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,328
-Chun Je-suk?
-Je-suk?

22
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,247
-Je-suk?
-Oh, right.

23
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,290
You changed your name.

24
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,503
I'd like to express my thanks
to Ms. Chun Jane.

25
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,088
Now tell me.

26
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,842
What's an app developer doing here?

27
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,845
That's right.
I don't know what being an agent entails.

28
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:21,432
So I'm planning on leaving that job
entirely to the veterans here.

29
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,143
However,

30
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,521
the principles of business management
are the same everywhere.

31
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,690
Efficiency.

32
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,651
To maximize everyone's potential

33
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,820
and increase the company's profits.

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,238
That's right.

35
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,576
Now I'm here, it's only a matter of time
until you become the best in the industry.

36
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,618
Why?

37
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,122
Because I'm going to make
this company the best.

38
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,041
Sunny.

39
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,545
This is Sunny Lim.

40
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,464
She will be the manager
of our Strategic Planning Team.

41
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,138
Strategic Planning Team?
Did we have such a department?

42
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,933
I'll update you on the team's policy
and manuals later.

43
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,814
PRESIDENT KOO HAE-JUN

44
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,233
It's the first time I'm hearing
about this new team.

45
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,402
Of course. I formed it this morning.

46
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,864
How could you form a new team
without discussing it with us?

47
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:22,118
Am I not allowed to form a team
in my own company?

48
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,336
Kim So-hyun and Son Jun-ho.

49
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,629
What happened to them?

50
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,214
They left before their contract ended.
Is that okay?

51
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,799
We tried to help them make up,

52
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,260
but it only led to misunderstandings.

53
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,803
And Cho Gi-bong approached them.

54
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,348
-Who's Cho Gi-bong?
-The president of Star Media.

55
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,559
We warned him to stay away,
and he did this to get back at us.

56
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,230
Are you going to just
watch him do that then?

57
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,399
Hasn't he done a lot of wrongdoing?
Why don't we let it slip?

58
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,611
We could also boycott their actors,
risking some side effects.

59
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,029
What if we do the same?

60
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,822
There.

61
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,283
Kim Ji-hoon.

62
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,327
Let's poach him from Star Media.

63
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,957
You may not be familiar

64
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,376
but you can't just poach actors like that.

65
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,835
There are contracts and--

66
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,879
Actually, his contract is almost over.

67
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,674
After he lost the part
in Writer Lee Eun-suk's new drama,

68
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,175
he's on bad terms with them.

69
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,887
But I'm sure others have contacted him,
including foreign agencies,

70
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,806
especially after Money Heist: Korea.

71
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,182
That sounds great.

72
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,768
Let's bring him.

73
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,314
Seeing he's on top of their website,
he must be the most popular one.

74
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,276
We should've contacted him already then.
It's too late now.

75
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,487
Gosh, you keep saying we can't do this
and that. It's annoying me.

76
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,115
What if they steal our actors again?

77
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,866
Will we just sit back and watch?

78
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,910
Let's bring in Kim Ji-hoon.

79
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,329
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

80
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,331
Why did you bring a jerk like that?

81
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,126
Well, I couldn't just watch
the company get ruined.

82
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,712
This wouldn't have happened
if you didn't lose our clients.

83
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,213
Who's the one that flirted
with the tax guy?

84
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,756
Why would you bring that up?

85
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,092
That tax investigation
was inevitable anyway.

86
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,218
Is everything my fault?

87
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,304
Are you going to blame me
for separating your wife too?

88
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,555
-What?
-Am I wrong?

89
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,390
-No, wait!
- Seriously!

90
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,517
-Stop, both of you.
-Watch your blood pressure.

91
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,102
Gosh.

92
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,856
Fine. I'll bring Kim Ji-hoon. I will.

93
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,107
Will that do?

94
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,443
-Gosh.
-You heard me.

95
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,486
Collect everything you can on Kim Ji-hoon.

96
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,572
His family, friends, hobbies, everything.

97
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,823
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

98
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,825
Move.

99
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,788
KANG HEE-SUN

100
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,750
Ms. Kang Hee-sun, come on in.

101
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,341
Hello, I'm Kang Hee-sun.

102
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,926
The one who threw the bag at me.

103
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,431
Let me take your bag.

104
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,312
I'm really sorry about what happened then.

105
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,022
We're running late. Let's begin.

106
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,025
Wait. I have a question.

107
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,236
According to the description,
the character is a sexy and cool woman--

108
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,238
It's freestyle. Perform as you'd like.

109
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,782
Okay.

110
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,621
Sir.

111
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,040
Why don't you
ever wear the tie I gave you?

112
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,625
-I--
-Too boring.

113
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:23,299
She's a secretary flirting with her boss
for a promotion using her sexy charms.

114
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,718
But I don't feel anything.

115
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,637
How strange.

116
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,806
I thought you'd be perfect for this part.

117
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,890
Pardon?

118
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,558
What are you talking about?

119
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,144
I know everything, so don't play innocent.

120
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,855
I heard you and Mr. Kim were dating.

121
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,566
I thought
your hands-on experience would help,

122
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,111
but I guess
you just don't have the acting skills.

123
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,446
Ms. Kang.

124
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,615
Don't try to perform.

125
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,451
Do what you normally do.

126
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,246
Show me what you've been doing
with Mr. Kim.

127
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,793
Exactly. There you go. Let's start over.

128
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,802
WILL KIM JI-HOON BE
ON LEE EUN-SUK'S NEXT BIG SHOW?

129
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,345
KIM JI-HOON IS THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE…

130
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,685
Hello, sir.
You seemed busy, so I left a message.

131
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,061
How have you been?

132
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,358
I just wanted to ask you something.

133
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,529
Have you contacted Kim Ji-hoon
for a Japanese movie…

134
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,283
Yes.

135
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,703
Director Matsumoto?

136
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,754
Son Jun-ho isn't working with us anymore.

137
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,840
I don't know his agent's number.

138
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,966
Bye.

139
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,094
Darn it.

140
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,182
Are you sure you don't
want to see the doctor again?

141
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,101
He always says the same thing.

142
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,062
Anyone can advise to sleep well and relax.

143
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,275
You might be in big trouble
next time you collapse like that.

144
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,779
I know a really good person…

145
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,822
I said I'm good.

146
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,824
I'm talking about a shaman, not a doctor.

147
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,578
This shaman just got their powers,
so the shaman is really good.

148
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,748
In times like these
when you suffer constant misfortune,

149
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,999
an exorcism can help.

150
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,543
Just give me the contract.

151
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,297
I knew you wouldn't have time,
so I went to the shaman for you.

152
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,298
CONTRACT

153
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,676
Keep this on your desk.

154
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,553
And this one…

155
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,097
to carry wherever you go.

156
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,110
What era is she living in?

157
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,113
Jeez.

158
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,185
On the desk…

159
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,533
Why is that thing here?

160
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,243
No idea. What are you doing…

161
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,161
Could you move it a bit to the right?

162
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,122
Thank you.

163
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,465
Me?

164
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,761
-Am I Ms. Yoo?
-Choi Mi-seon, the AK News reporter.

165
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,762
I need her contact.

166
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,930
Have we…

167
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,016
spoken before?

168
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,818
I was just asking you a favor.

169
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,237
But I didn't sound very polite, did I?

170
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,910
Please be understanding.

171
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,537
Hello.

172
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,789
-Hey.
-Hi.

173
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,166
-Hi, Hyun-joo.
-Hi.

174
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,590
Director Lee Chang is filming a new movie,

175
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,510
and he said he wanted to meet you.
He may give you the grandson part.

176
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,470
Thanks.

177
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,435
How's Dad doing?

178
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,735
He passed out recently.

179
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,778
What?

180
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,447
He was overworked and stressed.

181
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,907
He went for medical checkups,

182
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,950
but he didn't have any health issues.

183
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,413
-Why don't you go see him?
-I don't think I'm ready yet.

184
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,084
Let me know if something happens to him.

185
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,893
Damn it.

186
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,897
Hee-sun, is everything all right?

187
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,651
Don't worry.
There will be other auditions.

188
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,821
Excuse me.

189
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,449
Yes, Director.

190
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,160
What kind of a crazy bitch is she?

191
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,539
-What do you--
-My nose is broken

192
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,582
-and I have a concussion.
-What?

193
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,793
I won't let this slide.

194
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,211
That crazy thing…

195
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,213
What? "Thing"? I'm not an object!

196
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,756
You're a lame director anyway!

197
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,591
I should've stitched your mouth shut.

198
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,343
Sorry, ma'am.

199
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,470
-No, that's not it.
-Are you apologizing to that lady?

200
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,472
Do you know what she said to me?

201
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,269
She said she got parts on the
casting couch. How can she say that?

202
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,188
Calm down. They have the high ground now.

203
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,441
She used actual abuse
against verbal abuse.

204
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:17,111
Don't let them upset you.
It'll only make them more aggressive.

205
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:21,282
I've seen Hee-sun with you,
and she does cross the line sometimes.

206
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,492
You don't have the right to say that.

207
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,453
Mr. Kim, this is your fault too.

208
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,456
You can't just push her
into every audition. It seems suspicious.

209
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,790
The part didn't even suit her.

210
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,335
New actors can't afford to be picky.
They've got to do anything they can.

211
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,213
So you're saying,

212
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,884
Ms. Kang Hee-sun, our receptionist,

213
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,594
signed a contract as an actress,

214
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,723
and she has a crush on her agent, Mr. Kim?

215
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,849
-No.
-Yes.

216
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,439
Change her agent.

217
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,607
What?

218
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,527
Leave her to the junior agents.

219
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,364
So you can focus
on something more productive.

220
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,744
Don't waste your time
on an unknown actress.

221
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,004
Who does he think he is
changing her agent?

222
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,756
Plus, I'm not wasting my time.

223
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,633
To be honest, he's kind of right.

224
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,761
-What?
-This is better for Hee-sun too.

225
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,181
Even if she becomes successful,
they'll say she manipulated her agent.

226
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,310
Actresses that get into scandals
with their agents are criticized brutally.

227
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,603
You already know that.

228
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,775
-Do you really have no feelings for her?
-I told you I don't.

229
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,486
Then tell her you're not interested.
That's the right thing to do.

230
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:47,493
I wanted to make her successful myself.

231
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,703
I bet she'll be upset.

232
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,874
She seemed to really like me.

233
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,004
Why did it have to be me?

234
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,176
Where did she go again?

235
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,063
Thank you.

236
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,148
Yes?

237
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,817
So, you already went home.

238
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,612
Okay.

239
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,989
See you tomorrow.

240
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,073
Bye.

241
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,221
Here.

242
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:35,017
I found some things
on Reporter Choi Mi-seon.

243
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,394
Thank you.

244
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,356
Everyone here is nice.

245
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,983
They're just uneasy
adjusting to new things.

246
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,404
I'm sure they'll open up to you soon,
so don't be too concerned.

247
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,365
Okay.

248
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,660
Also, this.

249
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,454
It seemed like you skipped dinner.

250
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,043
I'll get going then.

251
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,586
Wait.

252
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,756
We happen to be the same age,

253
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,508
can we just talk casually?

254
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,721
I was away from Korea for ten years,
so I have no friends.

255
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,683
All right, then.

256
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,394
I guess when it's just the two of us.

257
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,035
All right.

258
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,871
Guys, try this.

259
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,542
It's made of coffee,

260
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,837
so it works wonders
when you want to stay awake.

261
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,135
This is nice.

262
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,680
Is it nice? Comfortable?

263
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,390
No, sit. Sit down.

264
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,391
Sit!

265
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,977
Guys.

266
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,313
When I said
I wanted information on Kim Ji-hoon,

267
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,065
I meant new information.

268
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,900
These were all from variety shows!

269
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,527
That's the best we could do.

270
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,988
It's not like we have a spy in Star Media.

271
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,117
How about we hire a private detective?
I know someone. I can call…

272
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,703
Why don't we just meet him in person?

273
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,872
Maybe we can convince him--

274
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,957
If that was possible,
Would I be doing this?

275
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,461
He's ignoring all calls from every agency.

276
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,381
We can't rush him in this situation.
Think of a natural way.

277
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,718
He works out at a gym in Seongsu-dong.

278
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,387
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

279
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,348
Someone I know said
he's been going there since last week.

280
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,267
The gym is open only to its members…

281
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,265
One, two.

282
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,977
-But he's working out so hard.
-Now's the time.

283
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,604
Keep hitting it.

284
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,814
One, two.

285
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,482
One, two, three.

286
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,778
-This one's too hard.
-Try this one.

287
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,698
Ji-hoon? Aren't you Actor Kim Ji-hoon?

288
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,034
Hi. Do you remember me?

289
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,911
We met at a wrap party.

290
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,247
I'm Chun Jane of Method Entertainment.

291
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,957
-Hello.
-Hello.

292
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,335
Can I talk to you for a second?

293
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,968
Barging into the gym where I work out
during my personal hours

294
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,303
is pretty shady, isn't it?

295
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,684
I know I'm being rude,
but I have a reason for it.

296
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,019
You wouldn't answer my calls
or read my messages.

297
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,521
It won't take long.

298
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,735
We want to work with you, Mr. Kim.

299
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,867
With me?

300
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,910
Why?

301
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,121
We want to give you a new vision.

302
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,415
Is "a new vision" some kind of trend

303
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,876
in the industry?

304
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,295
Everyone is using that word.

305
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,964
It sounds pretty dull.

306
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,344
You were dismissed
from Lee Eun-suk's new show, right?

307
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,141
I'd make it work no matter what
if it's what my actor wanted.

308
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,107
Who said that?

309
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,943
Who said I wanted the part?

310
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,904
Pardon?

311
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,450
Not even Star Media could do it,

312
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,827
what are you going to do about it?

313
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,373
I don't like people who are just talk

314
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,542
without any substance.

315
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,255
Fine, then keep doing what you always do.

316
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,761
Just keep repeating the same old roles
with Star Media forever.

317
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,474
You turned down Matsumoto's film.

318
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,268
How could you turn that down?

319
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,853
Don't you have an eye for hits?

320
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,482
If you took the job,
you'd be on the red carpet at Cannes…

321
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,695
Don't tell me…

322
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,032
Did you not know you had the movie offer?

323
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,035
-Does it work now?
-Yes, it's done.

324
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,370
Thank you.

325
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,124
Hey.

326
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,377
What about Kim Ji-hoon?

327
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,170
I'm approaching him discreetly.

328
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,090
-Right.
-I see.

329
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,635
Actress Kang.

330
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,012
Please tell everyone to come to my room.

331
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,348
Yes, sir.

332
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:17,192
All agents present in the office,
please come to the president's office.

333
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,735
I repeat.

334
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:23,198
All agents present in the office,
please come to the president's office.

335
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,414
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

336
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,582
If it's not too much to ask,

337
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,294
may I take a selfie with you?

338
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,297
I want to brag to my friends
that I work with a total celebrity.

339
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,508
Thank you.

340
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,343
Sorry. Just a second.

341
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,765
-All set?
-Thank you.

342
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,811
-Sir.
-Yes?

343
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,022
What's happening to our salary?

344
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,315
Your salary?

345
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,817
I guess you'll get it on payday. Why?

346
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,779
Because of the company's debt,
all the employees' salaries were cut.

347
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,116
You'll get your original salary.
Don't worry.

348
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,494
As long as I'm here,
this company won't lose money.

349
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,540
I mean, the employees' salaries
are the last thing to cut.

350
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,793
Who came up with such a dumb idea?

351
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,884
You can't just call us in like this.
We have work to do, you know.

352
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,889
Then don't come. It's not compulsory.

353
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,183
As of now, those who have the time

354
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,102
can choose to participate
in our company meetings.

355
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,649
Now, let me ask you a question.

356
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,651
Why do we not have

357
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,071
new actors in our company?

358
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:48,366
Ko Eun-gyul and Kang Hee-sun.
They're the only two.

359
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,494
Because new actors are like the lottery.

360
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,622
The chances that they're successful
are extremely low.

361
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,625
It's not easy to train new actors.

362
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,127
And it requires a lot of effort
to get them parts.

363
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:03,882
Due to our current financial situation,
we need to focus on established actors.

364
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,302
We can start finding new talent
once our financial situation improves…

365
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,139
Now I see the problem with this company.

366
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,017
The water needs to flow to provide oxygen,

367
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,646
keep itself clean, and attract fish.

368
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,982
If the water is stagnant,
it'll only go bad.

369
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,402
Are you saying that we're a filthy pool?

370
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,863
Successful and famous actors.

371
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,574
Is it really any fun working with them?

372
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,245
New stars appear all the time.

373
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,665
But they are never born by themselves,

374
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,500
which means someone has to make them.

375
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,335
Who?

376
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,712
Who?

377
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,551
Who?

378
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,594
Me?

379
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,227
Us.

380
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,150
I have an idea.

381
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,860
Create a Talent Development Team.

382
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,697
Anyone can apply for a position
including inexperienced applicants.

383
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,614
Can we…

384
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,451
apply too?

385
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,123
Mr. Choi, why don't you apply
for the manager position?

386
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,000
Me?

387
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,294
What?

388
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,213
Why not,
as long as he has the required skills?

389
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,341
Ms. So, you can apply for manager too.

390
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,802
No, I just entered the company.

391
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,095
Ms. So.

392
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,308
I was your age
when I founded my first company.

393
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,185
Who knows?

394
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,645
Maybe you'll buy
this whole company one day.

395
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,855
What?

396
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,023
Do you want to?

397
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,275
Goodness. That felt so good.

398
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,444
He's such a cool man.

399
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,947
What happened to Kim Ji-hoon?

400
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,411
I think I mentioned
that I was engaging him.

401
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,579
Right.

402
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,665
I don't think
I mentioned incentives, did I?

403
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,042
Do you think money will--

404
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,168
Ten million won.

405
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,379
You mean, 2.5 million per person?

406
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,964
No. Ten million per person.

407
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,010
To the person
making the biggest contribution,

408
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,511
an extra ten million as a bonus.

409
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,062
Apparently, Director Matsumoto
wanted to cast Kim Ji-hoon

410
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:25,148
saying he suited the character
in his movie, Come Together.

411
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,902
Wasn't that one of the Cannes winners?
Why didn't he take the part?

412
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,780
Star Media turned it down,
because of his drama schedules.

413
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,741
They chose Korean TV over film
because they make more money.

414
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:40,288
But it seemed that Kim Ji-hoon
had no idea he even got an offer.

415
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,083
-His agency rejected it on his behalf.
-I guess so.

416
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,503
This is great. All actors hate that.

417
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,005
Turning down offers
without asking their opinions.

418
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:54,010
After showing him solid evidence
what Star Media has been doing to him,

419
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,554
we can tell him to join our company.

420
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,806
Hey, if you were him,

421
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,184
would you want to work with an agent
who had been spying on you?

422
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,604
What if we don't tell him directly?

423
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:06,898
What?

424
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,819
Wait.

425
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,321
I know someone named Otani Satoshi.

426
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,074
He was the CD then. Here.

427
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,867
CD: CASTING DIRECTOR

428
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:23,164
Right. I heard he stopped working
in this industry after retiring.

429
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,417
He looks familiar.

430
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,211
Look at his pale face

431
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,879
and tired, big eyes.

432
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,726
-Won-jae.
-Yes?

433
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,061
Come in for a second.

434
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,669
Mr. Ji-hoon.

435
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,463
-Hello.
-How are you?

436
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,839
Nice to meet you.

437
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,299
Nice to meet you too.

438
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,385
-Are you Mr. Otani Satoshi?
-That's right.

439
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,471
I'm Otani Satoshi.

440
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,306
Thank you very much.

441
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,641
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

442
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:33,818
I couldn't reach your agent,
so I contacted you directly.

443
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,446
I see.

444
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,366
I've heard a lot about you.

445
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,119
I heard you were
in charge of Director Koreeda's film,

446
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,038
and Director Matsumoto

447
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:49,250
works only with you, doesn't he?

448
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,254
I've always wanted to meet you,

449
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,801
so I was really surprised
when you reached out to me.

450
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,845
You wanted to meet me? Why?

451
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,724
Well, there's something I wanted to ask.

452
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,309
Have you ever…

453
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:11,147
offered me a part in a movie?

454
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,275
Last year around this time,

455
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,862
I offered you a part
in Director Matsumoto's film.

456
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,656
You didn't know?

457
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,117
I contacted your agency.

458
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:28,957
But it was another company's agent
who recommended you.

459
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,086
Another company's agent?

460
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,132
Ms. Chun Jane from Method Entertainment.

461
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:41,219
After reading the script,
she recommended you.

462
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,889
Although you aren't with her agency,

463
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,058
she thought you'd be perfect for the part.

464
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,686
Okay. So how did he react?

465
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,021
Really?

466
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,609
Thanks, Won-jae.
You did great. Go rest up.

467
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,236
Bye.

468
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,994
Okay.

469
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,091
It's been a while.

470
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,344
It has.

471
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,057
Have you been well?

472
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,144
Yes.

473
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,778
I've seen you here before,

474
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,994
so I was hoping…

475
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,290
Well…

476
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,543
ACTOR KIM JI-HOON

477
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,172
Sorry.

478
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,591
Right.

479
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,469
I'm very sorry. Just a moment.

480
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,597
Hello?

481
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,142
Now?

482
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,778
No, I have time.

483
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,862
Yes.

484
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,989
Where do you want to meet?

485
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,785
Okay. Very well.

486
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,223
What we talked about earlier…

487
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,350
Have you thought about it?

488
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,811
Yes.

489
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,522
My answer is no.

490
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,569
Please just listen to me.

491
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,905
Let someone else be your agent.

492
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,117
What about Hyun-joo?

493
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,913
I saw her getting you scripts and all.
She seemed sweet to you.

494
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,874
Is it because of what happened yesterday?

495
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,211
Well, that too,

496
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,256
but I'm a bit uncomfortable.

497
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,967
Because you…

498
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,218
I what?

499
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,471
Because I said I have a crush on you?

500
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,183
I've moved on.

501
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,144
What?

502
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,772
You didn't seem interested, so I moved on.

503
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,693
And I didn't want to say this, but…

504
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,862
I have a boyfriend now.

505
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,490
A boyfriend?

506
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,577
He's been hitting on me for a long time.

507
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,371
Anyway, that's what happened.

508
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,833
I'm allowed to have a boyfriend, right?

509
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,919
Of course, you are.

510
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,504
Please stay as my agent.

511
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,756
I like Ms. So,

512
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,842
but since we're both rookies,
I feel like it's going to be rough.

513
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,803
You have more authority than her anyway.

514
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,599
Don't care about what others say.
I won't either.

515
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,448
I'm thinking of applying
for the Talent Development Team.

516
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,701
They're going to assign a famous actor
to you soon. So why bother?

517
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,371
I want to start on my own.

518
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:41,501
Mr. Kim also said that when the actors
he'd been working with since their debut

519
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,711
mentioned his name at an award speech,

520
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,632
he knew his hard work had paid off
and that he felt fulfilled.

521
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,342
That's just an illusion.

522
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,177
Most actors won't appreciate you.

523
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,846
If you don't want to feel betrayed later,

524
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,974
choose the path that benefits you.

525
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,650
I'm saying this
because I don't want you to be used.

526
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,653
Okay.

527
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,071
-Hello.
-Hello.

528
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,907
Could you recommend a product for her?

529
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,663
How about this one?

530
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,000
It's made of lambswool,
so you can use it all year round.

531
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,961
What do you think?

532
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,926
It's nice.

533
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,512
-We'll buy this one.
-Okay.

534
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,770
Got any dinner plans?
If you're free, let's eat together.

535
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,690
I have plans already.

536
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,817
You'll have to eat alone.

537
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,949
Eun-soo was mean to me
when I first came too.

538
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,995
Many join just to see celebrities
and then quit the company soon.

539
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,288
I suppose that's why.

540
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,834
Jin-hyeok is actually really nice too.

541
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,169
He can guide you at work.

542
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,798
And you don't need
to be intimidated by Ms. Chun.

543
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,844
She may sound harsh,
but she's actually very caring.

544
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,430
She only acts cold.

545
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,975
What about Director Jang Myung-aeh?

546
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,103
What exactly does she do?

547
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,191
The only time I've seen her around
is when she's watering the plants.

548
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,152
Director Jang?

549
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,574
She's in charge
of a few middle-aged actors…

550
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,417
But to be honest,
she doesn't have much to do.

551
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:51,172
She doesn't have to try to get them parts.

552
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,758
They get casting calls on their own.

553
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,219
So she's a slacker.

554
00:34:56,302 --> 00:35:01,057
But many managers and senior employees
rely on her for advice.

555
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,852
She's like
the emotional anchor of our company.

556
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,822
I didn't know
we had places like this near Seoul.

557
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:20,159
I come here from time to time
when I have something to think about.

558
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,372
Is something bothering you?

559
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,836
I'm thinking of leaving Star Media.

560
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,298
And why is that?

561
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,886
We want different things, so to say.

562
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:45,184
I'd like to try something new,
even if it could be risky.

563
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,438
But they want me to be on the safe side.

564
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,776
We always have disagreements
on this matter,

565
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,779
and I'm tired of it now.

566
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,995
Don't get too excited.
I'm not saying I'm going to Method.

567
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,207
For the time being,

568
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,668
I want to be on my own.

569
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,843
It's like you dump me
even before we start going out.

570
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,429
So why did you call me?

571
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,851
I thought

572
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,981
I could have a heart-to-heart with you.

573
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,413
So…

574
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,833
What's your plan
after leaving the company?

575
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,877
Any type of work you want to do?

576
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,504
Since I made my debut,

577
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:01,177
I've been working for over 20 years now.

578
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,138
I realized clearly…

579
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,851
that there's something more
important than money.

580
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,605
I think I finally found the path
I want to take,

581
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:17,068
but the company wants me
to stay on the road well-worn.

582
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,363
I'm tired of arguing with them
because of this.

583
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,033
Even if it takes time,

584
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,535
I want to take the path I want to walk.

585
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,372
That's the right thing to do.

586
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,750
Lee Eun-suk didn't turn you down.
You turned her down.

587
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,169
And that's where the conflict began
with the agency.

588
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,256
You're really my kind of actor, you know.

589
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,510
You're right though.

590
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,389
Whatever others say, you're the only one
who knows what you should do.

591
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,476
You could've chosen to do
the safe weekend dramas

592
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,020
but instead, you stayed hungry
for a couple of years.

593
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,356
Then you rebranded yourself
on Flower of Evil

594
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,316
and went global with Money Heist: Korea.

595
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,402
You really made the right choice.

596
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:03,030
Otherwise, you would be doing
the same role even now.

597
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,952
How do you know so much about me?

598
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,918
So tell me.

599
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:21,924
What kind of character
do you think I should play?

600
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,094
From an agent's perspective, you know.

601
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:30,182
Man, I wanted to keep the list to myself
until you joined our company.

602
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,185
Too bad.

603
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:40,109
It might be a little risky,
but there's a part I had in mind.

604
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,445
But this character

605
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,114
is really hated by everyone.

606
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,533
Can you handle it?

607
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,328
What character is it?

608
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,791
You know Director Lee Chung-hyeon

609
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,543
-and his movie, The Call?
-I do.

610
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,171
Of the three main characters in the movie,

611
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,548
the bad one.

612
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,217
The most wicked one…

613
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,695
Okay.

614
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,452
Good morning, Mr. Kim.

615
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,214
Starting today,
Director Ma is your manager.

616
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,383
He's aware too.
You'll be working with him now.

617
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,009
But why?

618
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,428
I said I don't like you anymore.

619
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:53,140
We don't have feelings for each other,
so why bother changing?

620
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,395
Director Ma is
the most powerful agent in this company.

621
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,022
This is for your sake.

622
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,123
-Good morning.
-How did it go?

623
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,583
We spent the night together.

624
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,085
-Again?
-What?

625
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,045
We spent…

626
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,756
the whole night talking at the campsite.

627
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,302
-He wants to leave Star Media.
-And? Is he coming to Method?

628
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,555
Not yet.

629
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,516
Don't worry.
We're going to the theater today.

630
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,435
And I'll seal the deal there.

631
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,229
-Don't mess it up by making it personal.
-Gosh.

632
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,314
I got it. I'll take care of it.

633
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,692
Don't you worry. Okay?

634
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,734
I got this.

635
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,656
-You can do it.
-I can do it.

636
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,415
-What's that?
-A present.

637
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,378
I heard you're going to seal a deal
in the evening.

638
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,089
It hasn't happened yet,
so why buy me this?

639
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,675
Keep it until I get a signed contract.

640
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,385
That's not it.

641
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,561
Make sure to put this on tonight.

642
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,771
It'll help you close the deal.

643
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,859
I don't need it.

644
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,451
I thought it'd look good on you,
but I didn't expect it to look this good.

645
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,578
Wear it later today, okay?

646
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,998
Don't take it the wrong way.
This isn't for your sake.

647
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,917
We've got to show him

648
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,544
that Method's agents are
in a different class.

649
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,172
I don't need this
to prove that I have class.

650
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,007
Make sure you sign him to Method.

651
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,344
Right.

652
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:58,182
Don't forget to send me
a picture of you wearing this.

653
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,067
Did you watch the show because of me?

654
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,736
No.

655
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,822
It's been a while
since I watched a fun show.

656
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,574
I had a good time.

657
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,915
Would you like to go somewhere quiet
for a cup of coffee?

658
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,585
I have something to tell you.

659
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,672
Sure. Shall we?

660
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,340
Ji-hoon.

661
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,682
How did you know I was here?

662
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:43,060
You're always in my heart.

663
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:49,650
You can go anywhere you want,

664
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,403
but not her.

665
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,737
Never!

666
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,908
You met a Japanese casting director
recently, right?

667
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:02,246
He's a field manager with Method.

668
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:05,374
Japan, my foot.
He hasn't even been to Jeju.

669
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,885
What are you talking about?

670
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,888
You're the one who turned Matsumoto down.

671
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,432
Who are you trying to frame?

672
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,434
You bunch of thieving hoodlums.

673
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,020
Says the one who stole
Son Jun-ho and Kim Soo-hyun.

674
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,188
See?

675
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,107
They're just trying to get revenge

676
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,901
for losing their clients by stealing you.

677
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,528
That's not true.

678
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,406
I really do want to work with you.
I'm serious.

679
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,116
Man.

680
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,327
I heard you were sold
to some rich businessman.

681
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,788
Still, how could you
pull a cheap trick like this?

682
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,541
I'm warning you.

683
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,210
Before Method hits rock bottom,

684
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,339
you'd better take care of your own actors.

685
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,508
Don't go after actors who aren't yours.

686
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,261
Damn it.

687
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,306
It's okay if you don't want to join us.

688
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,183
But I meant what I said yesterday.

689
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,186
What you think is right is the right
answer, so push forward with it.

690
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:10,147
You should cut ties with an agency
that only thinks of you as a cash cow.

691
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,525
That little…

692
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,862
Damn it.

693
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,874
-Hello?
-So? Did he sign the contract?

694
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:29,792
That's enough!

695
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,799
What was that?
Are you yelling at me right now?

696
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,175
If you want him so badly,

697
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,885
why don't you sign him yourself?

698
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,263
-What?
-You think everything goes your way?

699
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,016
If you're so rich, just buy Star Media!

700
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,769
Hey, Suk. Don't cross the line.

701
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,938
I'm your boss.

702
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,148
Don't cross it yourself.

703
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,068
It's an eyesore watching you
go on a power trip using money.

704
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,779
Stop bugging me and let me breathe,
you disgusting pig!

705
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:19,258
You can't see it from here,
but the whole audience was crying here.

706
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,385
Wait. How can I turn up the volume?

707
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,889
Did you hear that?
The guy at the front just sniffled.

708
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,767
He came to watch our show seven times.
Can you believe that?

709
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,810
I see.

710
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,687
But why can't I hear anything?

711
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,814
One second.

712
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,232
How do I turn up the volume?

713
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:39,069
-Hello.
-Hello, I'm with the real estate agency.

714
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,195
Okay?

715
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:44,116
Your wife wouldn't answer her phone,
so I'm calling her emergency contact.

716
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,786
Someone wants to see your place.
Is it okay if I show it now?

717
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,746
What are you talking about?

718
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,832
-Should I come another time?
-Hold on.

719
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,043
Aren't you Mr. Ma Tae-oh
living in 354 Banpo-dong?

720
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,211
Yes, that's me.

721
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,339
Your wife, Ms. Song Eun-ha
put up the house for sale.

722
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,049
Were you not aware?

723
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,637
I'll call you back later.

724
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,558
What the hell is going on?

725
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,822
This one and…

726
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,160
When's your mother coming again?

727
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,287
Next week.

728
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,331
There it is.

729
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,624
Don't.

730
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,667
What if we get in trouble for taking it?

731
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,086
It's almost expired. It's okay.

732
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,505
Here.

733
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,715
It's almost expired,
so use it on your feet.

734
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:44,551
Your feet are going to be smooth
like a baby.

735
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,679
Thank you.

736
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,848
-Jin-hyeok.
-Yes?

737
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:50,933
I am…

738
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,894
going to apply for
the Talent Development Team.

739
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,816
For the manager position?

740
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,693
What?

741
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,488
No, I can't be a manager.

742
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,574
If you become the manager of the team,

743
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,952
I'd like to join that team.

744
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,163
Is that okay with you?

745
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,000
Of course!

746
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,503
-Take a look at this.
-What?

747
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:22,172
These are the design proposals
for a business card.

748
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:25,217
This one is simple and modern.

749
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,844
This one is avant-garde.
Which one is better?

750
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,096
-I like this one.
-Really?

751
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,514
This one suits you perfectly.

752
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,559
It's conspicuous and unique.

753
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,726
Oh, my.

754
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,063
I'm so glad I have you
as a junior coworker.

755
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,485
If I, Choi Jin-hyeok, become
the manager of the team,

756
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,572
Ms. So, I want you to
be the assistant manager.

757
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,365
At your service, sir!

758
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,794
Sorry about yesterday.

759
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,171
Cho Gi-bong suddenly showed up

760
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,382
and messed it all up.

761
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,593
So I got a little upset. Sorry.

762
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,303
I understand.

763
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,403
Pack your stuff.

764
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,408
Hey, what are you–-

765
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:36,413
Star Media just called.
You got us in serious trouble.

766
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,998
I'm not going to tell you

767
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,250
what I had to do to fix this.

768
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,918
Because you don't work here anymore.

769
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,337
Fine. I made a mistake.

770
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,131
But this is unfair.
I've been working here for years.

771
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,509
I'm a company shareholder.

772
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,887
I hold the majority
and I make the decisions.

773
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,307
Don't you think of stealing our actors.
Leave your laptop before you go.

774
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,147
This is heavy.

775
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,334
-Hello.
-Hi, this is Kim Ji-hoon.

776
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,587
Why doesn't an agent answer their phone?

777
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,340
I was really offended yesterday, you know.

778
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,093
What happened was just ludicrous.

779
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,303
I'm sorry.

780
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,847
Forget it.

781
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,225
About Director Lee Chung-hyeon…

782
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,811
He contacted me

783
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,105
and offered me a part.

784
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,276
You recommended me to him.

785
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,363
-Am I right?
-Yes.

786
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:56,034
So can I take the offer?

787
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,496
And work with you?

788
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,839
I want to work with Method Entertainment.

789
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,509
All of a sudden?

790
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,262
I don't know what happened
between the two companies,

791
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,974
but I want to focus on myself for now.

792
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:24,521
Right now, I need an agent like you.

793
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:28,191
An agent who knows my needs and vision

794
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,569
better than I do.

795
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,489
Thank you for setting me up
with the movie.

796
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,409
Ms. Chun…

797
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,288
you seem like a great agent.

798
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:45,000
Well… except for your unnecessary lies.

799
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:49,212
Thank you.

800
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,464
I'm looking forward…

801
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,925
to working with you.

802
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,553
Okay. Bye.

803
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,150
Well done, Suk.

804
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,861
I knew you could do it.

805
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,280
Let's get the contract ready.

806
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,407
Why is this damn thing so heavy?

807
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,097
-Hello.
-Hello.

808
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,230
Hi.

809
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,623
What was that?

810
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,669
Employees that are managers or above,

811
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,213
please come to the president's room.

812
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,589
I repeat.

813
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,424
Employees that are managers or above,

814
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,094
please come to the president's room.

815
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,721
-The phone is turned off.
-What?

816
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,808
Please leave a message after the tone.

817
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:33,608
I just wired the incentive I promised.

818
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,780
I told you

819
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:42,576
that I would maximize your potential.

820
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:47,330
From now on,
just trust me and follow my lead.

821
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,171
All right. Next.

822
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,307
Director Jang Myung-aeh.

823
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,810
What exactly are your tasks
in this company?

824
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,478
I can't seem to figure it out.

825
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,817
I exclusively manage senior actors.

826
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:22,282
Those senior actors have
old-fashioned ideas about agencies--

827
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,241
Then…

828
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,410
we've got to make them catch up.

829
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:29,497
Fear the change, then you'll fall behind.

830
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,459
Actually, I have a suggestion.

831
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,463
Why don't you
start enjoying a relaxed life from now on?

832
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,798
Wait. Hold on.

833
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,092
What are you talking about?

834
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,847
Are you telling me to retire?

835
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,265
No, that's not what I mean.

836
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,940
I want you to stop all work.

837
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,567
Instead, I want you to be our advisor.

838
00:53:58,693 --> 00:53:59,819
Hey, Koo Hae-jun!

839
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,112
I'm not deaf.

840
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:06,493
Other agents will take over
the senior actors you've been managing.

841
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,664
I've read the files thoroughly,

842
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,292
and I'm not sure why I should…

843
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,878
keep you here.

844
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,382
You can't evaluate her contribution
with a single file.

845
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,217
Since this company was founded, she--

846
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,471
Other employees seemed to think
she was making easy money.

847
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,390
What was it called?

848
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,976
A slacker?

849
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:32,852
Who said that?

850
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,813
Who?

851
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:43,113
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone…

852
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,156
He's not picking up?

853
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,742
It's still off.
This has never happened before.

854
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,221
Old, yellowed leaves like these

855
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,473
are called hayeob.

856
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,353
They were the first
to root down and sprout,

857
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,858
but as time passes, they become yellow…

858
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,237
and useless.

859
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,075
You need to

860
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,745
take them out

861
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,790
so the rest of the leaves can be healthy.

862
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,466
No way. This is absurd.

863
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:47,427
We'll find a way. Don't worry, Director.

864
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,932
Please take good care

865
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,685
of Method Entertainment.

866
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,064
Guys.

867
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,818
Let's have a drink later.

868
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,009
Who the hell said that?

869
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,805
Said what?

870
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,724
Apparently, somebody said to Mr. Koo

871
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:20,186
that Ms. Jang was just a slacker.

872
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,022
That she gets a salary for nothing.

873
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,110
Oh, no.

874
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:39,330
He told me to single out
the least effective employee.

875
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,834
I approached you just to figure out…

876
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:45,920
what people think.

877
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,257
I knew it would be one of the three,

878
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,093
but I was surprised to find out
it was Ms. Jang.

879
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,013
Well, it's true
that her output was the weakest.

880
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,017
Some things can't be
measured with numbers.

881
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,144
Numbers don't tell you everything.

882
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,699
Oh, my goodness!

883
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,326
-Director Ma!
-What's going on?

884
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,078
-Oh, my gosh!
-What's wrong?

885
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,621
What? What happened?

886
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,541
What's going on?

887
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,460
Director Ma…

888
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,295
What is it?

889
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,172
What's the matter?

890
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,716
Gosh, you scared me.

891
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,010
-Director Ma…
-It's hot.

892
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,681
-I was so worried.
-Jeez.

893
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,141
What on earth is going on?

894
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,519
Sorry.

895
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:25,895
Thank you.

896
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,815
Again, I'm so sorry.

897
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,651
This door…

898
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,782
It's okay. Leave it.

899
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,120
Here.

900
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,748
-Thank you.
-Have a seat.

901
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,093
I'm sorry.

902
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,555
You wouldn't

903
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,641
pick up your phone,

904
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,893
so I thought

905
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,813
something bad might have happened.

906
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,941
So you called me 30 times?

907
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,778
Did you think I died or something?

908
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:17,572
Well…

909
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:22,869
You've been through a lot lately, so…

910
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:36,799
What happened?

911
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,969
I fell down while I was running here.

912
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,929
It's okay.

913
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,765
No, it's not.

914
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,225
Wait here.

915
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,437
But I'm really okay.

916
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,364
You should've been more careful.

917
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,917
Gosh, that must hurt.

918
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,065
My…

919
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,403
My heart is pounding…

920
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,530
Director Ma.

921
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,217
BEHIND EVERY STAR

922
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:11,245
We can't stand back and just watch him
run the company however he wants.

923
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,581
-Leave management up to us.
-You must have some sort of plan.

924
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:15,249
Then why don't we work together?

925
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,626
I'll show you what I'm capable of.

926
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:20,046
Actually,
there is one thing you need to do.

927
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,632
Nobody knows about your fear of heights
except for me.

928
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,133
Do you think I can really do a good job?

929
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,426
If we want to sign with her,
it's now or never.

930
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,470
I don't think it's a good idea
to bring up Squid Game.

931
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,388
Why didn't you tell us
you knew each other?

932
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,973
What? You can't do it on your own?

933
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,142
Why don't we just come clean and tell him…

934
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,185
I shall overcome!

935
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,478
Joo-ryung!

936
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,646
Somebody save me!

937
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,940
