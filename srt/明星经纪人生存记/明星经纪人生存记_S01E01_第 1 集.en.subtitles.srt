00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,952
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,421
EPISODE 1

3
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,674
What?

4
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,176
She's still at the farm?

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,136
You need to get there now.

6
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,388
I'll find a way to buy some time here.

7
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,474
Tell them she's on her way if they call.

8
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,325
Hello? Won-jae?

9
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,576
Hey.

10
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,912
I mean, why aren't you here yet?

11
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,581
Can you check up on her?
We're running out of time.

12
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,417
Hurry, okay? I'm begging you.

13
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,211
-Good grief.
-Hello.

14
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,382
I'm Kim Jung-don,
Ms. Cho Yeo-jeong's agent.

15
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,259
Here.

16
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,428
-Here.
-Sure.

17
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,432
What's going on?

18
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,852
There must be some kind of event.
All of Jongno was in heavy traffic.

19
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,855
I barely managed to get here on a scooter.

20
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,525
She's on her way now,
so if you just wait a little…

21
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,151
Excuse me.

22
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,114
Won-jae, where are you?

23
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,907
What?

24
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,618
A fender bender?

25
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,703
How's Yeo-jeong?

26
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,221
-Yeo-jeong.
-Hey, Jung-don.

27
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,514
Is your class not over?

28
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,683
Goodness, look at the time. I'm sorry.

29
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,644
Won-jae is on standby
with the car at the entrance.

30
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:28,314
-Come as soon as you're ready, okay?
-Sure. I'll be there.

31
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,482
Yeo-jeong.

32
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,860
Are you talking to me on the horse?

33
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,362
Yes, that's right.

34
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,363
Why?

35
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,533
You must be pretty good at it now.

36
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,203
Of course, I'm totally good now.

37
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,330
What a relief.

38
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,666
I was actually a little worried.

39
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,628
The US unit stressed that you had to
ride the horse yourself countless times.

40
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,589
You were worried for nothing.

41
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,923
Who do you think I am?

42
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,135
Okay. Hang up now. I'll be there soon.

43
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,344
Bye.

44
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,020
I'm in trouble.

45
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,357
Hey, Yeo-jeong.

46
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,610
-Am I late?
-No, you're fine.

47
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,112
I didn't shower in case I was late.

48
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,239
-Aren't you glad?
-Yes, I'm very glad.

49
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,574
-Yeo-jeong.
-Yes?

50
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,910
I have your outfits,
hairstyle, and makeup ready,

51
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,202
so don't worry about them.

52
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,163
We'll get a call from the US today.

53
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,081
All right.

54
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,625
-Yeo-jeong, don't worry.
-Sure.

55
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,542
Stay focused today.

56
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,377
-Good luck!
-Got it.

57
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,714
-Get her makeup ready.
-Okay.

58
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,227
We are ready to go.

59
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,978
-This way.
-Hello.

60
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,063
Hello.

61
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,774
-Let's start right away.
-Okay.

62
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,400
-Hello, Yeo-jeong.
-Hello.

63
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,653
Thank you for coming out so far.

64
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,154
-Let's go this way.
-Okay.

65
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,364
My goodness.

66
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,865
-Let's start the shoot.
-Hello.

67
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,117
-Let's begin!
-Hello.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,460
Beautiful.

69
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,717
Nice. All right.

70
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,886
Good.

71
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,515
Okay, looking good.

72
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,227
I don't think I need to retouch anything.

73
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,354
-You won't need to do much.
-It's fine, right?

74
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,982
-It's nice and natural.
-She did all the heavy lifting.

75
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,234
Great job today.

76
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,318
Don't mention it.

77
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,322
It seems like there are rumors

78
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,117
-of the next role you'll take up.
-Right.

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,493
Can I tell her?

80
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,915
Well, nothing's been set in stone.

81
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,751
We haven't even signed the contract yet.

82
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,086
This is for your ears only.

83
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,963
This will be completely off the record.

84
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,924
Quentin Tarantino.

85
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,304
Amazing, right?

86
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,390
What genre is it? What's it about?

87
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,642
It's about this woman who manages a farm.

88
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,604
She travels through time
to get her revenge on men, and…

89
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,564
Oh, my.

90
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,608
I was told not to share the story.

91
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,110
Gosh, whatever.

92
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,573
I read through the script
and was completely hooked.

93
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,367
I couldn't believe
I was getting this chance.

94
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,368
AGENCY CEO AMY

95
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,497
TARANTINO CAN'T WORK WITH YEO-JEONG.
HE THINKS SHE'S TOO OLD FOR THE PART.

96
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,708
-This is absurd.
-I'll be one of his go-to actors.

97
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,462
So I've been taking horseback riding
lessons to prepare for the part.

98
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,632
It's great for women's thigh muscles.
I totally recommend it.

99
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,729
This is Method Entertainment.

100
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,775
Yes, I'm sorry,
but profile submissions have ended.

101
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,777
Goodbye.

102
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,653
KIM JUNG-DON, MANAGER

103
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,322
Hello, Mr. Kim.

104
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,575
#EMOTIONALAGENT
#PACIFIST #ALLABOUTLOYALTY

105
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,035
Yes, I know.

106
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,912
I get what you mean.

107
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,790
But I have a good reason
when I tell you not to do that film.

108
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,791
Director.

109
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,708
MA TAE-OH, DIRECTOR

#STRATEGICAGENT
#ALLABOUTPERFORMANCE #ICONOFAMBITION

111
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,337
At this point in your career,

112
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,506
you should be focused on quality,
not quantity.

113
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,093
Think about it, okay?

114
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,888
Your next project will decide
whether you rise to the top or not.

115
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,557
Call their youngest and tell them

116
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,936
that we'll manage Daniel Henney,
and reserve first-class seats.

117
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,230
They always say they didn't hear it
when it's me who tells them.

118
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,731
Then leave them a message.

119
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,274
Sir, do you have time later?

120
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,486
-Did we get new beans?
-They keep ignoring me. What should I do?

121
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,029
Just figure it out, okay?

122
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,072
Is that mine?

123
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:47,990
You're welcome.

124
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,952
Then leave them a text
instead of instant messaging.

125
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,954
"I'm leaving you a text as you seem busy."

126
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,872
Be polite and convey a sense of respect.

127
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:55,832
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,667
I got a text from Alex.

129
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,793
Alex?

130
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,545
Alex what?

131
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,630
Alex, the photographer.

132
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,132
Him?

133
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,591
He says he can't reach you.

134
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,885
He's much clingier than I thought.

135
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,303
-Sorry?
-Nothing.

136
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,347
Tell him I'm getting married next week.

137
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,932
-Sorry?
-You're here.

138
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,976
-Hi.
-Hello.

139
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,936
You're getting married?

140
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,396
Why would I get married?

141
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,274
My gosh.

142
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,526
Use your brain.

143
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,571
Okay? Get it together.

144
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,199
How did it go?

145
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,286
Hey, Jung-don.

146
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,246
What?

147
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,790
Did you get
Yeo-jeong's contract from the US?

148
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,917
Yes, sure.

149
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,043
Right.

150
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,463
What's with him?

151
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,804
TARANTINO CAN'T WORK WITH YEO-JEONG.
HE THINKS SHE'S TOO OLD FOR THE PART.

152
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,269
METHOD ENTERTAINMENT

153
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,707
"However, a beautiful heart
that enriches…"

154
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,504
"That enriches the soul, and the love
in our hearts will always be there."

155
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,424
"They only grow with the passing of time."

156
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,011
-"Physical beauty…"
-Excuse me.

157
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,767
You can leave your profile there.

158
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,019
Well, I was--

159
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,605
We don't sign with new actors.

160
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,815
It's not that.

161
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,152
I'm here to see Director Ma Tae-oh.

162
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,115
-Do you have an appointment?
-No.

163
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,785
Then I'm afraid you can't.

164
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,370
I did text him a moment ago.

165
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,664
Please tell him that So Hyun-joo is here.

166
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,624
He will know once he hears my name.

167
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,336
I'll tell him,
but don't get your hopes up.

168
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,380
He isn't someone you can just come and--

169
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,173
Yes, Director.

170
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,133
There's a…

171
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,553
Hyun-joo. It's So Hyun-joo.

172
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,805
A Ms. So Hyun-joo is here to see…

173
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,224
Sorry?

174
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,646
Okay, I understand.

175
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,150
One second, please.

176
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,750
You're here.

177
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,335
Shall we talk outside?

178
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,421
Sure.

179
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,428
Don't worry.

180
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,931
I didn't tell the receptionist anything.

181
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,474
Are you in Seoul on holiday?

182
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,228
-Are you on a break already?
-I graduated last year.

183
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,771
I see.

184
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,356
Why didn't you tell me?

185
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,941
I would've sent you a gift.

186
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,694
You did.

187
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,451
Right.

188
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,410
I did.

189
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,289
Actually, it's been three weeks
since I came to Seoul.

190
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,875
I'm going to live here now.

191
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,210
Why?

192
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,591
What I mean is,
Busan is such a great place to live.

193
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,635
Why would you torture yourself here?

194
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,470
You had a job there too.

195
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,432
I was helping my mom out at her hair salon
because I couldn't get a job.

196
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,227
And there was something
I actually wanted to do.

197
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,315
And what could that be?

198
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,818
I want to be an agent.

199
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,407
Like a travel agent?

200
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,701
No.

201
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,121
In the entertainment business.

202
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,965
Speaking of which, can't you help me out?

203
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,801
People told me

204
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,304
that the fastest way to become one
is through a referral.

205
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,521
This is my résumé.

206
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:30,981
No.

207
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,824
Do you know how many kids like you
come to work here then run off crying?

208
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,325
But I really mean it.

209
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,119
-I'm confident I'll do well.
-Come on.

210
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,829
Stop talking nonsense.

211
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,837
Here. Grab something to eat and go home.

212
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,507
Our relationship…

213
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,929
I promise to keep it a secret.

214
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,667
I'm sorry. I'm a little late.

215
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,335
We're all here, so let's begin.

216
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,670
PRESIDENT WANG TAE-JA

217
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,089
This is our last meeting
before my vacation.

218
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,341
Anything to report?

219
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,510
Lee Hee-jun's casting has been confirmed.

220
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,138
And Jung Yu-mi will
renew her contract with us.

221
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,514
She should be…

222
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,725
signing her contract by now.

223
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,395
She was being so picky,
but she ended up signing.

224
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,230
Great work, Ms. Chun.

225
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,315
Sure.

226
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,901
What happened to that thing
with the writer Kim Eun-hee?

227
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,777
I have it ready here.

228
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,238
First four episodes,
including the synopsis.

229
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,200
Really? You have Kim Eun-hee's script?

230
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,202
It was highly confidential, so how?

231
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,287
I'll read it over and push ahead.

232
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,789
The production begged me
not to publicize it.

233
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,625
Okay, you do that, Director Ma.

234
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,211
Anything else?

235
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,921
Mr. Kim?

236
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,590
How's it going with Cho Yeo-jeong?

237
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,841
Her contract from the US.

238
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,385
Well…

239
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,764
What is it? Is there a problem?

240
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,308
Well, it's…

241
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,853
Yes, there is a problem. A very big one.

242
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,730
What is it? What's the problem?

243
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,233
I got a message saying

244
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,945
that they'll retract the offer
to cast Yeo-jeong.

245
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,738
-What?
-What did you say?

246
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,658
She was so thrilled about the offer

247
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,952
that she took up English
and riding lessons.

248
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,831
But they refused to cast her
because she's too old for them.

249
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,418
What a load of bull.
Didn't they even know how old she was?

250
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,755
The character was changed
to be in her early twenties with revision.

251
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,050
They also added many flashbacks
to her high school days,

252
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,135
so they're getting
someone else for the role.

253
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,555
I kept telling you
that it might not work out.

254
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,723
She called off
other dramas and films for that.

255
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,892
So you messed it all up?

256
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:13,978
Also…

257
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,815
What about the ads she got
because she was cast in a Tarantino film?

258
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,443
Would Yeo-jeong
sign with us again after this?

259
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,112
If we were to DM the director--

260
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,029
Hey.

261
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,074
-Then what about a text message--
-Hey!

262
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,495
Can't you read the room?

263
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,335
I haven't told Yeo-jeong yet, so…

264
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,470
Good grief.

265
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,682
Come on.

266
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,309
-Jeez.
-I'm sorry.

267
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,935
Hey!

268
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,146
What a mess.

269
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,108
I left you a text message.

270
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,277
-Excuse me.
-One second.

271
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,573
Do you have a spare envelope?

272
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,076
Yes, go on.

273
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,329
Hey!

274
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,331
Hey, you!

275
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,540
You little punk!

276
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,835
You'll quit just like this?
Have you lost it?

277
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,879
I've had enough!

278
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,548
You tell me to figure it out myself
when I ask you questions,

279
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,967
then you ask me why I didn't ask you
if I try to do something on my own.

280
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,885
Why you…

281
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,596
Mi-yeong.

282
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,972
I'm Sin-yeong!

283
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,849
Yes, Sin-yeong. All right.

284
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,393
Put your stuff down. Let's talk this out.

285
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,896
Do you want the rest of the day off?
How about we talk tomorrow?

286
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,482
You're a psychopath
with personality disorders.

287
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,816
You stubborn old-timer!

288
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,819
I'm not that bad, am I?

289
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,364
I'd be insane to ever return here.

290
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,451
Call me crazy if I ever come back!

291
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,078
You just quit on your own.

292
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,914
Don't call me later
to file for unemployment benefits!

293
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,018
Where am I going to find someone?

294
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,815
Mi-sun, don't you want to be an agent?

295
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,775
It's Hee-sun.

296
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,654
And I keep telling you
that I'm an actress.

297
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,117
I was cast as a lead in a play
for the first time.

298
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,535
-If you have time--
-Kids these days.

299
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,870
Why don't they have any grit?

300
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,957
They all quit
when they're about to be useful.

301
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,210
Why can't they hold out for long?

302
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,212
Gosh, I don't know.

303
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,922
I'm just dying to know.

304
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,676
When will I find and train someone again?
I need someone now.

305
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,556
If you're looking for someone new,
then I can do it.

306
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,746
Are you coming or not?

307
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,414
Coming.

308
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,796
DOUBLE MAJOR
IN LIBRARY SCIENCE AND LITERATURE

309
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,090
VOLUNTEERED AT BUSAN FILM FESTIVAL
TOP SCHOLARSHIP STUDENT

310
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,514
Three months on apprenticeship.

311
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,434
You'll get a permanent position
depending on your performance.

312
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,728
Your phone must be on at all times.

313
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,230
You have to pick up whether you're
eating, sleeping, or taking a dump.

314
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,274
You'll always work overtime,
often all night.

315
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,609
And I can't guarantee you a personal life.

316
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,944
Is that okay?

317
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,614
Yes, it's all right.

318
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,115
Can you begin right away?

319
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,117
Yes.

320
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,578
Our agency has about 30 actors.

321
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,413
We do deliveries, schedule management,

322
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,457
promotions, planning,
contracts, marketing,

323
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,210
and everything else
regarding an actor's career.

324
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,462
This is Choi Jin-hyeok.

325
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,589
He's in his fifth year
and is in charge of PR.

326
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,383
This is Yoo Eun-soo,
in charge of administration.

327
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,094
-Your name is?
-So Hyun-joo.

328
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,387
Yes, okay. This is your desk.

329
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,891
Assist your seniors for a while
and learn about your job.

330
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,434
Leave a note for all calls.

331
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,937
The only thing you'll say is,
"They're out for work."

332
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,855
-Okay?
-"They're out for work."

333
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,981
Yes!

334
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,990
Nice to meet you.

335
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,248
Hello, Director.

336
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,167
Yes, all right.

337
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,380
By Director,

338
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,800
you mean Director Ma Tae-oh, right?

339
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,593
Yes, why do you ask?

340
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,053
I was just asking.

341
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,681
I wanted to know what he was like.

342
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,890
Director Ma Tae-oh?

343
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,726
He's the one who runs things here.

344
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,146
He graduated from
a prestigious university,

345
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,189
is good at his job,
and is handsome to boot.

346
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,775
On top of that,
his wife is from a conglomerate family.

347
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,444
In a word, for Eun-soo,

348
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,408
he's someone she may want
but can never have.

349
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,910
He's like a mirage.

350
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,039
Do you think

351
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,168
it's best to tell Yeo-jeong the truth?

352
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,588
I don't think so.

353
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,598
When an actress turns 40,

354
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,185
she gets easily hurt
by the most trivial words.

355
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,187
Telling her she's old?

356
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,897
That's the worst of the worst.

357
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,400
The pride of an actress is

358
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,527
like this glass.

359
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,363
One mistake,

360
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,116
and it will shatter.

361
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,703
And the ones who prevent that
from happening

362
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,331
are people like us.

363
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,091
-See you later.
-Take care.

364
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,676
Have a great trip.

365
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,721
Remember what I told you.

366
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,098
Return quickly.

367
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,580
-Your call could not be connected…
-That's odd. Why won't he pick up?

368
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,305
What should I tell her?
She'll be so disappointed.

369
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,432
I think she's calling about the contract.

370
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,519
Avoiding her forever
won't resolve this situation.

371
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,604
Will you be quiet? I'm thinking too.

372
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,236
Goodness, please.

373
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,446
-Don't pick up.
-I'll just put it on vibrate.

374
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,283
This ringtone's been
driving me nuts all day.

375
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,742
Hey, hello?

376
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,746
-Did you just hang up?
-Yes.

377
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,581
-You hung up right away?
-Yes.

378
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,791
What?

379
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,669
What was that?

380
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,921
This is…

381
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,883
I'm sorry.
I was only trying to put it on vibrate.

382
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,635
What do I do now?

383
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,764
Why don't you just
keep your phone off today?

384
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,934
Turn the power off
and think about what to…

385
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,478
Hello? Jung-don!

386
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,440
Jung-don!

387
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,775
Hello?

388
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,113
You hung up again!

389
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,614
Are you trying to screw me over?

390
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,159
No way! Your power button is
placed differently than mine.

391
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,660
-You hung up!
-I did?

392
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,746
If anything happens between me and her,
it's your fault.

393
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,788
It's all your fault!

394
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,374
I'm sorry!

395
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,668
He just hung up on Yeo-jeong.

396
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,588
Jin-hyeok.

397
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,966
You just hung up on Yeo-jeong.

398
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,635
You hung up on Yeo-jeong!

399
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,308
Portrait rights and a breach of contract

400
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,851
are the Legal Team's work,

401
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,312
but agents need to know the basics too.

402
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,440
An agent must know everything
regarding an actor's career.

403
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,068
So Hyun-joo. A new agent.

404
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,615
This is the archive.

405
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,494
A room for the scripts we receive.

406
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,996
There are so many.

407
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,708
Everything begins here.

408
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,508
These aren't scripts.

409
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:08,428
These were put together
by Director Jang Myung-aeh.

410
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,931
Ms. Jang is… How can I put this?

411
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,016
She's like…

412
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,560
a living fossil among agents.

413
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,230
She's in charge
of middle-aged actors or older.

414
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,397
Well…

415
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,693
Anyway, she's quite peculiar. You'll see.

416
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,530
I saw earlier

417
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,909
that Ms. Chun had
lots of scripts in her office too.

418
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,036
Ms. Chun is

419
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,414
the first to read all the scripts
that we receive at the agency.

420
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,502
She studies them religiously to see
where she can place our actors.

421
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,963
The only scripts
she doesn't get to read are

422
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,757
the ones Director Ma obtains personally.

423
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:52,430
Ms. Chun's specialty is
stealing other people's scripts.

424
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,516
You be careful too.

425
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,017
Okay.

426
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,686
Follow me.

427
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,439
Right.

428
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,651
Let me show you the craziest thing.

429
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:09,197
It's where we keep the presents
from fans or sponsored goods.

430
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,408
We call it…

431
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:16,746
…the Method Boutique.

432
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,332
Ta-da.

433
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,222
-Isn't it beautiful?
-It is.

434
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,683
This one. Look at this.

435
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,730
Yeo-jeong wore this dress
at the reception for the Academy Awards.

436
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,150
Our agency had it tailored just for her.

437
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,157
She was so thrilled
to be cast in a Tarantino film.

438
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,410
Unbelievable. She's too old?

439
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,287
That's so absurd.

440
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,128
Our field manager.
Nothing happens around here without me.

441
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,797
Hey, Won-jae.

442
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,383
What?

443
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,856
Mr. Kim!

444
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,316
Mr. Kim. What the…

445
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,903
Was Yeo-jeong supposed to come in today?

446
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,074
-No.
-Then why is she coming?

447
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,077
-Who?
-Yeo-jeong.

448
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,828
Where?

449
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,498
Right here. She's at the office now.

450
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:45,252
Won-jae just called.
They just arrived at the parking lot.

451
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,714
"Missed calls."

452
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,007
ACTRESS CHO YEO-JEONG

453
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,596
This is bad. What do I do?

454
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:00,767
Wait a second. Mr. Kim.

455
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,272
Hello.

456
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,653
Hi, Hee-sun!

457
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,071
Hello.

458
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,115
Is Mr. Kim Jung-don in?

459
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,202
No, he's not here.

460
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,870
Really?

461
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,122
Then…

462
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,332
I'll wait in his office.

463
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,919
Hey, Jin-hyeok.

464
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,338
Jin-hyeok.

465
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,259
Goodness, Yeo-jeong. What brings you here?

466
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,845
Where's Jung-don?
We have something to discuss.

467
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,639
I'm not sure. He went out to work.

468
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,808
He might not come in today.

469
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,186
Wait a second.
Did you find a new skincare shop?

470
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,105
Can you tell?

471
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,899
Totally. Your skin is glowing!

472
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,359
My gosh, you look amazing.

473
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,111
I should've switched earlier.

474
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,697
Do you want to go?
You get 15 percent off with my referral.

475
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,949
-I'd love to.
-Really?

476
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,452
-Will you stay here forever?
-But your skin is fine.

477
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,411
-No way.
-Why not?

478
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,585
-It's lunchtime.
-Are you asking me out to lunch?

479
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,920
-Yes.
-Should I go there?

480
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:11,921
What?

481
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,258
-I'd love to.
-I should go.

482
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,594
Even if he's out,
he usually picks up his phone.

483
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,388
-Then can you get the elevator for me?
-Maybe he's busy.

484
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,473
Sure.

485
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,933
No, something is up.

486
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,603
I called him earlier.

487
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,314
-He picked up…
-Yes?

488
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,691
then gasped and hung up on me.

489
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,735
He did that twice already.

490
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,321
-Twice? Goodness.
-I heard it clearly.

491
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,616
I'm a little busy right now,
so I'll see you later.

492
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,117
Could you try calling him?

493
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,202
Sorry?

494
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,372
Can you call Jung-don? Then put me on.

495
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,627
Sure, I can. Of course.

496
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,633
Goodness, I'm getting a call.

497
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,344
Hello?

498
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,637
What?

499
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,222
Your car flipped over?

500
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,932
That's flipping wild!

501
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,309
Did you call the insurance company?
What now?

502
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,603
My gosh, what are you going to do?

503
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,532
Goodness. Here.

504
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,743
-Here.
-Thank you.

505
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,232
What are all those?

506
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:01,072
These? Scripts that the agency received.

507
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,450
I have to read and analyze them.

508
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,784
I see.

509
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:12,125
Do you know the similarity
between those scripts and actors?

510
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,463
We both have to wait until we're chosen.

511
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,806
Cheer up.

512
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,979
Honestly, it's their loss
for not casting you.

513
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,362
What do you mean?

514
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,239
I mean Tarantino.

515
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,867
How can he turn you down
because of your age?

516
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,287
How much younger do they need you to look?

517
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,456
It's unbelievable.

518
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,336
You're right.

519
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,963
Why would they do that?

520
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,259
The doors are closing.

521
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,303
Right, what's your name?

522
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,097
I'm So Hyun-joo.

523
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,225
-Agent So Hyun-joo?
-Yes.

524
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,893
Then I'll see you around.

525
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,104
Cheer up.

526
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,731
You can do it!

527
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,991
What are you doing here?

528
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,911
I got a job here.

529
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,089
Who said you could work here?

530
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,466
Ms. Chun.

531
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,849
I was harsh on you
because it was so sudden.

532
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,016
I apologize for that.

533
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,520
I'll find another agency for you,

534
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,148
-so go back to Busan for now.
-I got a job here on my own.

535
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,485
-I'm going to be an agent--
-How can you…

536
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,326
First…

537
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,828
The doors are closing.

538
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,628
All right.

539
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,880
Keep it up.

540
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,718
Hello.

541
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,229
You're back.

542
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,366
I'll find my way home.

543
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,826
You don't have to drop me off.

544
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,870
What? But why?

545
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,749
I feel like taking a walk today.

546
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,543
You should still take the van.

547
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,961
It's okay. Go now.

548
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,338
Bye.

549
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:08,635
I believe everything I do is
a part of my acting career.

550
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,096
Right now, I'm playing the role
of a temp receptionist.

551
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,516
You know what? I'm actually in a play.

552
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:22,190
It's a modern reinterpretation
of A Streetcar Named Desire.

553
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,694
It's my first role as the lead
after many supporting roles,

554
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,696
so I'm quite worried.

555
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,784
But if you have time, I hope you can come.

556
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,828
If you're busy, you don't have to…

557
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,594
I'm boring you, aren't I?

558
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,305
No, it's not that.

559
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,598
It's all right.

560
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,517
No one at the agency
cares about me anyway.

561
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,894
I'm sorry, Hee-sun.

562
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,813
There's a complicated problem
at the agency.

563
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,149
I was busy thinking about that.

564
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,070
Jung-don! There you are!

565
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,655
Yeo-jeong, how did you find me?

566
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,532
May I?

567
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,327
Why can't I get a hold of you?

568
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,122
I was out of my mind today.

569
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,708
-I see. So you were.
-Yes.

570
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,418
Anyway…

571
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,254
why haven't we received
a call from the US yet?

572
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,547
That?

573
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,091
Well, actually…

574
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,095
-We reevaluated the script…
-Yes?

575
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,555
and felt that it was below your level.

576
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,141
Oh, my. Is it? All of a sudden?

577
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,476
But why?

578
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,103
Well…

579
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,772
parts of it were historically inaccurate,

580
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:11,234
and the way the film
portrayed the female lead

581
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,028
seemed rather archaic.

582
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,863
Is that so?

583
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,408
And I wasn't going to say this, but…

584
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,369
Okay, here it goes.

585
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,164
-The director wants the movie…
-Yes?

586
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,208
to have a male lead.

587
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,293
A male lead?

588
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,837
-Absurd, right?
-All of a sudden?

589
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,797
-How could he do that?
-I see.

590
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,923
Forget it, Yeo-jeong.

591
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:37,009
Don't let it get to you.
We'll find another great film for you.

592
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,139
I might as well retire.

593
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,641
Sorry?

594
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,435
I get that I can get turned down
for a movie.

595
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,397
But my agent is racking his brain
over what lies to tell me

596
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,483
when he should be the one
to look out for me.

597
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,070
Yeo-jeong.

598
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,072
I might as well just quit,

599
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,241
move to the countryside,
and live a quiet life.

600
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,870
It's not like I can trust anyone, right?

601
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,290
Jung-don. How about you become an actor?

602
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,876
Your performance just now gave me chills.

603
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,085
You found a new talent.

604
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,171
It's just that I didn't want you to--

605
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,630
It's all right. Forget it.

606
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:19,594
How do you expect me to continue
working with you like this?

607
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,221
You'll just keep lying to me
in such instances.

608
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,431
Right?

609
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,057
Okay.

610
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,310
It's over with you.

611
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,270
Bye.

612
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,441
Yeo-jeong.

613
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,045
Did you want to see me?

614
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,755
Come in. Close the door.

615
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,928
You know who Director Ma is, right?

616
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,430
-Sorry?
-Did Jin-hyeok not tell you?

617
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,356
Yes, I know him.

618
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,945
I hear he has Kim Eun-hee's new script.

619
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,280
Find out what it's about.

620
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,990
Yes, ma'am.

621
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,684
Eun-soo, can you help me?

622
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,018
No.

623
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,233
There's nothing going on
between Director Ma and me.

624
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,279
As if I'd care about something like that.

625
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,948
Of course, I know that.

626
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,743
Anyway, he and I are not
in any kind of relationship.

627
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,288
I even have a boyfriend.

628
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,373
You do?

629
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,751
Then what happened back there?

630
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,255
That was…

631
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,635
because he saw me taking the scripts
outside of the office,

632
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,471
so he was scolding me
about confidentiality.

633
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,140
Goodness, I see.

634
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,058
How silly of me.

635
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,227
So how can I help you?

636
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,770
Well…

637
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,982
I'm putting together
a list of scripts we have,

638
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,235
and I'm missing the scripts
that Director Ma has.

639
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,822
And I heard

640
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:50,036
that you're the only one who
Director Ma shares his emails with.

641
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:54,165
I hear you are
his most trusted staff here.

642
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:55,791
And?

643
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,461
If you could give me
his email ID and password,

644
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,004
I'll just get the script titles.

645
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,131
Are you nuts?
It's full of confidential information.

646
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,507
Other people can't see that.

647
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,134
I can't do that, ever.

648
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,054
-I'll just look at the script titles.
-No.

649
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,307
-I'm great at keeping secrets.
-Who told her?

650
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,143
Who was it?

651
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,604
Who spilled it?

652
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,981
Who ran their mouth off?

653
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,359
Who told her?

654
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,152
Jung-don, why? What's up?

655
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,989
Someone told Yeo-jeong

656
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,283
that she didn't get the part
because of her age.

657
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,369
Who in their right mind would tell her?

658
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,454
Maybe Star Media did this

659
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,748
to steal her away
once her contract expires.

660
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,874
I'll kill them.

661
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,585
Jung-don, calm down.
You're about to lose it.

662
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,505
Do you know how long I've worked with her?

663
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,547
Jung-don.

664
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,758
-I've been there through ups and downs.
-Yes.

665
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,301
This just can't be.

666
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,552
What are we doing here?

667
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,972
Yeo-jeong is leaving the agency.

668
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,016
Goodness.

669
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,936
Who was it?

670
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,646
This is bad.

671
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,855
Who could it be?

672
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:00,940
Who did this?

673
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,734
-Who was it?
-Jung-don.

674
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,320
-Jung-don.
-Yes, Director.

675
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,364
-Yes.
-Who did this?

676
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,000
Did you want to see me?

677
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,547
Call the CEO of the agency
that represents Tarantino.

678
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,049
-Ask them to spare some time for me.
-Okay.

679
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,384
Also…

680
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,720
don't tell anybody else.

681
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,930
You know that, right?

682
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,473
Yes.

683
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,153
Your call could not be connected.
Please leave a message after the…

684
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,363
She won't even pick up my calls now.

685
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,240
No, I don't think she's even checking.

686
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,493
My friend, could you call her for me?

687
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,871
You're both women
and are around the same age.

688
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,123
I'm not around her age.

689
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,833
My birthday hasn't come up yet.
I'm still in my thirties.

690
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,377
You know how much
of a difference that makes?

691
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,422
-Darn it.
-Enough.

692
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,343
I'm sure she needs some time to think.

693
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,806
Things won't go haywire now,
so give her time until tomorrow morning.

694
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,849
Okay?

695
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,684
Don't you know that she's the type

696
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,061
who turns her back
as soon as she's disappointed?

697
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,897
She may not even want to talk to me.

698
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,650
Should I have told her the truth
from the get-go?

699
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,489
Right?

700
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,657
I would have only upset her.

701
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,460
Seriously? Do you have to do that now?

702
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,253
What? He's good-looking.

703
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,547
Are you made of magnets or something?

704
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,090
You draw men everywhere you go.

705
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,511
And how could he?

706
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,471
Am I invisible to him?

707
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,646
Goodness, my dear Jung-don.

708
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,649
And I found out later

709
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:10,444
that the woman sitting at the next table
was actually Sandra Bullock.

710
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,327
Anyway, Ms. Amy.

711
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,872
-About Tarantino's new film…
-Yes?

712
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,208
I hear 30 percent of it
will be shot in Seoul.

713
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,377
Don't even get me started.

714
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,338
It takes forever
to obtain filming permits.

715
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,091
There's so much paperwork involved.

716
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,636
It'll take much longer than you think.

717
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,304
But this is Tarantino.

718
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,516
If it was up to me,
I would beg him to come over.

719
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,019
Korean civil servants don't even care
who Tarantino is.

720
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,773
They'll get a lot of complaints
if the filming causes inconvenience,

721
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,066
so it won't be easy.

722
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,777
That movie…

723
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:58,033
This one production even waited
for an entire year only to be turned away.

724
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,745
You see,

725
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,998
I have a friend in City Hall

726
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,626
who's in charge of giving filming permits.

727
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,545
And?

728
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:13,465
If you would like,

729
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:17,011
I could put in a good word for you.

730
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,556
Ms. Amy won't pick up my calls.

731
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,684
Could you pass her a word
when she returns?

732
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,354
I wish to speak to her
regarding Cho Yeo-jeong.

733
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:28,939
Yes.

734
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,609
Sorry?

735
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,777
As it was?

736
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,238
He's going to cast her again?

737
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,824
No, I wasn't aware.

738
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:39,992
Yes.

739
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,746
Where's Ms. Amy now?

740
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,789
-Hi.
-Hello.

741
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,792
I'll call you back.

742
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,178
She's waiting in the room.

743
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,888
Yeo-jeong.

744
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,891
Yeo-jeong, I kept calling you.

745
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,976
-Yeo-jeong, wait--
-Mr. Kim.

746
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,561
Not now. This is important.

747
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,980
How could she go into a meeting
without her agent?

748
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,816
This isn't your place.

749
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,403
I have something to ask…

750
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,615
Quentin gave it another thought

751
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,117
and said that
you're perfect for this role.

752
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,620
My gosh, that's great.

753
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,081
This is so great.

754
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,749
He said that he'd give up

755
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,085
all the teenage flashback sequences
for your sake.

756
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:36,715
But he said that the lead
had to be in her twenties,

757
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,763
so we expect you
to make a little bit of an effort.

758
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,264
An effort?

759
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,267
I, Cho Yeo-jeong, am made of effort.

760
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,645
I'll take better care of my skin

761
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,522
and start eating healthier.

762
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,732
Those are all given.

763
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,779
There is a more definitive way.

764
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,116
Definitive?

765
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,456
Don't take this too seriously.

766
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,000
It's like dyeing gray hair.

767
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,836
I don't have gray hair.

768
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,547
Well, what I mean is…

769
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,095
I knew that I'd get
a smaller range of roles as time passed

770
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,975
and braced myself to face this reality.

771
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,855
But now that it's actually happened,

772
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,650
I finally realize that I'm over 40 now.

773
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,157
Here.

774
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,451
Look at this photo.

775
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,453
That's my wife.

776
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,829
How old does she look?

777
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,499
Mid to late-thirties?

778
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,418
She's 51, the same age as me.

779
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,838
No way. Her surgery looks so natural…

780
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,260
Now, she gets Botox shots regularly
for the wrinkles on her forehead

781
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,346
and gets hyaluronic acid injections
for the areas around her mouth.

782
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,515
She did her eyes again to prevent sagging.

783
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,684
I see.

784
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:15,022
Do you not find her unnatural?

785
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,565
Not at all.

786
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,401
It's so natural that I wouldn't even know
unless she told me.

787
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,236
I see.

788
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,950
She'll get the procedure.

789
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,537
Does this mean
she can have the role again?

790
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,874
Then I'll tell her to resume
horseback riding lessons.

791
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,167
Thank you, Ms. Amy.

792
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,938
Is it true

793
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,440
that you're leaving
the agency with Yeo-jeong?

794
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,568
Someone at Ms. Amy's agency said

795
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,280
you two are leaving the agency
and starting a new one.

796
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,408
It's not true, is it?

797
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,369
I must be hearing things, right?

798
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,668
Did she agree to leave with you?

799
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,962
You've seen it yourself, so why ask?

800
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,383
-How could you do this?
-Shouldn't you be thanking me?

801
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,426
You put us in this mess,

802
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,303
and I stepped in to get us out.

803
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,805
Yeo-jeong got her role back.

804
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,391
Does Mr. Wang know?

805
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,727
You planned this
before he went on his vacation, right?

806
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,437
To betray us while he's gone!

807
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,398
That's the thing with you, Mr. Kim.

808
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,941
How is any of that important?

809
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:44,444
Instead of complaining to me,
shouldn't you go find a solution?

810
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,114
You're acting like an amateur.
That's why you lost it all.

811
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,622
Are you not worried
about what people might say?

812
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,543
If the actors found out,
do you think they'll work with you?

813
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,382
Why don't you learn to keep your
subordinates in check first?

814
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,051
Who was it? So Hyun-joo?

815
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:12,431
This happened because she told Yeo-jeong
that she lost the film because of her age.

816
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,434
Are you sure it was her?

817
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,061
How could she be an agent
with such a big mouth?

818
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,563
She's not cut out for the job.

819
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,732
You hired her, so you deal with it.

820
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,032
Who are you to yap around?

821
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,576
Did you lose it
because you saw a celebrity in person?

822
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,786
Why not ask her for a photo
and post it online?

823
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,497
"Hashtag Cho Yeo-jeong. Old.
Turned down because of her age."

824
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,210
Do you know what you've done?

825
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,422
Our biggest actress is leaving us
because of you.

826
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:46,965
I'm sorry.

827
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,260
You would've kept quiet
unless Director Ma told me.

828
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,475
Did he tell you that it was me?

829
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,772
Get out.

830
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,066
Jin-hyeok.

831
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,110
Take away her employee pass.

832
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,001
Why did you tell her that?

833
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,878
I'm sorry.

834
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,091
It's all right.

835
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:35,055
Actually, it might be better to quit
before you actually begin.

836
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,307
Not anyone can survive…

837
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,476
here.

838
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:47,693
Anyway…

839
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,362
Goodbye.

840
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,198
I'm sorry we have to part ways like this.

841
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,661
If fate allows, I'm sure we'll meet again.

842
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,502
Bye.

843
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,571
I hear he has Kim Eun-hee's new script.

844
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:33,989
Find out what it's about.

845
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,908
Should I get the script off Director Ma

846
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,577
and have it summarized for you?

847
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,912
Do you think he'd share it
with us so willingly?

848
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,038
Go read it discreetly.

849
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,415
Got it?

850
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,737
You've zoned out completely, haven't you?

851
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,495
A star agent who runs off
to start a new agency with an actor…

852
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,121
It happens a lot in this field.

853
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,626
It's a wonder how someone as competent
as Director Ma stuck around this long.

854
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,170
I didn't think Yeo-jeong
would be the one to go.

855
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,297
So? Will you just sit there?

856
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,550
Director Ma will take good care of her.

857
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,844
He's very competent, you see.

858
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,972
Do you seriously think so?

859
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:26,977
That Director Ma will take better care
of Cho Yeo-jeong than you?

860
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,979
Is that why he told her…

861
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,149
to get lipo injections on her face?

862
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,866
Just lie around all day long.

863
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:47,122
I heard pumpkin
is great for a swollen face.

864
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:51,084
Or was it spinach?

865
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,827
What?

866
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:34,920
Yeo-jeong?

867
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,800
Good job.

868
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,553
Yeo-jeong.

869
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,722
-Watch out.
-My gosh.

870
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,101
What's with your horse?

871
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,187
It has tattoos.

872
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,230
What is this?

873
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,901
This…

874
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,486
Where did you get this?

875
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,820
No idea.

876
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,366
You lied to me
about getting better at riding?

877
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,284
I wasn't lying.

878
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,120
I'll be good after a little more practice.

879
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,664
You liar.

880
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,625
What about you?

881
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,753
I had no choice.

882
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:20,674
You were so thrilled
to have been cast in that film.

883
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:24,094
I didn't want you to be upset.
I was trying not to hurt you.

884
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,553
Forget it.

885
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:30,392
-Forget what? I was worried about you.
-Forget it, you liar.

886
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,978
You're the liar. This is a huge lie.

887
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,397
You liar.

888
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,483
-What? You're being immature.
-You can't say that. How old are you?

889
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,652
What's age got to do with anything?
I look older than you.

890
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:44,948
Stop shouting.
These horses are very sensitive!

891
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,075
-Stop shouting!
-You're louder than I am!

892
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,327
-I am not!
-Be careful over there!

893
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,496
A horse is coming! Get out of the way!

894
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,171
-Over here?
-Gosh, right there.

895
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,090
Here? Are you okay?

896
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,968
Be a man, will you?

897
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,054
Only I could catch you
that quickly, Yeo-jeong.

898
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,848
Goodness, you liar.

899
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,521
What about the clinic?

900
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,816
My reservation is at five o'clock.

901
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,819
Why? Are you here to stop me?

902
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,033
It's fine.

903
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,285
This isn't a big deal.

904
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,580
I knew I would face a day
when I'd have to do this.

905
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,373
The thought has crossed my mind.

906
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,755
It's not like I'm going off to die.

907
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,131
I'm fine.

908
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,052
Yeo-jeong.

909
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,597
No matter what choice you make,

910
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,350
to me, you are the best actor ever.

911
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,569
Come to the clinic with me.

912
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,530
I don't want to go alone,

913
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,575
but I don't want to go with anyone else.

914
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,010
You can take the stairs there.

915
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,637
I know.

916
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,763
I'll be fine.

917
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,266
Go now. Bye.

918
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,871
Ms. Cho Yeo-jeong,
please come to the procedure room.

919
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:57,956
Okay.

920
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,189
Yeo-jeong.

921
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,026
My gosh. Have you been waiting for me?

922
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,570
How can I just leave you here and go?

923
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,948
Are you all right?

924
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,534
Did it go well?

925
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:22,582
Yeo-jeong, stop that. Come on.

926
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,125
There are people around.

927
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,460
Look at my face.

928
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,378
I'm not ready to see this.

929
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,047
Look.

930
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,768
Did they give you fake injections?
Did they scam you?

931
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,895
Is it because
you're too famous to complain?

932
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,647
I didn't get it.

933
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,066
-What?
-Can't you tell?

934
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,526
I didn't get the procedure.

935
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,236
Why not?

936
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,280
I already look young enough.

937
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,617
If I look even younger,
it'll be tougher for me to get offers.

938
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,077
Yeo-jeong.

939
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,539
I'll just live as who I am.

940
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,833
If I get older, I'll accept it.
That's natural.

941
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,545
I'm hungry. Let's eat something.

942
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,629
Sounds great.

943
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,880
Let's go!

944
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,757
Let's go get some delicious food!

945
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,931
The breeze is so cool!

946
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,391
-Isn't it great?
-Yes!

947
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:28,565
I feel like I can go anywhere from now on.

948
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:32,777
No matter where it is,
I'll take you there, Yeo-jeong!

949
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,945
-Let's go!
-Really?

950
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,659
Jung-don.

951
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,453
Will you continue to be my agent?

952
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,539
Of course, Yeo-jeong.

953
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:48,459
I'll remain your agent
until you turn 100 and wrinkly.

954
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,713
Don't you bring up wrinkles again.
That's off-limits for now.

955
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,674
We'll get lipo injections together then.

956
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,051
-What?
-We'll get the procedure together!

957
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,095
I don't want to!

958
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,850
-Did you talk it out with Yeo-jeong?
-Hello.

959
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,395
Okay, good work. Wrap it up, then.

960
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,606
Okay.

961
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,618
What are you doing here?

962
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,621
I have something to tell you.

963
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,581
-Go while I'm still nice.
-Here.

964
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,795
This is Kim Eun-hee's script.

965
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,922
-You told me to bring--
-When did I say that?

966
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,257
I told you to read it discreetly.

967
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,853
I'm sorry for what happened last time.

968
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,357
I won't repeat the same mistake
ever again.

969
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,864
Please give me another chance.

970
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,327
I'll do my very best if you do.

971
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,984
Follow me.

972
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,572
Okay.

973
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,371
ACTRESS CHO YEO-JEONG

974
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,916
I'm sorry, but let's drop our contract.

975
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,728
-Goodness, Jin-hyeok.
-What do you think?

976
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,980
I told you to use size 12 font.

977
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,356
I'm sorry. Take mine.

978
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,691
Goodness.

979
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,234
-Over here.
-I'll take it.

980
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:21,112
-I'm too young to use reading glasses.
-Come on, Jin-hyeok.

981
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,032
What is this?

982
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,201
Did we change the air purifier?

983
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:30,413
The air in here seems
extra pleasant today.

984
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:36,461
Is it because Yeo-jeong
renewed her contract with us?

985
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,838
You lost a huge film yet look excited.

986
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,382
We managed to keep
Ms. Cho Yeo-jeong instead.

987
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:44,802
I wonder if you'll do all right

988
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,721
starting a new agency without an actor.

989
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:53,102
It's an international call.
Maybe it's Mr. Wang.

990
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,479
Put him on speakerphone.

991
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:57,231
-We should report to him what happened.
-Of course.

992
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,275
-Mr. Wang.
-Hello?

993
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,360
-Mr. Wang! Are you doing well?
-Mr. Wang!

994
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,403
Is it nice there?

995
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,906
Are you doing the samba?

996
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,032
Hello?

997
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,284
It's not him.

998
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,577
May I ask who is calling?

999
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,996
This is the Korean embassy in Brazil.

1000
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,415
I could not reach
Mr. Wang Tae-ja's guardian,

1001
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,334
so I called you instead.

1002
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,919
Yes, I see.

1003
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,420
What does this concern?

1004
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:21,964
I'm afraid I have bad news.

1005
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:26,344
Mr. Wang Tae-ja has passed away.

1006
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:28,805
-What?
-Wait, what are you talking about?

1007
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,598
He passed away?

1008
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:35,311
I'm sorry to be
the bearer of such tragic news.

1009
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,820
Wait, what do you mean?

1010
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,072
Yes.

1011
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,116
When?

1012
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:50,993
Are you sure?

1013
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:55,331
Yes, all of the staff are here.

1014
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:56,958
Yes.

1015
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,961
Yes, let us know when it's been confirmed.

1016
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,220
BEHIND EVERY STAR

1017
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,498
I'm thinking of selling the company.

1018
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,458
Do you think this is what Tae-ja wanted?

1019
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,085
Who are you to judge my acting?

1020
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:43,796
Two actors in the same agency
competing for a role?

1021
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,923
Don't you know about Sun-kyu and Hee-jun?

1022
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,968
I can't seem to reach Hee-jun.

1023
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,095
You can't just leave this shit behind you.

1024
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,638
That's so selfish of you!

1025
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:56,601
This is why Mr. Wang brought Director Ma
instead of making you the director.

1026
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,227
I'm an actor. My name is Ko Eun-gyul.

1027
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,687
What's going on between you two?

1028
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,480
I'm Director Ma Tae-oh's wife.

1029
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,524
Don't you dare mess with my family,
or I'm going to make you pay.

1030
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,610
