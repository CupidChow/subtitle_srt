1
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,952
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,206
EPISODE 5

3
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,716
My lady.

4
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,135
My lady?

5
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,990
Good grief.

6
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,367
Why won't you stick to the script?

7
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,660
What do you mean?

8
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,245
We'd be done if you went along.

9
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,955
It doesn't say you're to push me!

10
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,333
It's there in the actions.
"Passionately approaches."

11
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,667
Damn it, my head hurts.

12
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,086
Director.

13
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,796
Hurry over. Good grief.

14
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,423
-What's wrong?
-I mean, I am…

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,176
I'm the daughter of the richest man
in Gyeongseong.

16
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,220
And he's just a rickshaw driver.

17
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,515
How can a rickshaw driver
treat a noble like this?

18
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,599
It's so crude.

19
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,018
People may really take you
for a spoiled noble.

20
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,730
You're dying to be treated
like a star actress.

21
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,069
Ho-san.

22
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,656
Can we please try to be more graceful?

23
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,283
You keep pushing
and pulling me as you like.

24
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,036
Are you trying to show off
how strong you are?

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,246
Good grief.

26
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,123
You've changed so much.

27
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,291
I can't do this.

28
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,502
Those are my words!

29
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,045
Goodness. Good grief.

30
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,797
-One second.
-Forget it.

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,298
She's leaving the scene.

32
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,633
Oh Na-ra refuses to shoot!

33
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,969
-You've changed with popularity!
-Shut the hell up!

34
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,470
What was that?

35
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,181
-Hold on, let go. Are you cussing at me?
-No, wait.

36
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,267
Do it. Go on.

37
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,018
What did you say? Go ahead.

38
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,814
How much do we have left?

39
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,483
-We still have a lot left to shoot.
-Hey, what was that?

40
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,610
-What do we do?
-Are you mocking me?

41
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,320
For goodness' sake.

42
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,615
Hey! Where's their agent?

43
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,380
You're up.

44
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,258
I have to get to work. Get dressed.

45
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,217
A few more minutes.

46
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,218
MANAGER KIM JUNG-DON

47
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,970
Wait, I need to see my phone.

48
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,974
Hey, Jung-don.

49
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,185
-Why weren't you picking up?
-Sorry.

50
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,648
Won-jae just called.
The set is a huge mess right now.

51
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,738
Ho-san and Na-ra kept on fighting,

52
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,032
so all filming came to a halt.

53
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,034
What's with them?

54
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,871
Anyway, about Mr. Lee Sang-uk.

55
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,497
What about him?

56
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,668
The embezzlement info
we saw related to Mr. Wang.

57
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,794
Right.

58
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,172
After seeing that, I've lost my appetite.

59
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,133
What if our company is ruined?

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,427
Hey, look at that punk.

61
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,640
What? Why is he here?

62
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,600
Does he live nearby?

63
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,268
Man, what an awful start to the day.

64
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,228
I miss you already.

65
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,312
Good grief.

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,236
Happy birthday, daughter.

67
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,820
Did you get the seaweed soup?

68
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,239
Are you doing well?

69
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,866
I'm doing well. Everything is well.

70
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,159
So Hyun-joo.

71
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,163
I'll call you later.

72
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,547
Here. Take this.

73
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,095
What's this?

74
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,263
A birthday present.

75
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,307
It's for actor Kim Soo-ro,

76
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,226
so give it to Ms. Chun when she gets in.

77
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,070
What's that? A present?
What's the occasion?

78
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,863
There is no occasion.

79
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,497
-We don't have any lines.
-You don't?

80
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,957
Well, I do.

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,459
-I'm in a scene with Park Ho-san.
-Gosh.

82
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,628
-This is bad.
-What is?

83
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,755
If you make a blooper
while acting out a line,

84
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,882
you'll be in hot water.

85
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,428
Yes, I had a scene with Ho-san
during Pegasus Market.

86
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,264
I felt so pressured
that my mind went blank.

87
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,348
I can still feel it.

88
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,058
Gosh, good luck.

89
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,977
Can we start eating?

90
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,937
Give us a moment.

91
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,605
What are we having?

92
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,357
-It's Park Ho-san!
-Stir-fried pork?

93
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,526
-Turn slowly.
-I hope it's stir-fried pork tomorrow.

94
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,612
Ho-san, Ms. Oh is on standby.

95
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,657
She has to leave before two o'clock
to shoot a variety show.

96
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,242
Tell her to wait.

97
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,454
We have to eat to work.
She's not the only one who's busy.

98
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,874
-Tell her to wait a moment.
-She always makes me wait.

99
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,085
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

100
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,088
You're the maid.

101
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,214
Yes.

102
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,341
-Are you Maid One or Two?
-I'm Maid Three.

103
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,260
Then you have a scene with me.

104
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,345
-Yes, tomorrow. Scene 60.
-Right.

105
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,389
It's such an honor.

106
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,515
It's nothing.

107
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,225
I'm with Method Entertainment too.

108
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,894
Really? My agency?

109
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,437
I see.

110
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,646
I didn't know.

111
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,648
You must be nervous.

112
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,776
Yes, very much.

113
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,528
You'll get used to it soon
after being on set a few times.

114
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,781
She'll leave if you don't come.

115
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,033
Tell her to go.
She does everything she wants,

116
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,077
but she can't wait 30 minutes
for me to eat?

117
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,913
She always books everything
according to her schedule.

118
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,164
What does she think…

119
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,209
Shall we rehearse the lines for tomorrow?

120
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,127
-Really?
-Yes, let me see it.

121
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,004
I would be grateful.

122
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,131
We're with the same agency.
I can do that much.

123
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,049
Shall we?

124
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,763
You're nothing but a rickshaw driver.

125
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,140
How dare you speak like that to my lady?

126
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,854
You clearly look like a servant.

127
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,445
That's all…

128
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,365
You're good.

129
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,618
Your lines were spot on.

130
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,204
I almost thought you meant it.

131
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,789
You must've practiced a lot.

132
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,375
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

133
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,378
Go ahead and eat. I have a scene to shoot.

134
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,462
Goodbye.

135
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,131
We're on our way. Standby.

136
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,845
If it's for you, my lady,

137
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,349
I do not care
what happens to my insignificant life.

138
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,979
But if you fall in danger because of me,

139
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,856
I can't…

140
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,524
This is driving me insane.

141
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,776
I can't work like this.

142
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,241
Did you think this would work?

143
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,910
Are you testing my acting skills?

144
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,663
-When is Na-ra returning?
-In about four hours.

145
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,874
-How many hours?
-Four.

146
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,711
She's an actress!

147
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,798
How can an actress shoot a variety show
in the middle of shooting a movie?

148
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,092
How does that make sense?

149
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,805
I'm not doing it. I'm done too.
See you in four hours.

150
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,183
-I'm done. Let's do it when Na-ra's back.
-Wait. Ho-san.

151
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,186
No, tell Na-ra to wait four hours
once she gets back.

152
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,147
Ho-san.

153
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,273
Darn it.

154
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,317
Hey, Assistant Director.

155
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,030
Never mind. This must be hard on you too.

156
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,077
Let go of me, damn it.

157
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,746
-We're here.
-Ho-san.

158
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,540
Great work, everyone. Damn it.

159
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,666
Ho-san.

160
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,460
Hey. What happened?

161
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,003
I don't know why he's like that.

162
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,422
They fight whenever they see each other.

163
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,216
I'm stuck in the middle going crazy.

164
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,010
All right. Get some rest in the car.

165
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,311
Great work.

166
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,648
Na-ra, welcome back.

167
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,316
-Hey.
-Hi.

168
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,319
It's no use if you came
to get us to make up.

169
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,655
That man lacks the basics.

170
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,156
-Okay?
-Basics?

171
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,074
Hey.

172
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,911
You know I try extra hard
because I don't want people

173
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,413
looking down on me
just because I majored in dance.

174
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,498
Of course, Na-ra.

175
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,209
But Ho-san never analyzes his characters.

176
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,294
His character is
a romantic rickshaw driver.

177
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,799
But he's acting like
some ignorant, vulgar savage.

178
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,509
I thought he was a theater major.

179
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,678
I wonder why. Did he lose his touch?

180
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,348
Maybe he's doing that on purpose
to make you stand out more.

181
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,474
As if.

182
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,227
Ho-san was thrilled
to be cast alongside you.

183
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,937
He watched all your work too.

184
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,188
Why would he do that?

185
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,233
Na-ra, I checked
with the production on my way here.

186
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,819
The rough edit is already good.
You look great in it.

187
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,530
You'll be so proud once this premieres.

188
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,157
-They said I look good?
-Yes.

189
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,618
You've worked so hard until now.
Hang in there, okay?

190
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,498
Fine.

191
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,168
I'm still her senior,

192
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,546
but she always tells me off
in front of the crew.

193
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,674
She must think
she's really a lady of noble blood.

194
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,719
And her performance?

195
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,431
One time, the director asked her
to improvise a little more in the lead.

196
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,890
Do you know what she said?

197
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,727
"It's raining right now."

198
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,813
"The sky must be crying in my place."

199
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,399
Crying, my foot.
Is she some teenager? It's just rain.

200
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,900
Are you even listening?

201
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,905
Right. So? What happened?

202
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,117
-Forget it. I was talking to myself.
-I was listening.

203
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,870
So Na-ra tells you off and stuff?

204
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,790
Exactly. I play a rickshaw driver,
so she thinks I actually am one.

205
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,585
One time, she forgot her lines
and needed the script,

206
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,296
so I gave her mine.
But she held it like this

207
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,298
as if I had germs, saying "Oh, my."

208
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,259
Your damn phone keeps ringing.
Just reply right now.

209
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,094
I'm sorry. I'll set it to silent.

210
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,554
No, just reply now.

211
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
No, don't mind me. It's fine.

212
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,351
It's a guy. I don't want you
to blame me for your break up.

213
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,727
Just reply right now.

214
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,939
Can I?

215
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,150
Just ten seconds.

216
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,321
What does he do?

217
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,989
What?

218
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,784
He's an office worker.

219
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,996
I can tell by your face
that you're serious about this one.

220
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,708
At first, I thought he wasn't my type.

221
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,502
But it's really odd.

222
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,672
I keep getting drawn to him.

223
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,259
Once I opened up the door to my heart,

224
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,096
I began to see his charms

225
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,516
and I got carried away and fell for him.

226
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,684
Those are the good times.

227
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,523
Ho-san, you should try
to open the door to your heart.

228
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,982
Open it wide.

229
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,652
You two were close like real siblings

230
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,154
up until you two were in My Mister.

231
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,241
Exactly. We were so close back then.

232
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,915
JOO HA-MIN AND LEE OK-JA
ARE 99.9999 PERCENT RELATED

233
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,251
How?

234
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,003
How could you fool me like this?

235
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,964
Ha-min, Mom is sorry.

236
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,216
-Let me explain.
-Enough! That's enough!

237
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,263
Ha-min.

238
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,557
Don't say you're my mom.

239
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,104
Ha-min, don't do that. Stop it.

240
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,774
I'll…

241
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,862
I'll no longer call you my mom.

242
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,698
Because…

243
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,284
Because you're…

244
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,743
my father!

245
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,037
Ha-min.

246
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,206
Listen to me, Ha-min.

247
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,004
Ha-min.

248
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,222
Do you need an explanation?

249
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:50,060
But you can't suddenly kill off
the most popular character on the show.

250
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,812
You just saw him.

251
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,649
What will you do about his poor acting?

252
00:12:56,233 --> 00:13:00,446
Even my husband began to laugh out loud
at Youngtak's awful performance.

253
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,573
It was humiliating!

254
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:06,243
-Please calm down.
-I need to get rid of him from my show!

255
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,001
I want to kill him off right away,

256
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,712
but I'm letting you know beforehand
because he's with you.

257
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,547
Joo Ha-min…

258
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,549
I'll kill him no matter what!

259
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,178
Send some abalone to the writer's office.

260
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,389
"Ms. Kang, I'm sorry.
I will strive to be better from now on."

261
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,975
"From Youngtak."
And "Joo Ha-min" in parentheses.

262
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,478
-It's important. So make it look good.
-Yes, sir.

263
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,191
Oh, no.

264
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,985
The rumors of Youngtak
dropping out must be true.

265
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,779
Tell me about it.

266
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,782
Director Ma must be worried sick again.

267
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,743
He's become quite worn out lately.

268
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,081
My mom will be so disappointed.

269
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:56,418
She's the vice president
of Youngtak's fan club in Busan.

270
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,589
She loves him so much
that she watches all the reruns.

271
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,887
Should I leak that Youngtak
might leave the drama to her?

272
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,100
If his fans protest, we might be
able to stop him from getting kicked off.

273
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,604
What is it?

274
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,816
I mean, your idea was just so adorable.

275
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,322
Do you

276
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,825
have to go?

277
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,245
Once this rain stops,

278
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,790
I must leave.

279
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,252
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,880
Okay, good.

281
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,548
Yes, keep going.

282
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,803
Please don't cry
because of someone like me.

283
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,018
-What are you doing?
-What?

284
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,895
Why did you wipe my tears?

285
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,022
Because I told you not to cry.

286
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,774
I couldn't get into this,
so I had to force myself to cry.

287
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,193
-Why did you do that?
-I was sticking to the script.

288
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,613
I'm telling you not to cry
so I should be wiping it.

289
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,156
-Why wouldn't I?
-No good. Cut.

290
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,532
It's not in the direction!

291
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,743
Do actors only act out the directions?

292
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,996
Would it say, "Say goodbye,
then wave the right hand ten times"?

293
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,749
What are you screaming for?

294
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,460
-Enough.
-I know you wiped it on purpose!

295
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:23,380
You know it's hard for me to cry
because of my dry eyes!

296
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,257
Then you should carry artificial tears!

297
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,634
It's your fault!

298
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,427
-You call yourself an actor?
-What else would I be?

299
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,596
-That's enough.
-I'm going to kill him.

300
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,014
-Assistant Director.
-Yes, sir.

301
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,307
Don't touch me!

302
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,142
-Are you here on a picnic?
-What? Get back here!

303
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,602
Get back here. You!

304
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,854
Good grief, the set is a huge mess.

305
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,564
-Come here, you jerk!
-Should I go?

306
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,857
-You jerk!
-Let them be.

307
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,151
-Come here. Don't stop me!
-Let's see who wins.

308
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,653
You were really good.

309
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,529
-Really?
-I was surprised.

310
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,323
Keep it up.

311
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,992
-Mr. Kim!
-Hee-sun.

312
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,330
He's a manager from my agency.
I'm with Method Entertainment.

313
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,915
He must be here to root for me.

314
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,292
-Yes, hello.
-Hello.

315
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,171
-So? Are you nervous?
-A little.

316
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,717
-I met Ho-san a moment ago.
-And?

317
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,010
He saw me do my lines

318
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,595
and complimented me!

319
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,805
-Really?
-Yes.

320
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,390
-Ho-san did?
-Yes.

321
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,558
See? I told you not to worry.

322
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,519
Don't get nervous and act naturally.

323
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,812
-Okay?
-Okay.

324
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,648
One second.

325
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,818
-Hello.
-Hello?

326
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,570
Oh, that?

327
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,948
One second. Let me ask my agency.

328
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,410
Do I get tickets for the film preview?

329
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,328
Yes, sure.

330
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,249
I can get one or two tickets.

331
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,209
Hee-sun, I'll get going.

332
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,961
Good luck later. You got this!

333
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,379
Goodbye. Bye.

334
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,257
Park Ho-san?

335
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,634
I saw him. I said hi to him too.

336
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,677
Yes.

337
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,348
So I thought about this
from a fan's perspective.

338
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,686
People love that drama
because of Youngtak, right?

339
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,273
The main viewers are housewives.

340
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:10,154
So what I mean is that we should
mobilize Youngtak's fans as a group.

341
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,073
So what? You want to threaten the writer?

342
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,283
That's it.

343
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,244
They can protest
in front of the writer's studio.

344
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,497
-But…
-This actually happened overseas.

345
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,874
What is this?

346
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,294
Are people throwing feces at the window?

347
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,628
That's disgusting!

348
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,797
Are you trying to be funny?

349
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,383
Stop talking nonsense
and go help Soo-hyun.

350
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,178
She's having a tough time
scheduling her nanny.

351
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,179
Yes, sir.

352
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,599
That's gross.

353
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,351
Throwing feces?

354
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,026
Agents, how do you think
this film will turn out?

355
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,615
I think it'll flop.

356
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,618
That can't happen.
You know we invested in this film too.

357
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,869
Hang in there, Director.

358
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,037
Do you know

359
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,582
how many days we are behind right now?

360
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,670
The kiss scene has to be tomorrow
due to other reschedulings.

361
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,756
Goodness, tomorrow night is…

362
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,301
-We will manage to do our best.
-Yes.

363
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,511
Assistant Director.

364
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,888
-Hey, Assistant Director.
-Yes?

365
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,431
The kiss scene?

366
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,974
The kiss scene?

367
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,561
It will turn out unbelievable,
don't you think?

368
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,856
We'll persuade them so that
the kiss scene will look great.

369
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,358
Don't worry.

370
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,948
Anyway, you two are responsible.

371
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,575
If we can't shoot the scene tomorrow,

372
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,787
I'm done with this film.

373
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,622
Got it?

374
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,085
So should we reschedule?

375
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,586
Go away. Leave me alone!

376
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,923
Goodbye.

377
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,014
Is the kiss scene necessary?

378
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,600
You can't take out
the kiss scene in a romantic film.

379
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,727
And you okayed it
when you read the script.

380
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,272
I thought it'd be fine back then.

381
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,567
But look at how Ho-san is behaving.
How can I get in the mood to do it?

382
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,403
A kiss scene isn't a big deal.

383
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,405
Just let your lips collide,

384
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,951
mix up what's inside your mouth,
and move your head around.

385
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,411
That's all you need to do.

386
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,039
Ho-san, just think of this
as an action scene.

387
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,376
Can't we film this
symbolically and indirectly?

388
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,587
What's indirect and symbolic?

389
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,756
You know, it's a kiss scene

390
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,800
so the lips are about to meet,

391
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,262
but right before they do, the camera pans

392
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,264
to two birds mating.

393
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,266
This isn't a film from the '80s.

394
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,519
Then another one.
Our lips are coming together.

395
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,646
And right before our lips meet,

396
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,648
a woodpecker is seen on a tree,

397
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,776
-hitting its head.
-I feel small when I'm before her,

398
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,197
like an insignificant actor who can't act.

399
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,283
Goodness, what are you saying, Ho-san?

400
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,872
Among the actors in their fifties,
you're the coolest and the sexiest.

401
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,708
Among their fifties?

402
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,839
You got this!

403
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,426
Can they really do
the kiss scene tomorrow?

404
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,470
They aren't kids.

405
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,057
We barely persuaded them.
Who knows what might happen tomorrow.

406
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,560
Let's eat first.
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

407
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,397
Yes, okay. All right. I'll let them know.

408
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,523
Okay.

409
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,569
-Ms. Chun.
-What is it?

410
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,490
The Legal Team read over the contract
and sent it to you via email.

411
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,991
They want you to check.

412
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,243
Okay, I'll do that.

413
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,869
-And Hyun-joo…
-Yes?

414
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,080
Happy birthday.

415
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,750
Thank you.

416
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,294
Later, Jin-hyeok and I--

417
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,881
Yes, later, put the script together
and email it to me. I'll be reading it.

418
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,091
Bye.

419
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:18,902
My gosh!

420
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,540
Come on in.

421
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,961
How did you know I was here?

422
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,464
I checked your receipts.

423
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,303
Method Entertainment rented out
the second and fifth floors for the staff.

424
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,429
And my room number?

425
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,764
I asked one of the employees.

426
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,058
I told them I was
from the National Tax Service.

427
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,351
You're not joining me?

428
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,896
Aren't you happy to see me?

429
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,779
Sang-uk, I'm not here to play.
I'm here to work.

430
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,323
You can't barge in without telling me…

431
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,202
My hands are full
with things happening on set,

432
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,204
and Jung-don and I
are meeting over dinner.

433
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,789
You're eating dinner with him?

434
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,583
Of course, we're on a business trip.

435
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,168
Jane.

436
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,878
Wait, Jane.

437
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,507
Sang-uk.

438
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,179
Oh, no.

439
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,723
Are you okay?

440
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,935
Oh, no.

441
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,070
DO NOT CANCEL YOUNGTAK
SAVE JOO HA-MIN

442
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,744
DO NOT CANCEL YOUNGTAK
SAVE JOO HA-MIN

443
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,308
There's the sugar rush I needed.

444
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,522
Hey, Mom.

445
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,858
Yes, it's just as I said before.

446
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,153
I put together this petition.

447
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,116
It's a petition that asks
to save Joo Ha-min on the show,

448
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:33,286
so you can just upload
everything I give you on the fansite.

449
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,290
Yes.

450
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,586
Mom, one second.

451
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,713
CHOI JIN-HYEOK

452
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,258
Come out now. What's keeping you?

453
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,055
Does that hurt?

454
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,975
A little lower.

455
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,687
-Here?
-Yes, right there. That's good.

456
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,896
What about here?

457
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,691
-That's good.
-What about here?

458
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,989
You just slipped. That's all.
Don't be a baby.

459
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,492
Why weren't you more careful?

460
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,288
What if you hurt your back badly?

461
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,623
Then I'll have to take responsibility.

462
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,463
I didn't know how to react before.

463
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,092
I've had many guys who followed me around,

464
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,762
but you're the first one
who followed me on a business trip.

465
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,728
I came because I missed you.

466
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,903
I told you, didn't I?

467
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,364
It's tough to juggle work and dating.

468
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,744
Don't try so hard at both.

469
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,789
You can do your job
as much as you want, Jane.

470
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,834
I can do the dating for you.

471
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,216
When you get busy,
I can always come and visit you like this.

472
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,771
Hey.

473
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,108
Yes?

474
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,486
It's me. Let's go eat. Hurry up.

475
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,279
I'm starving.

476
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,865
I'm not feeling well, so I'll stay in.

477
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,784
Then I'll get you some porridge.

478
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,410
There's a porridge place nearby.

479
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,621
-A bowl of tuna porridge?
-No!

480
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,165
No, I'll get some air. One second.

481
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,250
Come on out.

482
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:48,088
-Five, four, three…
-I'll be quick.

483
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,382
-two, one.
-Will you come back soon?

484
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,802
-Half of one.
-Stay right here. I'll be back soon.

485
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,389
I'm starving. Let's go.

486
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,446
At times, I begin to wonder

487
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:18,159
how well we really know each other.

488
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,412
I mean, apart from work.

489
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,997
What else should we know?

490
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,457
Well, for example,

491
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,252
-you know, our lives.
-Sure.

492
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,630
And you know, love and such.

493
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,717
Look at us.

494
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,054
We're so busy looking after actors
that we put our lives on hold.

495
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,433
Is this the right thing to do?

496
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,018
Are you happy?

497
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,896
I hope the kiss scene goes well
on set tomorrow. I'm worried.

498
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,357
Yes, right.

499
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,485
It's really important. That kiss scene.

500
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,448
But at least for now,
let's not talk about work.

501
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,783
-Let's have a sincere conversation
-I'm full.

502
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,327
about us…

503
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,996
I'm stuffed. I'm getting sleepy.

504
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,333
-I'm calling it a night, my friend.
-What?

505
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,501
You eat up and get going too. Good night.

506
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,711
Okay.

507
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:37,238
Happy birthday to you

508
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,242
Happy birthday to you

509
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:46,039
Happy birthday, dear Hyun-joo

510
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:52,712
Happy birthday to you

511
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,173
Come on, Hyun-joo.

512
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,509
It's not like the world is over.

513
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,261
Are you down because you're 24 now?

514
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,805
Gosh, I am…

515
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,348
One, two…

516
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,642
Goodness.

517
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,103
I'll be 30 soon.

518
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,521
It's not that.

519
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,484
It seems like my birthday was forgotten.

520
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,069
By who?

521
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,243
Someone I earnestly hoped…

522
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,745
would remember.

523
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,373
Who? Make them say happy birthday.

524
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,417
What's the problem?

525
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,127
But it's past midnight.

526
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,982
That's the thing with life

527
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,192
as an agent.

528
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,196
You're so busy celebrating
occasions for other people

529
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,741
that it's not easy to celebrate your own.

530
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,660
You end up skipping it altogether
when you're busy.

531
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,081
Jin-hyeok.

532
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,668
I won't forget your birthday.

533
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,713
I'll make sure we celebrate.

534
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,134
Okay.

535
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:26,431
Then let's make sure
we celebrate each other's birthdays.

536
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,682
It's a promise.

537
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,186
Promise.

538
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,608
I had lunch with my father today.

539
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,447
He's quite worried about you.

540
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,119
You refused your chance
to move to Star Media

541
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,955
to stay with Method
whose future looks bleak.

542
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,999
So of course, he's worried.

543
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,461
He was never interested in this field.

544
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,422
Why are you like that
when I talk about my father?

545
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,508
He's just worried.

546
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,470
He never approved of what I did.

547
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,389
But he's interested now
when I'm about to be ruined.

548
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,353
Forget it. I shouldn't have brought it up.

549
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,024
I have good news, but I'm not telling you.

550
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,030
What is it?

551
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,532
Tell me.

552
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,867
Whatever. I'm not telling.

553
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,538
-I'm going to sleep.
-Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

554
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:37,043
I was wrong. So tell me.

555
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,257
The money to acquire Method Entertainment.

556
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,802
My father will lend it to you.

557
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,013
He said he would do that?

558
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,145
To be exact, I made the offer.

559
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,233
Once we acquire the shares,

560
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,529
you'll become the president
of Method Entertainment.

561
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,670
-Hello.
-Hello.

562
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,881
-Was your stay all right?
-Yes, I slept well.

563
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,090
All right.

564
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,217
Right, sir.

565
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,220
I'll add the extra charge
for the single room,

566
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,139
so you can pay at checkout.

567
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,307
Sure.

568
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,851
Wait, extra charge?

569
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:38,563
Last night, there was
one more guest in room 501.

570
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,231
We charge extra as a policy

571
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,067
when there is an additional guest
in a single room.

572
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,402
I see.

573
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,949
Extra?

574
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,081
Hey! It's me. Open the door.

575
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,958
I'm still getting ready. Wait.

576
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,377
It's an emergency. Open up now.

577
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,879
Why? What is it?

578
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,505
-I need to poop.
-Go to your room!

579
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,798
The housekeeper is there.

580
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,300
Hey!

581
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,594
Hey, the bathroom. Over here.

582
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,846
-My tummy hurts.
-It's over here.

583
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,265
Man, Jung-don.

584
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,352
Hey, you had a warm bath?
Don't you have a lot of body heat?

585
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,271
-Aren't you going to poop?
-It went back inside.

586
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,232
I couldn't sleep at night.

587
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,817
I got hungry while working.

588
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,195
Stop lying. There are two glasses.

589
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,905
I was stressed out at night.

590
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,824
-Get out. I need to pack.
-So you ordered it alone, poured it alone,

591
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,327
-and made a toast alone?
-Why can't I?

592
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,912
I can't do that.

593
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,080
Hey!

594
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,939
Since when?

595
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,149
It hasn't been long. Since last week.

596
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,027
Why didn't you tell me?

597
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,073
Do I have to report
the details of my love life to you?

598
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,159
He's not just anybody.
He's the tax investigator.

599
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,829
He's the Grim Reaper
who came to take us down.

600
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,831
I thought it through before I did this.

601
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,916
What if you dump him?

602
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,626
He might take it out on the agency.

603
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,838
I'll make sure I won't bring
any damage to the company. Don't worry.

604
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,381
As if.

605
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,592
You'll date him as you like,
then dump him when he gets needy.

606
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,344
Enough is enough. I'm warning you.

607
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,847
We're in a situation here
with the film production,

608
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,557
and you bring a guy here?

609
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,933
I can't believe it.

610
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,894
Actually, since you're already dating him,
how about this?

611
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,939
Talk to him so we cough up less money.

612
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,108
What do you call this again?

613
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,652
I know. Business in bed, right?

614
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,030
I'll kill you.
You can't blurt just anything.

615
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,614
Say that again. I dare you!

616
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,534
Stop trash-talking Director Ma
and try reflecting for once.

617
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,245
The company's in jeopardy
and you're doing this?

618
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,997
You're always thirsty for guys!

619
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,373
-Stop the car.
-I won't.

620
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,292
Stop the car, Kim Jung-don!

621
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,961
I'm not going with you.
Stop the car. Stop it.

622
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,087
Stop it now!

623
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,468
You jerk.

624
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,067
DON'T MESS WITH YOUNGTAK!
WHAT IS THE WRITER THINKING?

625
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,986
DO NOT CANCEL YOUNGTAK
SAVE JOO HA-MIN

626
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,613
How did you make this?

627
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:39,786
I picked out one of Youngtak's images

628
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,412
and edited it.

629
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,872
Without reporting it to me?

630
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,835
If I told you first,
I thought you would tell me to stop.

631
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,046
I'm sorry.

632
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:55,384
But it was received quite well.

633
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,763
But isn't it obvious we're behind this?

634
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,140
No, it's impossible to tell.

635
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:05,061
The petition on the fansite
was written by the vice president,

636
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,896
and the one who uploaded it

637
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,482
promised to keep it a secret.

638
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,197
You did quite well for an amateur.

639
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,827
Quite well?

640
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,246
It touches on the emotion,
but it's not too much.

641
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,956
Nice job.

642
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,464
Gosh, but still…

643
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,678
Should I take it down?

644
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,638
No.

645
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,057
Let's leave it up for now.

646
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,017
If anything, the TV station will respond.

647
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,853
They're sensitive to viewer responses.

648
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,147
Okay.

649
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,315
Yes, hello?

650
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,109
Yes, I'd like to call a taxi.

651
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,863
Yes, this is Dalsan-ri, Boryeong.

652
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,490
It takes two hours to get here?

653
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,034
Darn it.

654
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,830
Yes, hello?

655
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,625
It's an emergency.
I'm badly hurt and bleeding.

656
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,502
Can you come quickly?

657
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,007
I should call 911? Right.

658
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,801
Darn it.

659
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,890
Is this the courier service?

660
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,601
The number you have reached is
no longer in service.

661
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,768
Damn it!

662
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,606
Damn you, Kim Jung-don!

663
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,734
Gosh, I'm about to lose it.

664
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,473
-Thank you.
-Sure.

665
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,601
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

666
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,524
Hello.

667
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,193
One second.

668
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,444
Your attention, please.

669
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:23,199
We'll film scenes 44, 52,
and 53 when night falls.

670
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,535
So check your scenes, eat dinner,

671
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,329
then be on standby at 7:30 p.m.

672
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,413
-Okay.
-Okay.

673
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,917
And in 30 minutes, scene 24.
We need the tramps.

674
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,043
So please be ready.

675
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,211
-Okay.
-Okay.

676
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,587
Excuse me.

677
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,466
What about scene 60?
I thought it was scheduled for today.

678
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,592
Scene 60 was deleted.

679
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,593
What?

680
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,511
How come?

681
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,264
We don't have time to shoot it.

682
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,141
If the scene was unnecessary,
it shouldn't have been written.

683
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,269
You can't just delete it like this.

684
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,938
A lot more scenes were deleted this way.

685
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,858
And Park Ho-san also agreed.

686
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,026
So please understand.

687
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,486
Excuse me. Hold on.

688
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,448
Mr. Park Ho-san…

689
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,742
agreed?

690
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,791
Do you think it was
because my acting was terrible?

691
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,001
Assistant Director!

692
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,420
-Get back here now!
-Yes, I'm coming. One second.

693
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,383
Do you see the green room over there?

694
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,053
You'll find some tramp costumes.

695
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,431
Get changed and come back.

696
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,685
It's a group scene,
but your face will still be on camera.

697
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,042
Behind my neck.

698
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,085
Goodness, aren't you here early?

699
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,921
An actress needs a lot of preparation.

700
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:05,051
Okay, now.
Please sit in the back seat of the car,

701
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:09,221
gaze longingly into each other's eyes,
then kiss.

702
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,224
Just close your eyes
and get it over with in one take.

703
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,309
Okay.

704
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,194
I'm only continuing to work here
because they're such amazing actors.

705
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,864
Man, I'm never working with them again.

706
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,407
They're so frustrating.

707
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:32,411
Excuse me, Assistant Director.
Isn't that car really old?

708
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,164
I can't deal with bugs.

709
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,665
"I can't deal with bugs."

710
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,168
You and your darn lisp.

711
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,629
I said it since you're such a fan
of Prison Playbook.

712
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,714
Is that your only hit show?

713
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,717
-Do you have many hit shows?
-I have lots.

714
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,928
My Mister. Sky whatever.

715
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,513
The Sixth Sense, Alchemy of Souls.

716
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,182
I was in My Mister with you, and…

717
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,357
Ho-san, let's begin.

718
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,735
We'll begin the shoot!
We'll be shooting the kiss scene!

719
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,278
Please focus!

720
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,363
Quiet on set!

721
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,327
It's cramped in here. Go away.

722
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,413
You have plenty of space.

723
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,665
The camera is fixed here.

724
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,292
-Did you bathe in perfume?
-I'm so sick of this. Are we ready?

725
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,961
-I feel nauseous.
-Yes.

726
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,588
That's because you used
that cheap mouth spray.

727
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,756
Cheap?

728
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,008
It smells awful.

729
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,138
Let's go.

730
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,639
Okay.

731
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,737
What? Hold it back.

732
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,406
Hold it back, I tell you.

733
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,116
No!

734
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,536
That was disgusting. So gross.

735
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,954
I'm sorry. One more take.

736
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,540
Why did you spit on my face?

737
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,208
It was because of your perfume.

738
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,710
Darn it. Director!

739
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,171
Look what they're doing right now.

740
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,756
These two grown adults.

741
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,051
In your opinion, does this look like

742
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,973
a heartbreaking kiss scene that
transcends social statuses of the era?

743
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,434
I'll show them myself
how a kiss scene is done.

744
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,768
Please sit.

745
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,146
Should I? Should I go over and show them?

746
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,982
-You go over there
-Didn't we agree on this?

747
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,067
and show them how a kiss scene should be.

748
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,027
Sorry?

749
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,404
How am I supposed to…

750
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,530
Then should I?

751
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,408
Yes, sir.

752
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,664
Goodness, seriously.

753
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,292
Please do this for us.

754
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:48,964
If we don't finish this scene today,
we're all going to die.

755
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,342
I'm sorry. I'll stay focused.

756
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,843
I'm sorry. I'll do a good job.

757
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,095
Let's do another take!

758
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,269
-Now, let's do this, okay?
-Yes.

759
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,021
Let's go.

760
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,567
Let's begin.

761
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,327
A spider.

762
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,996
-Stop screwing with me.
-I mean it.

763
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,250
Stay still. It's coming down.

764
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,631
Where is it?

765
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,342
Hey, forget it. We're done. Let's go!

766
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,053
Goodness, no.

767
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,304
Sir, wait.

768
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,389
What?

769
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,516
Look at this.

770
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,026
It's good.

771
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:53,946
Where is it?

772
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,409
Good. More passionately. Yes.

773
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,702
We have to catch it.

774
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,328
Where is it?

775
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,789
I have to catch it.

776
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,917
-Good.
-Where is it?

777
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,335
-Right here!
-Where?

778
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,088
-I caught it.
-Did you?

779
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,881
-Where is it?
-Let's wrap it up.

780
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:17,928
Good.

781
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,264
Okay, this is it!

782
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,309
-We did it. This is it!
-Yes!

783
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,020
That was great, you two!

784
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,147
Good work!

785
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:33,986
I'm so happy to work
with such great actors.

786
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,946
Hey, great job.

787
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,656
Great work!

788
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,576
Are you okay?

789
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,871
Yes, I'm fine.

790
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,541
Just in case, see if you got bitten.
You're allergic to insects.

791
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,543
You remembered that?

792
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,796
During My Mister,

793
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,925
when you found a spider
in the money pot at Jeonghee's,

794
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,471
you screamed at everyone
that you're allergic to insects.

795
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,722
You still remember that?

796
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,308
How could I forget?
I caught it back then too.

797
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,268
Thanks…

798
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,854
for that.

799
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,112
This is more passionate…

800
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,990
than I expected.

801
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,911
I mean, Na-ra led the scene so nicely.

802
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,622
That's why people love Oh Na-ra.

803
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,624
You're a good actor too.

804
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,543
Let's do well on the rest too.

805
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,172
We should still make the film look good.

806
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:41,512
We may bicker, but actors do their best
once the camera rolls.

807
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,390
-Director, do you like it?
-I love it.

808
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:48,268
Did you do it like that? Look at your leg.

809
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,604
This is quite racy.

810
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:53,315
What is this? Stop watching.

811
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,776
You've been checked out.
Here is your receipt.

812
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:56,860
Thank you.

813
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,238
Goodbye.

814
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,368
In the end, they made up after all.

815
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,162
They put work before themselves
when it really counts.

816
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,705
They really are professionals.

817
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,292
How's Mr. Lee Sang-uk?

818
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,546
He just sprained his back.

819
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,881
Tell him I'll pay his hospital fees
with the company card.

820
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:18,882
Stop it.

821
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:27,975
Anyway, will you
keep dating him in secret?

822
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,102
Yes, I just need you to be quiet.

823
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,232
What do you see
in such a sleazy guy like him?

824
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,279
When I saw him in your neighborhood,
was he coming from your house?

825
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,826
You let him in and out of your house too?

826
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,830
Goodness, I wonder
how many months he'll last.

827
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,292
It feels different this time.

828
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,214
He's not like any of the guys
I've dated until now.

829
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,635
He's different. It's tough to explain,

830
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,638
but that's how it is.

831
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:11,435
Now that you're seeing him, don't break up
and stay together for a long time.

832
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,853
I plan on it.

833
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,982
Yes, don't break up with him
until the tax investigation is over.

834
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,526
-Keep it up.
-Keep it a secret at work.

835
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,905
It'll get complicated
if people find out. Okay?

836
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,250
Yes, Father. I understand.

837
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:36,627
Yes.

838
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,045
Thank you.

839
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,052
He'll meet the lawyer tomorrow morning
and wrap up the process.

840
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,604
Can't you just be comfortable with it?

841
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,359
Marrying someone like me

842
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,861
proves your competence.

843
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,406
Okay, I'll tell the staff
once I get to work.

844
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,993
All right, President Ma.

845
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,625
I should wash up and get going.

846
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,460
-You should get to work first.
-Okay.

847
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,131
You haven't forgotten
about tonight, right?

848
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,219
We're watching a musical tonight.

849
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,223
Yes, right. I'll see you tonight.

850
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:32,766
Okay.

851
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,649
HYUN-JOO

852
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,322
Honey, you're getting a call!

853
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,744
HYUN-JOO

854
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,997
I'll reserve it for noon.

855
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,544
-Goodness.
-Welcome.

856
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,129
-Hello.
-Welcome back.

857
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,006
-Hello.
-I'm exhausted from driving.

858
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,216
Why did he call us in so early?

859
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,051
Goodness, I wonder.

860
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,221
Eun-soo, do you know why
Director Ma called for a meeting?

861
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,347
I have no idea.

862
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:16,059
I saw him looking very excited
on the phone in his office.

863
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,438
Is he getting a divorce by any chance?

864
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,981
What do you mean, a divorce?

865
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:25,485
My wife and I are in a great relationship,
so that's highly unlikely.

866
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,657
You all seem busy,
so let me cut to the chase.

867
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,911
I found a surefire way
to save Method Entertainment.

868
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,166
Our agency will not be bought out.

869
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,503
We'll keep the name,
and no one will be dismissed.

870
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,758
Mr. Wang's wife
isn't going to sell her shares?

871
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:48,759
No.

872
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:50,886
I'll be taking over.

873
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:51,970
What?

874
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:58,268
You don't have to worry about the future
of Method Entertainment and their staff.

875
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,895
All of a sudden?

876
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,855
When did you decide on this?

877
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:03,398
Last night.

878
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,276
I found a financial partner last night.

879
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:07,944
Who is it?

880
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,112
My wife.

881
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,072
What?

882
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:15,577
Then Director Ma, will you be
the president of Method Entertainment?

883
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,538
We found a solid and trustworthy investor,

884
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,833
so we'll be able to deal with
the tax investigation as well.

885
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,627
He was planning this from the start.

886
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,546
He stopped us from getting sold
because he wanted to take over.

887
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,964
That snake.

888
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,884
But nothing really changes.

889
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:34,221
Director Ma already acts
like he's the president.

890
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,725
I'm not trying to be cross with him.

891
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,352
I just can't approve of this.

892
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,106
He didn't earn his way up.

893
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,233
He couldn't do this without his rich wife.

894
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,361
It's not like I couldn't find a rich guy.

895
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,029
Yes, of course.

896
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:54,032
You'd have no problem
attracting a rich man.

897
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,326
That's not all.

898
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,328
You even picked up a man who counts money.

899
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,830
The tax investigator.

900
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,423
-Hey, Won-jae.
-Put him on speaker.

901
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,885
I'm listening.

902
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,846
It's Ho-san and Na-ra again.

903
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,514
Are those two fighting again?

904
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,434
No, they aren't fighting,
but the shoot is delayed again.

905
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,686
What? Why's that?

906
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,939
I'll send you a video I took.
Please watch that first.

907
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,527
Okay, I got it.

908
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,006
What about it? It looks fine.

909
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,508
Yes, it looks great.

910
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,384
Well, they've gotten so ambitious

911
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,887
that they keep suggesting new ideas.

912
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,847
They've been dancing since last night.

913
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,599
-And right here.
-Yes.

914
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,476
-Don't lie down right away.
-Okay.

915
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,812
-I'll hold you back like this.
-That's great.

916
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,355
Nice.

917
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,857
-It's great.
-Isn't it?

918
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,400
This is great!

919
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,866
They're working too passionately,
so everything is getting delayed.

920
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,284
What do I do now?

921
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,663
Hey, what about us? What do we do?

922
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,083
Yes, Won-jae, what now?

923
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,584
No idea.

924
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,670
Goodness.

925
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,256
-Hey, you should go.
-No, you.

926
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,925
-Go now.
-I'm so sick of this.

927
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:19,469
SAVE JOO HA-MIN!
A PETITION AGAINST HIS CANCELLATION

928
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,055
Who was it?

929
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,181
Who?

930
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,312
Who was it?

931
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,860
Did you make the petition
to save Joo Ha-min?

932
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,028
-Sorry?
-How dare you use that photo.

933
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:40,490
How dare you upload my photo like that
without my permission!

934
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,535
It wasn't me.
You should talk to Ms. So Hyun-joo.

935
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,245
She did everything.

936
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,747
It was you?

937
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,209
Did you edit my photo
to make me look like a loser

938
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,919
and upload it online?

939
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,422
Well…

940
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,925
I thought it would get more views…

941
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,886
Have you ever seen me cry on TV?

942
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,599
Do you know how difficult it was
to make this macho image?

943
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,225
You ruined everything all at once.

944
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:09,936
Are you a hater?

945
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:10,979
What's going on?

946
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,356
Youngtak, what were you doing in there?

947
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,150
Director Ma.

948
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,652
Look at this.

949
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:22,449
She made me look like
a total loser. It was her.

950
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,952
Okay, I get it. Calm down.
Let's go out and talk.

951
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,370
Wait, one second.

952
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,540
Who are you? Who do you think you are?

953
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,960
Watch your language.
She's our staff and an agent.

954
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,504
An agent, my foot. You good-for-nothing.

955
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,342
-Get out.
-Did you hear that?

956
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:41,635
He told you to leave.

957
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,887
Youngtak, you get out.

958
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,059
-Director Ma, it's me, Joo Ha-min.
-Get out!

959
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,812
I'm Joo Ha-min…

960
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:07,285
This agency is a total mess.

961
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:32,102
MY MISTER

962
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:37,941
TO KIM JUNG-DON

963
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:41,111
Yes, that tall and pretty actress.

964
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,364
She can take on anything else.
It doesn't have to be a maid.

965
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,701
Yes, the amount of exposure
doesn't matter,

966
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,453
but something with lines would be great.

967
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,540
Thank you for accepting this call
at this late hour.

968
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,125
Yes, goodbye.

969
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,089
Hee-sun.

970
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,509
You're still here?

971
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,973
I'm sorry. I was dropped
because I wasn't good enough.

972
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,434
What do you mean?

973
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,227
It wasn't your fault.

974
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,439
This happens a lot during film shoots.

975
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,109
At times, your part gets edited out
after it's shot.

976
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,653
Don't let it get to you.

977
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:27,032
I called them,
so I'm sure you'll get another part.

978
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,558
Aren't you going home?

979
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,477
I should.

980
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,521
Do you want to get dinner with me?

981
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,149
Should we?

982
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,067
Let's do that.

983
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,193
One second.

984
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:11,284
Should we get Chinese food? Or pasta?

985
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,079
Pasta and kaoliang liquor?

986
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,333
Let's see…

987
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,462
This was the gas station.

988
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,548
This one's for cab fare…

989
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:38,895
Hyun-joo.

990
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,149
Do you need anything?

991
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:47,362
Wasn't your birthday two days ago?

992
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,032
It was.

993
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,663
I always sent you a present
around this time of the year.

994
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,707
But seeing you here every day now,
it skipped my mind.

995
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:02,794
I see.

996
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,048
Is there anything you want?

997
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,721
Or anything you want to do?

998
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,693
-Mom.
-Hey, Eun-gyul.

999
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,113
Where's Dad? Not here yet?

1000
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,949
It's not the first time he's late.

1001
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,661
He'll come after work,
so let's head in first.

1002
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:37,745
Okay.

1003
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,336
I've always wanted to try this.

1004
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,297
This is all you want to do?

1005
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,257
Last time,

1006
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,303
I saw you and Director Jang
having a drink together,

1007
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,263
and you guys looked so sophisticated.

1008
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,016
Hardly.

1009
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,810
Congratulations on becoming the president.

1010
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,397
Thanks.

1011
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,232
And happy birthday to you.

1012
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,692
Thank you.

1013
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:14,908
When I said I bought that scarf,
Ms. Chun was just…

1014
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,452
It was as if she lost everything.

1015
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,914
-So funny.
-I can picture her already.

1016
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,963
Honey.

1017
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:32,050
How was the show?

1018
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,719
I didn't want to step in
during the middle of it.

1019
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,679
Why didn't you call after?

1020
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:40,058
I did, but you didn't pick up.

1021
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:41,976
Really?

1022
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,774
Right. It was on vibrate.

1023
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,401
Do you want a drink too?

1024
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,571
Hyun-joo accomplished
something big at work today,

1025
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,865
so we were celebrating.

1026
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,243
A celebratory drink.

1027
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,996
And we were also celebrating
Director Ma becoming the president.

1028
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:06,209
Honey, let's speak privately.

1029
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,019
What were you doing with my dad?

1030
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,021
What do you mean?

1031
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,983
-It was just a celebratory drink.
-Stop lying.

1032
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,068
I already figured everything out.

1033
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,821
-What?
-What were you two doing?

1034
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,115
I told you. Celebrating.

1035
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,575
Be honest.

1036
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,619
I know you're hiding something from me.

1037
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,746
I saw her calling you this morning.

1038
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,833
I saw you two fighting
in front of our home last time.

1039
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,585
What are you talking about?

1040
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:51,004
It's not like that.
Don't take it the wrong way.

1041
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,798
Stop telling me that
and be honest with me.

1042
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,341
-Eun-gyul…
-What's your relationship with my dad?

1043
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,385
-Are you listening to me?
-It's not like that, Eun-gyul.

1044
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,636
-It's nothing.
-Tell me.

1045
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,637
Hey.

1046
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,055
Hey!

1047
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,516
-Honey!
-What are you doing?

1048
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,978
Are you two having an affair?
Are you the guy that she was seeing?

1049
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,652
What are you doing?

1050
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,238
Did you have a drink?

1051
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,573
Did I wake you?

1052
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:20,575
I'm sorry.

1053
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,118
Did you just come home?

1054
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,662
How much did you drink?

1055
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:30,668
I just ended up drinking a lot.

1056
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:32,712
With who?

1057
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:36,299
Wait, were you with So Hyun-joo?

1058
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,927
Don't worry. It wasn't her.

1059
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,099
You can clean up tomorrow. Go to bed.

1060
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,562
Do you dread the thought of me
seeing Hyun-joo?

1061
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,524
I just have no idea why you're like this.

1062
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,487
Give me a convincing reason.
Then I won't see her.

1063
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,990
She's seeing a guy.
I think he's a married man.

1064
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,826
You said it yourself
that she was seeing a married man!

1065
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,245
-Was that you?
-Eun-gyul, stay quiet.

1066
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,628
You and Ms. Hyun-joo.

1067
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,298
What's your relationship?

1068
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,635
Explain it clearly.

1069
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,026
There's something…

1070
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,699
I couldn't tell you to this day.

1071
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,630
BEHIND EVERY STAR

1072
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,573
Get out! Get out right now!

1073
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:24,866
Where would I go at this hour?

1074
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,702
I'm sorry. I'm looking for another job.

1075
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,078
What did I just see?

1076
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,246
It's become clear now.

1077
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,165
You're never going to change.

1078
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,667
If I can't deal with it,
I shouldn't start at all.

1079
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,712
I don't need an agent like you!

1080
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:39,130
You call this proper theater?

1081
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:41,674
If he keeps insisting,
I'll have to switch him out.

1082
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,176
There's something else to it, isn't there?

1083
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,428
You can't tell anyone about this.

1084
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,930
Must both of them have to take part in it?

1085
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,725
They both stormed out
and I can't reach either of them!

1086
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:51,976
I'll sue all of you!

1087
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:54,061
