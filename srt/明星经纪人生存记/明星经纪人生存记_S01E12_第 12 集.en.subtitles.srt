1
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,952
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,122
EPISODE 12

3
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,881
NEW-GENERATION DESIGNER HAN BO-REUM

4
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,758
Han Bo-reum, the hanbok designer?

5
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,260
He became famous
after a BTS member wore his clothes.

6
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,261
Here you go.

7
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,640
-That was him?
-His atelier is in Busan,

8
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,185
and I went there to get a hanbok once,

9
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,146
but I was told it's a two-year wait
because of all the orders.

10
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,862
Let's see.

11
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,238
Is she ready?

12
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,910
-Let me show you.
-Yes, please.

13
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,302
What do you think?

14
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,555
Do I look good?

15
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,436
Outstanding! You're so gorgeous!

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,730
I can't believe how thin this fabric is.

17
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,482
And it drapes so nicely.

18
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,401
It must have been hard
to get your hands on this.

19
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,987
Is she the best agent
in the world or what?

20
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,240
No, you can't.

21
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,784
You shouldn't move.
Be careful with the dress.

22
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,120
-The fitting isn't finished yet.
-Stay still.

23
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,288
Gosh.

24
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,836
The host of the Busan International
Film Festival deserves a dress like this.

25
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,631
It's a much bigger deal
than just walking the red carpet.

26
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:17,053
You'll be the main event
of this year's film festival.

27
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,974
Nice.

28
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,267
This is incredible.

29
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,979
-I knew it'd look great on her.
-She looks amazing.

30
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,981
-Of course.
-How much is it?

31
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,024
Who cares? Just look at her.

32
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,879
The one who picks the red stick is going.

33
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,088
Okay.

34
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,470
-I choose this.
-Okay.

35
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,472
-Let's switch.
-All right.

36
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,725
One, two, three.

37
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,062
Eun-soo wins!

38
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,606
Eun-soo

39
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,774
is going to Busan.

40
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,236
Flowers are in bloom

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,281
On Dongbaek Island

42
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,412
Won-jae, can't you stay back in my stead?

43
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,582
I have to assist Ms. Chun.

44
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:33,129
Usually, it's the youngest one
that stays back.

45
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,595
That feels nice.

46
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,724
I had a celebrity
visit my shop the other day.

47
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,267
Park Seo-jun.

48
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,729
Fair-skinned and tall…

49
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,689
He must be popular with the girls.

50
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,149
I don't care.

51
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,485
All I care about is Youngtak.

52
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,989
What were you doing in there?

53
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,077
Does Youngtak have a girlfriend?

54
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,329
I'm not sure.

55
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,331
I thought you worked as an agent.

56
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,500
And you don't even know that?

57
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,293
Even if he does, he'd never admit it.

58
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,089
He'd say, "My fans are my girlfriend."

59
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,634
They say all celebrities are two-faced.

60
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,261
You're the one that's two-faced.

61
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,679
What did you say?

62
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,266
-I mean your makeup looks great.
-Okay.

63
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,603
What were you doing in there?

64
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,231
It's hot!

65
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,399
What was that?

66
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,567
You should train her better.

67
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,236
I'm never coming back here.

68
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,197
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,121
Didn't I tell you
to treat them with extra care?

70
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,000
They're the ones who got me
all the wedding hairdo jobs.

71
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,961
They were gossiping about celebrities
the whole time. Pathetic.

72
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,216
Are you defending celebrities because
you were an agent for a few months?

73
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,470
It's not like anyone's going to miss you
up there in Seoul.

74
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,680
Your dad…

75
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,517
Let's drop it.

76
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,602
It's not worth it.

77
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,147
Anyway,

78
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,192
go to her shop and apologize tomorrow.

79
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,110
Understand?

80
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,780
Hey.

81
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,700
My goodness.

82
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,413
How's Hyun-joo doing?

83
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,669
I FEEL BAD SHE LEFT THAT WAY

84
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,881
She's doing well. Don't contact me again.

85
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,343
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO HYUN-JOO

86
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,678
She blocked your number.

87
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,182
Leave the kid alone,
and let's live our separate lives now.

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,667
The designer insists
on mending the dress herself.

89
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,669
She won't even let us touch it.

90
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,090
The opening is in two days,
so I'm looking for another dress.

91
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,342
I'm sure most dresses
have already been taken.

92
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,803
And the remaining ones
won't be good enough.

93
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,807
Rona Mikel won the Academy Award
for Best Costume Design last year.

94
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,851
Every actress in Hollywood
is lined up for her dresses.

95
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,478
I know that.

96
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,147
I also know that
you begged C&G to get that dress.

97
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,858
C&G had their own reason to help us.

98
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,236
A-joong is starring in a film
they're sponsoring,

99
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,863
so they must want to generate
publicity for the film.

100
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,782
Exactly. I know that too.

101
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,867
You said you'd get her into Hollywood.

102
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,744
So I invited reporters from overseas

103
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,163
and asked them
to get the dress on the front page.

104
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,915
You're telling me she can't wear it?

105
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,334
Suk, you're being a little sloppy here.

106
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,628
Is something distracting you?

107
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,047
A-joong is going to wear
that Rona Mikel dress.

108
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,758
All of it will go as planned.

109
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,385
It was an update. I'm going to solve it!

110
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,178
You'll have to.

111
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,347
To make up for losing Henney.

112
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,433
Solve the dress issue by tonight.

113
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,520
And share the revised contract
with me tomorrow morning.

114
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,194
Let's go.

115
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,536
-Won-jae.
-Wait.

116
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,204
-When the reporter arrives,
-Yes.

117
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,165
-please escort him.
-That's right.

118
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,000
-Thanks.
-Got it.

119
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,502
-No, it's at 4 p.m.
-You're already there?

120
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,838
Our field manager, Choi Won-jae,
will meet you.

121
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,131
-One moment.
-Jin-hyeok.

122
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,050
Reschedule Ji-hoon's meeting.
It overlaps with the KOFIC meeting.

123
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,888
Give me a second. I'm scheduling
interviews with overseas reporters.

124
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,432
And send our schedule to the hair team.

125
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,934
Okay, let me write that down.

126
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,936
Mr. Park, I'm sorry… Hello?

127
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,857
-Ms. Chun!
-Yes?

128
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,943
Can you please hire more people?

129
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,447
With one person gone,
I'm too busy to even breathe.

130
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,242
Hire? I'll do that. Wait just a few days.

131
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,453
Can you check
Eun-gyul's red carpet schedule?

132
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,538
-Anyone?
-I'll do it.

133
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,624
I can do it.

134
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,875
You said you're too busy.

135
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,418
Get your name on the list.

136
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,546
Eun-soo, book flight tickets for her.
She'll sit next to Eun-gyul.

137
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,174
Also, Director Ma will attend
the opening in my stead.

138
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,884
Change the name on the list.

139
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,135
Got it!

140
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,948
Thanks.

141
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,730
BUSAN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL

142
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,981
-Good luck.
-See you.

143
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,904
Welcome.

144
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,615
Hello.

145
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,243
This is K Production's Ms. Kang So-yeon,
the director of the opening ceremony.

146
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,745
Nice to meet you.

147
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,414
-I look forward to working with you.
-Great to have you.

148
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,874
Please come this way.

149
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's go.

150
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,422
The costume team
is getting your dress ready.

151
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,675
Sorry I changed the dress
at the last minute.

152
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,718
Sorry?

153
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,095
You changed the dress?

154
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,015
I wanted to surprise you. Just a second.

155
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,516
Ma'am!

156
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,398
What happened to the dress?

157
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,944
You had it mended? Oh, my.

158
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,946
There's a seamstress in Dongdaemun

159
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,116
who's famous among foreign designers.
Her name is Ms. Park.

160
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,618
-I know her.
-We persuaded

161
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,620
the designer all night via video call.

162
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,956
I went to Ms. Park
and begged her to fix it.

163
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,752
I can't believe you.

164
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,088
She can work magic sometimes.

165
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,965
How could I give up
when you love this dress so much?

166
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,386
I wanted to let you wear it
no matter what.

167
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,638
It's all up to me now, right?

168
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,057
Don't worry. You'll do great.

169
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,559
You're going to look gorgeous.

170
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,569
What's this?

171
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,489
Come with me later.

172
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,367
Let's get some fresh air
and watch a few movies.

173
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,039
The company will pay
for your flights and hotel room…

174
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,508
She's been invited as an actress.
Don't get the wrong idea.

175
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,517
I didn't say anything.

176
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,366
Where's the revised contract?

177
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,118
I left it in your office…

178
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,704
No, I forgot it on my desk.

179
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,666
Where on your desk? I can't find it.

180
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,126
Check my drawer…

181
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,377
Are you in my office?

182
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,379
Who said you could go in there?

183
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,214
I'm busy, so just tell me.

184
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,425
-Which drawer?
-The top one.

185
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,927
It's there, right?

186
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,972
Take that and leave now.
Don't hang around in there.

187
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,599
REVISED STANDARD CONTRACT

188
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,477
Ms. Kang.

189
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,521
Did you want to see me?

190
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,024
I wanted to have tea with you.
Do you have time?

191
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,400
Yes, sure.

192
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,865
This is Ms. Shin Ju-gyeong,
a close friend of mine.

193
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,451
This is Ms. Chun Jane
whom I told you about.

194
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,827
Nice to meet you.

195
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,412
Nice to meet you too.

196
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:54,792
Ju-gyeong's father is
Chairman Shin Seung-cheol of C&G Group.

197
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,963
Nice to meet you.
I've met Chairman Shin a few times.

198
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,758
She's very interested
in the film and agency industry,

199
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,969
so I wanted to introduce you.

200
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,432
Let's be friends.

201
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,934
Can I call you by your name?

202
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,187
Sure, you can do that.

203
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,400
"Enjoy the greatest films in one place."

204
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,486
"This is the 27th year."

205
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,284
"Enjoy the greatest films in one place."

206
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
"This is the 27th--"

207
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,622
CHUN JANE

208
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,002
Hi, Jane.

209
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,712
Did you get some rest?

210
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,134
By any chance,
do you know Ms. Shin Ju-gyeong?

211
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,136
How do you know her?

212
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,138
So you do know her.

213
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,433
Can you come to the café
on the first floor for a second?

214
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,185
She's here,
and she wants to have lunch with you.

215
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,146
No, I'll stay in my room.

216
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,359
You're not that close?

217
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,570
Not really.

218
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,197
I've met her a few times
at sneak preview after-parties.

219
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,324
I see.

220
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,326
You see,

221
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,538
she attends all kinds of events
and after-parties using her background

222
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,290
to get cozy with celebrities.

223
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,250
She also promotes her fashion brand.

224
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,628
And she bosses new actors around.

225
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,212
I can't stand her.

226
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,006
I'll just be rehearsing in my room.

227
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,508
Don't stay with her for too long
and come up.

228
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,218
Okay?

229
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,554
Okay, I get what you mean.
I'll sort things out.

230
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,141
Oh, my.

231
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,978
Too bad. She's not feeling well.

232
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,564
She just got here and must be tired.

233
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,777
In that case,

234
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,864
she can come to my birthday party tonight.

235
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,950
Your birthday party?

236
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,620
She has interviews booked all evening,

237
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,664
so I don't think she can make it.

238
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,294
A-joong is starring in a new film, right?

239
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,508
You know that film is sponsored by my dad.

240
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,974
I'll send a car over later.
Bring her with you.

241
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,311
-I'm off.
-See you.

242
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,279
What's going on here?

243
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,031
Why are you being so serious?

244
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,826
She just wants A-joong to drop by.

245
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,162
It didn't sound like that to me.

246
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,585
C&G…

247
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,132
is planning to expand into Hollywood soon.

248
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,218
All the foreign filmmakers
in Busan right now

249
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,345
are under C&G control.

250
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,558
You got that dress through C&G too, right?

251
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,770
If you want A-joong to go global,

252
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,564
make sure to bring her to the party.

253
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,483
Play along with
a wannabe celebrity for a while,

254
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,652
and there will be a lot to gain.

255
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,279
Both A-joong

256
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,613
and you.

257
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,164
I'm thinking of taking
an early train tomorrow.

258
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,665
I have some work left.

259
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,083
All right.

260
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,918
You want some coffee tomorrow morning?

261
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,253
No, thanks.

262
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,338
I have a breakfast meeting.

263
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,552
-Eun-soo.
-Yes?

264
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,767
I appreciate that you always put me first.

265
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,563
But from now on,
I want you to put yourself first.

266
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,400
Okay.

267
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,198
Director Ma, we're late.

268
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,783
-Let's hurry.
-Okay, let's go.

269
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,701
Call me, Jin-hyeok.

270
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,871
-Hang in there.
-You can go next time, Jin-hyeok.

271
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,791
-Let's go.
-We're late.

272
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,959
You can always go next year.

273
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,127
Cheer up.

274
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,547
I'll catch up with you tomorrow morning.

275
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,590
See you tomorrow.

276
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,258
Cheer up, Jin-hyeok.

277
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,262
-Jin-hyeok.
-Yes?

278
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,514
Water the plants, okay?

279
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,271
I won't.

280
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,439
I won't!

281
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,863
This will be perfect.

282
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,162
That's a lovely dress.

283
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,413
How have you been?

284
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,503
Hello.

285
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,922
What brings you here?

286
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,591
Director Ma isn't here, I swear.

287
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,593
I know. He left for Busan.

288
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,889
I'm here today to see you, Eun-soo.

289
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,393
Me? Why?

290
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,311
Can you give me

291
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,690
his schedule and the name of his hotel?

292
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,651
But don't tell him anything.

293
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,573
Sure.

294
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,283
Just a second, please.

295
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,583
By the way,

296
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,962
is there a way to book a flight to Busan?

297
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,964
The train tickets are sold out.

298
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,594
I asked just in case, so never mind.

299
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,433
Are you going there to see Director Ma?

300
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,400
Yes.

301
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,363
I'd like to change the passenger's name.

302
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,912
The app isn't working currently.

303
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,955
Yes.

304
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,041
It's Yoo Eun-soo.

305
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,337
Please change it to…

306
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,507
Song Eun-ha.

307
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,638
No, it's Song Eun-ha.

308
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,350
Song Eun-ha.

309
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,857
Just pretend you're having
a meal with a fan.

310
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,692
She's not my fan.

311
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,906
She just wants to brag
that she knows the host of the festival.

312
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,368
I doubt she even knows
what films I starred in.

313
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,331
She probably invited everyone she knows,
just to show off.

314
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:53,252
You know connections are important
in this line of work, don't you?

315
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,088
The party is thrown by C&G.

316
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,548
Many foreign filmmakers will be there.

317
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,678
We've been working so hard
for your American debut.

318
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,304
This is a great opportunity.

319
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,392
To get what we want,
the end justifies the means.

320
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,394
Is that what you mean?

321
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,193
It wouldn't hurt
to be on good terms with C&G.

322
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,948
Without C&G, the dress
wouldn't have been possible. Originally--

323
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,125
It was originally supposed to be worn
by another actress?

324
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,674
You know how fiercely actresses compete
for dresses for film festivals.

325
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:45,387
Every agent wants their actress
to wear the best dress.

326
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,599
Jane.

327
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,102
Yes?

328
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,439
Being an actress,

329
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,609
and working with great colleagues on set

330
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,071
are all I need to be happy.

331
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,200
Am I being too selfish?

332
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,997
I know

333
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,791
that you and everyone at the agency

334
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,294
work day and night to support me.

335
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,921
I know that.

336
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,135
A-joong.

337
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,603
I'll go.

338
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,689
I'll attend Ju-gyeong's birthday party.

339
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,400
Let me get ready.

340
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,194
See you in the lobby.

341
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,696
Okay.

342
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,885
What? Hey.

343
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,096
What are you doing here?

344
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,473
I've been invited
to the reception tomorrow.

345
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,683
Personally by the investors.

346
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,604
What? Did you think
I came here to see you?

347
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,904
Are you seeing that guy,
Lee Sang-uk, again?

348
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,948
-That's none of your business.
-But it is.

349
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,909
What if you get distracted
and can't get your job done?

350
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,620
Is everything okay with A-joong?

351
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,708
Rona Mikel is launching a brand
in Asia next year.

352
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,211
C&G will be investing,
and I'll be their broker.

353
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,590
You're trying to promote
the Rona Mikel brand…

354
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,759
Hey.

355
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,597
-You're using a client for personal needs?
-It's a win-win situation.

356
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,517
The whole world will notice A-joong
if she wears that dress.

357
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,603
Isn't that what you want?

358
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,190
Achieving your goal
by whatever means necessary.

359
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,113
Rona's investors
will be at the party tomorrow.

360
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,825
I'll send some outfits up,
so make sure she wears them.

361
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,394
What's going on? What are you doing here?

362
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,606
I sent the car away.

363
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,610
-Why?
-I made a mistake.

364
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,697
I thought I was doing this for your sake,

365
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,327
but I almost failed to protect
the most important thing.

366
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,622
"Important thing"?

367
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,373
My client's dignity

368
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,710
as an actress.

369
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:14,471
I told Ju-gyeong that you can't make it
because you're not feeling well.

370
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,224
So get some rest in your room.

371
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,936
I'm sorry you dressed up for nothing.

372
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,480
I'm really sorry. I'll get going now.

373
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,069
Chun Jane.

374
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,657
Yes, A-joong.

375
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,369
What's with you?

376
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,331
Why do you have to be so cool?

377
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,003
That was really touching.

378
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,551
Since I'm already dressed up,
let's go for a drink.

379
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,845
There's a bar downstairs. Okay?

380
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,516
Let's go.

381
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,440
Not going home?

382
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,567
Didn't you have an early train to catch?

383
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,278
I'm not going.

384
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,825
You're going to stay here all night
and go straight there?

385
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,577
No. I'm not going to Busan.

386
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,870
What?

387
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:26,418
I forgot I had booked
a meridian massage this weekend.

388
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,629
Oh, my.

389
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:33,925
Why does everyone pull my leg
all the time?

390
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,265
Take this ticket to the opening.

391
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,733
-For me?
-Be careful and have fun.

392
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,569
The train tickets are sold out,
so take the company car.

393
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,446
I'll get a ticket somehow.

394
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,031
Thank you so much.

395
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,117
Someone, please cancel their ticket.
I beg you.

396
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,160
Please.

397
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,204
What's wrong?

398
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,457
What do you mean?

399
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,750
Never mind.

400
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,378
Please. I just need one canceled ticket.

401
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,845
Thank you so much.

402
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,306
I'll have a great time.
I really appreciate it.

403
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,694
SEAT AVAILABLE

404
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,790
I can't believe this.

405
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,500
There isn't a single cancellation.

406
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,127
My goodness.

407
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,505
Just take the company car.

408
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,216
I can't. I have night blindness.

409
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,345
I guess I can't go.

410
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,513
I'll just

411
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,391
stay here with you.

412
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,935
Poor me.

413
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,110
What's wrong?

414
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,446
-Oh, my.
-Jin-hyeok.

415
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,323
What's going on?

416
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,827
Thank you, Jin-hyeok.

417
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,508
Who is it?

418
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,471
Honey.

419
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,063
Are you here for Eun-gyul?

420
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,107
Yes.

421
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,609
Partly.

422
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,363
And some other things too.

423
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,906
He's doing fine.

424
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,159
His acting is pretty good too.

425
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,995
He's doing fine on his own
even without my help.

426
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,372
Of course.

427
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,708
He's my son after all.

428
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,340
You're attending
the opening ceremony later, right?

429
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,802
I'll get you a seat.

430
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,888
While we were separated,

431
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,975
I gave it a lot of thought.

432
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,688
And I still couldn't forgive you.

433
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,609
You absolutely ruined our marriage.

434
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,031
But then…

435
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,701
this thought hit me.

436
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,414
"Did I ever see you for who you are?"

437
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,168
After everything that happened,

438
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,297
I think I finally understand
who you really are.

439
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,261
And that neither of us are perfect.

440
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,226
How about we accept that…

441
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,606
and start over?

442
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,445
And make up for each other's flaws.

443
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,035
Eun-gyul told me

444
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,704
that girl…

445
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,208
got in trouble while trying to help you.

446
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,796
I know you're hesitating.

447
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,673
You should…

448
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,969
stop neglecting her.

449
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,890
What do you mean, the dress is gone?

450
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,475
That's what I want to ask you.

451
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,979
-C&G gave you that dress?
-Yes.

452
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:00,817
They barged in and took it away,
saying there had been a mistake.

453
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,157
Apparently, it's going back to Kang Cho-a.

454
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,159
What's going on?

455
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,456
Let me make a phone call.

456
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,134
Yes?

457
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,803
What do you think you're doing?

458
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,723
-What do you mean?
-Cut it out and bring the dress over.

459
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:35,602
Jane, you don't seem to understand
the predicament you're in.

460
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,730
This dress was supposed to be
worn by Kang Cho-a,

461
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,815
but I pulled some strings for you.

462
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,526
Rona and I are best friends, you see.

463
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,946
Is this about yesterday? Can't you keep
business and private separate?

464
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,491
The ceremony is in three hours.
Where are you? I'll come to you.

465
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,993
Bring A-joong with you.

466
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,620
What?

467
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,164
I want her to apologize to me
for yesterday

468
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:00,335
and promise to attend
the official party thrown by C&G

469
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,629
after the opening ceremony with me.

470
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,341
-Then I'll give you the dress.
-Apologize for what? What did she do?

471
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,219
Suit yourself.

472
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,141
But it seems like
there are a ton of foreign reporters

473
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,769
who came here to cover this dress.

474
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,562
Should I just give it to Star Media?

475
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,315
-Ms. Shin.
-I can't wait long.

476
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,414
The opening ceremony starts soon.
What will you do?

477
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,708
Let me think for a second.

478
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,793
I'll go.

479
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,466
She wants me to apologize, right?

480
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,134
So typical.

481
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,512
I'll do it. It's no big deal.

482
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,348
You jumped through hoops
to get that dress.

483
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,434
And we planned the whole look based on it.

484
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,312
I can take care of it.

485
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,399
-I'll go and--
-No.

486
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,235
She won't change her mind
unless I go personally.

487
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,487
Wait here.

488
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,948
I'll go and bring the dress back.

489
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,960
Ju-gyeong.

490
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,797
Did I upset you?

491
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,342
I was feeling lousy yesterday.

492
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,970
That's why I couldn't make it
to your party.

493
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,639
Are you sure that's why?

494
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,433
Yes, I'm telling you.

495
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,311
I didn't want to ruin the mood
at your party by being sick there.

496
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,938
-I see.
-Right?

497
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,649
That's why I didn't come.
It was for your sake.

498
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,695
This is why I like you.

499
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,906
You know when to give in.

500
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,581
I guess our little misunderstanding

501
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,001
has all been cleared up now.

502
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:23,227
I was afraid you'd turned into
one of those self-important actors.

503
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,108
-What?
-You know how it is.

504
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,444
Actors who think
filmmaking is oh-so-important

505
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,489
and refuse to care about anything
other than acting and movies.

506
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,700
Those who are stubborn
and idiotic for their own good.

507
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,997
They have to give in
when they run out of money anyway.

508
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,084
What's the point of being so proud?

509
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:52,423
By the way, about that agent of yours.

510
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,258
I think she needs a lesson.

511
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,594
She's so stuck up.

512
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,889
She must think
she's on the same level as her client.

513
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,894
In reality,
she just mooches off celebrities.

514
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,854
She needs to know that.

515
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,398
Shouldn't you talk to her?

516
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:13,569
I really wanted to keep to myself,
but I just can't do that with you.

517
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,738
What? Self-important actors?

518
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,074
Then what are you?

519
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,243
A self-important heiress?

520
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,787
An attention seeker
obsessed with connections?

521
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,998
And what?

522
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,752
My agent mooches off celebrities?

523
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,004
Gosh.

524
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,465
It takes one to know one.

525
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,633
-What?
-My goodness.

526
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,634
You're right.

527
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,428
You need money to make films, no doubt.

528
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,099
But we're not putting
our heart and soul into movies

529
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,267
just to make money.

530
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,602
Hey.

531
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,356
Here's a little advice
coming from me as your elder.

532
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,526
Learn to respect others
before you brag about your money.

533
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,736
Understand?

534
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,158
Hey, what's going on?

535
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,076
You don't need that dress?

536
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,620
You really shouldn't do this to me.

537
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,750
You want an apology?

538
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,089
Here you go.

539
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,217
Wear that dress yourself

540
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,596
and get a lot of thumbs-ups
from your social media friends.

541
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,808
But I'm not sure if it'll fit you.

542
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,562
It's been tailored to fit me.

543
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,523
Wait…

544
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,441
Hey!

545
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,610
Have you forgotten who I am?

546
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,237
I mean…

547
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,282
I just lost my cool
when I heard what she said.

548
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,162
I should've gone with you.

549
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,955
I should've gone and

550
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,001
showered her
with every Korean cuss I knew.

551
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,670
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

552
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,716
She says she lost her cool,
but she's just so elegant.

553
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,093
Don't you think so?
She's an actress after all.

554
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:05,514
We all should've gone and spat
a dozen English swear words at her too.

555
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,643
My client did so well.
That sure feels nice.

556
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,564
But…

557
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,609
what do we do now?

558
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,988
We'll figure something out.

559
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,159
-Hello.
-How about this?

560
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,827
-The thing is…
-Find out and get back to me.

561
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,205
-Hello. How have you been?
-Okay?

562
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,332
-I'm wondering…
-Please call me.

563
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,501
-Hello.
-By any chance…

564
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,921
I'm going to the department store.
To buy something off the rack.

565
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,881
No, that's not going to work.

566
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,218
There are a ton of reporters
from overseas.

567
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,137
We need something better than that dress.

568
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,602
I know some designers in Seoul,
but none in Busan.

569
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,606
Hold on a second.

570
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,484
Didn't you say
that hanbok designer, Han Bo-reum,

571
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,903
has his atelier here in Busan?

572
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,072
Yes.

573
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,283
Is that right?

574
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,912
-This is nice.
-Yes, it is.

575
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,580
-This one is nice too.
-Right?

576
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,792
It'll go well with this.
So let's do these two and the skirt.

577
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,878
Let's try it out and see how it goes.

578
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,339
Hello.

579
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,676
Hey. I got a call from your mom.

580
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,847
I'm sorry about yesterday.

581
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,015
I brought this.

582
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,269
Oh, my. You didn't have to.

583
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,233
Have a seat.

584
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,655
So…

585
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,950
you were upset
because I gossiped about celebrities?

586
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,416
The celebrities you worked with
must be so lucky.

587
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:59,795
How reassured would they feel
to have an agent standing up for them?

588
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,424
Wait a second. I'll get you some tea.

589
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,518
I can't.

590
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,314
It'll be on the covers
of the most renown fashion magazines.

591
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,900
It'll be a great opportunity
for you as well.

592
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:25,821
You may not be aware,
but I don't need that kind of publicity.

593
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,365
I'm aware.

594
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,618
Your works are already being endorsed
by celebrities on social media.

595
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,829
But being in foreign magazines
is meaningful.

596
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,123
More so because it's hanbok.

597
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,336
I beg you.

598
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,172
We really need your work.

599
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:47,676
My family has been in this business
for three generations.

600
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,721
And I've never been told
to hand over my work this way.

601
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,473
I understand your situation,

602
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,060
but my mother won't sit back
if I sold off my work

603
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,145
like it's an off-the-rack item.

604
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,271
I'm sorry.

605
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,033
Thank you for the tea.

606
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,703
Thanks for coming. Get home safe.

607
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,622
-See you.
-Bye.

608
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,836
Hyun-joo!

609
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,046
What are you doing here?

610
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,925
What about you?

611
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,802
Well…

612
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,180
-I…
-Son.

613
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,308
What time should we have dinner?

614
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,524
Did she just say "son"?

615
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,110
Yes.

616
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:51,782
So you're asking me to persuade my son
to give you his hanbok?

617
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,033
Yes.

618
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,119
I beg you.

619
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,538
Do as they say.

620
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,000
Bo-reum always listens to you.

621
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,047
Why does it have to be my son's dress?

622
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,551
I'm sure you can easily find
a beautiful dress.

623
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:14,555
So why does it have to be his?
That's what I don't understand.

624
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,728
Your son's clothes
make the wearer stand out.

625
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,857
Every year, people talk about
how bold, revealing,

626
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,400
and unique each dress is.

627
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:31,363
But I want people to focus
on the actress than the dress itself.

628
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:36,994
That's why I need Mr. Han's work.

629
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,956
I get what you mean,

630
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,168
but there's nothing I can do
if the designer himself says no.

631
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,337
Please go back.

632
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,175
Wait, ma'am!

633
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,432
She's here. Hurry!

634
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,934
Be careful.

635
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,941
Take the bridge, then the mountain pass.
It'll be much faster.

636
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,902
Mountain pass?
I just need to follow the GPS, right?

637
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,864
Have you ever driven in Busan?

638
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,699
Follow the GPS and you'll be late.

639
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,720
Hold on tight.

640
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,066
Hey.

641
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,653
Here we go.

642
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,429
My gosh.

643
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,686
Hurry. You have less than an hour.

644
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,479
-Okay. I'll call you.
-All right.

645
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,921
BUSAN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL

646
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,899
Mr. Kim!

647
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,665
Do I look weird?

648
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,832
No.

649
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,379
Practice keeping your eyes wide open.

650
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,298
When the reporters see you,
their camera flashes will go off.

651
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,678
Thank you for bringing me here.

652
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,223
It's to cheer me up

653
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,934
after what happened
with Director Oh's movie, right?

654
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,021
I shouldn't have complained so much to you

655
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,399
when you've done nothing wrong.

656
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,275
I'm so sorry.

657
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,152
Don't be.

658
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,408
I'll try to shake it off
and work harder from now on.

659
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:06,745
Well…

660
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,164
Hee-sun.

661
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,294
I'm on my way to Busan.

662
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,588
I'm attending the reception,
let's talk in person.

663
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,508
Mr. Kim?

664
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,093
What?

665
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,930
Let's go. Everyone must be waiting.

666
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,349
Okay. Let's go.

667
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,103
All right.

668
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,950
Delivery!

669
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,083
-Hello.
-Hi.

670
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,377
-Good evening.
-Hello.

671
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,088
Entering now is actor Go Eun-gyul

672
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,884
-from the movie, Maestro.
-Here he comes.

673
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,219
-Open it.
-We have to hurry.

674
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:05,929
Oh, my.

675
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,478
-Oh, my.
-Look over here!

676
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,729
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

677
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,689
-Look this way please.
-Over here!

678
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:16,982
Please look at the camera!

679
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,192
He's on!

680
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,818
Please wave at the camera.

681
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,987
-Look at the camera!
-Over here!

682
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,947
Look at the camera here!

683
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,492
I'm glad I listened to you
and stayed here.

684
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,911
-We can see him up close.
-Right?

685
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,873
And it's nice with just the two of us.

686
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,755
I saw that Eun-gyul
shot a commercial for this.

687
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,177
Are you proud?

688
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,303
Of course.

689
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,641
I've quit coffee and switched to these.

690
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,851
You're kidding me.

691
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,228
It's true.

692
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,621
Where have you been?

693
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,124
Over here!

694
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,085
Look at the camera here!

695
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,213
Can you wave at the camera?

696
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,176
-Look over here too!
-You look great.

697
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,386
Over here!

698
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,555
-And over here!
-Here too!

699
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,057
-Can you wave at the camera?
-Please wave your hand!

700
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:36,812
How many minutes?

701
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,189
-Ten minutes.
-Ten minutes?

702
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,110
-Here she comes.
-What?

703
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,698
What's wrong?

704
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,366
She's beautiful.

705
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,951
Gosh, you scared me.

706
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,954
Okay, everything's good now.

707
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,803
Do I look okay?

708
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,180
You look stunning.

709
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,099
Get out there.

710
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,576
That's a lot of toppings.

711
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,957
Watch it on the big screen.

712
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,552
You brat.

713
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,438
Who's the host this year?

714
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,439
Kim A-joong.

715
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,442
Who's the male host?

716
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,903
There isn't any. She's the sole host.

717
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:08,820
Really?

718
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,572
That's unusual.

719
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,700
Wait and see. She'll be amazing.

720
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,995
You brat.

721
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,045
Look at the cheese stretch.

722
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,675
How is this possible?

723
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,350
Ladies and gentlemen.

724
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:44,314
The opening ceremony of the Busan
International FIlm Festival will begin.

725
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,776
The 27th Busan
International Film Festival.

726
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,696
I introduce to you our host this evening.

727
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,448
Please welcome, actress Kim A-joong.

728
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,284
Let's give her a warm welcome!

729
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,287
-What?
-No way.

730
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,924
She's not wearing a dress.

731
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,175
She's gorgeous.

732
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,053
Jane must have gone through hell.

733
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,642
Asia's greatest film festival.

734
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,852
I welcome you all

735
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:26,106
to the 27th Busan
International Film Festival.

736
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,608
Good evening, I'm Actress Kim A-joong.

737
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,409
I feel thrilled and nervous

738
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,953
to be the host of this honorable event.

739
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:44,750
For me, nothing is more touching

740
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,961
than seeing the end credits roll up.

741
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,006
Seeing the cast and crew list…

742
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:56,386
"The director of photography
filmed us so beautifully."

743
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,847
"The production manager

744
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,892
stood in the middle of the road
and stopped all the cars himself,

745
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,852
putting up with the drivers' complaints,

746
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,688
so that we could focus on acting."

747
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,274
I'm always reminded of their efforts.

748
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,359
But sometimes,

749
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:17,449
we overlook each and every act
of dedication that has been made for us.

750
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,122
And we're led to believe
that we deserve to take the shortcuts

751
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,876
offered by those who have
power and influence.

752
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,840
There are people who quietly support me

753
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,886
behind the scenes at all times.

754
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:44,059
Movies cannot be made
without their efforts.

755
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,479
Thanks to their passion and hard work,

756
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:51,274
we can be gathered here
to celebrate cinema.

757
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:56,488
With a love for cinema that
cannot be swayed by any external pressure.

758
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:02,702
It is time to meet our great legacy.

759
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,916
The 27th Busan International Film Festival

760
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,125
starts now.

761
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,686
How was I?

762
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,271
You were incredible.

763
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,816
You did an amazing job.

764
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,318
You're so pretty.

765
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:47,205
Social media is blowing up.

766
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,459
Foreign fans are desperate to know
where A-joong's dress is from.

767
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,214
Who is it?

768
00:52:56,298 --> 00:53:00,594
Ms. Chun wants me
to write a press release.

769
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:03,763
Right now.

770
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,455
SORA HAIR SALON

771
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,748
What's wrong?

772
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,375
Do you feel sad
after watching the ceremony?

773
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,836
It's not like that.

774
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,630
It's just that…

775
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,550
it feels weird to see people I know on TV.

776
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,351
MA

777
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,353
Yes?

778
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:54,981
Here.

779
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,320
Hello?

780
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,821
Are you busy right now?

781
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,616
No. Why?

782
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,914
I want you to come
to the film festival reception with me.

783
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:16,211
How can I do that? I quit the company.

784
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,465
Ms. Chun told me
you were a big help today.

785
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,554
I got you on the list, so you can come.

786
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:32,227
I've never been to these things before.

787
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:36,147
And I'm dressed too casually.

788
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,067
I had to guess your size.
I hope it fits you.

789
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,535
Hyun-joo.

790
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,296
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

791
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,298
It's beautiful.

792
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,093
-Hey.
-Hi.

793
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,481
My goodness.

794
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,900
Here.

795
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,121
Mom.

796
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,832
Can I really go?

797
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,544
Even if I stop you,
you won't listen to me anyway.

798
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:43,423
Please

799
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,925
take good care of Hyun-joo.

800
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,929
Thanks, Mom.

801
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,724
Gross. Get off me. Jeez.

802
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:57,312
Right. The hanbok lady called me earlier

803
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,439
and asked me
about Youngtak's concert tickets.

804
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,774
What's that about?

805
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,609
Oh, that…

806
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,487
It's nothing.

807
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,533
Hey! My goodness.

808
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,077
You can't go in there!

809
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,291
-Thank you.
-Sure.

810
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,251
-Mr. Kim. Hello.
-Hello.

811
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,129
-Director Jang.
-Thanks.

812
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,882
-She's lived in New Zealand.
-Excuse me.

813
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,051
She speaks perfect English.

814
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,014
Hello.

815
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,141
Thank you.

816
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:40,730
Excuse me for a second.

817
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,401
Sang-uk, have you gotten off work?

818
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,986
I'm getting off work now.

819
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,365
But it's so late.

820
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,033
You're still outside too?

821
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,160
-Is this a bad time?
-No.

822
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,247
We're almost done here. It's fine.

823
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,624
I miss you.

824
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,335
I miss you too.

825
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:07,090
I saw the opening ceremony.
It was amazing.

826
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,843
You have no idea what I went through.

827
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,636
I'll tell you when we meet.

828
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,972
Won't you be tired when you get back?

829
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,933
Are you sure we can meet on Sunday?

830
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,643
-We can postpone.
-No.

831
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,855
We finally managed to book
a table at that restaurant.

832
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,148
Hold on.

833
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,402
What's going on?
Is it our anniversary that day?

834
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,697
Why are you laughing?

835
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,699
It's a secret.

836
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,285
Anyway, I'll see you on Sunday.

837
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,954
Sang-uk, I'll call you back. Sorry.

838
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,041
You did great today.

839
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,710
You too.

840
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:48,715
Did I tell you that I used to work
at the Entertainment Department of KBB?

841
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:54,262
I worked my butt off for about ten years.

842
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,431
But then I reached my limit.

843
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:01,436
No matter how hard I worked,
I was nothing more than an employee.

844
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,397
So I started my own production company.

845
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,984
I guess Ju-gyeong helped you a lot.

846
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,278
And that's how you got to direct BIFF.

847
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,408
You're not going to stay
at Method, are you?

848
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,955
I doubt you'd be content
working under someone else.

849
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,418
My ex-husband

850
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:29,589
is running a talent agency
called ST in Los Angeles.

851
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,509
-Have you heard of it?
-Yes, I have.

852
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,553
He's planning to establish
a New York branch next year.

853
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:39,265
When I told him about you,
he wanted to meet you.

854
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,690
Think carefully…

855
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:54,072
which position would suit you better.

856
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,911
Hello, Director.

857
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,121
Have you been well?

858
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,504
Eun-gyul, say goodbye.

859
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,138
You must be tired. You can leave now.

860
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,140
No, I'm fine.

861
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,850
I need to stay next to you

862
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:26,145
for people to think the company
is paying special attention to you.

863
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,857
I don't think I'm that special.

864
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,150
You are.

865
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,277
What?

866
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,658
Should we

867
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,077
speak casually?

868
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,081
Sure.

869
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,809
Thank you.

870
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,030
Ms. Chun.

871
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:31,169
I was in a rush earlier,
so I didn't get to thank you properly.

872
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,255
Thank you so much.

873
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,381
Don't mention it.

874
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,218
How do you like being away from work?

875
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,720
Do you like it?

876
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,556
It's been awful.

877
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,643
If I'd quit over such a trivial matter,
I would've quit long ago.

878
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:47,769
You have a long way to go.

879
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,731
I…

880
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,027
want to become an agent like you.

881
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:02,700
I know I'm extremely inadequate
compared to you now.

882
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,243
Don't say that.

883
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:09,165
But until I become an agent like you

884
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,585
I won't ever be giving up

885
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,090
as long as you put your trust in me.

886
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,390
Can you speak English?

887
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,810
Yes, I can speak it a little.

888
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,189
Hyun-joo.

889
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,357
Yes?

890
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,777
Do you want to go to the US with me?

891
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,654
What?

892
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,119
It's not easy.

893
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,330
I have to sit at the desk all the time,

894
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,667
and some auditions are
during working hours.

895
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,546
But it's not all bad after all.
I get to audition,

896
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,839
and my profile…

897
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,551
Hee-sun, can we talk?

898
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,594
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

899
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,846
See you.

900
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,307
What's the matter?

901
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:14,981
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

902
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,317
Actually…

903
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,611
The thing is…

904
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,656
I…

905
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,659
Me too.

906
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,494
What?

907
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,121
I like you too.

908
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:36,461
I was going to tell you
after I starred in a movie.

909
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,799
DIRECTOR OH HUN

910
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,050
Excuse me for a second.

911
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,637
Hey, where are you?

912
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:49,724
I'm home.
I don't feel like going to Busan.

913
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,393
That's good.

914
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,520
Coming here would only make you
more upset.

915
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,189
Hee-sun.

916
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,940
-Someone told me
-Hello.

917
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:01,027
that some jerk had been
spreading rumors about my movie.

918
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,405
That there are overly racy scenes.

919
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,450
Who's this jerk
that's been spewing nonsense?

920
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,202
Do you know anything?

921
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,996
I heard about your movie.
That it fell through.

922
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,831
That's right. It's over.

923
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,500
Will you keep working with him?

924
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,460
With who?

925
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,463
I mean Mr. Kim Jung-don.
He's the one who put a stop to it.

926
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:23,800
When I find that jerk, he's dead meat.

927
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:28,596
Anyway,

928
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,890
If you hear anything, call me.

929
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,600
I have to go.

930
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,686
-Hee-sun!
-Mr. Kim, there you are.

931
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,605
This is President Kim Mi-young.

932
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,774
Nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

933
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,734
I'm Kim Jung-don of Method Entertainment.

934
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,528
Is Mr. Lee Soon-jae doing well?

935
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,905
Of course. He's still going strong.

936
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,413
Enjoy Busan. See you on Sunday.

937
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,969
Excuse me.

938
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:11,138
Can I borrow a pad if you have one?

939
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,849
Oh, no. I don't have any right now.

940
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,309
There should be
a convenience store right outside.

941
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,770
-Okay. Thank you.
-No problem.

942
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,871
My bad.

943
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,083
Gosh.

944
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:42,962
Excuse me.

945
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:45,756
Has the guest in Room 1206 come back?

946
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,675
She's a colleague. I'm looking for her.

947
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:52,054
She just checked out and left.

948
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:26,380
Have you heard of ST Agency in the US?

949
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,633
Isn't that a talent agency in LA?

950
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,303
I heard the CEO is Korean.

951
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:34,305
I'm thinking of taking it over.

952
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,515
You?

953
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,727
What? You don't think I can?

954
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,230
No, that's not it.

955
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:45,358
If that happens,

956
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,569
would you be interested in leading

957
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,780
Method Entertainment's LA branch?

958
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,445
Gosh.

959
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,781
I'm the worst

960
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:20,578
both as an agent and as a man.

961
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,124
I envy you.

962
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,752
You're successful

963
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,838
in both your career and your love life.

964
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:37,428
And I'm about to get another role.

965
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:40,931
What's that?

966
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,397
Let me enjoy the view for now.

967
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,415
By the way,

968
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,960
which direction is the US?

969
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,756
-Isn't it that way?
-It's that way.

970
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,092
Wake her up and ask her.

971
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,427
Do you know where the US is?

972
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,722
That's too far off.

973
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,307
She has no clue.

974
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:27,645
She must not be from the US.

975
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,192
Have a drink with me.

976
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:07,184
BEHIND EVERY STAR

977
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:50,853
It's true.

978
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,563
-What is?
-Hi, Hyun-joo.

979
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:54,648
-It's true, I swear.
-I mean, what is?

980
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,233
Nice. Do you like this?

981
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,586
Do it properly
