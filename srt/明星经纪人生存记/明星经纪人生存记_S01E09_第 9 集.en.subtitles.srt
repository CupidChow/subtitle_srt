1
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,952
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,831
You were super restless in your sleep.

3
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,167
EPISODE 9

4
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,877
I guess I had a bad dream.

5
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,881
-Shall we?
-Yes.

6
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:45,146
Then who else will be on the show with me?

7
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,940
The others on the show…

8
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,776
are a secret.

9
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,612
You'll meet them when you get there.

10
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,824
So you really do things like this.
I'm looking forward to it.

11
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,284
Have you watched Earth Arcade?

12
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,703
Of course, I enjoyed it so much.

13
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,664
It's the hottest program right now.

14
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:06,626
I never imagined I would
get to be a part of season two.

15
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,586
Where's the location?

16
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,088
The location?

17
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,257
That is also

18
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,883
a secret.

19
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,762
You'll find out at the airport anyway.

20
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,598
And what we're going to do there is…

21
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,351
Also a secret.

22
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,645
Actually,

23
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,983
there is one thing you need to do.

24
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,151
What is it?

25
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,944
And that is…

26
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,446
So you go, then go up…

27
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,706
Joo-ryoung, why did he tell you
to train for rappelling?

28
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,374
-What will he make you do?
-Gosh.

29
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,376
Something like boot camp, probably.

30
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,753
But why do I have to do this with you?

31
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,673
Come on, have you no loyalty?
How can I do this alone?

32
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,093
Joo-ryoung, are you really not scared?

33
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:01,431
Hey, I went bungee jumping very often
when I was in the US.

34
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,183
Back then, it was much higher than this…

35
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,196
Joo-ryoung, what's wrong?

36
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,364
Right.

37
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,367
It's nothing.

38
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,787
Jung-don.

39
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,039
You can go first for now.

40
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,081
What?

41
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,917
I'll do it later. Untie me now.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,209
-What's wrong?
-Joo-ryoung, what is it?

43
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,962
-I need to make a restroom run.
-Restroom.

44
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,422
You went three times already.

45
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,049
-Please make it quick.
-Okay.

46
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,383
-I'll be back.
-Join me after.

47
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,260
-See you.
-Joo-ryoung.

48
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,221
Wait, no.

49
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,263
What?

50
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,098
Prepare for descent!

51
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,725
Good luck.

52
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,893
Descent.

53
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,397
Going down.

54
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,525
Joo-ryoung!

55
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,241
DIRECTOR JANG MYUNG-AEH

56
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,869
Is something going on at work?

57
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,122
No, nothing.

58
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,251
Make sure you go tell him.

59
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,921
If you don't, I'll go over
and turn the place upside down.

60
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:15,838
Okay.

61
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,132
I'll be back.

62
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,514
Goodness.

63
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,575
-Director Ma.
-Hey.

64
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,578
My mom is here.

65
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,331
Where?

66
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,917
At my place.

67
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,627
She came yesterday.

68
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,045
I see.

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,258
I'm eating lunch with her
tomorrow afternoon,

70
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,261
and she asked for you to join
if you have time.

71
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,263
I have a previous engagement tomorrow.

72
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,514
I see.

73
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,433
What about the day after?

74
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,853
The day after? Probably a meeting.

75
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,815
If you don't come,
she said she'll come to the office.

76
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,527
I'll be there tomorrow.
I can push my schedule back.

77
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,988
Okay.

78
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,955
What will happen
to Director Jang Myung-aeh now?

79
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,625
Will she really retire like this?

80
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,093
-We'll take the plants to the warehouse.
-Yes.

81
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,221
We'll use the elevator, so this way.

82
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,682
-Okay.
-Please be careful.

83
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,938
The newbie is tearing the place down.

84
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:01,235
It's best to stay low
and be quiet in times like these.

85
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,361
Gosh.

86
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,791
Has Director Jang
contacted you separately?

87
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,667
I took over her line of work.

88
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,338
I needed some files from you,
so I sent an email.

89
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,964
Please check those,

90
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,509
and finish it by Monday morning.

91
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,469
Everyone's been working late these days.

92
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,472
We also have tons of work
the president asked us to do.

93
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,265
I see.

94
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,602
Then I'll relay
your exact words to the president.

95
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,728
No.

96
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,649
I'm just sharing the situation.
It's not that I won't do it.

97
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,823
Email me all the files
related to Ko Eun-gyul.

98
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,117
Ko Eun-gyul? Why?

99
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,743
Because I need it.

100
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,543
"Because I need it."

101
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,628
Unbelievable.

102
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,841
Look at how she kicked Director Jang out
and took her office.

103
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,551
Good grief.

104
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,012
But wait.

105
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,267
Why did she single out Eun-gyul
and ask for his file?

106
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,525
The client whom Director Jang
was exclusively in charge of.

107
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,445
They're all calling me
because they can't reach her.

108
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,322
I have to meet them individually
and sort it out,

109
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,741
but I'm really bad at this stuff. Gosh.

110
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,286
Should I do it?

111
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,080
Really?

112
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,458
Aren't you busy?

113
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,419
I'm fine. I'll do it.

114
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,672
Joo-ryoung.
You can't get over this in a few days.

115
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,551
You should be honest with Producer Nah
and tell him you can't do it.

116
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,262
Jung-don, I really want to do this.

117
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,141
It might be because
I wasn't feeling my best that day.

118
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,019
Okay, Joo-ryoung.

119
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,937
I'll talk to the trainers again.

120
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,608
Joo A-hyun won't sign with us.

121
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,904
She even got all the terms she wanted.
Why all of a sudden?

122
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,614
She thinks she can't work in Korea.

123
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,868
Man, what do we do?
We worked to get her for a long time.

124
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:18,247
I went back and forth from Paris
for over a year to get her…

125
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,665
Darn it.

126
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,502
Hey, maybe she heard Kim Ji-hoon's story.

127
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,505
Apparently, the president of Star Media
is spreading rumors

128
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,423
that we took his actor by conning him.

129
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
No.

130
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,635
I doubt it.

131
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,054
Damn, that Cho Gi-bong.

132
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,263
Hey, Won-jae.

133
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,141
What?

134
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,771
What's this about
cutting the budget for field work?

135
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,689
We're discussing it now. Close the door.

136
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,988
I heard you're going to cut down
on their food and travel costs.

137
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,699
We should be providing more
for their hard work.

138
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,243
Exactly.

139
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,495
They work hard,
so they should get good rest.

140
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,997
I'm totally fine with
expenses from their job.

141
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,834
But tagging along on
actors' personal matters? That's too much.

142
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,546
It's a part of our job
to manage their personal life.

143
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,131
If something happens when they're alone--

144
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,884
We can think about that when that happens.

145
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,345
Agents tag along
when actors go for a drink

146
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,014
just to wait in the car all night.

147
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,392
Let's not do that. It's too low.

148
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,269
I get what you're saying,

149
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,730
but if you suddenly cut costs,
there will be complaints from the field.

150
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,526
And why wouldn't you
discuss these things with us?

151
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,362
If you keep meddling with the field--

152
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,446
Just…

153
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,616
Leave management up to us.

154
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,995
This line of work
is different from other fields.

155
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,124
Keep this up and
the company won't operate smoothly.

156
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,127
So I should just pump in my money,
and sit around and watch?

157
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,922
No, you don't know the business,
so just leave it to us.

158
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,010
And if I do,

159
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,679
can you cover the tax penalty losses?

160
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,268
Let's do this.

161
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,064
You'll each bring me a significant
achievement within the next week,

162
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,150
then I'll leave the work up to you.

163
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,152
If you don't bring anything,

164
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,821
you will no longer talk back to me.

165
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,239
Are you trying to make a bet--

166
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,533
Let's do that. Sure.

167
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,160
All right.

168
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:23,164
Also, there are actors
who do nothing after signing with us,

169
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,583
so let's slowly cut off
those contracts too.

170
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,252
Time is money.

171
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,213
Wait a minute. Hey.

172
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,718
Don't worry. He can't do much anyway.

173
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,930
You must have some sort of plan.

174
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,684
Hey, you got…

175
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,687
Mr. Kim, focus on
Kim Joo-ryoung doing well.

176
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,523
You know how everyone is
lined up for Nah Yung-suk's shows.

177
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,527
Nurture a good relationship,
and get more of our actors in his shows.

178
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,905
You said back then that

179
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,449
you don't know the business,
so you'll leave it to us.

180
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,451
Why do you meddle with every little thing?

181
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,286
It's adorable to see you so mad.

182
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,084
Je-suk.

183
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,170
You did all kinds of things
to keep the company together.

184
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,963
What was his name again?

185
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,383
Lee Sang-uk?

186
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,762
I can't believe
you hit on the tax investigator.

187
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,349
Well,

188
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,102
you've been like that since childhood.

189
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,021
You always did what you wanted
no matter what it took.

190
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,815
Ambitious and hate to lose.

191
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,113
Are you going to punch me?

192
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,990
No one would take you
if you get fired for that.

193
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,121
You have an awful rep in this field.

194
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,206
Not getting in?

195
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,293
I take off my school uniform…

196
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,395
ACTOR CONTRACT REVOCATION AGREEMENT

197
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,774
You're telling me not to make use
of Method's name elsewhere.

198
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,445
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,780
I heard I'm the last one.

200
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,034
Did everyone else agree to this
without any complaints?

201
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,333
They always send
the underlings to do these things.

202
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,505
I finished watching
Rainbow Bridge yesterday.

203
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,841
The one you starred in.

204
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,010
I don't have many scenes.

205
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,846
But you played an important role.

206
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,640
And I'm not just saying this.

207
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,311
I really loved your performance in it.

208
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,316
I made it this far
thanks to Director Jang.

209
00:12:55,983 --> 00:13:00,237
Older supporting actors like us
are like kites without strings

210
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,324
unless we have a connection like her.

211
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,836
Mr. Park.

212
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,923
If it's okay with you,

213
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,301
what do you think about
working with a new agent?

214
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,013
That's true.

215
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,892
But can she try one more session?

216
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,644
There are safety concerns too.

217
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,062
If she's in that state,

218
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,773
it'll be tough for her to get trained
at other places too.

219
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,191
Okay, I understand.

220
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,112
Hee-sun, Jin-hyeok told me

221
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,114
that you haven't been auditioning.

222
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,075
Director Ma is such a busy man

223
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,328
that he has no time
for a nameless actor like me.

224
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,998
There's this director
named Oh Hun coming over.

225
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,208
Do you want to meet him?

226
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,834
Oh Hun?

227
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,754
The actor-director, Oh Hun?
Last year's Berlinale awardee?

228
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,090
You're right. He's a close friend.

229
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,508
Hee-sun, come for a second.

230
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,804
He's getting ready for a film,
a musical film.

231
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,265
I told him we have an actress
who can sing very well.

232
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,516
I mean you.

233
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,227
Really? My goodness.

234
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,728
I'm a huge fan of Director Oh.

235
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,314
Well, he's on his way now. Have a seat.

236
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,524
Okay.

237
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,736
All right. Try crossing your legs.

238
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,655
Hand on your chin.

239
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,617
You look like an indie singer. Good.

240
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,579
I'm going to switch the entire ending.

241
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:36,333
The river doesn't capture everything,
so I'm planning to use the sea.

242
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,211
It's much broader.
You know I like stuff to be big.

243
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,130
Of course, the sea is much better.

244
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,549
She's the one I told you about.

245
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,054
Actress Kang Hee-sun,
singer and an actress.

246
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,516
I thought she'd be perfect for this
as soon as I read your script.

247
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,352
She has the right voice
for a musical film.

248
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,647
My film isn't just a musical film.

249
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,401
It's an erotic musical cinema.

250
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,612
-Grab a seat.
-Sure.

251
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,949
You two look great.

252
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,786
So…

253
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,290
It may be that I'm not aware, but

254
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,209
have you released an album?

255
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,172
I'm not a singer who releases albums.

256
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,674
I mostly sing live on the stage.

257
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,092
I prefer that.

258
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,596
I'm not looking for someone
who has technical skills,

259
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,140
but someone with a unique tone of voice.

260
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,560
Imagine this.

261
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,605
Nature as it was in the beginning.

262
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,734
As deep as the roots of the earth,

263
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,028
yet as light

264
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,489
as a leaf.

265
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,616
Yes, I see.

266
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,201
That thing you like.

267
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,704
That's her voice.

268
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,540
Half air, half moisture.
She moistens your ears--

269
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,337
This must be sent quickly,
but I have to leave now.

271
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,838
Give this to the courier later.

272
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,675
I'm in a hurry.

273
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,013
Bye.

274
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,932
Aren't you a signed actress here?

275
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,935
-I am.
-So why is this…

276
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,353
It's method acting.

277
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:23,023
She's about to go into a reading
for an office drama.

278
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,984
So everyone is helping her prepare.

279
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,404
You're right.
"Give this to the courier later."

280
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,406
That was so smooth.

281
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,949
Everyone loves her.

282
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,034
-Is that so?
-You flatter me.

283
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,338
You've improved a lot.

284
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,590
I'm getting much better with lessons.

285
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,802
-Hey, Director Ma.
-Hello, President Bae.

286
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,597
I've been practicing
to get up to your level.

287
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,433
Goodness, don't be modest.

288
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,311
I've been watching your drama.
People love it.

289
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,355
It's great on the outside,

290
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,274
but the set…

291
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,112
It'd be much easier
if we had an agent like you, right?

292
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,614
It'd be easier to control our actors too.

293
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,286
Then why don't we work together?

294
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,329
Then I can help you out.

295
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,584
Really? Then what can I do for you?

296
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,212
I would love to take part in your work
as a producer.

297
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,052
-How about a drink after practice?
-Sounds great.

298
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,596
-See you soon.
-Sure.

299
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,270
Don't mind what happened on that day.

300
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,237
-Joo-ryoung.
-Okay.

301
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,950
I gave this a thought.

302
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,788
There's a method called exposure therapy
that's used to treat phobias.

303
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,208
Instead of avoiding your fear,
you expose yourself to it to overcome it.

304
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,542
Let's get in.

305
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,668
-Get in?
-Yes.

306
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,633
How far does this go up?

307
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,010
-Higher than you think.
-Really?

308
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,970
Don't worry. Stay focused.

309
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,806
-You got this.
-I got this.

310
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,265
-You can do this.
-I can.

311
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,811
We're here.

312
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,021
Joo-ryoung.

313
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,108
-Don't back out.
-Hey, I can't do this.

314
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,359
But you came this far.

315
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,778
Joo-ryoung. Think of Nah Yung-suk.

316
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,906
All right. One step at a time.

317
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,117
-It's okay. I'll hold you.
-Don't let go, okay?

318
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,827
One more step.

319
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,245
Joo-ryoung!

320
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,996
No, Joo-ryoung!

321
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,248
-Hold tightly!
-I am!

322
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,794
No, Joo-ryoung!

323
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,764
Gosh, my back.

324
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,247
I was never afraid of such things before.

325
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,334
So why am I suddenly like this?

326
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,421
It must be caused by pressure.

327
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,758
Could you be more specific?

328
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,344
On the set of Squid Game,

329
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,932
there was a scene
where you fell through the glass bridge.

330
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,728
You wanted to perform so well back then

331
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,856
because it was such an important scene.

332
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,526
The burden from that time
turned into pressure,

333
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,279
and that pressure became trauma,

334
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,782
which makes you freeze up
when faced with a similar situation.

335
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:06,121
Well, actually,
that was my last scene as Mi-nyeo.

336
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,416
So I thought her story would end nicely

337
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:13,462
only if I successfully act out
her complicated feelings,

338
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,839
so I did experience such pressure.

339
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,090
On top of that,

340
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,886
I couldn't sleep a wink
the night before the shoot.

341
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,848
Even after I was done with the scene,
I didn't like the end result.

342
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,518
Your dream and the kindness
in your heart not to harm others.

343
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,190
And you knew this was a real chance,
and you had to make the best of it.

344
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:38,195
You had a tough time physically,
emotionally, and psychologically.

345
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,113
And your body remembers that.

346
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,414
I'd like to take on Mr. Park Chun-bae.

347
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,708
Who's he?

348
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,752
An actor Director Jang used to manage.

349
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,046
He played
lots of supporting roles and extras,

350
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,673
and he recently took up

351
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,509
an important role on a show
called Rainbow Bridge.

352
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,261
Didn't I tell you to get rid of him?

353
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,932
You probably don't know,

354
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,726
but he's highly respected
in the theater scene.

355
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,770
If we officially sign a contract with him

356
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,147
and pay him a little more attention,

357
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,942
he'll be able to land
much better projects in the future.

358
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,238
If you want to sign actors by talent,

359
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,407
there's a truck full of them
in the theater district.

360
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,077
So what I mean is--

361
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,079
No.

362
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,832
If you want to convince me,

363
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:35,127
then show me
how he'll benefit this agency.

364
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,549
Ms. Lim is right about that.

365
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,469
Actors with lots of experience
but low public profiles

366
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,515
end up losing us money
once we take out the expenses.

367
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,186
He might not want to sign with us.

368
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,398
He's not paid a lot,
so if he splits it with us,

369
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,233
there's not much left for him.

370
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,154
Money is always the problem, isn't it?

371
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,365
You already have a lot of work.

372
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,576
Why do you make more work for yourself?

373
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,079
Is it to get on the president's good side?

374
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,165
It's not like that.

375
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,127
I'll eat lunch alone today.

376
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,551
Their dishes are out of this world.

377
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,680
-Shall we eat together?
-I'm meeting my mom today.

378
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,098
Enjoy your lunch.

379
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,725
Have a good time then.

380
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,688
Then let's go eat lunch, Eun-soo.

381
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,901
Eun-soo.

382
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,070
Let's go eat.

383
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,364
I brought lunch. You can eat alone.

384
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,206
Please. That's enough.

385
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,502
I need to look younger,
even if it's only a year.

386
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,130
You're killing me.

387
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,094
I'm too hungry. Let's order first.

388
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,595
Excuse me.

389
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,847
He's here.

390
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,767
What is this? Why does he look the same?

391
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,227
You look the same too.

392
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,231
-It's been a while.
-Hey.

393
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,149
You still look rad…

394
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,693
wonderful.

395
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,948
Jeong-hee, you're the same too.
You haven't changed a bit.

396
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,410
You haven't ordered, right?

397
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,371
Excuse me.

398
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,040
Excuse me.

399
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,917
Come take our order.

400
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,001
Mom.

401
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,854
Hello.

402
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,106
I can't seem to reach my husband.

403
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,736
Oh, no. My gosh.

404
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,488
Please pick up.

405
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,741
Director Ma left for lunch
about an hour ago.

406
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,119
Director Ma, it's Eun-soo.

407
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,872
Your wife is at the office. What do I do?

408
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,415
-Oh, no!
-She's over there.

409
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,125
I think she's onto us. What now?

410
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,793
Call me when you hear this.

411
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,757
Eun-soo.

412
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,260
Eun-soo?

413
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,721
I'm sorry.

414
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,936
-Eun-soo.
-I have to hurry out right now.

415
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,105
Do you know where my husband is?

416
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,692
Hee-sun said you would know.

417
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,611
I wouldn't know.

418
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,279
I'm late for lunch right now.

419
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:53,158
I have to eat with Hyun-joo
and her mother right now.

420
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,826
I'm running late, so I must go.

421
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,455
Hyun-joo's mother?

422
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,665
Yes, she came from Busan yesterday.

423
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,791
Goodbye.

424
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,254
I'll come with you.

425
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,843
I haven't had lunch yet either.

426
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,769
How can you two not say a word to me?

427
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,688
You two are the same.

428
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,982
No, she got her stubbornness from you.

429
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,652
Spending time with her,
I see now how similar you two are.

430
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,446
I really didn't know he was here.

431
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,701
Long time no see, Hyun-joo.

432
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,037
Honey.

433
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,081
Long time no see, Honey.

434
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,374
Well…

435
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,211
Hello.

436
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,588
Hello.

437
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,676
I always wanted a chance to meet you.

438
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,885
My name is Song Eun-ha.

439
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,805
I'm his wife.

440
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,767
My name is So Jeong-hee. Hyun-joo's mom.

441
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,435
Let's talk outside.

442
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,485
Eun-soo, you should go back to the office.

443
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,488
Why are you here? So Ji-sub--

444
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,074
Your dad must be coming.

445
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,286
I'll explain this later.
You should go back.

446
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,371
Is she onto us?

447
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,707
-Is she?
-No, go back.

448
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,874
Go now.

449
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,850
I asked him to meet us.

450
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,728
You don't have to explain, Hyun-joo.

451
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,358
Do you come to Seoul often?

452
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,320
No, I came to meet her.

453
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,946
Otherwise, I wouldn't visit Seoul.

454
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:01,828
Tae-oh and I last met
when she entered high school,

455
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,913
and it's been eight years since then.

456
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,588
When do you go back to Busan?

457
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,964
Before the weekend.

458
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,637
May I have your number?

459
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,598
-Why do you need--
-I'd like to meet you

460
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,141
before you return.

461
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,479
Let's do that.

462
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,123
Excuse me.

463
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,211
A glass of whiskey, please.

464
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,379
-Me too.
-Me too.

465
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,382
Why did you get her number?

466
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,800
Why do you want to meet her?

467
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,843
We have to talk, woman to woman.

468
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,262
How far will you take this?

469
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,348
Wasn't it enough for you to kick me out?

470
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,433
And this isn't fair to Hyun-joo.

471
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,396
Do you think I'm hiding something else?

472
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,400
Or the alimony?
How much more do you want from me?

473
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,276
I didn't take anything from you!

474
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,445
You put our home up for sale
without telling me.

475
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,072
That house is mine.

476
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,617
I paid for the remodeling
and the maintenance.

477
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,662
Unbelievable. I never knew
you were such a petty man.

478
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,499
Why did you come to the office?

479
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,753
To see if my unfaithful husband
is doing well alone.

480
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,671
What now?

481
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,135
Eun-gyul told me you collapsed.

482
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,471
I was an idiot for being worried.

483
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,601
It's really over.

484
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,479
You'll get the divorce papers.
Sign it and send it back.

485
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,696
Man.

486
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,701
I was out of my mind for a moment.

487
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:08,496
I thought he'd take care of you,
since he's your dad after all.

488
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,166
This is so wrong.

489
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,126
Pack up. You're coming with me.

490
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,754
I'm already having a tough time at work.

491
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,423
-Why are you piling on?
-So just quit!

492
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,259
No one will miss you even if you quit.

493
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:25,096
Everything you do there
isn't even important.

494
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,682
It's not like
you work with a famous actor.

495
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,059
An actor's career doesn't equal fame.

496
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,480
Even if no one recognizes my work,
even if my work seems petty,

497
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,731
it's important to me.

498
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,529
Hey.

499
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,283
Hee-sun, can you call me a courier?

500
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,387
A-hyun.

501
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,556
What brings you here?

502
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,058
I'm not here to see you, Ms. Chun.

503
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,229
Hyun?

504
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,525
-Hey!
-Hey! What's going on?

505
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,027
-It's been so long!
-Why are you in Korea?

506
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,112
-What's going on?
-It's been so long!

507
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,240
I'm so glad to see you.

508
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,283
How do you two know each other?

509
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,576
When I was in New York,

510
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,287
his company was
a sponsor for my model agency.

511
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,542
He was such a big help.

512
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,044
Why didn't you tell me
that Mr. Koo was the president?

513
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,087
Mr. Koo?

514
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,820
Yes, hello.

515
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:04,904
Yes.

516
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,409
I'm very sorry, I forgot to call you back.

517
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:10,952
Yes.

518
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,413
I haven't checked…

519
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,291
I'm sorry. Let me call you back.

520
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,339
A-hyun!

521
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,518
Why didn't you tell us
you knew each other?

522
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,270
You never asked.

523
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,648
Whatever. So will she sign with us?

524
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,275
I didn't ask.

525
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,735
What?

526
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,739
You didn't want me
to meddle in those affairs.

527
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,118
What? You can't do it on your own?
Do you want me to help?

528
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,078
She'll say yes if I ask.

529
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,792
Promise you'll accept me as the president

530
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,629
and follow every decision I make.

531
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,839
Then I'll help.

532
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:11,387
I thought about why
you were dying to harass me like this.

533
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,933
In the sixth grade,

534
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,477
I took the entire class
to a hamburger place

535
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,104
because I wanted to be
the entertainment officer.

536
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,774
ENTERTAINMENT OFFICER

537
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,734
I want to be the entertainment officer.

538
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,445
Hamburgers are on me, guys.

539
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,241
Je-suk, hamburgers are on me!

540
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,202
-Let's make you the entertainment officer!
-Back then,

541
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,495
you had a crush on me,

542
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,164
so you said you'd buy everything
when I didn't even ask.

543
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,627
You made a whole speech
about how your parents ran the place.

544
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,589
You began to wail and throw a fit
when you found out I liked someone else.

545
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,549
-Goodness.
-I like you.

546
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,635
Be my boyfriend.

547
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,642
You haven't changed a bit since then.

548
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,396
A kid who's dying for attention.

549
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,608
I'll take care of Joo A-hyun.
Mind your own.

550
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,818
And also,

551
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,489
do you want people to acknowledge you?
Then start acting like a grown-up.

552
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,200
Stop harassing others
while demanding attention.

553
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,924
We have an announcement.

554
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,092
This Sunday,

555
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:35,847
President Koo Hae-jun will hold
a magnificent inauguration ceremony.

556
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,599
Please come and take part.

557
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,184
Let me repeat.

558
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,561
This Sunday,

559
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:45,064
President Koo Hae-jun will hold
a magnificent appointment…

560
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,068
I'm going to invite directors, writers,

561
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,320
and everyone that works in broadcasting.

562
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,741
If you're busy, don't come.
But if you have time, join me as you like.

563
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,367
Over.

564
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,209
I'll show you what I'm capable of.

565
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,129
What?

566
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:09,839
What did he say?

567
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,970
He said come if you like.

568
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,140
It means we don't have to go, right?

569
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,311
I bet my entire fortune that
he'll harass you for life if you don't.

570
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,732
How can he want an inauguration ceremony

571
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,401
after what he did to Director Jang?

572
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,779
Really, it's awful.

573
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,906
Let's boycott the ceremony, everyone.

574
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,990
What?

575
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,619
We can't stand back and just watch him
run the company however he wants.

576
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:43,790
We should have done something
when Director Jang was dismissed.

577
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,833
Darn it.

578
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,628
Now,

579
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,839
it's not too late to show him.
Let's all boycott the ceremony.

580
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,008
He can try without his staff.

581
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,843
What if he fires all of us?

582
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,470
Then we can all leave.

583
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,599
If we all leave at once,
we aren't the ones who'll be sorry.

584
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,892
It's Koo Hae-jun.

585
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,604
Then we'll be able to bring
Director Jang back too.

586
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,397
Yes.

587
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,234
And above all,
we have Director Ma with us.

588
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,572
You told President Koo

589
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,324
to leave management up to you.

590
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,785
That he shouldn't harass us anymore.

591
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,078
No, that's because…

592
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,330
Please take the lead once again.

593
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,791
It'll be such great motivation for us
if you do.

594
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,964
Man.

595
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,842
Okay, fine.

596
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,262
Let's make a promise.

597
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,848
We're boycotting
the inauguration ceremony.

598
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,974
Okay.

599
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,697
Gosh, fine. All right.

600
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,407
Gosh.

601
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,953
It's betrayal if you go to the ceremony.

602
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,508
INAUGURATION D-1

603
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,801
Hello.

604
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,220
Any updates?

605
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,057
We chose the venue.

606
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,769
It's trendy yet luxurious,
a great match with your image.

607
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,688
-Indeed.
-Yes.

608
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,903
I like it.

609
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:43,159
And the caterer is operated by a chef
from a five-star hotel restaurant.

610
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,788
Sounds great.

611
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,916
Are you all excited?

612
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,584
-Yes!
-Yes!

613
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,628
Then I'll see you at the ceremony.

614
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,379
-Yes!
-Yes!

615
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,509
I booked a hotel room for the weekend.

616
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,762
I won't pick up even if he calls.

617
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,640
You, Won-jae, and Hyun-joo.

618
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,725
Turn your phones off, all right?

619
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,144
-Mission complete, ma'am.
-Okay.

620
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,126
Hello, A-hyun. This is Chun Jane.

621
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,631
It's a shame we couldn't talk
when you visited.

622
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,466
If you have time…

623
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,680
You're leaving in two days?

624
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,933
Then before you do…

625
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,602
Wait, where?

626
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,820
You'll do what?

627
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,531
I'd like to sing
at the president's inauguration ceremony.

628
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,074
Exactly. Why?

629
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,410
I hear Director Oh Hun will be there.

630
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,162
After he listens to me sing,

631
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:14,375
you can talk him up to see what he thinks.

632
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,794
Well… One second.

633
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:19,922
Hello, Producer Nah.

634
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,634
What?

635
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,938
Yes, Producer Nah. Okay.

636
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,189
All right.

637
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,610
Joo-ryoung, have this.

638
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,446
It's your usual.

639
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,534
Thanks a lot, Jung-don.

640
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,661
-Let's go.
-Okay.

641
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,833
Producer Nah is
going out of the city next week,

642
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,045
so he wants to talk to you
before he leaves.

643
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,424
Okay.

644
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,592
Joo-ryoung.

645
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,928
Nobody knows about your fear of heights
except for me.

646
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:12,600
Keep up your counseling, and you'll be
better by the time you leave the country.

647
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,726
So don't worry.

648
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,770
All right.

649
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,567
Anyway, where's Won-jae?
Why are you driving?

650
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,863
Won-jae had an all-nighter yesterday.

651
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,699
I see, then he should rest.

652
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,829
I don't think it's a good idea
to bring up Squid Game for a while.

653
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,290
It'll remind you of that falling scene.

654
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,793
I wasn't thinking about it,

655
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,546
but I just remembered
because you mentioned it!

656
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,049
Hey.

657
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,101
INAUGURATION CEREMONY

658
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,441
Hello.

659
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,529
-I'm here.
-Hi.

660
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,406
You really came.

661
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:09,949
How are you?

662
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,743
He's over there. This way, please.

663
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,290
Producer Nah, you're here.

664
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,209
-Hello.
-Hello.

665
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,545
-Director Ma, you're also here.
-Hello, Joo-ryoung.

666
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,047
-So you came.
-Mr. Kim, you're here too.

667
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,508
I love the ambiance of this ceremony.

668
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,552
I should go to Method
for Business Trip to Work.

669
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,512
Sure, come by anytime.

670
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,390
And President Bae of SY Pictures.

671
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,850
I've heard a lot about you.

672
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,686
-Hello.
-Yes, it's an honor to meet you.

673
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,813
I'm a huge fan of Squid Game.

674
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,398
I especially loved Han Mi-nyeo.

675
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,775
-You were the best.
-Thank you.

676
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,992
You traitor.

677
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,744
What about you?

678
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,997
I had to come because of Joo-ryoung.

679
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,082
I came to talk to President Bae too.

680
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,584
To talk? About what?

681
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:07,006
President Bae and I will work together.
A co-production.

682
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,342
I'll tell President Koo later,
so keep it quiet.

683
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,387
And let's pretend
we didn't see each other today.

684
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,555
Okay?

685
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,229
You traitors.

686
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,023
And you were the one
who talked everyone into this.

687
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,232
What about you?

688
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,359
You said we'd quit together.

689
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,611
When did I say that?

690
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,279
I never took things that far.

691
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,281
You're here for Joo A-hyun, aren't you?

692
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,741
Yes.

693
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,994
She's leaving tomorrow.
It's my last chance to talk to her.

694
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,537
If we want to sign with her,
it's now or never.

695
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,331
Everyone probably had faith in us.

696
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,083
I'm too ashamed to see them.

697
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,835
Microphone test.

698
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,295
All right.

699
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,797
And now, let us begin
the inauguration ceremony

700
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:52,009
for President Koo Hae-jun
of Method Entertainment.

701
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:55,763
All guests, please get together
for a moment. Thank…

702
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,479
-…you very much.
-Let's scram.

703
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,277
There's no exit that way.

704
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,489
Greetings. My name is Koo Hae-jun.

705
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,913
First off, I'd like to thank everyone who…

706
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,631
Yes, nice to meet you.

707
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,341
Why am I suddenly sweating?

708
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,136
Producer Nah, thank you.

709
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:41,058
Instead of boring you with greetings,
I'll end it with a quick announcement.

710
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,352
President Bae, please.

711
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:54,029
Method Entertainment will collaborate
with President Bae's SY Pictures

712
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:58,993
and participate more actively
to coproduce dramas and films.

713
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,744
And I'll do my best

714
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:05,499
to provide our actors with more chances
to work on great projects.

715
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,877
On top of that, it'll be even better
if we make more money.

716
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,505
What's going on?

717
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,799
You were talking to me.
Why did you tell him?

718
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,551
What do you mean?

719
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,720
Who else should I be talking to
if not the CEO?

720
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,600
That thing we discussed over golf.

721
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,268
I mentioned it to President Koo,

722
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,312
and he said he was thinking about it too.

723
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,982
He wanted to announce it
along with his ceremony.

724
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,276
So I said yes.

725
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,903
I sent you the divorce papers.
Sign and return them.

726
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,198
Anyway, that President Koo.
He's such a big man--

727
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,908
Let's talk again later.

728
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,203
Director Ma!

729
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,581
-It was great meeting you.
-Sure.

730
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:51,962
A-hyun.

731
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,968
Have you thought about my offer?

732
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,720
I'm not sure.

733
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,015
I'd have to start from ground zero.

734
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:07,394
If the Korean market is too much,
why don't you start in the States?

735
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,022
Other people probably see you

736
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,817
only as a celebrity or a big-shot model,

737
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,069
but not me.

738
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,030
You're already a world-famous model,

739
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,742
so you should also become
a world-famous actress

740
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:22,743
together with me.

741
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,705
One, two, three.

742
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,332
-Okay.
-Thank you.

743
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,251
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

744
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,378
Actually,

745
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,381
I'm a huge fan of Squid Game.

746
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,883
Especially Han Mi-nyeo.

747
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,052
-Yes, thank you.
-Me too.

748
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,472
I was really heartbroken
when she fell off the bridge.

749
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,724
I see. Thank you.

750
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,976
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

751
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,441
Squid Game really has had a big impact.

752
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,651
Right.

753
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,985
Anyway,

754
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,113
how's the rappel training?

755
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,280
Producer Nah, a toast.

756
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,448
Sure.

757
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,826
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

758
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,121
Mr. Kim.

759
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,872
-Hello.
-Hello.

760
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,082
Hee-sun.

761
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,710
Director Oh Hun is over there.

762
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:17,005
You should go.
Producer Nah and I can drink here.

763
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,341
-I'll make it quick.
-Okay.

764
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,926
-I'll be back soon.
-Sure.

765
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,892
So when the rappel suddenly drops--

766
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,977
Producer Nah.

767
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,438
This is so good. May I have another glass?

768
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,690
-One more?
-Yes, one more.

769
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,899
Can you pour me one?

770
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,408
ACTOR CONTRACT REVOCATION AGREEMENT

771
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,201
I'm sorry.

772
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,581
I shouldn't have made the offer
if I couldn't follow through.

773
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,749
Don't say that.

774
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:57,838
I was grateful for your offer

775
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,715
to be my agent.

776
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,468
I felt like

777
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,722
I was somewhat useful as an actor.

778
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,601
Right.

779
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,895
If you get a hold of Director Jang,

780
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:16,690
please tell her that
I really appreciated her hard work.

781
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,860
I can't seem to reach her.

782
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,950
PARK CHUN-BAE

783
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,403
You're here at this hour?

784
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,615
I had some overdue work.

785
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,408
What brings you here?

786
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,162
I have some work to do too.

787
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,209
I'm sorry…

788
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,211
about that day.

789
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,800
There was a situation at the restaurant.

790
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,013
Things have been

791
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,475
quite complicated recently.

792
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,854
Anyway, my wife doesn't know a thing.

793
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,773
Don't worry about it.

794
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,572
Director Ma.

795
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,579
You don't have to try
to take responsibility for everything.

796
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,497
If I…

797
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,418
If we can help you with anything,

798
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,128
let us know anytime.

799
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,257
Okay. Thanks.

800
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,980
Eat up!

801
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,860
You have my trust, Ms. Chun Jane.
Let's make this work.

802
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,529
You won't regret your decision.

803
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,698
Gosh.

804
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,203
I'll get going. I have an early flight.

805
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,165
-Let me take you.
-It's okay. My ride's here.

806
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,207
I'll call you.

807
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,210
Don't drink too much, Hae-jun.

808
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,174
You don't have to come.

809
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,344
Jeez.

810
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,139
Drink up!

811
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,773
Told you, didn't I?

812
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,775
That I'd get Joo A-hyun by myself.

813
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,361
Isn't this a significant achievement?

814
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,029
Jeez.

815
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,573
Don't you think
you and I are too much alike?

816
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,743
We hate to lose.
We have to have whatever we want.

817
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:17,746
And you're dying to win against me

818
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:21,291
because we're the same.
You know, loathing your own kind.

819
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,086
Just admit your defeat
and stop making up lousy excuses.

820
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,254
Excuses? What excuses?

821
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,466
All you did was sign with a model.

822
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,635
You didn't even sign her.
It was just a chat.

823
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,553
What now? All I did?

824
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,513
Yes, that's right.

825
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,183
Hey, you were trying so hard earlier.

826
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,102
Were you dying for my recognition?

827
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:43,230
I'm showing you that we do well
without you, so stop running wild.

828
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,816
-Don't you get it?
-Run wild? When?

829
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,651
I only say the right things.

830
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:48,944
You can hold your liquor.

831
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:27,524
Whenever I look at you

832
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:34,322
My heart doesn't feel like my own

833
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:42,706
Whenever you smile at me

834
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:48,712
Time stands still

835
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,383
Like fate

836
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:59,806
Like an old dream

837
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:06,480
Only if I can fill this world with you

838
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:15,363
The day you come and be with me

839
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,576
Will be the day I believe

840
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:24,289
In the word fate

841
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,585
I'm sorry.

842
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:33,423
Forget it. I have no excuses either.

843
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,550
We're all the same.

844
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,178
We're just helpless people.

845
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,265
Goodness, he's making
so many moves on Hee-sun.

846
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,979
That director always
dates the actress in his film.

847
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,524
Hee-sun should be careful.

848
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,068
Why? She has a boyfriend.

849
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,152
What?

850
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,071
No way.

851
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,824
When I tried to set her up,

852
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,326
she said she isn't with anyone,

853
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,995
but she doesn't want
to date anyone for a while.

854
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,922
Like an old dream

855
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:20,595
Only if I can fill this world with you

856
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,142
I like you.

857
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,395
I have a boyfriend now.

858
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,983
Will be the day I believe

859
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:38,238
In the word fate

860
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:16,568
The call could not be made.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

861
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,195
Charges will be made after the tone.

862
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,156
Director Jang.

863
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,284
It's me, Hyun-joo.

864
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,872
I'm sorry.

865
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,628
Everything that's happened to you…

866
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,298
is all my fault.

867
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,635
I'm so sorry.

868
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:51,394
I wanted to protect
all of the actors you worked with,

869
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,900
but I didn't have the strength.

870
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,779
I'm sorry.

871
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,474
Where did Jung-don go?

872
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,642
Jung-don.

873
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,145
Have you seen my Jung-don?

874
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,397
No.

875
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,357
-We don't know him very well.
-No.

876
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,317
-All right. I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

877
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,902
Goodbye.

878
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,322
Where has Jung-don gone?

879
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,451
Have you seen my Jung-don?

880
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,161
Have you?

881
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,248
I am honestly

882
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,459
scared.

883
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,091
Overcome?

884
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,385
Right.

885
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,846
I shall overcome!

886
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,029
Hey.

887
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,990
What are you doing up there?

888
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,453
It's dangerous up there. Come down.

889
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,747
Hey.

890
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,250
Right.

891
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:43,381
If you could,
you would have come down ages ago.

892
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,968
Why would you be crying up there
if you could?

893
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,555
Hey, but still.

894
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,891
You have to jump down.

895
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,020
You can't stay there forever.

896
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,451
Jane.

897
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,038
Jane.

898
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,550
Why did you drink so much?

899
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,348
How did you come here?

900
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,065
Why are you so late?

901
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,945
I missed you so much.

902
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,118
I'm sorry for everything.

903
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,539
Don't ever leave

904
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,291
without me.

905
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:02,836
I won't.

906
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,102
My goodness.

907
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,979
Somebody save me!

908
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,523
Joo-ryoung!

909
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,233
Oh, my.

910
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,735
Jung-don, where have you been?

911
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,404
How did you get up there?

912
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,530
No idea.

913
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,408
I was up here once I sobered up.

914
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:36,202
Why did you go up there
when you're afraid of heights?

915
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,079
Fear of heights? What?

916
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,789
Goodness, Joo-ryoung.

917
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,166
How did you get up there?

918
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,501
-What's this about fear of heights?
-It's not that.

919
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,753
No, stop it!

920
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,339
Joo-ryoung.

921
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,092
Just drop down.

922
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,636
-What?
-Let go of your hands.

923
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,431
Remember what the doctor said?

924
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,351
Joo-ryoung, don't try so hard.

925
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,520
You've done well enough.

926
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,564
You know that.

927
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,275
Let go. Just let it all go, Joo-ryoung!

928
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,112
Joo-ryoung.

929
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,906
I'm right here. I have you.

930
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,658
Joo-ryoung, let's do it together.

931
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,785
I'll hold you tight.

932
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,621
I'll catch you.

933
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,040
Let go.

934
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:25,293
Okay. I'll try.

935
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,378
You can do this, Joo-ryoung.

936
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,422
Are you all right?

937
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,136
Yes.

938
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,644
So where's Jung-don?

939
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:31,818
Joo-ryoung.

940
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,363
-Are you okay?
-Hey.

941
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:39,033
Were you here like this?

942
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,495
Jung-don.

943
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,666
Thank you, Jung-don.

944
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,001
Great job.

945
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,545
-Thank you.
-No problem.

946
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,218
I'm finally sobering up.

947
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,598
It's really effective.

948
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,017
It is. Thanks.

949
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,279
Jung-don.

950
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,741
You know that

951
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,910
when I was about to give up

952
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:26,873
on 20 years of my career as an actor,

953
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,500
I took on Squid Game.

954
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:33,880
I thought, "Fine, I'll do this and quit."

955
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:38,968
That's why I did my best
and gave it my all.

956
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,805
Of course I know, Joo-ryoung.

957
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,516
It was tough for me just watching you.

958
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,272
After Squid Game became a huge hit,

959
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,442
I was very grateful and happy

960
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,613
that people loved and welcomed me,

961
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,948
but I was also afraid.

962
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,661
Afraid it would go back to the way it was.

963
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,706
That's nonsense. Why would you think that?

964
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,293
Joo-ryoung, this is just the beginning.

965
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,588
You're an actor that makes people
anticipate your next role.

966
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,173
I know it for sure.

967
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:22,553
So you have to believe in yourself
and march forward.

968
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,683
Do you think I can really do a good job?

969
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:30,061
I know because
I've been with you to this day.

970
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:31,062
Also,

971
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,648
don't try so hard.

972
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:39,779
Jung-don.

973
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:41,948
I am…

974
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,993
so glad that you're my agent.

975
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,538
Me too.

976
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,331
Thanks.

977
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,959
Thank you, I mean it.

978
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,961
Why are you like this today?

979
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,963
-Let's go.
-Shall we?

980
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,513
Right.

981
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:10,393
Producer Nah just heard
that I have a fear of heights. What now?

982
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,062
I'll talk to him once again.

983
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,814
I think it'll be more interesting.

984
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:22,321
What's so fun about watching someone
do what they're good at.

985
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,116
It's more touching to see
someone muster up courage

986
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,786
and overcome their fears. Isn't that so?

987
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,955
Gosh, Producer Nah.

988
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,585
Let's fly through the sky in style.

989
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,129
Sorry?

990
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,505
The sky?

991
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,882
-Why would I fly?
-What?

992
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:42,800
-Producer Nah.
-Producer Nah.

993
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,093
Did you say the sky?

994
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,263
Yung-suk!

995
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:49,098
-Producer Nah!
-Wait, Yung-suk!

996
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,892
No, I can't fly!

997
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,086
Director Ma, why don't you lead

998
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,964
the co-production with SY Pictures?

999
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,053
I think you'll do great.

1000
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,226
I take off my school uniform…

1001
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,197
Traitor. Renegade.

1002
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,908
The managers and Director Ma
were there too.

1003
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,828
-Why are you so harsh with us?
-Exactly.

1004
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,579
-Eun-soo.
-Traitor.

1005
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,498
I'm sorry.

1006
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,127
Gosh, how much did she drink?

1007
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,259
-Did you get home well?
-I did.

1008
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,052
-Did you have fun?
-Yes.

1009
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,180
I had fun too.

1010
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,815
Hey, Suk.

1011
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,775
Drink this and sober up.

1012
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,235
I'm dying here.

1013
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,071
You drank like a fish.

1014
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:31,784
Hey, you got sauce on your hair.

1015
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,455
How did you come here?

1016
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,749
What are you spewing?
I got us hangover drinks.

1017
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,461
Why are you so late?

1018
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,881
I missed you so much.

1019
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:48,217
You're wasted. A goner. Goodness.

1020
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:51,053
I'm sorry for everything.

1021
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,433
So don't ever leave without me.

1022
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,685
What the hell are you saying? Hey!

1023
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,313
Hey, what's with you?

1024
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:36,057
Actor Park Chun-bae,
who starred in  Rainbow Bridge,

1025
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:40,811
was nominated for Best Supporting Actor
at the Golden Film Festival.

1026
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:46,484
He was a lesser-known actor who endured
a 30-year career outside of the spotlight.

1027
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,652
That's all for today.

1028
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,786
BEHIND EVERY STAR

1029
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:22,228
-That day…
-It was a mistake.

1030
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,521
And I already love someone else.

1031
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,856
The tax guy? What about kissing?
Was I first? Who did you kiss first?

1032
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,110
-Director Oh Hun? Just the two of you?
-This is a restricted area.

1033
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,361
Do you feel like he's taken her?

1034
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:34,156
Make sure Daniel Henney stars in this film
or I'll terminate his contract.

1035
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,325
-Sorry, but I don't have time.
-Chun Je-suk!

1036
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,870
Daniel must do this film.
We can't miss this. I'm dead serious.

1037
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,998
It's such an incredibly ridiculous idea.

1038
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,541
Director Ye refuses to work with Daniel.

1039
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:46,711
-What should we do?
-I think I can help.

1040
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:50,089
The real problem is So Hyun-joo.

1041
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,258
We can take legal action and fire her.

1042
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,968
