1
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,952
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,122
EPISODE 7

3
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:43,501
I heard you two became the hosts
of a new variety show.

4
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,213
It's a musical audition program
called Love Love Musical.

5
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,925
So-hyun and I will both be the hosts
and judges on the show.

6
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:56,639
Then you two must continue
to see each other at home and work.

7
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,433
You get sick of each other, don't you?

8
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,268
"Get sick of each other"?

9
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,689
I've never felt such a thing with So-hyun.

10
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,442
Gosh, I've got goosebumps.

11
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,278
It must be tough for our agent here
to watch this.

12
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,780
Anyway,

13
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,449
isn't it uncomfortable
sharing the same agent?

14
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:17,285
You might end up saying something
you probably shouldn't.

15
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,162
Not at all.

16
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,831
We don't keep any secrets between us.

17
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,292
It's already the last question.

18
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,586
What do you think it means to be married?

19
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,050
To be married is
to be with your life's companion

20
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,927
who loves and trusts you.

21
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,638
You came thoroughly prepared.

22
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,931
What about you, Jun-ho?

23
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:43,311
On a stage called life,
a partner whom you can

24
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:45,980
trust the most.

25
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:47,899
Oh, my.

26
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,276
Oh, my, you two are far too sweet.

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,945
It's time to let you two go.

28
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,655
When will the program air?

29
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:57,117
This Saturday at 9 p.m., on tvX.

30
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,536
-Please tune in!
-Please tune in!

31
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,330
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

32
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,748
-Thank you.
-Great work--

33
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,294
Inhale.

34
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,756
Exhale.

35
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,176
Inhale.

36
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,847
Exhale.

37
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:25,395
You're breathing is becoming
more and more comfortable.

38
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,115
ACTRESS KIM SO-HYUN

39
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,121
-Hello?
-Director Ma, what do I do?

40
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,165
Why? What's going on?

41
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:49,460
I was in my car with a friend,
and I think someone took a picture of us.

42
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,713
What? Is your friend a man?

43
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,048
Did you do something inappropriate?

44
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,885
No, he's a friend from university,

45
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,511
and we were just chatting.

46
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,222
Then what's to worry about?

47
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,182
Well…

48
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,729
Jun-ho thinks I went to my parents' house.

49
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,273
-What?
-You can't tell him no matter what.

50
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,068
He hates it when I meet him.

51
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,904
Goodness. Calm down.

52
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,864
It's late, so go home.

53
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,866
-Go tell Jun-ho the truth.
-What?

54
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,535
Be honest and tell him the truth.

55
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,996
He'll be angrier
if he later finds out that you lied.

56
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,463
Thinking it over,
I may have been mistaken.

57
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,383
They could have taken a selfie
as they walked by, right?

58
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,760
-What?
-Gosh.

59
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,386
That must be it.

60
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,306
I got overly conscious
and took it the wrong way.

61
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,391
Nothing will happen, so don't worry.

62
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,227
-I'm hanging up.
-So-hyun, hello?

63
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,980
Jeez.

64
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,487
Sang-uk?

65
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,509
What is it?

66
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,348
It's what you asked me to do.

67
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,560
I singled out Ko Eun-gyul's scenes
and put them together.

68
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,478
-How's Eun-gyul doing?
-Sorry?

69
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,315
How is he on set?

70
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,819
I thought… Yes.

71
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,947
Everyone compliments him
for doing his best.

72
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,908
He should unless he wants to hear
talk of nepotism.

73
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,413
You don't have to worry about that.

74
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,999
The actors and production crew said

75
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:37,920
they wanted to work with him again
for his diligence and good character.

76
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,763
Then you can take Ko Eun-gyul from now on.

77
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,390
Sorry?

78
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,601
Well, there aren't a lot of scenes left,

79
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,438
but go to the ones that are left
for some field experience.

80
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,402
Yes, I'll do my best.

81
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,403
Really?

82
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,240
Yes, a director saw you
at your last audition

83
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,825
and he must have liked you a lot.

84
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,119
He's invited you for a different audition.

85
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,329
What's the role?

86
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,623
It's not decided yet.

87
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,124
First, he wants to see you again,

88
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,502
and if there's a fit,
match you with a role.

89
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,003
This happens from time to time.

90
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,173
A director can even create a new role
for an actor they really like.

91
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,176
Let's see.

92
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,096
You can leave after lunch around 1 p.m.

93
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,056
I told Won-jae about it, so go with him.

94
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,519
You aren't coming with me?

95
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,354
I'm swamped with work today.

96
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,775
A callback is a great opportunity,

97
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,318
so make sure to do well.

98
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,528
Okay?

99
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,698
Yes.

100
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,077
I'm going on set from tomorrow

101
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,455
as Eun-gyul's agent.

102
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,754
But don't worry.
I'll be there only as an agent,

103
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,466
and I know best about his strengths
and weaknesses as an actor.

104
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,218
Okay.

105
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,053
Good luck.

106
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,432
It must be tough for him,
so look after him on set.

107
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,979
And I feel bad for you.

108
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,148
It must be tough for you too.

109
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,358
It's okay.

110
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,362
So while we're at it,

111
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,825
I want to try

112
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,912
to set things right from here.

113
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,416
But you already told your wife.

114
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:42,086
I want to be honest at work too,
and tell them that you're my daughter.

115
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,132
If you say I'm your daughter now,

116
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,051
they'll all feel betrayed by me,

117
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,721
thinking I hid it from them
the whole time.

118
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,223
And there's Eun-gyul too.

119
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,439
I'm fine with how things are,

120
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,234
so please keep it a secret at work
just as it is now.

121
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,614
Okay.

122
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,454
-Should we head out now?
-Okay.

123
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,708
Thank you for the food.

124
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,170
ACTRESS KIM SO-HYUN
MISSED CALLS

125
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,510
Isn't that the president of Star Media?

126
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,805
And our president's wife next to him…

127
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,978
-"Is he a musical actor too?"
-This is just awful.

128
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,689
-She usually doesn't upload this stuff.
-When did this happen?

129
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,815
I can't believe it.

130
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,277
-What's wrong?
-Look.

131
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,989
Someone uploaded this on social media,
then deleted it right away,

132
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,699
but it already got around.

133
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,618
I'm starting to see articles too.

134
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,912
This wasn't edited, was it?

135
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,957
You knew?

136
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,500
I talked to So-hyun yesterday.

137
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,419
He's a school friend.
They were chatting in the car.

138
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,921
They're hugging each other.

139
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,590
-Look.
-Having fun?

140
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,926
No, it's just that the photo…

141
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,512
His belt wouldn't come off.

142
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,973
She went to help him,
and it was taken then.

143
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,975
It looks like that because it's dark.

144
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,893
So it wasn't an affair?

145
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:21,936
Seriously.

146
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,188
I was just worried. I'm sorry.

147
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,774
The Love Love Musical staff
is going to complain.

148
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,277
They were cast as hosts
since they're a happy couple,

149
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,237
but they're in this mess now.

150
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,032
This week is the premiere,
so they have lots of promotions booked.

151
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,244
So let's patch this up.
We have to be honest about these things.

152
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,705
If things don't add up later, it blows up.

153
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,125
It won't become a bigger problem
as long as we play the media right.

154
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,544
There's a bigger problem.

155
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,299
President Wang's wife is
in contact with Cho Gi-bong of Star Media.

156
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,550
Why?

157
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,511
-Will she sell us off to them?
-Maybe.

158
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,055
Cho Gi-bong would do that and much more.

159
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,517
He lived his entire life
trying to bring President Wang down.

160
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,021
And everyone, listen up.
The agency is really struggling.

161
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,982
We lost a lot of income
when films got canceled due to COVID-19,

162
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,650
and our additional taxes…

163
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,570
were a lot more than we expected.

164
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,115
What? Are you saying that's my fault?

165
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,075
You said you'd handle it.

166
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,328
Director Ma, you said
you'd buy the company.

167
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,164
All right, now.
Anyway, I gave this some thought.

168
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,169
We'll have to reduce our salaries
for a couple of months.

169
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,423
What? Whose salary?

170
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,591
Our salaries.

171
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,426
All of us.

172
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,641
Once we're back on track,
you'll get all your deferred pay.

173
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,643
How can you be so sure?

174
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,479
We don't know
when we'll get back on track.

175
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,399
Who knows if it'll be two months,
three months, or six? No one knows.

176
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,403
I can't believe you, Director Ma.

177
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,407
Me neither.

178
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,535
It's very tough for me…

179
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,666
to believe you, Director Ma.

180
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,837
Goodness.

181
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,591
Why'd you come here
when there are so many prying eyes?

182
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,885
Don't try to fool me. Be honest.

183
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,388
You knew, didn't you?
You know why she met that jerk.

184
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,099
-I'm sure they chatted as friends.
-Friend, my ass.

185
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,684
A man and a woman can't be friends.

186
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,228
This is so unfair.

187
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,648
When one of his girl friends calls,
he runs out right away to meet them.

188
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,193
Ever since I got married,
all I've ever known was work and home.

189
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,030
Don't you know why So-hyun would
go so far as to make up such a lie?

190
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,074
I wasn't going to tell you this, but…

191
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,953
Jun-ho is downstairs.

192
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,916
He gets that he was mistaken
and feels bad for overreacting.

193
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,418
So accept his apology.

194
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,669
It's just as you said.

195
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,047
Just as you hid your affair from your wife
to avoid hurting her,

196
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,299
-So-hyun lied in case I got hurt.
-Take this.

197
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:02,221
Take this, tell her you're sorry,
apologize, and make up. Okay?

198
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,723
I'll let her off this time.

199
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,933
Okay.

200
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,685
Darn it.

201
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,481
-One second.
-What now?

202
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,358
Let me check the dashcam.

203
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,362
UNABLE TO USE VIDEO SAVE FUNCTION

204
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,947
SAVED VIDEOS: 0

205
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,824
So why did you delete the footage?

206
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,578
My friend asked me
not to share his story with anyone.

207
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,704
How can I believe her?

208
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,332
She dated so many guys
before we got married.

209
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,335
I once went to her house
and found a stash of matching rings.

210
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,131
What about him?
He clung to a single woman for years.

211
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:41,093
And even now, every single day,
he watches IU's videos on repeat!

212
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,304
That is my only means of comfort.

213
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,473
Last Valentine's Day,

214
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,683
she got me cheap,
convenience store chocolate.

215
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,768
He only acts sweet on TV. So pretentious.

216
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,479
She may be my senior out here,

217
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,897
but she patronizes me at home

218
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,648
and nags at me all the time!

219
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,900
-You have no idea how much
-You have no idea how much

220
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,319
-I've been enduring it all this time!
-I've been enduring it all this time!

221
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,821
Enough. Stop!

222
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,499
You want me to manage So-hyun?

223
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,083
Yes, just for a short while.

224
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,878
Go with Mr. Kim for a few days.

225
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,173
You and Jun-ho have
the same schedule right now,

226
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,883
and you two will only fight.

227
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,009
Gosh.

228
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,595
So you're choosing Jun-ho over me.

229
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,055
It's not that.

230
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,599
You're probably mentally drained.

231
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,018
I thought it'd be nice
to have Mr. Kim around.

232
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,103
He's deeply caring and calm.

233
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,232
He's the most trusted agent
among the actors in our agency.

234
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:40,236
And also, Mr. Kim, didn't you say
you wanted to work with her?

235
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,362
Me?

236
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,867
Yes, I did.

237
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,287
If being separated from Jun-ho is ideal,

238
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,665
I'd rather look
for another agency at this point--

239
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,707
-No.
-No.

240
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,677
Yes, hello?

241
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,804
I'm calling from Shark Entertainment.

242
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,639
Is this Agent Choi Jin-hyeok?

243
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,225
Yes, that's me.

244
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,520
You recently applied to our job opening
as an experienced agent, right?

245
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,522
I called after seeing your résumé.

246
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,274
Yes, that's right.

247
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,944
We're in a bit of a rush.
Can you start next week?

248
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,028
What?

249
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,114
That soon?

250
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,533
One of our managers suddenly had to quit.

251
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,993
Please consider it soon.

252
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,121
Next week is a bit of a rush…

253
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,415
Did you just say…

254
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,543
it was a manager position?

255
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,544
Yes.

256
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,840
Mr. Choi Jin-hyeok,
we'd like you to join us as a manager.

257
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,845
Well, this is a very sudden offer.

258
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,347
Can you tell me about the
compensation package?

259
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,766
That would aid in considering the offer.

260
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,257
Your coffee is ready.

261
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,843
Yes, right.

262
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,304
-Did you do what I asked?
-Yes.

263
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,306
You'll see the reservation in the app.

264
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,016
You depart tomorrow at 7 a.m.

265
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,267
Are you going somewhere?

266
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,644
Haenam. My parent's place.

267
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,853
All of a sudden?

268
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,689
She's receiving an award
as a youth who's honored her hometown.

269
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,691
That's just an excuse.

270
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,903
The district provided a filming site
for Han Ji-min's new film.

271
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,739
I'm stopping by to thank them
and show my face around.

272
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,158
Use the opportunity to get some fresh air.

273
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,203
And clear your mind.

274
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,621
What fresh air?

275
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,540
I run into my parent's friends
at every corner,

276
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,292
so it's more like a prison.

277
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,755
Why am I returning the next day?
I wanted to return right away.

278
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:08,175
Well, that was the only viable time
because you wanted to stop by

279
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,760
Han Ji-min's film location.

280
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,637
Man, this is driving me insane.

281
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,182
Won-jae.

282
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,142
What's Ji-min's schedule like on set?

283
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,769
She doesn't have any time off?

284
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,062
Goodness.

285
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,773
She doesn't even want to spend a night
in her hometown.

286
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,067
I guess not.

287
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,703
Hee-sun.

288
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,497
I heard your second audition is today.

289
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,959
Won-jae told me
that you got another callback.

290
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,753
-Yes.
-I'm glad.

291
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,880
Anyway, what's with them?

292
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,967
If they want to cast you,
they should do it straight away.

293
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,093
Right?

294
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,721
Hee-sun, you'll get busier soon.

295
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,931
We'll need a new receptionist soon.

296
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,767
Good luck later.

297
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,644
Hello, Director.

298
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,229
Yes, right.

299
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,856
Have you been well?

300
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,066
Yes, I've been well.

301
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,992
I'm sorry.

302
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,703
The company cars were all booked.

303
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,165
It's all right.
I go around like this often.

304
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,167
The bus is probably faster at this hour.

305
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,754
But still.
I wanted you to relax on your way there.

306
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,756
You need to focus on your script too.

307
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,467
I only have one line today.

308
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:32,968
That's true.

309
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,973
Anyway, Hyun-joo.

310
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,477
You're really pretty today.

311
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,816
You're a great actor.

312
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,901
-I am?
-Yes.

313
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,402
-You practiced a lot.
-Was that good?

314
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,612
Totally.

315
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,574
It's a lot of pressure
since it's just one line.

316
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,118
Yes, and that one line
should be memorable too.

317
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,620
-Yes.
-You did really well.

318
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,288
-Let me try again.
-No.

319
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,539
-Just once more.
-No.

320
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,042
-Anyway, you're really pretty today.
-No, stop that.

321
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,752
-So pretty.
-You're a good actor.

322
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,295
-So dazzling.
-Enough.

323
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,546
-My eyes.
-Stop overreacting.

324
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,466
The star lovebirds special?

325
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,468
Yes, we'd love to have them there,

326
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,013
but both Kim So-hyun and Son Jun-ho
are completely booked right now.

327
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,682
I'm sorry. Bye.

328
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,520
We're getting so many casting calls
after the scandal.

329
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,940
Why is Hyun-joo on set on a day like this?

330
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,942
This is Method Entertainment.

331
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,569
You left this on the copier.

332
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,240
And once you're done using it,
can you refill the paper?

333
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,326
It's not like we have a guy
just for refilling the copier.

334
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,420
Won-jae, can you go downstairs
and get some coffee?

335
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,798
A reporter is coming in for an interview.

336
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,761
We didn't join this company
to fetch coffee and run errands.

337
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,222
Not at all.

338
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,600
Jin-hyeok, is something going on?

339
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,519
Listen up, Won-jae.

340
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,981
Putting up with such mistreatment
and staying loyal to the agency?

341
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,899
I'm not sure.

342
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:15,070
This agency won't protect you forever.

343
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,283
But figures.

344
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,411
My advice to you ends

345
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,289
right about here.

346
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,215
-Three cups?
-Yes, Americanos.

347
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,341
Okay.

348
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:43,056
You're the joint host
for Love Love Musical with Son Jun-ho.

349
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,976
Do you ever get into fights?

350
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,688
All the time.
How can a married couple not fight?

351
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,983
Life every day is a climax.

352
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,444
And it ends in tragedy.

353
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,864
Could you stick to questions
about the program?

354
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,199
-Sure.
-Thanks.

355
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:05,078
Then what do you think is
most important between a couple?

356
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,497
I'm sorry,
but no questions about her private life.

357
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,043
I'm asking
about the contents of the program.

358
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,631
If you keep this up,
it's slightly uncomfortable.

359
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,050
I've been mentally worn out lately,

360
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,761
so he's concerned I might make a mistake.

361
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,014
Then let me ask you
about your future plans.

362
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,644
Do you have any other musicals in line
after Anna Karenina?

363
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,688
I don't have any plans right now.

364
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,274
I want to abandon everything.

365
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,944
No, she doesn't mean
abandoning everything.

366
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,738
She just said…

367
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,075
-she wants to abandon everything.
-No.

368
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,660
That's not what she means.

369
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,787
Well, it's… Anyway, no.

370
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,580
Considering retiring…

371
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,123
"Considering retiring"?

372
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,875
No, she hasn't considered that.

373
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,044
Q. FUTURE PLANS?
A. NO PLANS, I WANT TO ABANDON…

374
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,423
What are you doing right now?

375
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,301
I want to ensure
the interview is accurate.

376
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,345
I shouldn't have. I'm sorry.

377
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,682
Sure.

378
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,725
Wait, I…

379
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,270
Wait, I mean.

380
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,523
-Forget it.
-Let me…

381
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,233
I'll give you a call.

382
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:22,239
HAENAM CITIZENS' DAY
MAKE OUR HOMETOWN SHINE AWARD

383
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,245
-Why did he leave her with me?
-I wonder.

384
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,331
Director Ma manages
all the musical actors himself.

385
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,418
He normally doesn't like it
when others intervene.

386
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,794
Precisely.

387
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,713
It's really odd.

388
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,466
Did he put So-hyun with me
thinking she'll cause trouble?

389
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,135
He doesn't want to be responsible.

390
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,721
He's doing this to get rid of me,
his strongest rival.

391
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,931
That's it.

392
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,559
It must be a scheme
to get rid of me for good, right?

393
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,478
That must be it. You're in deep trouble.

394
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,274
Hey, I'll call you later.

395
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,234
-Hello.
-Well,

396
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,652
look who it is.

397
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,113
It's the eldest of the Chun family.

398
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,741
Wow, you've become a young lady already.

399
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,576
What young lady? She's about to be 40--

400
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,289
She'll be older tomorrow
than she is today,

401
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,957
but she won't get married.

402
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,500
Do I go up when I'm called?

403
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,626
No.

404
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,629
There was a bit of a change.
You haven't heard?

405
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,965
What are you talking about?

406
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,675
Isn't my kid getting an award?

407
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,595
Will you stop shouting?
You'll make me go deaf.

408
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,639
Now, don't worry about that.

409
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,726
We just have a surprise guest.

410
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,853
We're awarding him too,

411
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,732
so we just switched
the order of the ceremony. Just the order.

412
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,068
You know him too, right?

413
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,654
The second son of the mill, Hae-jun.

414
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,823
Oh, my.

415
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,451
The one who became
a big success in America?

416
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,871
He made some dating app or something

417
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,457
-and made a fortune, right?
-Yes.

418
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,001
I wonder if he's still single.

419
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,046
Do you remember him?

420
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,382
You two used to be best friends
when you were young.

421
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,718
-Goodness.
-Look at that cool car.

422
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,138
Oh, my. Speak of the devil.

423
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,223
There he is.

424
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,601
-What's that car?
-That looks impressive.

425
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,984
Is that him?

426
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,529
Well…

427
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,073
He's quite handsome.

428
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,201
Look who this is. It's my son.

429
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,829
-Goodness, welcome back.
-Hello.

430
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,664
-How was your trip?
-How are you?

431
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,165
How long has it been?

432
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,709
-He's my son. Isn't he good-looking?
-He's quite tall.

433
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,670
He made a fortune.

434
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,589
My gosh.

435
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,476
We are here to commemorate
the 49th Haenam Citizens' Day.

436
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,563
I'd like to thank our residents
and distinguished guests

437
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,774
for traveling a long way and coming here

438
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:07,612
to honor the Make Our Hometown Shine Award

439
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,490
despite your busy schedules.

440
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,703
Well, you already know that
Ms. Han Ji-min, the actress,

441
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,039
is here at Haenam right now

442
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,000
filming a movie, right?

443
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,377
The agent of Actress Han Ji-min is

444
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,006
Ms. Chun Jane,
who is sitting with us right now.

445
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:30,552
She is the daughter of Chun Bong-su,
the representative of the Livestock Co-op.

446
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:37,726
This young lady who now works
with such a global star

447
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,061
was proudly brought up in our hometown.

448
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,688
Please give her a big hand.

449
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,691
MAKE OUR HOMETOWN SHINE AWARD

450
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,196
Do we know each other?

451
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,865
Class 6-2, Haenam Elementary.

452
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,283
It was you, Chun Je-suk.

453
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,370
Why does everyone call you Chun Jane?

454
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,706
I changed my name in middle school.

455
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,416
I see.

456
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,792
Je-suk suits you better.

457
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,379
Following this young lady's example,

458
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,591
we'll continue to cooperate actively…

459
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,009
ME + U
SERVER DOWNTIME NOTICE

460
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:15,639
…to help K-dramas
and K-movies expand worldwide.

461
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,265
I made that app.

462
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,310
And now, let me introduce Mr. Koo Hae-jun.

463
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,104
He developed a dating app

464
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,859
that became a big hit
in over 40 countries worldwide.

465
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,114
He is also a famous businessman
as an M&A specialist,

466
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,783
and he was chosen

467
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,536
as the tenth most noteworthy
young businessman by the LA Times.

468
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:45,210
Anyway, I have a question for you.

469
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,838
May I ask you?

470
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,257
Sure, please.

471
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:57,013
I hear you'll begin
a new business in Korea.

472
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:00,100
I'm quite curious about that.

473
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,851
I'm still thinking about it.

474
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,603
Please make a good recommendation.

475
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:08,358
Our district is
in need of a new soccer field.

476
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,610
What do you think about that?

477
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,656
He's such a funny man, isn't he?

478
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:29,879
I'd like to donate a natural grass field
for every school in our district.

479
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:39,431
Who knows? Our hometown
may have the next Son Heung-min.

480
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:47,856
-Koo Hae-jun!
-Koo Hae-jun!

481
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,275
-He's so cool!
-Koo Hae-jun!

482
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,153
-Koo Hae-jun!
-Koo Hae-jun!

483
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,531
What's going on?

484
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,367
We put out a press release saying

485
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,828
the couple will come,
but only So-hyun showed up!

486
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,914
I'm sorry.
Jun-ho isn't feeling well lately.

487
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,500
You know how hard it was
to get on We Quiz, don't you?

488
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,295
I do. And that's why I'm sorry.

489
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:16,176
But why don't we let So-hyun
promote Love Love Musical alone?

490
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,302
Are you kidding me?

491
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,431
Forget it. They have to be there
for the live talk show tomorrow.

492
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,893
If they don't show up there either,
then I won't let this slide!

493
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,686
I will sue you for breach of contract

494
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,856
and cut them both off from the program!

495
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,112
Good grief.

496
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,406
RECENT CALLS

497
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,368
ACTOR SON HO-JUN

498
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,536
The device is turned off.
Please leave a message…

499
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,082
They're driving me nuts.

500
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,377
Have you heard?

501
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,212
Is So-hyun still upset?

502
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,135
Yes, she's barely
getting through her schedule.

503
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,680
But she has to do
that live talk show tomorrow.

504
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,644
Anyway, about asking me to manage So-hyun.

505
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,020
Why did you do that?

506
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,233
I mean, it's all very sudden.

507
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,445
To be honest, you've never transferred
one of your clients to me before.

508
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,406
I found it odd.

509
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,867
So-hyun needs you right now
more than she needs me.

510
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,328
Someone she can lean on
during her troubles.

511
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,997
If it hadn't been for you,

512
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,291
she wouldn't have done any work right now.

513
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,005
Do you really think so?

514
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,258
Why? Don't you believe me?

515
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:42,887
I mean, you've never said
anything like that to me before.

516
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,976
Ever since you and your wife parted,

517
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,270
strangely enough,
you've become more considerate.

518
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,857
We haven't parted.
We're temporarily separated.

519
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,483
The two will make up soon, right?

520
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,526
Of course.

521
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,236
We won't break up that easily.

522
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,320
Don't worry.

523
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,406
I meant So-hyun and Jun-ho.

524
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:08,246
This seemed a little too serious
to simply call it a lover's quarrel.

525
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,081
What if they--

526
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,708
What do you know, Mr. Kim?

527
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,252
A couple doesn't break up over a fight.

528
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,378
Right?

529
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,338
Right.

530
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:22,343
And they won't get divorced
unless one of them is hugely at fault.

531
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,310
Darn.

532
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,530
Who's that?

533
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,115
Jang Myung-aeh!

534
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,326
What have you done? Hey!

535
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,203
Darn it. Have you gone senile?

536
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,790
Oh, my.

537
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,958
You got me.

538
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,669
Damn it, I just got this two months ago!

539
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,421
You got all four sides.

540
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,758
Hey, do you want to get arrested
for damaging property?

541
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,886
No, you better be careful
if you don't want to be arrested.

542
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,725
You put up this building
with bribes you took behind your actors.

543
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,560
Do your actors know?

544
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,062
How funny.

545
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,689
What now? Do you have any evidence?

546
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,107
How funny.

547
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,694
Of course.
Do you think I came here with nothing?

548
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:25,406
When Tae-ja and I were
betrayed and kicked out by you,

549
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,117
do you think we left empty-handed?

550
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,292
Method Entertainment isn't an agency
for some hoodlum like you.

551
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,003
Don't you dare lurk around us again.

552
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,214
This won't be the end of it.

553
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,348
It's not too late to join us.

554
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,812
Your dearly beloved Wang Tae-ja
is now dead and long gone.

555
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,981
Method will go down soon.

556
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,364
Hey!

557
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,034
This is my final warning.

558
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,289
If you mess with Method,
Star Media will also…

559
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,166
Got it?

560
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,547
What? Hey.

561
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,257
Not the hood. You!

562
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,719
No! Not the bumper! Damn it, that woman.

563
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,055
He sold the dating app
to Jacebook for 80 million dollars.

564
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,892
-Are you listening?
-Yes.

565
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,102
But would he invest in us?

566
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:39,480
I heard he divorced his wife in America
and returned to Korea for good.

567
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,150
He's looking for a new investment,

568
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,569
I'm going to try to win him over.

569
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,404
How will you do that?

570
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,114
He used to like me as a kid.

571
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,366
It's our last chance
to protect our agency…

572
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,035
Hey, stop!

573
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,879
Hey, Chun Je-suk. What's up?

574
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,673
It's our reunion,
so it's a shame to leave so early.

575
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,841
Let's grab a meal.

576
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,637
If you're busy,

577
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,932
can you drop me off at my set?

578
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,734
One of our clients is on set nearby.

579
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,569
Han Ji-min.

580
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,280
Give her the address.

581
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,284
Yes, okay. Go now. Go!

582
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,911
Go now! Go far away!

583
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,872
Don't come home!

584
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,169
I can't believe we met again like this.

585
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,172
Seems like fate brought us together.

586
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,679
Do you remember how I saved you
when you transferred in and got bullied?

587
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,601
That Koo Hae-jun grew up
into such a magnificent guy.

588
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,647
Well, I knew it back then too.

589
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,316
That you were different from other kids.

590
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,110
How can I put this?

591
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,405
You had this aura about you.

592
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,156
Cut to the chase.

593
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,080
After I became rich,
lots of people come looking for a handout.

594
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,959
So? What is it? What do you want?

595
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,712
Your mother said
you're looking for a husband.

596
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,800
-I'm just joking, Je-suk.
-Gosh.

597
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,386
Goodness, you wouldn't
try anything with me.

598
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,056
You were really nice to me
when we were kids.

599
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,057
And…

600
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,519
you know I had a crush on you, right?

601
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,979
Jeez.

602
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,898
That's embarrassing.

603
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,316
I always told myself

604
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,653
I would pay you back for that
if we ever meet again.

605
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,947
Let me know if I can help in any way.

606
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,080
Good.

607
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,625
Then I'll be frank with you,
although this may seem sudden.

608
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,630
Actually, our agency is a great company.

609
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,674
We have great clients and great agents.

610
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,010
But we've been in trouble

611
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,804
after our president
suddenly passed away in an accident.

612
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,016
There are many agencies
that want to buy us out,

613
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,977
but we don't want it to be just anybody.

614
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,897
We're looking for a good investor

615
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,316
who can appreciate our value.

616
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,111
An investment?

617
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,030
All of a sudden?

618
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,615
Yes.

619
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,583
Okay.

620
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,669
Aren't you getting out?

621
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,837
Yeah.

622
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,050
Right. I should go.

623
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:04,102
Je-suk, show me around the set.

624
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,438
Our agency
partially invested in this film.

625
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,774
Directed by Seo Ju-hwan.
Written by Lee Jeong-eun.

626
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,776
You know them, right?
They won awards at Cannes.

627
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,693
Are they famous?

628
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,821
I've been living abroad,
so I'm not familiar.

629
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,949
They're famous in the US too.
Anyway, the lead role is Han Ji-min.

630
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,700
Watch out for the cable.

631
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,994
The project budget is 20 billion won.

632
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,663
There are four different crews…

633
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,835
Twenty billion?

634
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,088
We have scenes abroad,
with lots of computer graphics.

635
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,257
There's Ji-min. Ji-min!

636
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,425
ACTRESS HAN JI-MIN

637
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,594
Hello.

638
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,930
-Hello.
-Hello.

639
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,392
-Han Ji-min?
-She's the script supervisor.

640
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,434
Where's Ji-min?

641
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,563
She went back to her lodging.
Her day shoot ended.

642
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,981
-She isn't coming?
-No.

643
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,774
-I see.
-I see.

644
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,359
Okay, thanks.

645
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,988
Right. I see.

646
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,575
So this is worth 20 billion won?

647
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,911
You're throwing away money.

648
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,124
Do you have to do this?

649
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,835
I need time to think.

650
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,921
I want to reflect on my marriage.

651
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,554
You have to go
to the live talk show tomorrow.

652
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,930
You know, right?

653
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:28,144
If you don't show up for that,
you'll be kicked off Love Love Musical.

654
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,314
My faith in So-hyun is shaken.

655
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,318
How can we do a talk show
as if nothing has happened?

656
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,611
Okay, in that case,

657
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,907
why don't you show up alone instead?

658
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,617
That's okay, right?

659
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,412
Are you telling me to go out
and have a good laugh?

660
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,415
Impossible.

661
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,630
Hey, Jun-ho, You can't do this to me.

662
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,715
When you lost your money in stocks,

663
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,509
didn't I let you
take an advance on your fee?

664
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,928
Man, Tae-oh.

665
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,347
You can't say that to me.

666
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,265
I got into trading because of you!

667
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,477
You had to do musicals back-to-back
to make up for that,

668
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,646
but I let the news say
it was out of goodwill.

669
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,897
Should I expose the truth?

670
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,483
Jeez.

671
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:17,944
Hey.

672
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,654
Jun-ho.

673
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,990
Just one last talk show, okay?

674
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,116
Fine.

675
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,495
I'll do that talk show. Happy?

676
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,250
Good. I'm glad you made that decision.

677
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,755
Tae-oh.

678
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,926
You have to keep it a secret.

679
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,762
She's going to kill me. Okay?

680
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,973
Don't worry about it. Don't you trust me?

681
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,141
Don't worry.

682
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,726
Goodness.

683
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,604
It rained until yesterday,
we haven't shot any outdoor scenes.

684
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,024
And now the car broke down,
so the schedule has to be pushed.

685
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,402
Man, what a mess.

686
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,488
Sets are always like this,
full of accidents and mishaps.

687
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,906
So the car broke?

688
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,992
You can use my car.

689
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,203
-What?
-It's better to use a Korean car anyway.

690
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,665
Well, may we do that?

691
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,793
-I can talk to the insurance agency…
-You can tell them and use it.

692
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,295
And why don't you

693
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,755
let her drive too?
She's an amazing driver.

694
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,133
-Right?
-No, it's too dangerous.

695
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,384
Of course not.

696
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:27,596
There is a set of moves for car scenes,
so it must be a stunt performer.

697
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,265
I'm letting you use my car,

698
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,767
so is it wrong to have my driver drive it?

699
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,437
Who cares if anybody does it?

700
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,480
It's not just for anybody.

701
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,733
This is a part of acting too.

702
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,776
And there's the problem
with insurance too.

703
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,819
I see.

704
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,155
If there's an accident,
I'll take responsibility. Use it.

705
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,657
Sunny, you'll make your film debut.

706
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,412
Hey, let's call it off.

707
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,248
Do you think filmmaking is a joke?
Damn you.

708
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,500
"Damn…"

709
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,794
-"Damn you"?
-No.

710
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,296
-What?
-Come on.

711
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,422
No, nothing.

712
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,299
-How dare you swear at me?
-Stop.

713
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,134
-You said it to me first, punk.
-No.

714
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,469
-Punk?
-Stunt Director.

715
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,220
-You swore at me first.
-Don't you point at me.

716
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,472
Stunt Director, please.

717
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,223
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, you!

718
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,433
I'm sorry.

719
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,643
Man.

720
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,688
Who the heck is that punk?
What a total psycho.

721
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,693
-Man.
-Hey, Hae-jun!

722
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,988
Hae-jun, wait! Stop!

723
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,073
Hae-jun!

724
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,451
Watch out!

725
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,332
The second time.

726
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,877
I should ask.

727
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,344
The stylist. In.

728
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,807
Oh, man.

729
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,229
Goodness, look who this is.

730
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,773
If this isn't Mr. Kang
of Number One Entertainment.

731
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,817
Is your agency in trouble?

732
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,777
What kind of sudden nonsense is this?

733
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,238
One of my rookies went to an audition,

734
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,782
and one of your actors was there
reciting lines.

735
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,867
I think her name was Kang Hee-sun.

736
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,037
I felt bad to hear
she was reciting lines all day

737
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,455
although she wasn't cast.

738
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,916
You never allow your clients to do that.

739
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:19,834
What happened?

740
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,127
Hey, I need to hang up.

741
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,974
She made me promise not to tell you.

742
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,893
I mean, even so. Look at the time.

743
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,228
I had no idea.

744
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,689
I'm sorry. I still should have called you.

745
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,942
No, it's not your fault. Where's the car?

746
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,777
Over there.

747
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,195
-Can you bring it over?
-Okay.

748
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,706
Mr. Kim.

749
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,041
Hee-sun.

750
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,672
I didn't know about this.

751
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,258
You should've told me.

752
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,595
It's all going under my belt.

753
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,556
This helped me out
much more than I expected.

754
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,851
And I could see the strengths
and weaknesses of those being auditioned.

755
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,772
I'm okay. I feel completely fine.

756
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,151
But you should've told me.

757
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,654
I'm someone who must know
everything about you.

758
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,448
After all, I'm your agent.

759
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,494
I'm sorry, Hee-sun.

760
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,122
Why?

761
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,459
I feel like
I haven't paid a lot of attention to you.

762
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,591
As an agent?

763
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,053
Sorry?

764
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,555
Mr. Kim.

765
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,515
Hey.

766
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,767
Hop in, Hee-sun.

767
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,022
Are you coming?

768
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,690
On my way.

769
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,943
The agency explained everything,

770
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,530
and most people don't believe it,
so it'll be fine.

771
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,699
If I had known,

772
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:20,246
I should have listened to you
and been honest from the start.

773
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,376
It's because I made up a lie
about visiting my parents.

774
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,837
After this incident,

775
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,632
I reflected on our relationship.

776
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,511
Everything we held back and piled up

777
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,888
blew up all at once.

778
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,559
Jun-ho says

779
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,896
he sacrificed a lot
for the sake of our family.

780
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:51,569
I thought I was the one
who sacrificed and held back more.

781
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:57,283
Why should we live together
if we must both hold back and sacrifice?

782
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,828
Because you're a family.
And you have a kid.

783
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:05,708
You each hold back for the other.
That's just life.

784
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:11,505
I made up a lie because
I didn't want him to be concerned.

785
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:17,344
Do you think I can get Jun-ho
to trust me again?

786
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,181
Of course, Jun-ho will be there
at the talk show tomorrow.

787
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,767
His anger will slowly subside too.
Don't worry about it.

788
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,595
Je-suk, come and eat!

789
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,889
Wake up already!

790
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,559
Goodness.

791
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,686
Are you all right?

792
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,785
Can you take me to the dentist later?

793
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,119
You should've stayed out,

794
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,538
why did you come back with a broken tooth?

795
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,625
Go to a big dentist's office in Seoul.

796
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,003
It's better to go
to a big and famous hospital.

797
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,130
The same goes for jobs too.

798
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:44,223
I heard your agency is about to go down
after what happened to your president.

799
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,684
It's not too late,

800
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,602
so you should take the state exam.

801
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,229
The agency isn't going down.

802
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,317
How about marrying a civil servant?

803
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,611
You don't know any, do you?

804
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,073
Should I find someone? Should I?

805
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,912
Try this one too.

806
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:07,996
Okay.

807
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,668
Goodness.

808
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,754
She's not a daughter,
but our greatest enemy.

809
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,173
You're going to Shark Entertainment?

810
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,178
So that's why
you made that ridiculous scene.

811
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,597
-You're so quick.
-Despite how you look,

812
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,599
you're the daughter of a rich farmer,

813
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,519
but contrary to my looks,
I must make a living for myself

814
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,854
and survive on my own.

815
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,983
You're going to stick around anyway.
You adore Director Ma.

816
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,990
Goodness.

817
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,867
Don't be so sad.

818
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,743
I prepared a goodbye present.

819
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,334
I left a handwritten
resignation letter for Mr. Kim.

820
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,296
I also included some killer advice on

821
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:00,340
the mess of a system this agency runs on!

822
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,383
You lunatic.

823
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,055
Shark. It's Shark Entertainment.

824
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,267
They're already looking for me.

825
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,104
Pick it up.

826
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,566
Hello? Choi Jin-hyeok speaking.

827
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,485
Hello, this is Shark Entertainment.

828
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:22,863
Yes, hello. I was going to call you.

829
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,656
I'm so sorry.

830
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,576
I thought you were the Choi Jin-hyeok
our president mentioned.

831
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,786
But I called the wrong person.

832
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,499
The Mr. Choi Jin-hyeok we were after
started work today.

833
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,334
I'm sorry, but what do you mean?

834
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:38,253
I'm so sorry about that. Goodbye.

835
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,880
Excuse me. Hello?

836
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,173
Hey. What…

837
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:47,846
What do I do?

838
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,061
-No! Oh, my gosh!
-Run!

839
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,104
Go!

840
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,692
-Eat it!
-Eat it?

841
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,320
Say hi to him.

842
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,369
Swallow it.

843
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,598
Coffee smells great. May I have some?

844
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,434
Coffee, my ass.

845
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,897
What's wrong?

846
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,483
You wanted to talk.
Isn't that why you called?

847
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,863
Change your address.
And take your stuff since you're here.

848
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,700
Otherwise,
I'll get someone to throw it all out.

849
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,746
Let's stop this, Eun-ha.

850
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,458
Stop this? Stop what?

851
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,876
I'm sorry.

852
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,921
But it was 24 years ago.
How much longer do I have to beg?

853
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:12,014
I'll be sorry for the rest of my life.

854
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,849
I really thought we were done.

855
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,309
It was just that one time.

856
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,020
And since then,
I never even looked at another woman.

857
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,271
You know that already.

858
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,862
What's this?

859
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,074
Who sent this to you?

860
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,578
An employee of my restaurant
lives in that apartment.

861
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:38,081
She said she saw you yesterday
going to another woman's house.

862
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,627
Another woman? Look, it's So-hyun.

863
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,420
So-hyun is a woman too!

864
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,258
Jun-ho and So-hyun had a fight,
so he's staying with me.

865
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,969
That's why I stopped by,
to discuss something.

866
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,390
So you went in alone
to her house without Jun-ho?

867
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,392
Well after midnight?

868
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,061
Stop that. What's with you?

869
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,729
You made me like this!

870
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,149
Eun-ha, one second.

871
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,362
Let's…

872
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,906
get a divorce.

873
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,840
LOVE LOVE MUSICAL HOST KIM SO-HYUN
ADMITS WANTING TO "ABANDON EVERYTHING"

874
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,018
Who are you?

875
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:42,938
Yes, well…

876
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,606
STAR MEDIA
PRESIDENT CHO GI-BONG

877
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,402
We've met a few times in passing.

878
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,237
I'm waiting for someone.

879
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,615
President Kim Mi-hye of Sam Musical?

880
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,283
She'll be late.

881
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,620
I asked her to set this up
because I wanted to meet you.

882
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,627
Your bag.

883
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,303
How much do you trust Director Ma?

884
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,851
What do you think you're doing?

885
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,983
Do you know that Director Ma
and Son Jun-ho are on the same team?

886
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,779
What are you talking about?

887
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,741
I'd like to order.

888
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,622
Do you know that Jun-ho keeps
some money of his own hidden from you?

889
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,586
We're about an hour into
the live talk show

890
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:50,130
celebrating the premiere
of Love Love Musical.

891
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,215
Ms. Kim So-hyun was supposed to join us,

892
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:56,219
but she became quite ill,
so I only have Mr. Son Jun-ho with me.

893
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,472
Some questions are coming in right now.

894
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,850
ID Snorlaxative sent this question.

895
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:05,270
"What's the secret to maintaining
a marriage without losing your spark?"

896
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,731
It must be

897
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:11,443
my deep generosity like the sea.

898
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,072
Is that so?

899
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:20,118
I wonder what this person will think

900
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,120
about your answer.

901
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:26,082
We have a surprise guest
at the studio right now.

902
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,127
-A surprise guest?
-Yes.

903
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,921
-Do you want to find out?
-Yes.

904
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,297
Then let's meet her.

905
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,216
Let's welcome the guest into the studio.

906
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,467
Come on out!

907
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,515
-Hello.
-Hello.

908
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,225
Yes, please take a seat.

909
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,353
-All right. Welcome.
-Hello.

910
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,938
-Did you know about this?
-What?

911
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,523
-I was quite worried.
-No.

912
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,566
I heard you were ill.

913
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,776
Are you feeling better?

914
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,611
-Yes, I'm all right.
-I see.

915
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,823
I wanted to surprise Jun-ho.

916
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,825
I'm not sure if it worked.

917
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,035
After living together for a long time,

918
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:05,372
I find that
we must tell lies like this at times.

919
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,999
She's right.

920
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,626
Marriage…

921
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,879
is a series of lies

922
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:17,634
and perpetual surprises.

923
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:23,139
Love Love Musical will
premiere tomorrow at 9 p.m.

924
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,809
Let's watch the highlights together.

925
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,606
You lying crook.

926
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,149
Who? Me?

927
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,277
-Yes.
-That should be my line.

928
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,988
Shut up.
You lost all your money in trading.

929
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,700
And you got an advance on your pay?

930
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:44,703
Why? Why didn't you
just take out a private loan?

931
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:45,912
Right.

932
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:50,959
That's why you did
five musicals in a row last year.

933
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,460
-No, I--
-Be honest.

934
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,129
How much did you lose?

935
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,964
-It's…
-How much?

936
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,135
Hey!

937
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,680
Excuse me, the clip is about to end.

938
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,392
I'm sorry.

939
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,979
I didn't know it would plummet.

940
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,440
It was supposed to go up for sure.

941
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,150
-I just--
-I can't believe it.

942
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,403
I told you time and time again
not to get into that.

943
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:23,033
Wait, where did you
get the money for that?

944
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,620
I know where all the money comes from.

945
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,083
What?

946
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,504
We're back in ten seconds. Okay.

947
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,884
It was all for you.

948
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,010
What?

949
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,678
You lost money because of me?

950
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,516
I did it to see you smile.

951
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,559
What?

952
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,942
Last year,
on our tenth wedding anniversary,

953
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,612
you couldn't take a break from work.

954
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,114
That's why

955
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,911
I wanted to send you on a vacation
to the US for a few months.

956
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,540
I knew you wouldn't want it.

957
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,669
I'm certain you'd have said
you didn't need the rest.

958
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:19,673
That's why I wanted
to prepare it in secret and let you go.

959
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,092
You've worked tirelessly.

960
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,887
So I wanted to let you rest.

961
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,017
I never had a chance

962
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,812
to do anything good for you.

963
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,691
What do you mean?

964
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:42,112
I'm here today because you're with me.

965
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,365
I could hold out until this day

966
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,493
thanks to your support.

967
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:56,418
Looking at the highlight clip
already got me excited for the show.

968
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,253
So-hyun, when you evaluate,

969
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,255
do you have anything you look for?

970
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,508
Excuse me, So-hyun?

971
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,759
So-hyun?

972
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,679
-Yes.
-Yes, right.

973
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,347
Of course,

974
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:13,268
one's skills and techniques are important.

975
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:18,732
But above all, it's important
to be considerate of one another.

976
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,651
And…

977
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:24,279
Love.

978
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:32,579
Love that embraces each other's mistakes

979
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,041
or even faults.

980
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,800
How much you are in love
when you're on the stage.

981
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,345
That's what we'll look for.

982
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,558
Yes, he's right.

983
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,852
When you sing a duet,

984
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,148
it's most important
to listen to one another.

985
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,069
So I'll keep my eyes out to see

986
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,322
how considerate you are of one another.

987
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:21,878
Goodness, this is so lovely.
It's great to see you two together.

988
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:25,799
Love Love Musical premieres tomorrow.

989
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,008
Are you all excited?

990
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,719
Please tune in tomorrow!

991
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,498
Mr. Kim.

992
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,209
Yes?

993
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,672
I like you.

994
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:15,682
Hee-sun.

995
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,225
I like you, Mr. Kim.

996
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,272
You already know that, Mr. Kim.

997
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,736
I'm not asking you for anything,
so don't be pressured.

998
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,616
-Hello.
-Hello.

999
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,471
LOVE LOVE MUSICAL
IS OFF TO A GOOD START

1000
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,098
HOSTED BY KIM SO-HYUN AND SON JUN-HO,
LOVE LOVE MUSICAL IS A HIT…

1001
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,355
-Tae-oh.
-Hey.

1002
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,523
Hello.

1003
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,528
It's been a while
since the three of us met.

1004
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:11,529
You're right.

1005
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,490
You two look great.

1006
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,203
Let's order. Here's the menu.

1007
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,503
What? Do you have something to say?

1008
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,463
Wait.

1009
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,340
You aren't in another fight, are you?

1010
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,008
No, that's not it.

1011
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,594
We had a talk.

1012
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,264
Here's our thought.

1013
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,893
For a relationship to last long,

1014
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,811
trust is essential.

1015
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,856
Yes, of course.

1016
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,568
As you know, we went through
a big incident recently.

1017
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,696
That's why we want to bring some change.

1018
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,661
-So I'm saying--
-We're moving agencies.

1019
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,958
You and Jun-ho worked together to fool me,

1020
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,293
but it's all in the past,

1021
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,838
and he's reflecting on himself,
so I won't bring that up.

1022
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,131
However,

1023
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,800
someone must be responsible.

1024
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,845
-What do you mean?
-She found out.

1025
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,722
About the trading
and the advance payments.

1026
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,351
-So-hyun, that's…
-Yes.

1027
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,853
He was trying to help me out.

1028
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:30,608
But you were the one
that told me to buy that stock.

1029
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:33,361
I didn't care about stock trading before.

1030
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,737
-Right?
-Jun-ho.

1031
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:39,075
Jun-ho and I want a fresh start
through this incident,

1032
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,995
without any lies, in honesty.

1033
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,915
Let me leave you with this just in case.

1034
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:49,460
Don't try to hold us back
with the period left in our contract.

1035
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,380
You know what you've done.

1036
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,092
I mean,

1037
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,595
you can't suddenly switch agencies…

1038
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:08,104
You aren't looking
for another agency, are you?

1039
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,147
I am.

1040
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,232
Star Media.

1041
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,526
I've already talked with their president.

1042
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:16,279
And he's giving us a hefty advance.

1043
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:19,157
-All we need to do is sign and relax.
-Come on.

1044
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,454
-Tae-oh, I'll be in touch.
-Goodbye, then.

1045
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,192
Hey.

1046
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,664
Are you ill? You don't look well.

1047
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,041
No, I'm okay.

1048
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,764
Hello, Ms. Chun Jane. Director Ma.

1049
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,058
I've been waiting for you.

1050
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,060
Hello.

1051
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,480
Ms. Chun.

1052
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:36,401
Thank you for introducing our agency
to President Koo Hae-jun.

1053
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:40,655
Thanks to you, we finally found
a savior for Method Entertainment.

1054
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:41,781
Yes.

1055
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,326
Well, we've made introductions
to almost everyone.

1056
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,663
The de facto leader
of Method Entertainment.

1057
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,164
Please meet Director Ma Tae-oh.

1058
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,709
He'll be of great help from now on.

1059
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:58,005
Nice to meet you. My name is Koo Hae-jun.

1060
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,550
Director Ma?

1061
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:06,055
Mr. Koo Hae-jun is
the new president of Method Entertainment.

1062
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,018
What's wrong with him?

1063
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,989
-Director Ma!
-Oh, my!

1064
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,491
BEHIND EVERY STAR

1065
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,351
Kim Ji-hoon.
Let's poach him from Star Media.

1066
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,604
Ten million won to the person
making the biggest contribution.

1067
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:58,191
Not even Star Media could do it,
what are you going to do about it?

1068
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,693
Kim Ji-hoon had no idea.

1069
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,320
What if we don't tell them directly?

1070
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:05,114
I realized clearly that there's
something more important than money.

1071
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,658
-Don't mess it up by making it personal.
-Gosh.

1072
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,452
But not her.

1073
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:10,495
What are you talking about?

1074
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,289
-Can we just talk casually?
-I guess when it's just the two of us.

1075
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:16,501
I'm not sure why I should keep you here.

1076
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,252
What happened was just ludicrous.

1077
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,463
Don't even think of stealing our actors.
Pack your stuff.

1078
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,381
