1
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,952
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,079
To some,

3
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:42,375
it might seem like agents are
parasites on stars, leeching off of them.

4
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,379
If celebrities are crocodiles,
their agents are crocodile birds.

5
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,256
EPISODE 6

6
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:52,719
But in reality,
agents are more like crocodile trainers.

7
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,346
They feed the crocodiles
when they're hungry

8
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,973
and treat them when they're sick.

9
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,016
But most importantly,

10
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:01,186
their job is to prepare an environment

11
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:04,230
where the crocodiles
can show off their talents.

12
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,315
For example…

13
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,069
Let's team up a newbie with a veteran

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,363
to revive the theater--

15
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,366
I see that Kim Soo-ro isn't the director.

16
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,203
He's directed many plays, hasn't he?

17
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,663
Would you like to go outside
and watch them rehearse?

18
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,291
I mean, what's with you?

19
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,420
It just feels a little awkward.

20
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,466
Director Kim,
let's leave out the pool scene.

21
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,092
I'm the director here, Soo-ro.

22
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,179
-You have to go in.
-Don Juan is an eloquent speaker.

23
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,847
All he needs to do is talk.

24
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,349
Why would he go into the water?

25
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,936
How many times do I have to tell you
this is a modern interpretation?

26
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,065
Gosh, can I have a word with you?

27
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,108
We can talk here.

28
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,985
If you have something to say, say it.

29
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,906
I really didn't want to say this,

30
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,408
but how many times
have you even read Don Juan?

31
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,370
This misses the whole point.
It has nothing to do with Don Juan.

32
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,331
And what about the stage?
It's not even an actual theater.

33
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,459
With some half-naked actors in a pool…

34
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,794
You call this proper theater?

35
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,671
I can't do this. Get rid of the pool!

36
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,007
Let's get rid of you instead of the pool!

37
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,426
I'll have you kicked out
before that ever happens!

38
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,514
What do you even know about directing?
You're so full of yourself!

39
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,517
I was on the stage while
you were still sucking on freeze pops!

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,602
We didn't have freeze pops in my days!

41
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,988
Do you have kimchi?

42
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,616
Should I send you some?

43
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,410
No need.

44
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,412
Mom, you know what?

45
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,914
They don't put jeotgal
in their kimchi in Seoul.

46
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,333
At first, I thought
the kimchi here tasted bland,

47
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,501
but I'm used to it now.

48
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,420
You little brat.

49
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,088
You sound like a proper Seoulite.

50
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,256
I guess so.

51
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,886
Who is it at this hour?

52
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,887
No idea.

53
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,138
Package delivery, maybe?

54
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,349
Check who it is before you open the door.

55
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,227
Who is it?

56
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,729
It's Song Eun-ha,

57
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,981
Director Ma Tae-oh's wife.

58
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,316
Who did they say it was?

59
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,859
Hey! So Hyun-joo, you--

60
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,985
CALL ENDED

61
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,162
So…

62
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,665
you moved here just like that?

63
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,044
Because you wanted to be an agent?

64
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:34,964
Yes.

65
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,721
Does your mom know?

66
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:43,890
No.

67
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,226
She doesn't know a thing.

68
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,605
Did my husband…

69
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,400
I mean, Director Ma,

70
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,152
see you grow up?

71
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,363
We met once a year.

72
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,325
When he was in Busan
for the film festival.

73
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,663
But I rarely met him
after I started high school.

74
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,629
Did you not know

75
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,839
about me and Eun-gyul?

76
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,968
I didn't when I was a kid,

77
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,471
but my mom told me
in my second year of high school.

78
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,068
About what?

80
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,029
About…

81
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,367
everything.

82
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,588
Didn't you say you were
the same age as Eun-gyul?

83
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,715
Yes.

84
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,969
When is your birthday?

85
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,472
It was last week.

86
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,849
The 23rd.

87
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,060
Get out!

88
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,146
-Why, all of a sudden?
-"All of a sudden"?

89
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,232
Did you give me a heads-up
before cheating on me?

90
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,359
Get out right now!

91
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,652
Where would I go at this hour?

92
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,195
You cheated on me

93
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,905
while I was pregnant with Eun-gyul!

94
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,575
Get out.

95
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,619
I didn't know you were pregnant back then!

96
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,830
And technically, we had broken up.

97
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,999
Fine, I get it.

98
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,459
I'll leave.

99
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,169
I'm going.

100
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,435
Eun-gyul.

101
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,395
Are you just getting home?

102
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,233
How much did you drink?

103
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,651
Do you know what time it is?

104
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,239
Are you scolding me?
What gives you the right?

105
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,745
I'm just worried about your mom.

106
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,246
Don't stay out too late.

107
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,664
And keep an eye on your mom.

108
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,334
Are you going to her family?

109
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,922
Hey, watch it.

110
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,799
I don't care. Do whatever you want.

111
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,223
You can't back out now.
The show is just around the corner.

112
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,852
Then get rid of the pool scene.
It wasn't even in the original script.

113
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,397
And he switched to that ridiculous venue
without saying a word to me.

114
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,568
There's something else to it, isn't there?

115
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,696
My goodness.

116
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,240
You never go against the director
without good reason.

117
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,366
So tell me.

118
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,830
I can't fix it
unless I know what the problem is.

119
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,208
What is it?

120
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,044
I can't…

121
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,423
What? Speak clearly.

122
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,011
-You probably won't believe this, but…
-I probably won't, but?

123
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,640
I can't.

124
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,642
Can't what?

125
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,271
I can't go into the water.

126
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,315
I have aquaphobia.

127
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,779
Gosh, then you should've said so.

128
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,072
No way.

129
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,784
You know I once went on a talk show
and gave a lecture, right?

130
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,078
Don't you remember what I said there?

131
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,123
When an actor performs,

132
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:24,086
they must forget all
of their fears and insecurities.

133
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,798
Overcoming their limits

134
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,010
is what an actor does!

135
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,011
That's what I said.

136
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,722
So how can I say
I can't go into the water?

137
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,724
-I can't.
-Still…

138
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,518
Whatever.

139
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,853
You can't tell anyone about this.

140
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,980
You have to keep it a secret.

141
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,235
And please work things out for me.

142
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,402
I beg you.

143
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,446
You got this.

144
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,073
I'll be going. Thanks.

145
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,783
-Soo-ro…
-Good luck. Problem solved.

146
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,244
Let's grab some Korean beef soon.

147
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,247
Two, three…

148
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,732
Something good must be going on with you.

149
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,611
Something good
is going on with you, Hee-sun.

150
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,781
You know Director Jang Sin-ae, right?

151
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,158
Of course.
She's the hottest director these days.

152
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,619
And you'll be given a chance

153
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,289
to audition for her next project.

154
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,541
That's awesome! What's the role?

155
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,335
It's a girl who's lived abroad.

156
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,963
-That's me.
-She has many foreign friends.

157
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,214
So do I.

158
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,799
She's full of soul.

159
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,759
-That's me!
-She loves hip-hop.

160
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,720
-She's a street dancer.
-That's…

161
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,682
Hip-hop?

162
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,767
Dancer?

163
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,394
Since you give out dancer vibes,

164
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,439
the role will definitely be yours.

165
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,149
Yours.

166
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,819
When's the audition?

167
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,576
That's new.

168
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,787
That's extremely hard to come by.
It's a new limited-edition Prada.

169
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,039
Darn it.

170
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,749
What I mean is,

171
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,877
I don't understand
why he brought that huge bag to work

172
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,754
when he's not going on a business trip.

173
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,880
I see.

174
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,091
-Do you think there's money inside?
-Money?

175
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,469
-Director Ma said he'd buy the company.
-Right.

176
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:41,265
Maybe he brought the money
his father-in-law gave him

177
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,767
in that bag.

178
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,394
Who buys a company with cash?

179
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,481
-Maybe he's trying to launder the money.
-What?

180
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,524
Maybe it's from shady sources.

181
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,817
No way.

182
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,527
-I can't stand it.
-What?

183
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,196
Where are you going? What is it?

184
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,200
What are you doing?

185
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,451
Underwear?

186
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,661
-Underwear!
-What's going on--

187
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,248
Come out. Director Ma is coming.

188
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,416
What do I do with this?

189
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,517
Why did you want to see me?

190
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,354
I must say, I love the new stage.
People will go mad when they see it.

191
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,232
Come on. You're exaggerating.

192
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,736
But about that scene
where Don Juan goes into the pool…

193
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,657
There might be line delivery issues
if he goes into the water,

194
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,953
so maybe he should say his lines
outside the water, facing the pool.

195
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,624
Did Soo-ro ask you to say that to me?

196
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,626
No, it was my idea.

197
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,505
That stubborn old goat.

198
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,091
He never stops babbling
about the classics all the time.

199
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,220
That's why the crew
calls him old-fashioned.

200
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:02,888
Forget it.

201
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,975
If he keeps insisting,

202
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,351
I'll have to switch him out.

203
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,728
What will people say

204
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,815
if they find out Kim Soo-ro dropped out
a week before the premiere?

205
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,821
Is that a threat?

206
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,573
This project is important to you.

207
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,658
It can get your name out there
as a director.

208
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,496
I think you two should
meet each other halfway

209
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,833
so that this project can be
a win-win for everyone.

210
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,127
Ms. Yoo, can I get an envelope?

211
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,295
Sure.

212
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,671
No, I don't have any.

213
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,798
You always keep some in your drawer.

214
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,633
We're all out at the moment.

215
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,885
Completely.

216
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,387
-Really?
-Yes.

217
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,682
I'll bring one to you.

218
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,643
-All right.
-Okay.

219
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,709
-Will you be taking those home?
-Shut up.

220
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,521
-Hey.
-Here.

221
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,444
Why do you have these?

222
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,196
You must have dropped them.

223
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,615
I picked them up in the hallway
and kept them.

224
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,910
Okay, thanks.

225
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:49,912
All right.

226
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,011
Did you leave home?

227
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,764
I didn't, so don't worry.

228
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,599
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

229
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,519
Forget it.

230
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,020
What happened, happened.

231
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,188
It's okay.

232
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,734
I'm looking for another job.

233
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,695
I'll leave as soon as I can.

234
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,535
Hey…

235
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,356
Like this.

236
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,570
FROM THE FREEZE, PUSH OFF YOUR LEGS

237
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,538
You're working so hard.

238
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,833
Are you preparing for your audition?

239
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,918
Yes.

240
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,085
I see.

241
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,089
I guess the role is a zombie.

242
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,508
But I thought zombies were…

243
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,428
more like this.

244
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,521
This is why I brought you here.

245
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,108
You are my youth, love,

246
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,944
-past, and--
-Try again.

247
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,030
I don't feel any emotion.

248
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,662
You are my youth, love,

249
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,622
-past--
-Stand closer to the water.

250
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,461
You're faced with your past and future
in your subconscious.

251
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:06,674
You're so far away from the water,
so the scene doesn't feel alive.

252
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,807
-Is this close enough?
-No. A little closer.

253
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,103
Soo-ro, you need to come closer.

254
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,443
You're my youth, love--

255
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,365
See? You see what I mean?

256
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,283
The lines feel hollow.

257
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,578
They don't mean anything
unless he says them while drenched.

258
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,248
Then cast a professional swimmer instead.

259
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,000
This isn't the Olympics.

260
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,170
That punk's obsession
is making everyone miserable.

261
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,173
What did you just say?

262
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,300
"Punk"?

263
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,511
Did you just call me a punk?

264
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,263
Yes, I did, you little punk.

265
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,556
How dare you glare at me?

266
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,851
Back in the day,
you wouldn't dare look me in the eyes.

267
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,061
My goodness.

268
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,605
Ladies, you can come out.
You're shivering--

269
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,982
Stay right there!

270
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,650
Enough is enough!

271
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,112
Can't you see them shivering
with their lips all blue?

272
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,033
-Let's take a break.
-What are you talking about?

273
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,620
Soo-ro, are you okay?

274
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,706
Soo-ro!

275
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,499
Get him out of the water! Now!

276
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,959
Soo-ro!

277
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,378
-Are you okay?
-Hurry!

278
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,214
Soo-ro! Come on up.

279
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,924
Careful.

280
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,346
Are you okay, Soo-ro?

281
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,140
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,349
Are you all right?

283
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,728
Why you little…

284
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,563
I'll teach you a lesson, you punk!

285
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,110
Sir, please calm down. Who hit who first?

286
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,614
Both the actor and the director
are claiming they got hit first!

287
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,408
They both stormed out
and I can't reach either of them!

288
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,120
You talked me into getting them on board,
so you sort this out.

289
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,582
If this play fails, I'll sue all of you!

290
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,378
Damn it.

291
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,340
That play…

292
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,927
Must both of them have to take part in it?

293
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,804
What?

294
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,973
Director Ma once said

295
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,560
the company doesn't benefit much
from the actors starring in plays

296
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,481
because they get paid too little
compared to the effort we put in.

297
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,607
So…

298
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:33,779
if the two of them
can't seem to get along,

299
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,324
maybe one of them should drop out

300
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,701
for the company's sake.

301
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,080
It's just my humble opinion.

302
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,084
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:52,005
If that happens after all that media hype,
do you think the reporters will sit back?

304
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,927
Agents should always put
their clients before the company.

305
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,180
Take what Director Ma says
with a grain of salt.

306
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,141
He puts money before his clients.

307
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,690
Wait.

308
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,483
Give this to Eun-gyul.

309
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,429
I'm sorry I'm late.

310
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,347
I had to make up an excuse to step out.

311
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,266
It's okay.

312
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,852
We're meeting here because of me anyway.

313
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,978
I know.

314
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,857
But that's also because of me.

315
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:53,859
Sorry.

316
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,073
My dad is the one who should be sorry.

317
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,416
Did you say you had no other siblings?

318
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,128
I don't.

319
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,256
That makes us each other's only siblings.

320
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,594
It's weird to have a sister
all of a sudden.

321
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,724
I think it'll take some time
to accept it and get used to it.

322
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,935
For both me and my mom.

323
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,438
You understand, right?

324
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,942
Yes.

325
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,697
It definitely seems like he's home.

326
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,660
-Hi, Won-jae.
-Hi.

327
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,497
-Are you sure he's home?
-Yes.

328
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,416
I just saw someone
deliver jjajangmyeon to his house.

329
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,797
Hello?

330
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,715
Soo-ro?

331
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,676
Your call could not…

332
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,136
Gosh, I told him
to install a doorbell many times.

333
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,725
Stand there.

334
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,560
-Are you going over?
-Yes. Stand there.

335
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,523
Brace your legs. Okay.

336
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,401
Here I go.

337
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,885
It's so hot.

338
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,017
Soo-ro!

339
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,351
What do I do?

340
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,021
Soo-ro!

341
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,816
Get inside your house!

342
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,609
Now!

343
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,112
House! Gosh.

344
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,989
-Goodness gracious.
-Oh, my.

345
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,742
Why would you jump over the wall?

346
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,744
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

347
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,788
You've got yourself a great guard.

348
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,544
It's just…

349
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,880
I should at least pretend
to make an effort.

350
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,214
Good for you.

351
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,218
I knew you wouldn't keep
acting so unreasonably.

352
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,679
This play is a lost cause,

353
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,599
but something similar could happen again.

354
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,017
"A lost cause"?

355
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,022
Did you think I'd keep working
with that jerk Ho-young?

356
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,816
Let's see what happens
to the play without me.

357
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,318
That arrogant punk.

358
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,362
How can he not even apologize
after pushing me into the water?

359
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,615
I was just with him.

360
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,744
He's kicking himself
for the way he treated you.

361
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,913
-As if.
-It's true.

362
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,499
I barely stopped him
from tagging along here.

363
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,085
"Soo-ro doesn't feel like seeing you."

364
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,795
"Go see him once he feels better."

365
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,631
Then how come he hasn't even called me?

366
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,510
I told him not to call, okay?

367
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:10,055
I told him to apologize to you in person
when you're in a better mood.

368
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,140
Apologizing over the phone?

369
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,853
What kind of rude and disrespectful
behavior is that to a senior actor?

370
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,232
You little brat.

371
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,445
It's not going so well.

372
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,536
Great work.

373
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,412
Hi, Ho-young.

374
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,164
Are you free tonight?

375
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,128
This isn't about Soo-ro.
I just want to grab a drink with you.

376
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,297
Yes, I know that place.

377
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,384
Okay. See you in a bit.

378
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,721
You know Ho-young's favorite bar?

379
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,931
Yes, I do.

380
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,182
Let's go there.

381
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,976
Looking like this?

382
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,819
-Let's go.
-Okay.

383
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,658
Can you make it on time?

384
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,118
Of course.

385
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,036
I'll be back by 10:30 p.m.,
so wait for me.

386
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,913
Won't you be too tired?

387
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,583
Going to the movies after a meeting?

388
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,128
How about next time?

389
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,213
No, that movie stops showing this week.

390
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,048
And it has to be seen in a theater.

391
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,217
I'm just worried you'll be--

392
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,555
Done.

393
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,608
Don't you think
you're too dressed up for a meeting?

394
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,194
I'm going on a date afterward.

395
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,112
With who?

396
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,785
I'm sorry I can't have dinner with you.

397
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,165
If you're sorry, come home early.

398
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,291
Okay.

399
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,377
I'm not being unreasonable here.

400
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,588
Going into the pool
is the crux of the play.

401
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,132
So how can I take that scene out?

402
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,759
Right, you shouldn't.

403
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,555
Soo-ro says he's sorry.

404
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,724
He's going to try his best
for the pool scene.

405
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,019
Come on, I know what kind of person he is.

406
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,230
He's too stubborn to have said that.

407
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,564
It's true.

408
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:28,485
He even got himself
a pool this deep in his yard to practice.

409
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,571
You should apologize to him too.

410
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,116
Forget it.

411
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,744
Why should I apologize
when I didn't do anything wrong?

412
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,829
Stop talking about him.

413
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,164
It's stressing me out.

414
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:57,681
I'm having a birthday party
at a friend's bar tomorrow.

415
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,683
It'll just be a casual get-together.

416
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,269
You're invited.

417
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,398
I do hope you can make it.

418
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,611
There's such a charming air about you.

419
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,114
That must be why everyone likes you.

420
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,574
What about you?

421
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,492
Me?

422
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,202
I like you too.

423
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,329
Come on.

424
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,915
As a friend? Or…

425
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,334
as a man?

426
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,841
I realized many things
while watching you direct.

427
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,219
That there's always more to people
than meets the eye.

428
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:41,141
That there are still many sides of you
that I don't know about.

429
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,353
For example?

430
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,940
For example…

431
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,943
-Oh, no!
-That's cold!

432
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,862
-My bad. Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

433
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,822
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

434
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,407
I'm sorry.

435
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,410
I'm sorry.

436
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,454
Ho-young.

437
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,212
"Kim Soo-ro."

438
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,922
Here he is.

439
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:18,428
"I'd like to apologize to you in person."

440
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,471
Send.

441
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,807
PLEASE COME TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY TOMORROW.
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU IN PERSON.

442
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,852
Delete message.

443
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,318
I'm sorry.
The meeting took longer than expected.

444
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,572
Are you very upset?

445
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,161
You didn't even have time to send a text?

446
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,372
I was too focused on the meeting.

447
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,915
Did you even go home last night?

448
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,625
Of course.

449
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,960
Past 3 a.m.?

450
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,006
Is that how long you waited?

451
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,260
I left after you got home.
I guess you were too drunk to remember.

452
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,017
I understand you didn't have a choice.

453
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,354
Next time, let me know so I don't worry.

454
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,148
Okay. I will.

455
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,781
You drank a lot last night.

456
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,659
I can cancel our plans tonight
if you want.

457
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,708
With my friends, remember?

458
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,128
That's tonight.

459
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,212
I'm aware.

460
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,844
If you're busy due to work,

461
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,220
-we can find another--
-No.

462
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,681
We can't postpone plans like that.

463
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,182
It's suffocating.

464
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,854
Why do I have to tell him
everything going on with me?

465
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,897
I feel suffocated.

466
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,068
Well, it must be the first time
that's happened to you.

467
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,947
The old you would've
broken up with him right there.

468
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:05,452
Gosh. You must like him a lot.

469
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,578
You think so?

470
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,623
He says he understands,
but I don't think he means it.

471
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,084
I don't feel understood at all.

472
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,045
You're the one who should try
to understand your boyfriend.

473
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,756
You stand him up all the time,

474
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,841
you leave for work while eating,

475
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,218
and your eyes are glued
to your phone all day.

476
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,765
If he's putting up with all that,
he must really like you.

477
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,727
Why are you defending him?

478
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,814
Don't break up
until the investigation is over.

479
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,940
Why you…

480
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,027
I won't. Do you know how much I like him?

481
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,445
I really like him.

482
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,280
Seriously?

483
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,448
Jeez.

484
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,666
AUDITION LOCATION

485
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,099
Ms. Kang Hee-sun?

486
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,645
-Is Ms. Kang Hee-sun here?
-Yes, I'm here!

487
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,355
-Please come in.
-Okay.

488
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,066
I can do this.

489
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,655
Hello, I'm Kang Hee-sun
from Method Entertainment.

490
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,742
I see. Ms. Kang Hee-sun?

491
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,665
She's the one
Mr. Kim Jung-don talked about.

492
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,584
We're a little behind schedule.

493
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,045
Let's see you dance first and then act.

494
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:04,028
"You don't mean any of the words you sing
for those 16 lines."

495
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,113
"This is…"

496
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,702
I'm sorry, but please don't say any lines.
I just want to see you dance.

497
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:15,206
I thought you should see me act first.

498
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,499
No.

499
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,209
Let's see you dance.

500
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,752
Okay.

501
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,558
What's she doing?

502
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:45,570
"You don't mean any of the words you sing
for those 16 lines."

503
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,822
-"This is just garbage!"
-Hold on.

504
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,578
I'm sorry. I'll call you back--

505
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,871
Hello?

506
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,501
I jumped through hoops
to get you this audition…

507
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,046
Why did you do that?

508
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,049
Explain why you did that.

509
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,386
I can't dance. I have two left feet.

510
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,306
Then you should've said so.

511
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,059
Were you going to star in a hip-hop movie
without dancing?

512
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,395
You got me the audition
without asking my opinion.

513
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,065
You assumed I'd be soulful
just because I lived abroad…

514
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,401
I wanted to be cast with my acting,

515
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,404
then practice my dancing afterward.

516
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,572
Your acting?

517
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,075
You mean throwing your bag
at the director?

518
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,244
The director owes me a favor,

519
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,082
so I begged her to cast you
even though you're a rookie,

520
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,793
and you would've passed
just by doing the bare minimum.

521
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,629
Then I wouldn't have earned it.

522
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,006
Stop being so naive.

523
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,258
You can't win by playing fair here.

524
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,886
You're the one
who doesn't trust my performance.

525
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,472
Then why did you ask me to sign with you?

526
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,641
No way.

527
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,185
Do you have feelings for me?

528
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,311
What?

529
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,939
Never!

530
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,650
That's not true, I swear!

531
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:10,780
What's the point of getting me auditions
when you don't even know what I'm good at?

532
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,533
I don't need an agent like you!

533
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,751
Jeez.

534
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,920
She's over there.

535
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,131
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

536
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,472
Hello.

537
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,816
What do you think you're doing?

538
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,407
I'm sorry.

539
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,491
Forgive me this once.

540
00:33:56,325 --> 00:34:00,288
If I had done the same,
would you be able to forgive me?

541
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,210
-Will you excuse us for a second?
-Sure.

542
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,639
-Go ahead.
-I kept it from you

543
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,142
because I love you.
Because I didn't want to lose you.

544
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,563
Why are you so desperate?

545
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,524
Because of the company?

546
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,318
It doesn't have to do with that.

547
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,532
Don't worry.

548
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,077
I haven't told Father yet.

549
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,252
I'm going to tell him today.

550
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,922
-Honey, please--
-Get your hands off me.

551
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,759
-Ju-yeong?
-Yes?

552
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,680
Let me start again.

553
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,225
I'm not going.

554
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,687
Why are you being like this?
I already told Ho-young you were coming.

555
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,065
If you back out now,
how would that make him feel?

556
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,983
Who is he to tell me to come and go?

557
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,861
I don't even know if I'd see him
if he came over.

558
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,613
He's using his party as an excuse

559
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,574
because it'd be awkward
to meet with you alone.

560
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,952
How can we possibly talk at a party?

561
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,496
There will be a ton of people.

562
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,623
It's not that kind of party.

563
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,376
He's just having a few friends over.

564
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,547
Ho-young will be
looking forward to seeing you.

565
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,716
Okay. Fine.

566
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,386
I'll pick you up at 6 p.m.

567
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,767
Sang-uk, I'm really sorry,

568
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,437
but something came up,
so I might run a little late.

569
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,024
I have to drive Kim Soo-ro
to an important dinner.

570
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,194
Everyone involved in the play
will be there.

571
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,488
No, don't cancel it.

572
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,241
I'm only dropping by the party.

573
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:06,873
Of course, I wouldn't meet your friends
without looking my best.

574
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,209
Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.

575
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,275
This is ridiculous.

576
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,279
What a way to waste your money and life.

577
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,655
Do you call this casual?

578
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,116
It is, considering Ho-young's character.

579
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,243
Forget it. I'm out of here.
I can't stay here.

580
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,037
Come on. Look, Ho-young's over there.

581
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,666
See? He's rushing over to greet you.

582
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,877
Did you bring a present?

583
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:59,091
Seriously, what would you do without me?

584
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,804
-Ho-young!
-Hey, you made it.

585
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,727
-Hi.
-You must have spent quite--

586
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,062
Happy birthday.

587
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,398
I brought Soo-ro with me like you asked.

588
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,983
Well, Soo-ro.

589
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,526
You said you brought a present.

590
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,445
What? Right.

591
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,323
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

592
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,116
What is it?

593
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,368
GENIUS DIRECTOR KIM HO-YOUNG

594
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,369
"Genius director"?

595
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,625
-Thank you.
-Sure.

596
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,085
That's so hip.

597
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,964
How thoughtful of you, Soo-ro.

598
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,424
So…

599
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:47,890
Ho-young!

600
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,392
-Hey, you came.
-Happy birthday.

601
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,518
Why are you so late?

602
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,228
-I've been waiting.
-Happy birthday.

603
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,646
Seriously.

604
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,651
That rude brat.

605
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,945
After buttering me up
to make me come here,

606
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,822
how can he blow me off like this?

607
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,533
He doesn't deserve a present.

608
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,910
He's just busy greeting his guests.

609
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,037
Let's grab a drink over there.

610
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,455
I'll bring him in a bit.

611
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,000
Drink with the genius director instead.

612
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,251
-I'm leaving.
-Soo-ro.

613
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,086
Excuse me. Aren't you Kim Soo-ro?

614
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,421
Yes, that's me.

615
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,424
-Can I get a photo with you?
-Of course, you can.

616
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,759
-Thank you.
-Sure.

617
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,553
It's my pleasure.

618
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,471
All right.

619
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,640
You're all gorgeous.

620
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,434
One, two, three.

621
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,815
You were excited about working with him.

622
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,109
That was before he beat me up.

623
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,068
Hey.

624
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,364
He lost his grip on you, and you slipped.
I looked into it.

625
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,492
Whatever.

626
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,078
My pride was still hurt,
and it's beyond recovery.

627
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,206
I may have debuted later than him,

628
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,460
but I'm the director of this play.

629
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,129
But he still calls me a punk all the time.

630
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,090
He doesn't respect me as a director.

631
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,134
So why should I keep working with him?

632
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,389
It's not that he doesn't respect you.

633
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,808
Then what's the matter?

634
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,894
What's so bad about going into the water?

635
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,731
He has his reasons.

636
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,191
So what are they?

637
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,284
I'm going to kill you if you tell anyone.

638
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,494
I won't.

639
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,541
He can't go into the water.

640
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,919
What?

641
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,298
He can't go into the water
because he's scared!

642
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,353
-Soo-ro.
-Soo-ro!

643
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,479
Wait!

644
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,152
Are you serious about this?

645
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,279
Pack up and leave right now.

646
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,657
I don't even want to talk to you anymore.

647
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,700
Fine.

648
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,370
It's all my fault.

649
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,706
You can take custody.

650
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,750
What are you crying for?

651
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,338
I want to work things out with you.
Please forgive me this one time.

652
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,714
Let go!

653
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,258
HYUN-JOO

654
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,260
Please trust me just one more time.

655
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,804
It's already over between us.

656
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,890
-Didn't you expect this when you lied?
-What's the matter?

657
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,392
Have you had dinner yet?

658
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,603
-I didn't want to hurt you.
-Do you hear yourself?

659
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,772
-You made a fool out of me.
-No, I haven't.

660
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,034
You don't have an appetite?

661
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,790
-I'm not that hungry.
-It must not be to your taste.

662
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,710
I wanted to buy you something good.

663
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,088
No, it was good. I enjoyed it.

664
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,304
Are you sleeping okay?

665
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:18,476
I barely slept
when I first moved to Seoul.

666
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,561
I was scared,

667
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,647
and there was a noisy barbecue restaurant
on the first floor.

668
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:28,777
But after a while,
I grew to dislike silence more.

669
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,699
When it's too quiet,
you fall asleep better with the TV on.

670
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:37,244
Especially the baduk channel.
They make that sound…

671
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,837
It's like an ASMR video made just for me.

672
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,222
What is it?

673
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,307
Nothing.

674
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,729
You should stay with the company.

675
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,566
What?

676
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,528
Don't mind me and stay.

677
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,697
Ms. Chun seems to like you too.

678
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,294
Tell me if you need anything.

679
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,630
I will. Get home safe.

680
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,590
Okay. Good night.

681
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,677
Hyun-joo.

682
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,012
Yes?

683
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,644
Thanks.

684
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,745
When I was little,

685
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,916
I went to a swimming pool with my friends.

686
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,378
And one of them dared me
to hold my breath longer than him

687
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,380
at the bottom of the pool.

688
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:16,594
But then my swim trunks
got caught in the pump,

689
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,888
and I started getting sucked in.

690
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,350
I thought I was going to die.

691
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,185
Luckily,

692
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,480
the lifeguard saved me in time.

693
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,275
So that's what happened.

694
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,194
Since that day,

695
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,157
I can't stop thinking I might die

696
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,284
every time I go into water.

697
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,453
I'm sorry.

698
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,495
I had no idea.

699
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:47,416
Don't apologize.
I should've told you from the beginning.

700
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,794
It's my fault for not telling you.

701
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,175
Soo-ro, I realized something
after hearing your story.

702
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:00,387
You're exactly the Don Juan
I would like to depict.

703
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,725
A Don Juan who is
self-centered and obstinate,

704
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,897
but fears death deep down inside.

705
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,817
A Don Juan who seems so very human.

706
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,321
In any case,

707
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,367
the Don Juan that you imagine
must go into the water.

708
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,202
It only makes sense that way.

709
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,620
Speaking of which…

710
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,916
I'd like to show you something.

711
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,377
-This is unnecessary.
-Don't force yourself.

712
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,671
-Don't push yourself.
-I'll take the pool scene out.

713
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,340
-I mean it. Hold on.
-Soo-ro, please.

714
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,549
Stop!

715
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,601
Be careful.

716
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:16,088
When an actor performs,

717
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:21,135
they must forget all
of their fears and insecurities.

718
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,264
Overcoming their limits

719
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,808
is what an actor does!

720
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,232
-I did it!
-Oh, my!

721
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:40,654
He's been practicing going into the water
to star as your Don Juan this entire time!

722
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:41,905
Soo-ro!

723
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,908
Soo-ro!

724
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:47,995
Soo-ro!

725
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,580
If I…

726
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,374
If I train just a little more…

727
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,960
I'll be able to stay in the water longer.

728
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,546
You're the best!

729
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,173
You're amazing!

730
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,216
Soo-ro!

731
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,389
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

732
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,559
Soo-ro, you're the best!

733
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,906
Soo-ro, you're amazing!

734
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,074
-Let's drink!
-Come here!

735
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,954
You're the best!

736
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,916
-Soo-ro!
-Everybody, make a train!

737
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,751
-Choo-choo!
-Follow Soo-ro!

738
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,711
Choo-choo!

739
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,970
Choo-choo!

740
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,348
Choo-choo!

741
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,266
Choo-choo!

742
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,478
Sang-uk.

743
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,315
Sang-uk, wait! You've got the wrong idea.

744
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,652
That was Ho-young. Kim Ho-young.
You know him, right?

745
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:05,197
I'm sorry I couldn't call.
I must have been out of my mind.

746
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,575
I was so happy
that Soo-ro and Ho-young made up

747
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,119
and ended up having a few drinks.

748
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,372
What you just saw means nothing.

749
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,375
We were just drinking together
to build teamwork.

750
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,252
-It's just work.
-Work?

751
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,129
You're telling me that was work?

752
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,258
I know it's hard to understand…

753
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,093
Were all your meetings like this?

754
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,429
No, today was a special occasion.
I can explain everything.

755
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,267
-It's become clear now.
-What?

756
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,060
That you're never going to change.

757
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,480
I'm trying my best.

758
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,400
I've never told anyone about
what I'm doing or where I'm at.

759
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,901
But I tell you everything.

760
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,279
I'm trying my best to change.

761
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,991
You don't have to mind me anymore.

762
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,660
So live however you want.

763
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:56,999
Sang-uk.

764
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,294
Are you breaking up with me?

765
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,171
Sang-uk!

766
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,724
Who is it?

767
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,144
It's Hee-sun. Kang Hee-sun.

768
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,270
Hee-sun?

769
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,480
Just a second.

770
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,945
What brings you here?

771
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,781
I thought about calling you, but…

772
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,243
I'm sorry about earlier.

773
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,663
I was feeling ambitious and impatient.

774
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,708
I got upset with myself
because I wasn't as good as I wished.

775
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,296
I should've told you
I couldn't dance from the beginning.

776
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:47,716
No, I should have checked with you first.

777
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,887
Here.

778
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,722
What's this?

779
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:59,853
I wrote down my strengths and weaknesses.

780
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,440
You're good at speaking English,
singing, running,

781
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,234
playing phone games, and thrift shopping.

782
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,071
And you're bad at cooking, gossiping,

783
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,073
and dancing.

784
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,492
Dancing.

785
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,537
I'll keep this in mind from now on.

786
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,415
I'll get going then.

787
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,042
Wait, Hee-sun.

788
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:27,381
Since you're here,
should we grab a beer or something?

789
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,466
-My favorite bar is around the corner.
-Sure.

790
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,926
I'll get a cab for you later.

791
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,219
Let's see.

792
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,346
What should we eat?

793
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,351
-Jung-don.
-Oh, my. Hey.

794
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,561
-Jung-don, I messed up.
-What happened?

795
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,563
Watch your head.

796
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,108
-I screwed up.
-It's okay.

797
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,567
-It's okay.
-At the pool…

798
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,113
-Hey.
-I was at the pool and…

799
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,531
Hee-sun.

800
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,408
Sorry, but can we reschedule?

801
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,742
-I'm sorry.
-Sure.

802
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,744
-Hey, look at me.
-He was…

803
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,871
-Goodness.
-What do I do?

804
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,623
Your clothes are soaked.

805
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,710
-It's okay.
-Why did I…

806
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,712
It's all right.

807
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,047
It's okay, I get it. Jeez.

808
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,841
What happened?

809
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,970
Don Juan.

810
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,473
Goodbye. It's all over now.

811
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:37,367
The bloody history tainted with jealousy

812
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,747
will lead me on the path to freedom!

813
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,784
-It was amazing.
-Thank you.

814
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,744
-Congratulations.
-It was so nice.

815
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,954
-I really enjoyed it.
-Thank you.

816
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,583
Utilizing water in the play
was a brilliant idea.

817
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,127
To Don Juan,

818
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:32,339
who rejects the idea of monogamy,
water is like a mother

819
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,425
who accepts him the way he is.

820
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:40,931
What makes Don Juan
jump from one woman to another

821
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:43,099
isn't his lust.

822
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,519
It's his fear.

823
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,564
Hold on. What fear?

824
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:53,235
The fear of losing himself

825
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,987
if he were to fall in love
with someone with all his heart.

826
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:00,242
The fear of his loved one leaving him.

827
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,496
Gosh, that was impressive.

828
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,215
IF MY WOUNDS HAVE HEALED
THE SIXTH STORY

829
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,301
I WISH I COULD GO BACK, BUT…

830
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:23,098
HOW TO REGRET
AFTER LOSING SOMEONE YOU LOVE

831
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:34,776
YOU WERE THE ONE FOR ME!

832
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,861
HOW TO REGRET
AFTER LOSING SOMEONE YOU LOVE

833
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,198
THE GUY FROM THE NATIONAL TAX SERVICE

834
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,124
Ms. Chun, their conversation
with Mr. Lee Sang-uk is about over.

835
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,422
I think…

836
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,633
you should see it for yourself.

837
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,976
Can we talk?

838
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,406
What did he say?

839
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,450
Do we have to pay a big fine?

840
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,371
Just tell us already.

841
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,626
He engaged in embezzlement
and tax evasion for the past ten years.

842
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,087
The fines are pretty hefty.

843
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,882
How much?

844
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:45,013
Does your father-in-law know
about the tax investigation?

845
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,514
Yes.

846
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:49,643
He's still willing to buy the company

847
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,020
regardless of the fines?

848
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,229
Well…

849
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,316
there's a problem.

850
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,776
What problem?

851
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:04,157
I think we have to postpone
the acquisition a little bit.

852
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,911
Without his money,
how are you going to pay the fines?

853
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,958
I don't care
if Method goes bankrupt or not,

854
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,543
so figure something out.

855
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,637
The acquisition will be postponed? Why?

856
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:31,518
Tell us. Did something else come up?

857
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,686
What is it?

858
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,359
My wife and I are separated.

859
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,779
It's a family matter.

860
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,823
Goodness gracious.

861
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,541
What's with her?

862
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:56,710
Is she

863
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,837
going to beat him up?

864
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,340
-Let's go.
-We have to stop her.

865
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,425
-Hurry.
-Oh, no.

866
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,888
I realized what my problem was.

867
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,268
I was afraid

868
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,979
that my life would falter
if I loved someone with all my heart.

869
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:21,109
I want to do well at both work and love,
but it's difficult.

870
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,777
So please show me how.

871
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:25,989
I'm sorry.

872
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:41,629
Where is she?

873
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:57,520
Goodness gracious.

874
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,190
What did I just see?

875
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,859
Mr. Kim, did you know about this?

876
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:05,987
No.

877
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,104
Take care.

878
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,137
Shouldn't you go after her?

879
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,392
No, I'm not going to do that anymore.

880
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,063
It's never a good idea

881
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,482
to mix work and emotions.

882
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,653
If I can't deal with it,

883
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,281
I shouldn't start at all.

884
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:43,084
He was leaving

885
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:49,591
But he was not leaving for good

886
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,804
There must have been

887
00:57:55,346 --> 00:58:00,685
Such a promise

888
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,980
Every day…

889
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,732
Then…

890
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,776
what's going to happen

891
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,572
to our company?

892
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,535
I'll figure something out,

893
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,705
so you can all go home.

894
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:26,294
I won't let anything happen to Method
as long as I'm around.

895
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:29,631
He was leaving

896
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,758
But he was not leaving for good…

897
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,384
Are you drunk?

898
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:37,931
No.

899
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,768
Don't worry and go home, all of you.

900
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:49,692
I haven't seen Director Ma
this drunk in a long time.

901
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,115
Was it about 20 years ago?

902
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,909
During the film festival in Busan,

903
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:02,580
he got wasted after almost breaking up
with his wife on the phone

904
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:06,125
and went missing for three days.

905
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:12,590
While we're on the subject,
let me ask you something. Okay?

906
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:22,767
Where the hell were you back then?

907
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,147
I don't remember.

908
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,567
Come on.

909
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,111
Tell me, Director Ma.

910
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,532
I don't remember. It's been too long.

911
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,536
You're smiling.
I can see your two dimples.

912
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,581
-I'm getting curious.
-Tell us.

913
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,709
-Just tell us.
-Yes, tell us.

914
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,377
-What happened?
-Please tell us.

915
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,130
Stop making us wait and just tell us.

916
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,789
SANG-UK

917
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,041
We need to talk.

918
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,667
Are you not going to see me again?

919
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,669
I'm sorry.

920
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,094
Director Ma.

921
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,388
-Are you really not going to tell us?
-I'm not drunk.

922
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,057
-I'm so curious.
-Careful.

923
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,142
-Seriously.
-Grab that taxi!

924
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,810
Where were you then?

925
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,771
-Be careful.
-My goodness.

926
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:52,106
-You can at least tell me.
-Hey!

927
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,192
Please get in.

928
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,735
-Me?
-Are you leaving?

929
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,904
-Bye.
-Bye.

930
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,864
-See you.
-I wish you would tell us.

931
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,783
-Get home safe.
-I'm so curious.

932
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,243
-Go.
-Bye.

933
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,037
-What was that song?
-Let's go.

934
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,289
-He was leaving
-He was leaving

935
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,583
Eun-soo, wait for us.

936
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,627
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

937
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,464
-The buses are still running.
-There are.

938
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,633
-I'll get going.
-Take care.

939
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,093
-See you.
-Bye.

940
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,136
We haven't thrown you a welcome party yet.

941
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,304
It's okay.

942
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:26,099
A welcome party?
Should we go for another round?

943
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,517
-Another round?
-Another?

944
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,810
-Should we do that?
-Sure.

945
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:29,936
Let's go!

946
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:34,232
Let's go and have
some golbaengi and fried chicken!

947
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,483
That sounds good!

948
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,551
Sang-uk?

949
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,693
BEHIND EVERY STAR

950
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,470
We don't keep any secrets between us.

951
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,430
Director Ma, what do I do?

952
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,140
-So it wasn't an affair?
-Seriously.

953
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,935
Why'd you come here
when there are so many prying eyes?

954
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,521
So you're choosing Jun-ho over me.

955
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:19,772
-You have no idea how much
-You have no idea how much

956
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,148
-I've been enduring it all this time!
-I've been enduring it all this time!

957
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,358
Stop!

958
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,277
But would he invest in us?

959
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,945
I'm going to try to win him over.

960
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:26,863
Watch out!

961
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,447
-Don't you trust me?
-You have to keep it a secret.

962
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,782
"Considering retiring"?

963
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,951
-You lying crook.
-That should be my line.

964
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,288
-Shut up.
-How much do you trust Director Ma?

965
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,081
Let's get a divorce.

966
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:39,917
