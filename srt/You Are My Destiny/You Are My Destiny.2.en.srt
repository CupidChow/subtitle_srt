(Episode 2)

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,880
Did we get the wrong luggage?

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,080
Mine doesn't bear a trademark.

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,320
I can accept that I wore
the same outfit as a cleaner.

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,080
How could I also buy the same luggage

32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,000
as that icy man?

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
What has Siqi done?

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,240
Why did she put this in?

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,720
How should I wear this?

36
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,080
What is it?

37
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,380
(Anna: 16 Missed Calls)

38
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,360
Hey, Anna.

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,760
Where are you?

40
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,480
I'll go to see you.

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,640
Why did it take you so long to call back?

42
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,120
I've been calling you.

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,680
Oh,

44
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,320
I was just dealing with something important.

45
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,240
I'll go to see you now.

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's have a drink.

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,040
Well,

48
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,880
actually I...

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,440
I have gone.

50
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,800
Gone?

51
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,720
Where?

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,480
I was just away for a while.

53
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,600
Where have you gone now?

54
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,680
I've left the ship.

55
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,880
Shi Anna,

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,840
you said you would stay with me

57
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,840
and you wouldn't fly again.

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,640
Do you know this time I...

59
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,520
I know.

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,920
I know you've given in

61
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,480
again and again for me.

62
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,680
But this chance is really important to me.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,960
I will be the first Chinese

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,360
to stand on the stage of Paris Opera

65
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,440
and I'll be the white swan.

66
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,400
You'll be happy for me and proud of me,

67
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,080
won't you?

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,920
You know

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
how long I've been pursuing my dream.

70
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,800
I know.

71
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,120
I'm always second

72
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
to your dream.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,600
But Anna,

74
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,720
things are really different this time.

75
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,080
I know you won't forgive me

76
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,600
no matter what I say now.

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,840
But I really want to stay.

78
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
Just now I kept calling you

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,800
because I wanted to hear
your voice before I decided.

80
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,040
Perhaps when I heard it,

81
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,760
I would have the courage to give up.

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,440
Why does it have to be this time?

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,760
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,240
Never mind.

85
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,480
But this is really the last time.

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,720
Anna,

87
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,080
don't test the limit to my patience again.

88
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,500
Yes.

89
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,640
I promise that it's the last time.

90
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,120
I love you.

91
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,520
You're always able

92
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
to make me forgive you.

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,680
Tell me when you get on the plane.

94
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,280
Yes.

95
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,240
Bye.

96
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,320
Bye.

97
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,760
Wang Xiyi,

98
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,080
you failed again.

99
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,520
Home and dry.

100
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,760
I've maxed out my credit card,

101
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,120
but

102
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,320
I'll have beautiful memories with him here

103
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,240
and it's all worth it.

104
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
I haven't dressed yet.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,440
Gu Chi is waiting for me.

106
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,000
is it nice?

107
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,600
Wait a moment.

108
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,920
Gu Chi,

109
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,000
I just had something urgent to do

110
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,280
and I'm changing now.

111
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,120
I'll be right there.

112
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,880
It's okay. It's okay.

113
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,880
Take your time.

114
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,840
I've ordered a luxurious meal
for two at Casanova Restaurant.

115
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,760
When you arrive,

116
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,000
just say our room number.

117
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:29,960
Okay.

118
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,560
Done.

119
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,600
If I had known I'd be here alone,

120
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,400
I wouldn't have got on this ship!

121
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,800
Who is it now?

122
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,200
Who is it? Coming.

123
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,080
What are you doing here?

124
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,600
Sorry,

125
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,360
could you lend a hand?

126
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,040
My hair is stuck in the zip.

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,880
You should ask a woman

128
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,240
to help you with things of this kind.

129
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,240
I want to,

130
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,560
but the receptionist said
the cleaner was busy

131
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,800
and I had to wait for 20 minutes.

132
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,520
I need your help urgently.

133
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,520
My boyfriend is waiting
for me in the restaurant.

134
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,840
We're going to have a meal together.

135
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,480
Come in.

136
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,600
Is it alright if we do that in the hallway?

137
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,600
Or you can turn to someone else.

138
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,040
Sorry for bothering you.

139
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,200
Thanks.

140
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,280
Where is it?

141
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,520
Here...

142
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,000
here.

143
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,080
What are you doing?

144
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,320
Getting my scissors.

145
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,720
You've got to be careful, then.

146
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,560
Don't worry.

147
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,480
Don't move.

148
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,200
You've got your ring back.

149
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,680
Your proposal must have gone smoothly.

150
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,280
You're so good-looking

151
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,520
and put so much effort into it.

152
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,160
If I were your girlfriend,

153
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,120
I would definitely say yes.

154
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,040
It's not what you should worry about.

155
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,400
Go to see your boyfriend now.

156
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,920
Thank you.

157
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,000
Thanks.

158
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,880
Thanks, honestly.

159
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,720
Bye-bye.

160

(Casanova)

161
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,760
Hello,

162
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,480
welcome to Three-Star Michelin Restaurant,

163
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,360
Casanova.

164
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,280
Go in, please.

165
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,000
Where's the gentleman who booked the table?

166
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,240
Sorry,

167
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,520
he's away to do something,

168
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,400
but just now he said we could serve

169
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,840
when you arrived here.

170
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,960
Wait a moment, please.

171
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,960
Hello.

172
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,680
Hey, Gu Chi.

173
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,000
I've arrived in the restaurant.

174
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,560
Where are you?

175
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,840
Xinxin,

176
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,120
I suddenly got an ache in my stomach.

177
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,600
I went back to our room to take some drugs.

178
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,560
Wait for me there.

179
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,280
Okay, okay.

180
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:48,840
Good girl.

181
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,840
My cake.

182
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Compensate me.

183
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,560
I told you not to run and you kept running.

184
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm sorry. Sorry.

185
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,600
-It's okay. It's okay.
-My cake.

186
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,200
Stop crying.

187
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,960
My cake.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,680
Go, go, go.

189
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,680
Go.

190
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,160
Excuse me.

191
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,280
May I help you, sir?

192
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,720
Please open the door.

193
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,000
Could you please tell me your name?

194
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,640
My name is Wang Xiyi.

195
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,440
Wang Xiyi. Okay.

196
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,720
Wait a second.

197
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,440
Okay.

198
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,960
Are you really taking me to your room?

199
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,560
Aren't you afraid your girlfriend
will find out?

200
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,520
Why should I be? She's so stupid.

201
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,720
When we're done,

202
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,120
I guess she's still sitting there.

203
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,600
What worries me is your boss.

204
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
Will he be glued to a game of cards?

205
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,080
What if he gets bored with it?

206
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,040
Rest easy.

207
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,520
He can't find me.

208
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,120
This is our first meal on board
and it's so nice.

209
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,480
It must be a good omen.

210
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,240
The wine is sweet.

211
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,960
Gu Chi must like it very much.

212
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,460
(Recorder)

213
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,200
Why did he take so long?

214
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,400
Is there something wrong with him?

215
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
You really didn't eat anything.

216
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,120
You...

217
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,560
Eat. Don't waste food.

218
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
My... my boyfriend ordered these for me.

219
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,960
Why are you eating them?

220
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,840
Don't wait for him.

221
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,840
Eat as well.

222
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,680
Eat something.

223
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,560
You won't feel like eating

224
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,640
for a period of time.

225
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,920
What... what do you mean?

226
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:44,960
Okay.

227
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,000
Your room card.

228
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,000
Sorry.

229
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,240
When I finish eating,

230
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,080
go back to your room with me.

231
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,640
I've got an important date.

232
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,600
Go right away when you're done.

233
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,400
My ring is missing.

234
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,200
What?

235
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,280
Why are you looking at me?

236
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,160
Do you suspect that I...

237
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,160
How's that possible?

238
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,320
I won't do things like that.

239
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,640
But it seems

240
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,120
you particularly like my ring

241
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,160
and you tried so hard to find it before.

242
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,160
Aren't I right?

243
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,000
I didn't steal it.

244
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,440
Alright,

245
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
let's go to your room later

246
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,600
and we'll know everything.

247
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,720
Are you serious about this?

248
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes.

249
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,240
Make it quick.

250
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,200
He may have...

251
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,680
Who...

252
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,600
who...

253
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,200
who...

254
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,000
who is she?

255
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,000
I've told you to wait in the restaurant.

256
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,240
What did you come back for?

257
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,600
What's going on?

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,720
Here's the thing.

259
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,480
That lady

260
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,800
stays across our room.

261
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,920
And just now I had

262
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,320
an upset stomach

263
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,040
so I went to her room

264
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:39,880
to borrow some drugs.

265
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
She was on the balcony

266
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,560
and waves were huge there.

267
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
So she got wet

268
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,560
and came to borrow your dress.

269
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,120
But

270
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,960
you went to borrow drugs.

271
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,120
Why would she come to our room?

272
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,240
And

273
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,880
her dress is dry.

274
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,240
Chen Jiaxin,

275
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,440
you're suspecting me now.

276
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,040
I'm the one who should criticize.

277
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,280
Why didn't you prepare any drugs?

278
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:03,800
It's your fault.

279
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,240
I had to borrow things

280
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,920
and got misunderstood.

281
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,880
Are you satisfied?

282
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,800
You really have

283
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,160
your own brilliant ideas now!

284
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,200
That's not what I mean.

285
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,600
What do you mean, then?

286
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,120
Hey, shouldn't you ask him

287
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,040
why they were on the bed together?

288
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,320
Besides,

289
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,360
the room across is mine.

290
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,360
How did you even get on its balcony?

291
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,040
My room is next to yours.

292
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,760
Now that I've taken drugs here,

293
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,880
I'll be off.

294
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,000
Do you really think of others as a fool?

295
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,000
You randomly seduced a man on your journey

296
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,200
and you cheated on your girlfriend

297
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,160
and denied it.

298
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,080
Who are you?

299
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,560
It's not your place to talk nonsense here!

300
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,560
Jiaxin,

301
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,040
do you believe an outsider

302
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,160
instead of me?

303
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,480
I...

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,920
I don't know.

305
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,080
You will be especially sexy with this pajama.

306
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,880
You want me to wear your girlfriend's stuff?

307
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,120
What if she finds out?

308
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,240
If anyone wants to be my girlfriend,

309
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,560
she must be naive, obedient
and easy to control.

310
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,680
Who I'm dating is an idiot
who's 100% eligible.

311
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,960
I tell her to do something
and she never refuses.

312
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Even if she catches us at it,

313
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,760
as long as I say

314
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,920
that we're just chatting in bed,

315
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
she won't be a little bit suspicious.

316
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,800
What the hell is going on?

317
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,320
Are you ganging up on me?

318
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,200
Okay,

319
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,520
I admit that I'm a jerk.

320
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,480
What about you?

321
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,840
Come here.

322
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,160
What's your relationship with him?

323
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,160
I don't know him.

324
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,560
We just met on the ship.

325
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,280
You don't know him?

326
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,120
If you didn't know him,

327
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,280
would he have recorded that for you?

328
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,800
You yourself are the jerk.

329
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,040
Don't throw mud at others.

330
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,040
Why would I throw mud at you?

331
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,320
You two are so dirty already.

332
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,880
Do you dare to admit it?

333
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,520
Chen Jiaxin,

334
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,520
I've finally seen you through today.

335
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,160
Let's break up.

336
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,440
Get out, then.

337
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,000
Why should I get out?

338
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,080
Because I've paid for this room.

339
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,960
You asked me to travel with you.

340
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,600
Of course you should pay.

341
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,520
Do you have nowhere to sleep tonight?

342
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,240
You can sleep on the sofa.

343
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,480
If you want to sleep in bed,

344
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,200
there may not be enough room.

345
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:20,880
Hey,

346
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,840
don't kill yourself for a jerk.
He doesn't deserve it.

347
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,320
I didn't try to kill myself.

348
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,880
I just wanted to get my shawl back.

349
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,280
Sorry.

350
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Just now I...

351
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,600
Can you stop saying sorry?

352
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,960
Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

353
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,440
Never mind. Forget about it.

354
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,760
You were right.

355
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,680
I'm a fool.

356
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,760
He could get anything on his phone,

357
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,160
but he said he wanted it

358
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,680
and I went to buy it for him obediently.

359
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,160
Gu Chi doesn't like me at all

360
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,200
and I've put all my effort
into currying favor with him

361
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,320
and even maxed out my card for him.

362
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,880
I just wanted him to be touched

363
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,800
and like me a little bit.

364
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,760
I waited every day

365
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,800
and hoped

366
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,880
someone would see nice things about me.

367
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,480
But this city is really too big.

368
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,840
No one can see me.

369
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,640
I'm just like a sticky note

370
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,240
which is thrown away once used,

371
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,880
easily removed and never sticks to hands.

372
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,520
Look at you.

373
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,640
You're wearing

374
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,280
such a pair of glasses

375
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,640
and have

376
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,080
this ugly hairstyle.

377
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,680
Tell me

378
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,000
which man

379
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,800
will like you.

380
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,200
Yes,

381
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,720
you're right.

382
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,480
I'm not only a plain girl

383
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,880
but also a bad judge of men.

384
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,960
By the way,

385
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,800
you don't have to stay with me here.

386
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,920
Go back to your fiancee.

387
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,120
If you keep her waiting,

388
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,960
she'll be angry.

389
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,120
I'm comforting you

390
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,240
and you want me to go, don't you?

391
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,620
You...

392
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,920
you were comforting me just now?

393
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,800
I wasn't just comforting you

394
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,560
but also myself.

395
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,600
What do you mean?

396
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,760
She left

397
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,400
before I proposed.

398
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,920
Left?

399
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,320
Where has she gone?

400
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,040
Europe.

401
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,480
She is

402
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,120
the principal dancer of a ballet.

403
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,880
The ballet needs her

404
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,200
and she left me here.

405
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,200
Looks like

406
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
we've both been unfortunate today.

407
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
We were abandoned pitilessly

408
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,800
like sticky notes.

409
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,080
But how come

410
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,600
we're always sad and heartbroken

411
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,480
and they can keep being so carefree?

412
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,520
Who says we can only be sad?

413
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,840
I'm in a bad mood today

414
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,360
and you happened

415
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,960
to have met me here.

416
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,180
Let's go.

417
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,200
Where are we going?

418
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,120
You need to strike back.

419
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,840
I know what you're thinking.

420
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,160
Feel free to use your secret weapons

421
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,080
and change her

422
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,640
into a gorgeous lady

423
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,800
that captivates everyone.

424
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,720
Don't you think that's too difficult?

425
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,160
Why don't we just go?

426
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,000
I think my look

427
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,560
is fine now.

428
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,320
Anyway,

429
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,720
I don't want to be in a relationship anymore.

430
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,040
It's okay if you keep being like this.

431
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,520
But then you'll always have to be

432
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,400
an unimpressive woman

433
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,320
no men will look at.

434
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,640
I...

435
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,520
I...

436
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,680
don't wanna.

437
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,760
You finally saw the light.

438
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,880
So first of all,

439
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,120
what we should get rid of

440
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,560
is this pair of glasses.

441
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,720
Where are my glasses?

442
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,480
I'll wait to see your masterpiece.

443
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,640
I won't let you down.

444
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,800
Goodness,

445
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,960
you didn't take care of your skin.

446
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,920
It's so dry.

447
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,000
How can I make you up now?

448
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,640
Guys,

449
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,480
give her a moisturizer.

450
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,080
Sorry,

451
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,040
I kept you wait...

452
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,960
Sorry.

453
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,800
Don't spoil the beauty at this moment.

454
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,760
Remember.

455
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,720
Now you're the heroine

456
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,160
who all eyes are on.

457
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,200
Be confident.

458
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,480
Heroine?

459
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,560
Your cruise has just started.

460
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,880
I...

461
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,080
I haven't got any money on me.

462
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,400
Be confident.

463
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,160
Chip up.

464
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,360
Chest out.

465
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,120

this is so beautiful.

492
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,960
Thank you.

493
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,600
If it hadn't been for you,

494
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,920
I would have been crying at some corner.

495
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,560
Aren't you too low-maintenance?

496
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,960
The highlight today hasn't even started.

497
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,320
Did you forget our most important task?

498
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,000
Remember what I'm going to say.

499
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,040
We won't attack unless we're attacked.

500
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,320
When we're attacked,

501
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,320
we'll definitely teach him a lesson.

502
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,480
Come on.

503
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,200
Let's get even with the person
who cheated on you.

504
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,240
You can do it,

505
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,160
Chen Jiaxin.

506
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,240
What if I miss?

507
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,680
If women can do everything,

508
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,360
what do they need men for?

509
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,760
It's tiring to teach you to play billiards.

510
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,600
Go.

511
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,600
Pour me a glass of wine.

512
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,960
So cheeky.

513
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,160
Don't be afraid.

514
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,320
Chen Jiaxin,

515
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,360
why are you...

516
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,080
You've just broken up for two hours.

517
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,280
She changed and took off her glasses

518
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,720
and you can't recognize her already?

519
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,160
You've really messed around with this jerk.

520
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,800
You are the one who's a jerk.

521
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,680
What did you say?

522
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,120
Feel free to say anything.

523
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,920
You spent money your girlfriend made

524
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,960
and enjoyed the journey she paid for.

525
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,440
But when you just got on the ship,

526
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,720
you slept with another woman

527
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,400
in the room your girlfriend booked.

528
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,960
You are the most horrible jerk in the world.

529
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,320
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

530
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,200
Bastard,

531
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,480
did you ask her to say these things?

532
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,320
Answer me!

533
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,880
I knew it.

534
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,520
You two have messed around with each other.

535
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,840
I'm in a great mood today.

536
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,640
Do you wanna play a game?

537
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,880
Why not?

538
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,720
Okay.

539
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,600
Why don't we...

540
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,080
why don't we just let it go?

541
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,840
Do you distrust me so much?

542
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,520
I'm afraid you'll lose face.

543
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,000
Gu Chi is good at playing billiards.

544
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,200
I've never played billiards,

545
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,000
but I want to give it a try.

546
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,080
You've never played billiards?

547
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,040
What...

548
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,240
Give me your hand.

549
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,800
With it on your hand,

550
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,520
you can't escape anymore.

551
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,000
Hey.

552
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,240
We can't just play for nothing.

553
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,960
I'm not doing it without any bets.

554
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,440
What will you do if you lose?

555
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,160
If I lose,

556
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,560
I'll eat all these balls.

557
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,600
But if you lose,

558
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,560
just eat any one of them.

559
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,320
Chen Jiaxin,

560
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,960
if this jerk loses,

561
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,520
how do you want to punish him?

562
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,360
Me?

563
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,720
I...

564
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,040
I want him to make an apology.

565
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,640
He owes me one.

566
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,080
Deal.

567
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,400
Dear me, awesome.

568
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,520
Didn't you say you had never played this?

569
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,320
That's true.

570
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,000
I learned it when I watched you

571
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,480
play just now.

572
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
You fooled me.

573
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,200
Listen, you can't beat me even if you do

574
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,600
all your dirty deeds.

575
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,360
Oh,

576
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,240
make room. Make room.

577
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,000
It's a little bit hard

578
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,920
to hit the last ball.

579
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,320
Looks like

580
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,560
lady luck has to hit it for me.

581
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,040
Chen Jiaxin,

582
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,280
will you hit the last ball for me?

583
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,120
I regard this sticky note as a burden

584
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,720
and you call her lady luck.

585
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,880
I'd love to see

586
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
how this lady luck

587
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
can be of help to you.

588
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,400
You've got to be kidding me.

589
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,720
I haven't even touched a cue.

590
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,800
I can't do it.

591
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,080
Do you trust yourself?

592
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,560
Do you trust me?

593
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,400
Just hit it

594
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,120
as I told you.

595
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,680
I hope from now on,

596
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,960
you'll have power,

597
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,520
courage and good luck.

598
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,520
Ordinary girls

599
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,400
also deserve to be cherished.

600
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,120
Trust yourself.

601
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,680
Give me your hand.

602
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,880
Hold it tight.

603
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,360
Good.

604
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,080
Three,

605
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:11,800
two,

606
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,600
one.

607
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,360
We won.

608
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,880
We won.

609
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,640
Bravo!

610
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,360
Bravo!

611
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,360
Congratulations.

612
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,760
Thank you.

613
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,160
Admit defeat if you're a man.

614
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,400
He's right.

615
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,440
Admit defeat.

616
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,360
I'm going to meet my boss.

617
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,160
Apologize properly.

618
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,960
Sorry.

619
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,680
Louder.

620
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,640
Sorry!

621
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,560
Is that okay now?

622
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,840
Your extra dessert.

623
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,880
Jiaxin,

624
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,960
I've lost the game, apologized

625
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,480
and disgraced myself.

626
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,200
At any rate, we were
boyfriend and girlfriend.

627
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,920
You won't make me do it, will you?

628
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,520
Have you ever considered me
as your girlfriend?

629
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,480
I'm just an ATM to you,

630
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,280
a stupid woman who didn't dare

631
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,040
to start eating without your order.

632
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,800
I've finally seen you through.

633
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Everything about you disgusts me.

634
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,000
Yes, yes, yes.

635
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,160
I disgusted you.

636
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,880
I'm a jerk.

637
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,640
I'm a bastard.

638
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,520
Forgive me.

639
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,720
Get lost!

640
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,880
Don't let me see you ever again.

641
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,000
Are you hungry?

642
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,600
If you're not, I'll eat it.

643
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,480
Cheer up.

644
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,160
Thank you.

645
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,880
It's the first time

646
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,360
everything has been so unlike me.

647
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,800
You don't need to thank me.

648
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,960
Thanks to you,

649
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,360
my lonely journey hasn't been

650
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,440
quite boring.

651
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,120
But

652
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,200
it's a fly in the ointment

653
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,720
that we didn't make him eat that ball.

654
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,200
So

655
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,040
does it feel good to take revenge on a jerk?

656
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,120
Thanks.

657
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,360
You helped me teach him a lesson today.

658
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,720
It was very satisfying.

659
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,840
I think

660
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,160
now I can completely

661
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,680
and utterly say goodbye to this relationship

662
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,960
which was never for me.

663
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,280
Chen Jiaxin,

664
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,480
you've made progress.

665
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,920
Yes.

666
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,760
We all need to grow up.

667
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,600
It's been a long day.

668
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,960
I can finally go back and have a good sleep.

669
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,520
