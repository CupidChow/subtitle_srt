25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,940
(Episode 27)

26
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,380
(The Only One)

27
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,780
"The Only One".

28
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,460
"The Only One".

29
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,580
There are three things.

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,700
Why do you call it "The Only One"?

31
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,940
The three things

32
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,060
are indispensable

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,500
for a tea set.

34
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,020
But only with these,

35
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,180
we can't make a nice pot of tea.

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,580
So,

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,060
they're the only one

38
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,020
that's not suitable for each other.

39
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,420
I see what you mean.

40
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,060
You mean

41
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,220
each of the three things is unique.

42
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,660
But if they're put together,

43
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,220
they can't cooperate well,

44
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,700
so it's better to put them separately.

45
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,620
Maybe

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,660
this is the best state for them.

47
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,860
Is that what you mean?

48
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,660
Little girl,

49
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,820
how long will you stay in Hungary?

50
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,620
Um.

51
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,780
I don't know either.

52
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,500
Maybe I'll leave tomorrow.

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,740
Maybe

54
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,220
I'll stay for another while.

55
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,820
Sir.

56
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,020
Time for class. Don't be late.

57
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,740
Oh. Okay.

58
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,380
What will we make today?

59
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,020
Okay.

60
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,180
Yeah. What will we make today?

61
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,420
Uh.

62
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,020
Okay.

63
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,100
Bye.

64
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,060
Okay.

65
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,140
Okay.

66
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,900
If you hadn't come into my life,

67
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,940
we would have been living a quiet life

68
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,860
in our own worlds.

69
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,500
That may be the best state

70
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,620
for the three of us.

71
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:57,980
Mom,

72
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,820
I really don't understand.

73
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,620
Obviously, Xiyi can't forget Jiaxin.

74
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,340
He sleeps at the baby's room every night.

75
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,460
But why does he stay in contact with his ex?

76
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,020
Is it possible

77
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,540
they're back together?

78
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,340
Pooh.

79
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,900
How could it be possible?

80
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,420
Huh?

81
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,580
That is emotional blackmail
and moral coercion.

82
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:17,940
Well.

83
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,860
Jiaxin was pregnant
when she was married into our family.

84
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,260
Didn't she feel wronged?

85
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:21,980
Huh?

86
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,820
But she was cautious

87
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,860
and considerate,

88
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,380
because she didn't want
to bother Xiyi or any of us.

89
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,340
Right?

90
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,980
But look at Miss Shi.

91
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,100
First, seeing the photo of Xiyi and Jiaxin,

92
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,820
she fell and suffered cerebral concussion.

93
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,100
Then she was injured
and can't give birth anymore

94
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,060
because Xiyi pushed her by accident.

95
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:44,660
Hmm.

96
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,140
Yes.

97
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,660
This woman is pitiful,

98
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,620
but

99
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,860
because of the two reasons,

100
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,340
she made Xiyi have no choice
but to stay with her.

101
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,500
Now, Xiyi doesn't want to come home

102
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,580
and he doesn't have any appetite.

103
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,620
That woman is so scheming.

104
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,940
I hate to see her.
It makes me sick at the sight of her.

105
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,140
I'm telling you, Wang Zhengren.

106
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,660
Listen carefully.

107
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,460
If you have a girlfriend like that woman

108
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,020
and dare to take her home,

109
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,540
I'll kick her out immediately.

110
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,940
In this case,

111
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,460
Xiyi is the most pitiful.

112
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,180
Right?

113
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,340
All of them are pitiful.

114
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,220
Think about it.

115
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,820
Has your grandma had dinner with us

116
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,380
since Jiaxin left?

117
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,740
She's upset too.

118
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,860
Great Master,

119
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,020
why are you calling me?

120
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,940
Stop flattering me.

121
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,020
I have something to tell you.

122
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,980
Today,

123
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,820
I met someone who really understands me.

124
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,020
She stood before my painting for a long time.

125
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,020
The painting I didn't give a name to.

126
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,980
She said a lot.

127
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,340
That's exactly what I want to express.

128
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,860
Alas. Pitifully,

129
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,580
she's just a passer-by.

130
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,980
What would you do if she's not?

131
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,460
Isn't it obvious?

132
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,580
I'll take her to my studio.

133
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,140
I'll talk with her for three days and nights.

134
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,460
I'd like to see

135
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,900
what other ideas she's got.

136
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,660
I can't believe you said those words.

137
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
She must be amazing.

138
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,100
You have to get her contact information.

139
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,060
Then you can contact her occasionally.

140
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,900
Yeah. I planned to ask for her phone number,

141
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,100
but those kids pushed me to go back.

142
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,660
Well. I'm telling you.

143
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,340
You haven't had dinner
with me for a long time.

144
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,300
Do you know that?

145
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:47,900
Great Master,

146
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,380
I've been busy recently.

147
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,580
One of my friends just came to Hungary.

148
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,620
Fine.

149
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,780
You have to keep your friend company,

150
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,140
so you don't have time to see me. Right?

151
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,020
Hmm?

152
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:00,900
Alright.

153
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,020
Take your friend here.

154
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,620
That'd be great.

155
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,860
It happens that she's your big fan.

156
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,180
Come here with your friend.

157
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,740
Okay!

158
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,700
Hello.

159
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,540
Beautiful lady, are you available after work?

160
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,540
Why are you here?

161
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,220
I'm here to pick you up.

162
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,580
I want to take you
to have dinner with my friend.

163
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,860
But

164
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,340
my Hungarian is not good enough
for me to visit others.

165
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,900
It's okay, as long as you're thick-skinned.

166
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,220
Great Master,

167
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,380
we're here.

168
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,260
Dylan.

169
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:01,700
Eh?

170
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,380
You're…

171
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,020
You're the one in the show room.

172
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,460
You…

173
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,700
Oh.

174
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,140
Come in please.

175
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,540
Great Master,

176
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,660
your favorite Maotai.

177
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,180
Come on.

178
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,860
Take a seat. Make yourself at home.

179
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,780
It happens that I prepared dumplings.

180
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,740
The liquor is a great match for them.

181
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,540
Girls can drink it a little bit too.

182
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,460
I'll get a few cups.

183
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,100
Here you are.

184
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,620
Thank you.

185
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,420
Wow.

186
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,420
This cup is so beautiful.

187
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,220
It's more impressive

188
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,820
than Mr. Zhongshan Long's early works.

189
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,420
Why are you laughing?

190
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,020
Look.

191
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,500
On this cup,

192
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,780
you can see the trace of flame

193
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,340
flowing over the green body.

194
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,460
You can also see the ash glazes

195
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,060
made from the ash of wood.

196
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,500
Like Mr. Zhongshan Long's works,

197
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,460
Chai kiln is used to make it.

198
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,340
Look.

199
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,300
The texture is rough and natural.

200
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,620
The color is simple and pure.

201
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,620
The gradation is deep and reserved.

202
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,860
It looks ordinary at first glance,

203
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,500
but it's full of details.

204
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,180
I can't help looking at it again and again.

205
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,740
I can't take my eyes off it.

206
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,100
This…

207
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,460
You said it's for Mr. Zhongshan Long.

208
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,100
You're…

209
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,780
…Mr. Zhongshan Long?

210
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,260
You just showed me

211
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,700
what it's like

212
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,220
to teach fish to swim.

213
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,020
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

214
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,940
If I did, I wouldn't have had
a chance to laugh at you.

215
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,740
You're

216
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,700
Zhenzhu's granddaughter-in-law?

217
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,220
I…

218
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,660
I was.

219
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,580
But that's all in the past.

220
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,820
Great Master,

221
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,380
please don't take it to heart.

222
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,860
No warned, no fault.

223
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,100
I was

224
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,740
just saying.

225
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,060
It's okay.

226
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,780
It was his prank. He did it on purpose

227
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,580
to laugh at you.

228
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,820
But Dylan has been thinking highly of you.

229
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,620
He said you have great talent.

230
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,980
Great Master,

231
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,460
your first disciple has left
to get married, right?

232
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,020
She's such an enthusiastic and crazy fan.

233
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,100
Do you want to have one more disciple?

234
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,900
Do you…

235
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,740
…want to be my disciple?

236
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,780
Of course I do.

237
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,380
Actually, it's easy

238
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,140
to learn some basics of pottery,

239
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,300
but it's not easy

240
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,140
to be determined

241
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,020
to keep going.

242
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,180
Are you sure

243
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,900
you'll do that?

244
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,980
Yes, I am.

245
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,820
As long as

246
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,980
I can be your disciple,

247
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,860
I'm willing to do any work

248
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,100
that's hard, dirty or tiring.

249
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,380
Are you sure you won't regret

250
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,100
this decision?

251
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,100
I'll never regret it.

252
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,060
Alright.

253
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,140
From today on,

254
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,820
you're my last disciple.

255
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,820
Thank you. I'll do my best.

256
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,140
Great Master, let's clink glasses.

257
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,700
Okay.

258
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,180
For

259
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,260
my

260
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,780
last disciple,

261
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,740
cheers.

262
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,540
Thank you, master.

263
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,260
Good liquor.

264
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,580
Come on. Try the dumplings.

265
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,540
Mr. Yi,

266
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,580
this is the analysis report on sales
in Europe prepared by Marketing Dept.

267
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,420
Please have a look.

268
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,420
Okay. I see.

269
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:28,820
Okay.

270
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,620
Tang,

271
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,580
come over.

272
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,980
What is it?

273
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,460
Sorry, Mr. Yi.

274
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,660
I want to save paper,

275
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,420
so I printed them

276
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,180
on the other side of some used paper.

277
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,100
It's okay.

278
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,620
Get all paper like this for me.

279
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,340
Oh. Okay.

280
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,020
Mr. Yi, it's all here.

281
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,620
Thank you.

282
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,780
(Happy Cheng Jie 2.0 Plan
Proposer: Chen Jiaxin)

283
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,540
What were you talking about?

284
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,300
I said

285
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,620
Xiyi

286
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,020
helped me a lot.

287
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,700
He not only helped me analyze data

288
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,700
but also adopted
many of my little suggestions.

289
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,780
Oh.

290
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,940
I heard

291
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,860
everyone keeps on singing praises

292
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
on the new coffee maker

293
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,660
and fine coffee beans Jiaxin bought.

294
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,460
Besides,

295
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,180
I heard

296
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,860
you plan to set up
a lactation room in the company.

297
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,860
Some large-sized internet enterprises abroad

298
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
provide such benefits.

299
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,100
Some businesses even hold

300
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,340
"Take Our Kids to Work Day".

301
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,580
It's significantly effective.

302
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,460
The employee turnover rate
is greatly reduced.

303
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,740
Jiaxin, your little suggestions
are worth trying.

304
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,100
But

305
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,540
Xiyi also said that

306
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,620
such benefits have to be applied moderately.

307
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,540
We can't make the office
become the staff's home,

308
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,260
or many leaders

309
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,300
will take it for granted

310
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,700
that subordinates should work overtime.

311
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,220
In this case,

312
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,940
it'll become another way of exploitation.

313
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:07,780
Mom,

314
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,100
why are you in such a good mood?

315
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,460
I'm happy.

316
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,140
We haven't had dinner together

317
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,180
like this for a long time.

318
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,460

You finally succeeded.

514
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,860
During the past three years,

515
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,660
you're the one

516

I'm most grateful to.

Don't just talk the talk.

518
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,500
You'd better think about

519
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,940
how to thank me in a more practical way.

520
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,140
You're straightforward enough.

Business is business.

523
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,300
In recent years, Cheng Jie Group

524
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,620
has been operating across Europe.

525
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,500
Meanwhile, it's been successively chosen

526
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,180
as the most popular enterprise in China.

527
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,740
Besides, as far as I know,

528
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,300
Cheng Jie Group ranks

529
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,300
among the happiest companies.

530
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,820
And the employee turnover rate
is much lower than that in other companies.

531
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,260
Mr. Yi, can you tell us

532
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,100
what made you decide

533
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,820
to carry out enterprise reform?

534
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,300
Or

535
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,940
what secrets do you have
about enterprise management?

536
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,940
Can you share with us?

537
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,620
At the beginning,

538
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,300
I didn't pay much attention
to employee welfare.

539
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,940
I thought

540
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,740
employees

541
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,100
should serve the company whole-heartedly

542
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,260
now that they're paid

543
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,460
and they shouldn't take
personal issues to the workplace.

544
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,900
But one day,

545
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,340
I saw a proposal on employee welfare.

546
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,700
It influenced me a lot.

547
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,140
At first,

548
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,660
I wanted to prove she's wrong,

549
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,460
but in the end,

550
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,820
I proved I was wrong.

551
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,540
Every employee spends

552
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,740
more than half of each workday
in the workplace,

553
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,380
so it shouldn't be unfriendly.

554
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,420
Then,

555
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,660
we initiated "Cheng Jie's Love".

556
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,900
Based on institutionalized management,

557
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,620
we hope employees consider
the enterprise as their home.

558
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,540
I'm also willing to go forward
hand in hand with my family.

559
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,260
(Happy Children's Day)

560
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,900
I didn't expect
there is such a story behind it.

561
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,060
I think it's rare

562
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,940
for an employee

563
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,340
to make a boss change his ideas.

564
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,060
I'm wondering

565
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,740
if we can interview her.

566
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,820
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

567
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,420
After submitting that proposal,

568
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,580
she left Cheng Jie

569
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,860
and started a new journey.

570
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,100
Of course I hope

571
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,460
she can see the changes

572
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,540
that have happened to me and Cheng Jie

573
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,780
like the others do.

574
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,980
I believe she will.

575
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,460
Okay.

576
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,500
Mr. Yi, thank you for giving an interview.

577
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,260
Thank you.

578
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,780
Be careful.

579
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,860
Avoid hitting there.

580
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,260
Slow down.

581
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,420
Just put it here.

582
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,180
Okay.

583
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,820
Is it okay to put it here?

584
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,900
A little farther.

585
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,260
Here?

586
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:58,900
Right.

587
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,060
Great.

588
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,860
A little farther please.

589
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,540
Okay.

590
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,180
Okay.

591
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,380
Great.

592
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,820
Perfect.

593
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,860
Thank you for helping me with the decoration.

594
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,340
It saved me a lot of money.

595
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,420
Anna.

596
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:11,860
Hmm?

597
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,620
Are you determined to give up your career?

598
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,180
A lot of professional companies

599
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,460
are hiring dancers.

600
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,060
Don't you want to think about it?

601
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,340
Yeah.

602
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,940
It's a pity that you give up like this.

603
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,180
Girls, don't try to persuade me.

604
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,220
It's not easy to make preparations

605
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,100
for the dance studio,

606
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,260
but

607
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,060
I've never been so joyful,

608
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,780
free and peaceful.

609
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,300
In the future, I just want
to slow down my pace

610
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,900
and spend more time with Xiyi

611
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,860
to make up for the losses

612
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,700
caused by our long-distance relationship.

613
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,620
Anna, it seems

614
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,340
you're determined to be a good girlfriend.

615
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,660
A new chapter of your life begins.

616
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,780
Congratulations.

617
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,580
Congratulations.

618
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,580
Thank you.

619
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,020
Be happy.

620
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,100
Thank you.

621
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,740
Congratulations.

622
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,180
Hmm.

623
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,220
All the dishes are here.

624
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:17,620
Mom,

625
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,300
I've made your favorite dish.
Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs.

626
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,500
-Great.
-Wonderful.

627
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,580
It's been a long time

628
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,060
since we last had dinner together.

629
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,940
Hey. Xiyi,

630
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,140
I've got cutlery for you.

631
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,340
Why are you getting one more set?

632
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:29,900
Oh.

633
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,100
I invited one of my friends

634
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,100
to have dinner with us.

635
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,260
Who is it?

636
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,180
Xiyi.

637
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:43,660
You're here.

638
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,140
Grandma.

639
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,340
Auntie.

640
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,220
Zhengren.

641
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,460
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

642
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,060
These are gifts for you.

643
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,780
Hmm.

644
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,420
Today is Mid-Autumn Festival.

645
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,820
Anna has no relatives in Shanghai,

646
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,340
so I asked her to have dinner with us.

647
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:08,900
Take a seat.

648
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,980
Thank you, grandma.

649
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,020
Pass the stuff to me.

650
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,140
Xiyi,

651
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,180
I've made your favorite dishes.

652
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,060
Have a good appetite.

653
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,580
Mom,

654
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,300
I suddenly lost my appetite.

655
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,580
Enjoy your meal.

656
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,620
I forgot I need to send
an email this afternoon.

657
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,580
Enjoy your meal.

658
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,420
Xiyi,

659
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,020
you should've told us earlier

660
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,060
that Anna would be here for dinner.

661
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,660
Then I could've prepared more dishes.

662
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,980
I'll go get some fruits.

663
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,220
Enjoy your meal.

664
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,420
It's been three years.

665
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,940
They're still unwilling to accept me.

666
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,740
They even don't want to have dinner with me.

667
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,140
It's a festival today.

668
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,140
Don't think too much.

669
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,580
Eat.

670
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,580
Xiyi,

671
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,460
having dinner with you

672
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,540
still makes me happy.

673
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,300
What should we eat first?

674
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,140
How about the pork?

675
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,940
It's…

676
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,620
Elaine,

677
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,260
you've been learning from Zhongshan Long
for nearly three years.

678
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,100
I've been watching you

679
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,380
put in effort and change for the better.

680
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,860
It's time to test your works for the market.

681
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:18,940
But

682
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,260
my works

683
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,380
have never been exhibited.

684
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,820
Are they

685
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:24,980
qualified?

686
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,660
It's been a long time

687
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,900
since I last saw the unconfident Chen Jiaxin.

688
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,980
It's rare.

689
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:33,980
Alright.

690
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,540
Give your work a name.

691
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,620
What

692
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,060
shall I call it?

693
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,460
I'll call it "Memento".

694
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,260
"Memento".

695
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,300
A souvenir of

696
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,180
my work

697
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,220
being exhibited for the first time.

698
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,260
A souvenir of this moment.

699
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,620
A souvenir of

700
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,500
my days in Hungary.

701
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,340
A souvenir of

702
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,500
dribs and drabs during the past three years.

703
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,140
And a souvenir of

704
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,420
the days three years ago,

705
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,980
that person,

706
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,380
and that unrealistic dream.

707
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,820
Without them,

708
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,620
I couldn't have become what I am.

709
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,140
I want to commemorate them,

710
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,940
because I have been reborn.

711
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,980
Then,

712
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,020
I've also got something

713
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,540
worth commemorating.

714
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,580
When I hear some good music,

715
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,180
I hope you can listen to it.

716
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,980
When I read a good article,

717
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,580
I want to ask you

718
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,820
what you think of it.

719
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,820
Not the real you,

720
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,580
but the one

721
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,180
deep in your heart.

722
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,780
I don't want to bother you,

723
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,940
so I've been hiding my feelings for you

724
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,380
deep in my heart.

725
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,660
Over the three years,

726
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,020
each time I was mistaken for your boyfriend,

727
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,140
I'd be happy all day.

728
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,740
Why have you never said such words to me?

729
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,580
Because it's great to like
someone with your heart.

730
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,420
You're there,

731
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,420
so every effort I make and

732
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,620
every wish I have

733
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,100
are more meaningful.

734
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:53,980
Dylan.

735
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,660
Thank you very much.

736
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,100
Without you and your help,

737
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,780
I couldn't be living as Elaine.

738
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,780
It's great to have someone

739
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,380
who keeps me company
and cares for me quietly.

740
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,140
But…

741
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,620
I'm really not…

742
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,340
Jiaxin,

743
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,940
don't misunderstand.

744
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,900
I said those words
not to give pressure to you

745
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,380
or let you make any decision.

746
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,340
As I said,

747
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,940
this is my souvenir.

748
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,820
A souvenir of the three years

749
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,060
when I couldn't say what I want to say
and had to be cautious.

750
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,540
But

751
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,140
from today on,

752
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,660
you have to be careful.

753
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,500
From today on,

754
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,900
there are some words
I don't want to hide in my heart.

755
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,940
I won't suppress my feelings for you

756
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,460
or keep my social distance.

757
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,180
I'll stop being an observer
of you and another man.

758
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,300
Jiaxin,

759
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,740
get ready for my chasing.

760
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,020
We're developing Heritage soap
with essential oil

761
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,820
with Xiazhilu, a famous essential oil
manufacturer in Europe.

762
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,140
Now we've achieved initial results.

763
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,540
But they hope you can go there

764
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,780
for face-to-face communication

765
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,860
and they want to talk about
how to put products on the market.

766
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:39,900
Hmm.

767
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,540
It's easy to go on a business trip,

768
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,220
but they're headquartered in Budapest.

769
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,580
If you fly there,

770
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,780
you'll miss

771
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,460
the opening party for Anna's dance studio.

772
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,100
If they clash,

773
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,780
ask Zhengren to talk with them first.

774
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,060
Okay. I'll get it arranged.

775
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,660
(Dear Anna, Your performance is drawing near.
I'm sending my sincere blessing from afar.)

776
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,460
It still doesn't work.

777
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,180
Shi Anna,

778
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,820
give it up completely.

779
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,740
How do you like it?

780
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,860
Does this candlelight dinner

781
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,700
make you feel

782
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,780
you're being deeply loved?

783
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,460
The fast, thoughtful service
of that deliveryman

784
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,180
really makes me feel good.

785
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,100
I'll give him a five-star high praise.

786
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,100
Please don't just complain.

787
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,820
The packaging is simple and rough,

788
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,700
but I made this cake myself.

789
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,500
Have a taste.

790
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,420
No!

791
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,940
I didn't ask any question.
Why are you saying no?

792
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
Alas. What is it?

793
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,100
Wow. It's shining.

794
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,500
How do you like it?

795
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,260
You don't have the heart to say no
to such a creative proposal, right?

796
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,020
Creative?

797
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,700
I saw it a long time ago on TV.

798
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,140
It's cheap and outdated.

799
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,420
How dare you say it's creative?

800
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,820
My answer is

801
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,540
no!

802
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,420
Well.

803
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,020
Won't you think about it?

804
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,380
Generally, when the hero
of a TV series does this,

805
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,180
the heroine will be so moved as to shed tears

806
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,780
and agree to marry him.

807
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,180
Besides, it's been three years
since we got to know each other.

808
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,540
We've been together for three years, honey.

809
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,740
Go to the bathroom
and look at yourself in the mirror.

810
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,700
Tell me

811
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,860
what makes you think

812
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,660
you're like a hero.

813
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,980
You only propose

814
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,580
once in life,

815
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,620
but you made it cheap and outdated.

816
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,020
A honeymoon in Europe
and a wedding on an island.

817
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,740
That's what I dream of.

818
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,580
You don't care about me at all.

819
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,540
This is not the marriage I want.

820
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,780
So, my answer is

821
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,460
no, no, no!

822
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,380
Let's calm down and be practical.

823
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,980
In my opinion,

824
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,060
we should spend money where it counts most.

825
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,980
After we get married, we need to buy a house.

826
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:06,740
In the future,

827
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,260
we need to decorate our house
and pay for our kid's education.

828
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,780
Compared with wasting money

829
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,020
on vanity projects,

830
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:12,780
we'd better save them

831
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,460
to improve our quality of life.

832
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,020
Besides,

833
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,940
no matter how wonderful the wedding is,

834
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,420
it only lasts one night.

835
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,380
Don't overemphasize it.

836
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,580
First, it's not about face saving,

837
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,300
but about the value of my life.

838
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,620
The most important moment
in a woman's life is her wedding.

839
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,220
I don't want others to say that

840
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,540
my wedding is like a sale
or special promotion.

841
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,860
I don't want to rough it.

842
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,460
Nobody says it's a sale.

843
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,300
Can you stop puffing yourself up
at your own cost?

844
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,140
Living a happy life

845
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,700
is better than those
unrealistic expectations.

846
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,340
Anyway, give me an answer.

847
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,220
Will you marry me or not?

848
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,540
You even wouldn't plan a wedding I want.

849
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,220
What else can I expect from this marriage?

850
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:46,900
You'd better

851
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,020
find a practical girl to be your wife.

852
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,860
For me, it's impossible.

853
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:50,700
Well.

854
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:51,660
Honey.

855
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,460
Hey.

856
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,620
Qiqi.

857
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,620
The essential oil company
has developed four kinds of oil:

858
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,180
rose, lavender,

859
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,500
orange blossom and borage.

860
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,060
According to market research,

861
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,100
rose and lavender oil are the most popular.

862
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,860
I read a report that

863
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,620
borage oil is good for sensitive skin

864
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,820
because it's soothing and bacteriostatic.

865
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,260
I think it fits the corporate image

866
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,980
as a warm-hearted and reassuring company.

867
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,460
Tell Zhengren

868
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,380
to recommend borage oil

869
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,140
as the featured product during negotiations.

870
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,420
What's wrong?

871
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,060
I…

872
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,020
I'm a little embarrassed to mention that.

873
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,380
Go ahead.

874
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,220
I want a salary raise
("salary raise" pronounces "Jia Xin" in Chinese)!

875
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,500
What did you say?

876
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,980
I want a salary raise!

877
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,820
You want Jiaxin?

878
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,140
Yes.

879
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,740
You want Chen Jiaxin?
