(Episode 18)

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
Happy Birthday, Xiyi!

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,360
What else do you want

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,960
for your birthday?

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,840
I may say yes to anything.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,960
Are you willing to celebrate my birthday

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,400
every year in here with me?

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,560
I am!

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,280
Birthday boy!

36
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,800
Look over here! Over here!

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,120
Three.

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,880
Two.

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,680
One.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,760
She'll be back soon.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,760
Then...

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,040
Alright.

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,680
That's all for today's class.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Remember to practice the
movements you learned today.

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,960
See you next time.

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,160
What were you saying?

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,600
Nothing.

48
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,120
Jiaxin.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't be with you

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,600
on your birthday this year.

51
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,560
Sorry.

52
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,680
It's all right.

53
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,840
I still have work to do.

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,920
Let me send you home first.

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,560
I can go home by myself.

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,000
Then be safe.

57
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,480
We can talk more

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
after I get back.

59
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,480
Okay.

60
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,760
Jiaxin.

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,880
Are you free right now?

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,840
Why do you want

63
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,760
to meet in such a special place like this?

64
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,080
Every small wooden tablet here

65
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,440
represents a wish.

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,840
Since you are so powerful,

67
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,960
do you really need to make a
wish to make things happen?

68
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,360
I will go find my sister abroad soon.

69
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,480
I need some luck.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,320
And so do you.

71
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,600
Me?

72
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,280
Yes.

73
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,720
Here you go.

74
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,080
You found it?

75
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,400
Thank you!

76
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,460
(Pen collector Gu Yitian's
exclusive interview)

77
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,120
Gu Yitian?

78
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,760
Where is he?

79
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,760
What's the price?

80
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,360
I've talked to this collector.

81
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,400
But he's such a tough nut.

82
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,840
He asked for 100,000 right away.

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,800
Or, he wouldn't even consider it.

84
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,280
Even so, it's hard to say

85
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
if he'll sell it.

86
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,240
100,000?

87
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,320
So expensive!

88
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,040
Actually, money is not a problem.

89
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,360
I can lend it to you.

90
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,240
Or,

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,360
you can borrow it from your grandma.

92
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,520
It's something I want to buy,

93
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,080
so I'll save the money on my own.

94
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,920
But if it took you too long,

95
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,400
you might miss Wang Xiyi's
birthday to give it to him.

96
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,600
I still have some time.

97
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,200
I'll figure out a way.

98
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,360
Okay.

99
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,600
Now, let's make a wish.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,400
Alright.

101
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,160
There you go.

102
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,520
Thank you.

103
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,660
(I want...
Prayer:)

104
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,620
(All requests will be granted.
Pray)

105
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,080
How about...

106
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,080
How about I make a wish for you?

107
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,240
Hope

108
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,240
you and your sister will reunite soon.

109
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,360
If we make the same wish,

110
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,480
there'll be greater chance
for your wish to come true!

111
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,600
Never mind.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,080
You can save that wish for yourself.

113
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,120
But, if you really want to help,

114
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,600
there's one thing you can do for me.

115
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,280
What is it?

116
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,160
Entrust me with a solo agency for your work.

117
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,920
You

118
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,520
want to be my agent?

119
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,080
Are you kidding me?

120
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,160
Your work makes people feel warm

121
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
and happy.

122
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,520
Your artistic talent is very rare.

123
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,160
Trust me.

124
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,960
I want to be your agent,

125
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,560
not because I'm your friend,

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,760
but because I believe that

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,200
you'll make big money for me in the future.

128
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,000
Then, congratulations!

129
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,280
Your first wish

130
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,040
has already come true!

131
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,120
I want to

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,080
live a happy life

133
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,800
with Ximi

134
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
and Ximi's dad!

135
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,500
(I want to live a happy life with Ximi
and Ximi's dad! Prayer: Chen Jiaxin)

136
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,640
You've got to check carefully.

137
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,720
Especially the details.

138
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,160
Okay, meeting's over.

139
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Mr. Yi! Mr. Yi!

140
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,800
Come here.

141
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,280
What is it?

142
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,760
Come here!

143
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:41,920
Look.

144
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,200
Dylan just posted something on Weibo.

145
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,840
You said Chen Jiaxin went back on herself.

146
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,160
She actually met that art dealer again...

147
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,800
Will you stop being so gossipy?

148
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Don't ruin my good mood today.

149
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,440
And,

150
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,400
you need to work this weekend

151
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
and complete this for me.

152
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,040
Huh?

153
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,440
What?

154
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,480
Any problem?

155
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,320
Yes.

156
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,160
Leave is not allowed unless
for a wedding or funeral.

157
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,840
But, I have a date!

158
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,360
I'll go watch a movie with
my girlfriend this weekend.

159
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,560
You are dating someone? No way.

160
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,120
You didn't post any moments
and there was no PDA.

161
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,960
Because I blocked you!

162
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,720
You blocked me?

163
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,240
Yes.

164
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,520
Why did you do that?

165
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,160
Who are you dating?

166
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,760
Actually, you know her.

167
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,720
She is...

168
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,960
Liu Siqi.

169
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,160
Liu Siqi?

170
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,520
The roommate climbed out of hell?

171
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:21,920
Yep.

172
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,400
The No. 1 rule for employees
is not to cheat the boss.

173
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:24,960
This time I'll let you go.

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,800
But I still seriously doubt your excuse.

175
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,200
I swear to God that I'm telling the truth!

176
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,880
Then, lightning round, set, go! Her
birthday, horoscope sign, blood type!

177
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,480
Capricorn, January 13, type O!

178
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:32,920
What's her favorite food?

179
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,440
Spicy hotpot!

180
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,200
Her perfume and shoe size?

181
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,120
Dior. 38.

182
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,960
You even know such private questions?

183
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,600
See, I knew you wouldn't believe me.

184
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,200
But this is how idol drama goes.

185
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,320
As the saying goes, "no discord, no concord,"

186
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,760
"Out of blows love grows."

187
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,120
Right?

188
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,560
The two look like enemies

189
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,960
most likely fall in love

190
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,600
with each other in the end.

191
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,840
Just like

192
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,640
some guy and some girl, right?

193
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,640
What some guy and some girl?

194
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm not that guy anyway.

195
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,480
And we are not in an idol drama.

196
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,560
Snail!

197
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,600
Jiaxin?!

198
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,000
I...

199
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,400
Get it done

200
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,120
by Tuesday!

201
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,480
Thank you, boss!

202
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,200
I'm back!

203
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,440
You are back!

204
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,760
Yes.

205
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,760
Did you buy the stuff I asked?

206
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,240
Of course, I did!

207
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,440
And, look at this.

208
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,520
What do you think?

209
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,240
What's this?

210
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,920
When you buy my company's
new product Seeyoung shampoo,

211
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,600
you'll get this for free!

212
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,880
And it's not for sale!

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,800
Cute, isn't it?

214
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,640
You bought your company's shampoo

215
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,560
for this throw pillow?

216
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,520
That's not the reason why I bought it.

217
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,040
You know what?

218
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,640
This shampoo

219
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,240
is silicone oil & sulfate free.

220
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,080
It's all natural and won't harm your hair.

221
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,360
Though it sounds like advertising,

222
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,600
it's all truth.

223
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,720
Besides, this is also

224
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,160
a scalp-care shampoo. Super amazing!

225
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,440
I also bought this for you.

226
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,120
Don't always drink coffee.

227
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,880
You'll have a hard time
to fall asleep. Drink this.

228
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,320
Who gave you the right to decide for me?

229
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,480
Forget it.

230
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,720
For the sake of the milk tea,

231
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,680
I'll forgive you!

232
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,040
Then how about this?

233
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,480
Let's go watch a movie this weekend.

234
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,360
I heard a Chinese sci-fi movie

235
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,160
was quite good!

236
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,440
I can't!

237
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,720
I have to work this weekend!

238
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,000
It's a very important case.

239
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:32,880
Work?

240
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,080
It's yours.

241
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,800
This one, too.

242
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,280
Yours.

243
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,680
From this angle,

244
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,280
she looks so attractive!

245
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,640
Oh, by the way,

246
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,640
I've

247
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,840
told Mr. Yi

248
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,160
that we are dating.

249
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,720
Why did you tell him?

250
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,040
It's none of his business!

251
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,920
You don't know him as well as I do.

252
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,680
He's a workaholic.

253
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,920
If I didn't tell him I have a girlfriend,

254
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,480
he'd ask me to work on
the weekend all the time.

255
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,680
As someone who always screws around and just

256
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,640
spent his birthday with his ex-girlfriend,

257
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,280
he has no right to
interfere your private life!

258
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
How did you know he would spend
his birthday with Anna?

259
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Jiaxin told me.

260
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,800
Will you tell Wang Xiyi

261
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
that I'll always

262
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,760
keep an eye on him!

263
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,600
If he dares to hurt Chen Jiaxin,

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
I'll make him pay big time!

265
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,600
But, think about it.

266
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,000
From your point of view,

267
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,760
you may think Anna is the other woman.

268
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,640
But if you put yourself in her shoes,

269
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,520
you'd see she doesn't do anything wrong.

270
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,440
She doesn't even know

271
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,040
Snail's existence.

272
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,960
Then Mr. Yi should explain to her.

273
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,240
How?

274
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,720
Send her a WeChat message

275
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,720
and say,

276
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,040
"Sorry, I got married by accident!

277
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,280
Sorry, my wife got pregnant by accident!"

278
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,200
You think Anna can accept that?

279
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:09,920
In addition,

280
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,880
she finally stepped on a world stage,

281
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,240
such shocking news

282
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,800
would literally kill her if she heard it!

283
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,080
That's why

284
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,400
Mr. Yi couldn't say no

285
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,720
when Anna said she'd come back

286
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,720
to celebrate his birthday.

287
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,600
If he refused,

288
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,960
Anna would get suspicious.

289
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,720
But,

290
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,320
even though Wang Xiyi had his reasons,

291
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,360
and his ex-girlfriend is quite pitiful,

292
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,400
Chen Jiaxin is still the most innocent one!

293
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,040
Jiaxin and Xiyi are legitimately married.

294
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,640
Their marriage is protected by the law.

295
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,480
No one can sabotage that.

296
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,240
Nobody is going to sabotage their marriage.

297
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,520
Mr. Yi even asked me yesterday

298
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,400
to enquire you what Jiaxin likes,

299
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,760
so that he can surprise her on her birthday.

300
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,280
Are you serious?

301
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,800
Yes.

302
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,720
Back then, rarely did people
wear this when getting married.

303
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
Your father went to Shanghai,

304
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,960
found a jewelry store

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,560
and made this for me specially.

306
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,120
I blamed him afterwards for wasting money,

307
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,560
yet he said

308
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
that he could also

309
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,480
leave it for his future
daughter or daughter-in-law.

310
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,440
Sorry.

311
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,680
I have to send you guys to
somewhere else for a while.

312
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,480
But I promise I'll get you back A.S.A.P.

313
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,400
Hello? Dylan.

314
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,720
Would you please take me
to meet that collector?

315
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,520
This way.

316
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,120
For buying Wang Xiyi a birthday gift,

317
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,160
I can't believe you will...

318
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,040
I know it sounds crazy.

319
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,160
But like you said,

320
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,400
if I missed this time,

321
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,360
I might never get another chance

322
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,640
to celebrate his birthday.

323
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,800
So

324
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,960
I want to help him to make
his wish come true.

325
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,760
Let's go.

326
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,680
Hi,

327
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,360
you must be

328
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,920
Mr. Gu Yitian, right?

329
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,600
Chairman Hua of Shanghai
Collection Association

330
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,840
might have told you about me.

331
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,320
I am...

332
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,920
Say no more!

333
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,440
I know who you are.

334
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,000
If you didn't go to Chairman Hua

335
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,280
and asked him to speak for you,

336
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,240
I would never meet

337
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,640
an art dealer like you!

338
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,360
Come in.

339
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,000
Take off your shoes!

340
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,520
Nowadays, people

341
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,160
seldom write with a pen.

342
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Who would

343
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,640
be so keen on finding a
precious pen like this?

344
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,000
However,

345
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,640
that's exactly why this pen is so precious.

346
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,800
Okay?

347
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,400
You've seen it?

348
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,400
Yes?

349
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,920
You can go back now!

350
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,720
Mr. Gu,

351
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
did Chairman Hua tell you

352
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,720
that we'd be here to buy this pen?

353
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,640
Buy it?

354
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,640
With what?

355
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,280
You said

356
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
100,000 Yuan, right?

357
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,640
I brought the money.

358
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,520
You mean

359
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,000
my pen is only worth 100,000 Yuan?

360
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,600
As long as you are willing to sell,

361
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,640
we can talk about the price.

362
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,360
I really abhor art dealers like you!

363
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,640
You know nothing but money!

364
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,960
I have nothing more to say.

365
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,600
Please leave!

366
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,120
Mr. Gu!

367
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,400
What...

368
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
What else do you want?

369
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,600
Alright.

370
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,200
Use your story to impress me.

371
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,640
Story?

372
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,280
Yes.

373
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,400
If you want me to give you my precious item,

374
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,920
I'll do it

375
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,960
as long as your story can touch me.

376
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,080
Otherwise, no way.

377
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,680
This pen

378
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,640
holds my husband's childhood memory.

379
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,160
So,

380
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,200
I want to buy it

381
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,000
and give it to him as a birthday gift.

382
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,160
That's it?

383
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,720
Miss, your story is so dull and boring!

384
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,240
It's not worthy of my pen!

385
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,720
Just go back!

386
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,400
Mr. Gu.

387
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,360
Are you interested in any art items?

388
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,680
Maybe I can help you.

389
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,120
I just don't get it!

390
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,920
You didn't hear me or you didn't

391
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,080
understand my words?

392
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,400
Get out of here!

393
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,360
Please.

394
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,120
How am I supposed to
impress him with a story?

395
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,080
Should I

396
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,600
make up a story?

397
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,360
This Mr. Gu is quite weird.

398
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,160
I think he just didn't want to sell

399
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,560
so he made up an excuse

400
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,720
to send us away.

401
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,920
Jiaxin,

402
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,920
don't be disappointed.

403
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,840
I'll try to find some other collectors

404
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,840
and see if they have this pen.

405
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,440
Maybe we still have a chance.

406
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,480
But,

407
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,240
I'll fly to Europe tonight.

408
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,600
You need to wait till I'm back.

409
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,400
Okay.

410
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,800
Thank you!

411
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,000
And hope you will find your sister.

412
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,040
Chen Jiaxin! Be strong!

413
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,880
You've got

414
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,600
to try it

415
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,960
over and over.

416
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,840
Things will look up eventually.

417
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,280
Mr. Gu!

418
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,160
Why are you still here?

419
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,480
Mr. Gu,

420
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
this pen is very important to me.

421
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,760
Please sell it to me.

422
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,280
Would you please consider it again?

423
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,720
Xiyi,

424
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,560
Siqi asked me to stay in her house today,

425
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,120
so I won't go home tonight.

426
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,240
Mr. Gu.

427
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,000
Miss, please stop

428
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,200
following me!

429
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,920
I'll get angry if you keep doing this!

430
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,200
I...

431
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,600
Mr. Gu!

432
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,000
Morning, Mr. Gu!

433
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,200
You are still here?

434
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,240
You got up so early to go for a run.

435
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,160
Have you had breakfast?

436
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,200
Let me

437
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,760
buy you some breakfast, okay?

438
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,240
You see...

439
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,680
Mr. Gu!

440
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,880
Mr. Gu!

441
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,760
Mr. Gu!

442
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,160
Mr. Gu! Please think about it again, okay?

443
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,320
Mr. Gu!

444
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,120
Mr. Gu!

445
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,720
Mr. Gu!

446
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,240
Mr. Gu!

447
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,360
I can't get rid of you, can I?

448
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,400
Mr. Gu, please dry your sweat.

449
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,120
My... My story...

450
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,480
Thank you!

451
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,600
Most of people think

452
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,400
that I'm just an antique collector,

453
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,760
but actually the stories behind
the antiques fascinate me the most.

454
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,920
The antiques are valuable and everlasting

455
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,400
because they all have

456
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,240
their own moving stories.

457
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,080
Miss, there's nothing
special about your story.

458
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,040
Just forget about it.

459
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,760
Mr. Gu.

460
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,840
Mr. Gu, please listen to me!

461
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,880
As an

462
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,560
experienced collector like you,

463
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,680
you may think my story is too ordinary.

464
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,440
But, to me,

465
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,720
without these stories,

466
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,560
I'd be like the priced collectibles

467
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,080
you talked about

468
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,880
and only be defined by the secular world.

469
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,240
Mr. Gu.

470
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,800
"I won't keep you by my side.

471
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,880
I'll only be your No. 1 fan,

472
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,120
who cheers for you from afar!

473
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,200
Since you've found your own stage,

474
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,920
then be brave and go for it!"

475
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,360
Xiyi, you know,

476
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,720
I've been working

477
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,040
so hard these years,

478
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,680
not because I'm a brave girl,

479
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,040
but because I know

480
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,120
you've always had my back

481
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,000
and made me strong.

482
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,160
After the show is over,

483
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,160
I only want to go back to you.

484
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,760
Cause being with you will be

485
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,680
my last and forever stage.

486
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,080
It's time for rehearsal.

487
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,800
Anna, no matter what,

488
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,280
I'm very glad meeting you.

489
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,360
Hope you'll find your brother soon.

490
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,120
I believe that your sister

491
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,200
is also trying very hard to find you.

492
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,160
You are such a great brother!

493
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,560
Hope she's not

494
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,280
trying too hard.

495
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,840
I mean I hope she won't be like us,

496
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,960
always getting disappointed
after holding out high hope.

497
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,320
This is the ticket for "Paris
Opera Ballet: Swan Lake."

498
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,760
I was going to go with you tonight.

499
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,680
Though we aren't siblings,
I still want to give it to you.

500
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,080
By the way,

501
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,240
the lead ballerina is the first Asian girl

502
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,200
performs in the Paris Opera house.

503
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,960
Her name is also Anna.

504
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,240
I'm sorry I can't go.

505
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,080
I have to get back to Shanghai.

506
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,680
But I'm happy that we are friends now.
I'll contact you later.

507
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,360
Okay.

508
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:16,880
I'm leaving.

509
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,360
Alright.

510
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:17,960
Bye.

511
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,280
Xiyi,

512
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,960
I cooked braised ribs noodles for you today.

513
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,720
I fried the noodles in case
they'll get soggy in the soup.

514
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,040
What happened to your finger?

515
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,280
Oh.

516
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
It's nothing.

517
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,720
Alright.

518
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

519
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,000
I bet it'll taste really good!

520
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,080
Don't forget to eat it.

521
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,080
I put something else in there, too.

522
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Remember to eat it carefully.

523
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,400
Hey, birthday girl, I'm free this afternoon.

524
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,800
Would you like to have dinner together?

525
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,760
You don't have to work today?

526
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,240
Thanks to you,

527
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,920
Mr. Yi asked me to come to Cheng Jie

528
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,040
and celebrate your birthday.

529
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,280
You are so sweet!

530
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,600
Hold on,

531
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,080
Dylan is calling me.

532
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,640
You said he just arrived in Shanghai today.

533
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,720
He's calling you right after he landed.

534
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,880
Hey, Chen Jiaxin,

535
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,320
I think I underestimated you!

536
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,200
What are you talking about?

537
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,320
Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

538
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,640
Hey, why don't you ask him

539
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,120
to join us for dinner?

540
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,560
Or, you guys can date till next morning!

541
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,760
I don't mind you standing me up.

542
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,920
Nonsense!

543
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm hanging up!

544
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,440
So cute!

545
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,560
Are you crazy?!

546
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,840
Can't you just act like a normal person

547
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,520
instead of a scary ghost?

548
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,280
I scared you? I think you
are just being nervous!

549
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,840
You looked so happy. Who did you talk to?

550
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,360
Jiaxin.

551
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,000
Since Wang Xiyi will meet Anna,

552
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,760
I hope Dylan will do everything he can

553
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,200
to take Jiaxin away,

554
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,640
and I'm willing to help him!

555
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,520
What help him?

556
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,720
Jiaxin has a husband,

557
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,640
and Dylan is trying to approach Jiaxin.

558
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,960
You should have some moral sense

559
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,920
and stop Jiaxin from celebrating
her birthday with him.

560
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,280
How can you encourage and
support this kinda behavior?

561
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,280
You said that their marriage
was protected by the law.

562
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,400
This is apparently double standard!

563
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,560
Wang Xiyi is the one
should feel guilty, okay?

564
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,080
The divorce agreement is still there.

565
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,960
If this divine marriage

566
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,440
is premised on divorce,

567
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,680
Jiaxin of course has right to
pursue her own happiness!

568
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,040
Okay!

569
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,240
She's already wasted

570
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,440
part of her life for Wang Xiyi.

571
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,120
If she misses a good man like Dylan,

572
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,360
who knows how long she'll wait
till another good man shows up?

573
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,840
But... But...

574
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,640
you've promised Mr. Yi

575
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,880
that you'd celebrate
Chen Jiaxin's birthday with her.

576
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,920
You should honor your promise.

577
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,400
Don't you have a principle?

578
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,360
Of course!

579
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,160
My principle is

580
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,400
that Jiaxin must be happy!

581
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,920
If you wanna stand up for Wang Xiyi,

582
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,880
alright,

583
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,360
ask him not to meet Anna!

584
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,680
Let me tell you,

585
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,600
he should cherish

586
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,040
a woman like Jiaxin

587
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,720
who always puts family

588
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,200
and her husband first! Got it?

589
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,200
Stupid!

590
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,360
Ouch!

591
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,880
Ouch!

592
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,160
No one would care about you! You know?

593
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,120
Her thin leg is surprisingly strong!

594
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,480
Mr. Yi.

595
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,400
Please take a look.

596
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,560
This is the formula adjustment
plan that Zhengren suggests

597
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,200
to the European version of Heritage series.

598
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,200
I'll get back to you today.

599
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,200
Please heat up my lunch for me.

600
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,760
Oh,

601
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,480
by the way.

602
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:51,960
What?

603
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,280
How is it going with the
thing I asked about Jiaxin?

604
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:54,960
Uh-oh!

605
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,240
I forgot!

606
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,040
You forgot?

607
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,560
Yes.

608
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,520
I already feel sorry that I can't
be with her on her birthday.

609
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,720
And now I don't even have a gift for her!

610
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,640
Now, call your

611
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,240
girlfriend right away and ask her

612
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,680
to keep Jiaxin's company.

613
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,400
And,

614
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,920
postpone my meeting to 4:00 p.m.

615
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,080
Stop... Stop calling.

616
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,840
Maybe Jiaxin is talking with
Dylan on the phone right now.

617
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,040
It's not convenient for her.

618
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,600
Where's your girlfriend?

619
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,680
I asked her to keep Jiaxin's company.

620
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,000
Don't rely on her too much.

621
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,360
She has no principle at all!

622
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,760
Maybe she's already on Dylan's side

623
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,480
and trying to bring Jiaxin
and Dylan together.

624
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,800
But, come to think of it,

625
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,080
if Dylan really likes Snail,

626
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,280
it's unnecessarily a bad thing.

627
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
In that case, after the baby is born,

628
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,600
Snail won't bug you anymore.

629
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:29,960
Right?

630
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,360
You...

631
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,240
I'll go heat up your lunch.

632
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,600
Don't bother.

633
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,200
What's wrong?

634
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,320
I don't wanna eat.

635
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,080
Then...

636
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,600
Huh?

637
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,840
What's this?

638
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,680
It must be chopsticks and stuff.

639
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,160
You can take the lunch.

640
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,440
Oh, thanks,

641
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,960
since you are not eating...

642
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,600
Hello? Jiaxin.

643
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,040
He sold it to you?

644
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,440
You really made up a story?

645
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,920
I didn't.

646
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,320
I'll tell you when we meet.

647
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,640
Alright then.

648
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,360
I'll wait for you.

649
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,480
Mr. Di, someone has been

650
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,800
waiting for you for a long time.

651
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,720
Okay. Thanks!

652
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,440
Mr. Yi.

653
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,160
How may I help you?

654
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Seems like you still haven't
learned your lesson from

655
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,080
the accident with grandma and Jiaxin.

656
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,600
Otherwise, you wouldn't stop bothering her.

657
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,640
Don't you know that she's my...

658
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,320
Your wife, right?

659
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,200
I think it should be more accurate to say

660
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,920
that she's a single woman who
already signed the divorce agreement

661
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,200
and is about to become your ex-wife.

662
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,720
How did you know that?

663
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,720
Who told you that?

664
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:45,960
What?

665
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,160
You feel ashamed about this, Mr. Yi?

666
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,520
You don't want others to know?

667
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,480
No one would know

668
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,680
what will happen in the future.

669
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,480
But at least for now,

670
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,680
Jiaxin is still my wife.

671
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,120
Chen Jiaxin is a very cute, simple-minded,

672
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,440
and trusting person.

673
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,120
Every little help she gets from others,

674
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,880
she would return the
favor with all her heart.

675
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,760
I won't allow anybody to hurt

676
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,560
such a kind and nice Jiaxin!

677
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,760
She is kind and nice.

678
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
All she wants

679
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,760
is a happy family.

680
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,080
Ever since she got married with you,

681
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,360
she has put all her focus
on you and your family.

682
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,400
Except grandma,

683
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,320
even aunt and Zhengren
have changed because of her.

684
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,680
But have you

685
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,280
ever felt grateful for her?

686
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,840
Turns out

687
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,240
you are the one who hurts her the most.

688
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
So why do you think you have the right

689
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,960
to stand up for her?

690
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,240
You have no idea what happened
between Jiaxin and me.

691
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,520
So you can stop judging.

692
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,960
I do know

693
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,760
that her husband is abandoning her

694
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,360
on her birthday to be with his ex-girlfriend!

695
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,960
I have to!

696
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,200
And I've talked to Jiaxin.

697
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,160
She didn't mind.

698
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,920
With her personality,

699
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,920
she would only bear all the pain on her own.

700
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,200
She certainly wouldn't stop you from going!

701
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,080
Moreover,

702
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,600
she pawned all her dowry

703
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,000
to buy you a birthday gift.

704
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,960
What have you ever done for her?

705
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
Who did she pawn it to?

706
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,200
What?

707
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,280
Wanna get a free answer from me

708
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,760
and redeem it back for Jiaxin?

709
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,640
You think being a hero is that easy?

710
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,160
You don't have to

711
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,280
buy anything for her birthday.

712
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,080
Because you don't know at all

713
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,200
what she wants!

714
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,000
It's one thing to know it,

715
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,440
but quite another to make it come true.

716
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,920
If you had a way,

717
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,480
you wouldn't bother humiliating me.

718
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,440
Dylan,

719
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,400
looks like you are not

720
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,560
the most important one in Jiaxin's heart.

721
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,200
It doesn't matter what I said

722
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,520
or what Jiaxin wants.

723
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,440
What matters is,

724
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,760
have you thought about
why you came here today?

725
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,040
Between us, who's the one that gets jealous?

726
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,960
Aunt.

727
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,120
Aunt.

728
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,720
Hi, aunt.

729
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,120
Yes?

730
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,280
Your mail.

731
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,280
What did you buy? So heavy.

732
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,800
Oh, face mask.

733
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,000
It finally arrived! Great!

734
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Why did you order takeout?

735
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,400
Well,

736
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,960
you two will celebrate birthday today.

737
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,440
Grandma said you must have had a plan,

738
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,680
so she went to her friend's

739
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,840
and gave me one day off.

740
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,000
You know what?

741
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,840
Ordering takeout

742
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,760
and eating alone was so convenient.

743
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,360
Could you please let me taste the noodles?

744
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,560
Sure, go ahead!

745
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,880
Tastes good!

746
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,160
Doesn't it?

747
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
Very delicious.

748
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,160
Aunt.

749
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,640
Yes?

750
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,880
Where did you buy it?

751
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,080
Oh,

752
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,120
let me check the address.

753
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,480
Oh, here.

754
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,240
Not too far.

755
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,840
Only about two miles away.

756
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,840
Look yourself.

757
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,280
Jiaxin, you won't eat anymore?

758
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,000
Easy come, easy go.

759
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,800
Ma'am, are my noodles ready?

760
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,000
Yes, they are coming!

761
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,140
(Xishi Noodles)

762
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,600
Your tomato and egg
noodles. Your beef noodles.

763
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,440
Ma'am, are my noodles ready yet?

764
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,120
Soon! Very soon!

765
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,240
I've been waiting for mine for half an hour.

766
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,680
They'll be ready soon!

767
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,140
(Xishi Noodles)

768
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,800
Mom!

769
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,640
It's really you!

770
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,560
How did you find here?

771
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,040
My aunt ordered takeout.

772
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,200
I knew you cooked it the moment I smelled it.

773
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,520
Ma'am, are my noodles ready?

774
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,440
Oh, they are coming!

775
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,760
Look, the customers are waiting.

776
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,800
Give me a hand!

777
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,240
Oh.

778
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,040
Bring them to table 2 and table 4.

779
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,040
Here, your noodles.

780
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,600
Good.

781
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,560
Ma'am, your noodles are so tasty.

782
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,440
I'll come back a lot. Will
you give me a discount?

783
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,200
Sure! No problem.

784
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,240
Tastes good?

785
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,320
Mom, will you tell me now

786
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,720
what's going on?

787
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,240
Nothing's going on.

788
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,560
I just passed by here that day
when I was in Shanghai

789
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,560
and noticed this shop
was available for transfer,

790
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,160
so I took it.

791
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,120
So that's how

792
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,800
you came all the way here from
Huaniao Island to sell noodles?

793
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,480
I didn't come all the way
here just for selling noodles.

794
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,440
I've already moved here.

795
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,200
The owner of this shop

796
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,680
happened to have an apartment to rent,

797
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,400
so I took it, too.

798
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,200
I thought you hated Shanghai

799
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,200
for its crowdedness and loudness.

800
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,280
So why did you move here?

801
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,480
Mom,

802
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,120
be honest with me.

803
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,000
Did you move here

804
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,520
for me?

805
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,120
What are you talking about?

806
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,800
People change their minds.

807
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,440
If you can come to Shanghai, I can, too.

808
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,960
What? I can't live a life for myself?

809
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,720
I should always live for you?

810
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,080
Nothing can be done without determination.

811
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,040
Not everything is about you, okay?

812
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,600
I didn't mean that.

813
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Come on, stop worrying about me.

814
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,600
Let me ask you.

815
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,680
Today is your birthday.

816
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,480
Did Wang Xiyi and his grandma

817
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,040
do something for you?

818
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,120
Yes.

819
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,080
Grandma

820
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,320
gave me back the dowry you gave her.

821
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,360
Ms. Wang

822
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,240
is quite a sensible person.

823
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:49,920
Mom,

824
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,240
about the dowry...

825
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,960
The dowry of course belongs to you.

826
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,600
Remember,

827
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,400
no matter what kinda difficulties you have,

828
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,640
you still have me.

829
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,480
What about Xiyi?

830
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,760
How is he going to celebrate for you?

831
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,880
He is too busy.

832
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,840
But he asked Siqi

833
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,040
to be my company.

834
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,600
Would you

835
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,000
like to join us?

836
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,720
What? Are you kidding?

837
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,240
Why would I come

838
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,360
to you young people's birthday celebration?

839
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,520
Plus, I've been busy

840
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,520
with moving, running the noodle stand,

841
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,680
and organizing my room.

842
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,280
I'm so exhausted.

843
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,800
Just let me take some rest.

844
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,040
Where's your apartment?

845
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,280
Let me help you to organize it

846
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,000
and buy you some daily necessities.

847
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,240
Today is your birthday. Don't
worry about me anymore.

848
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,120
Just go and have some fun.

849
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,400
You always sacrifice for me

850
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,560
but never let me return anything back.

851
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,800
As long as you are happy,

852
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,440
it's the biggest return you can give me.

853
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,680
Here,

854
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,520
try the birthday noodles I cooked for you.

855
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,280
Thank you, mom!

856
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,120
Either Anna forgives me or not,

857
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,600
I can't keep Jiaxin and Ximi

858
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,880
a secret anymore.

859
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,400
Tasty?

860
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:00,920
Yes.

861
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,000
What's the flavor?

862
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,000
Tomato.

863
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,280
Ladies!

864
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,800
Where will you go to celebrate tonight?

865
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,120
It's too crowded outside.

866
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,960
I'd rather stay at home.

867
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,600
I also called Dylan to come over.

868
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,440
Hope you don't mind!

869
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,120
-Of course, not!
-I do!

870
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
Why do you mind?

871
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,640
The birthday girl gets
to call the shots today!

872
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,060
But...

873
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,680
But the problem is I've never got

874
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,920
to decide anything in this room!

875
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,280
Forget it!

876
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:24,840
Whatever!

877
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,200
I'll go to the bathroom!

878
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,640
Here I go!

879
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,560
You two

880
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,240
are really dating each other?

881
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,160
We are contract couple.

882
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,160
Our purpose is different.

883
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,480
The regular couples date for marriage.

884
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,840
We date for a show.

885
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,520
It's mostly about taking
pictures and posting moments,

886
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,240
so that our families and colleagues
will think we are dating.

887
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,480
That way, our relatives wouldn't
always urge us to get married.

888
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,200
If we have better choice,

889
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,920
we can start a new relationship.

890
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,800
When you are together long enough,

891
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,560
maybe one day

892
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,960
you'll fall in love with him.

893
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,320
Fall in love with him?

894
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:02,760
Yes.

895
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,040
Are you kidding?

896
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,720
I admit

897
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,880
that having someone share housework,

898
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,000
chat with me

899
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,040
and make me laugh

900
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,320
are quite nice,

901
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,280
but my feeling towards
him is just no hating him.

902
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,920
Not hating and falling in love someone

903
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,440
are totally different.

904
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,400
When you are in love,

905
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,000
when he approaches you,

906
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,120
you'll feel your heartbeats,

907
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,360
you'll feel like you are suffocated,

908
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,360
you have a hard time to breath,

909
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,280
and most importantly,

910
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,440
you wish the time could
freeze at that very moment.

911
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,960
But not hating someone,

912
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,520
just like Anson and me,

913
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,000
there's no passion or heartbeats,

914
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,160
instead, we fight

915
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,640
all the time. It's no fun.

916
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,520
No wonder you have mouth ulcer these days.

917
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,120
You bad-mouth me too much!

918
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
What's wrong with you?

919
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,000
You just have to act like a zombie, huh?

920
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,160
If I didn't,

921
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,680
how would I know you always
say bad things about me!

922
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,320
Forget it.

923
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,880
I'm happy today. I'll forgive you!

924
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,400
Hey, be honest.

925
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,920
Was Wang Xiyi touched big time

926
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,320
when he saw Jiaxin's gift for him?

927
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,240
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

928
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,360
Here's the thing.

929
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,200
He actually gave it to me.

930
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,920
And I'm sorry that I opened it.
