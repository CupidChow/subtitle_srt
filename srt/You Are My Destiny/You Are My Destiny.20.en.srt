25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,240
(Episode 20)

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,940
I should sleep on the couch.

27
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,900
So much time has passed

28
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,420
and you haven't made any progress.

29
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,420
Here. Lie down.

30
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,020
I'm the husband of an expectant mother.

31
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,060
Of course I should sleep beside her.

32
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,660
Why are you so nervous?

33
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,020
Relax your shoulder.

34
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,340
Relax your hands.

35
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,700
When you are nervous,

36
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,500
Ximi will feel uncomfortable.

37
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,900
Raise your head.

38
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,340
Chen Jiaxin.

39
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,020
This year's celebration for my birthday

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,260
feels more meaningful

41
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,140
and happier to me

42
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,380
than previous years' celebrations.

43
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,140
Where did my mother go early in the morning?

44
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,020
Mom.

45
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,860
Given your health condition, you shouldn't
have gone out to buy vegetables.

46
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,260
Let me carry them, Mom.

47
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,460
close the restaurant today.

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,380
Let me carry them.

49
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,300
No way.

50
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,900
I just came to Shanghai recently.

51
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,580
Do you want me to have
a source of income in Shanghai?

52
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,780
But you just recovered.

53
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,500
Maybe I should stay with you.

54
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,780
It's okay. If I need anything, I'll call you.

55
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,820
You're lying to me again.

56
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,860
Once I'm gone, you'll dive into a day's work.

57
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,740
I can help.

58
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,100
You?

59
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,220
Yeah.

60
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,140
Can you do it?

61
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,660
The noodles and green vegetables

62
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,220
aren't as obedient as your employees.

63
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,340
A lack of skill would result
in bad taste, you know?

64
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,620
Mom, Xiyi has work to do.

65
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,900
Forget about him. I can help you.

66
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,020
No matter how much money a man can make,

67
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,100
he needs to take care of his wife and children.
Otherwise, he wouldn't qualify as a man.

68
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,460
There's nothing wrong with getting
a permanent family member's help.

69
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,580
Since he wants to help, we
should give him a chance.

70
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,140
But...

71
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,860
Mom, I think I can do it.

72
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,260
The noodles and green vegetables

73
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,540
can't be more complicated than
the ROI rate and gross profit rate.

74
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,260
I can do it.

75
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,660

Can you do this?

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,340
His attitude has brought memories back.

102
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,100
Back in the day, I knew a man like him.

103
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,380
He said,

104
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,820
"A man who doesn't want
to support his wife and children

105
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,460
isn't worth being with."

106
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,900
Are you talking about dad?

107
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,780
I remember that dad's back figure

108
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,940
always reassured me when I was a child.

109
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,460
I told you not to load it fully.

110
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,820
But you insisted on acting tough.

111
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
(Xishi Noodles)

112
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,540
Here are your noodles.

113
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:04,700
Alright.

114
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,540
Hold on.

115
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,260
Why don't you finish your noodles?

116
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,380
I haven't finished my
homework yet. Got no time.

117
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,340
Let's make a deal, okay?

118
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,420
If you

119
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,660
finish the noodles,

120
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
I'll help you do your homework.

121
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,220
Deal.

122
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,620
Eat up.

123
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,020
Enjoy the noodles. I'll get back to work.

124
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,060
Come here.

125
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,420
Eat while there's no new customer.

126
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,340
I'll start eating then.

127
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,020
I'm telling you,

128
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,300
this bowl of noodles can't
compare with your usual dinner.

129
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,220
It's as simple as sunshine, air and water.

130
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,860
It can replenish your energy

131
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,140
when you need it the most.

132
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,140
It's like our Jiaxin.

133
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,340
Yeah.

134
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,900
The simplest and most important existence.

135
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,740
Now I can trust you with Jiaxin.

136
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,660
Thank you, Mom.

137
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,580
You must be tired after I ordered
you around for the whole day.

138
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,180
No, I'm not tired.

139
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,940
Finish the noodles and take Jiaxin home.

140
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,460
Yeah.

141
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,460
Do you want some?

142
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,380
Feel free to hold my hand.

143
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,020
You're as coy as a woman.

144
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,620
Who says I want to hold your hand?

145
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,500
When did I say that?

146
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,140
I...

147
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,140
I said you were cowardly.

148
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,500
But you didn't believe me.

149
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,540
Coward.

150
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,580
Who are you accusing of being cowardly?

151
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,700
The coward should know.

152
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,460
I...

153
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,300
Mister, there's popcorn on your head.

154
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,620
No need. Thanks. Eat it yourself.

155
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,180
Little lizard (Xiyi), I'm coming back.

156
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,260
It's such a long time.

157
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,020
I need you to bring something to her again.

158
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,740
Master, I just got off the plane.

159
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
You just can't wait to ask me to bring

160
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,220
your birthday gift for
grandma Zhenzhu to her.

161
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,700
I always had to make evidence

162
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,860
and tell her

163
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,860
I found the thing from a certain collector.

164
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,220
Don't you think

165
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,820
the receiver of the gift

166
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,420
not knowing the great trouble the giver

167
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,660
went through to make the gift

168
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,500
is a shame?

169
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,060
Actually, by giving her a gift,

170
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,100
I receive a gift from her.

171
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:18,980
Master,

172
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,860
I don't understand.

173
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,900
Every time

174
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
I make a gift for Zhenzhu,

175
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,660
I mold clay, shape it and fire it.

176
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,460
With every step I take,

177
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,260
I feel

178
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,900
her presence near me.

179
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,900
The feeling

180
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,780
is great.

181
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,380
That's the gift she gives me.

182
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,380
Only she

183
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,060
can inspire me this way

184
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,260
and give me the urge and passion

185
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,900
to create.

186
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:03,900
Alright.

187
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,860
On behalf of the oblivious person,

188
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,460
I'm giving the affectionate
person a small gift.

189
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,380
This color

190
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,380
was added by Zhenzhu.

191
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,220
The clay wasn't necessarily made by her.

192
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,420
I see you're really in love with her.

193
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,900
You can recognize her painting
on the clay pot. Awesome.

194
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,020
This clay pot

195
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,980
was made by Chen Jiaxin, whom
I mentioned to you earlier.

196
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,860
Look how interesting this is.

197
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,060
This little worm has scales.

198
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,780
It's not a worm.

199
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,580
It's a dragon as cowardly as a worm.

200
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,500
Grandma, worms are usually painted green.

201
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,820
Why do you paint it gold?

202
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,580
Gold is the color of dragons.

203
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,900
I hope this worm

204
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,900
will turn into a dragon someday.

205
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,980
I used to be friends with a
dragon as cowardly as a worm.

206
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,580
The dragon is named Zhongshan Long.

207
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,220
Zhongshan Long?

208
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,780
The master of pottery, Zhongshan Long?

209
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,380
Grandma, you know him?

210
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,660
I don't just know him.

211
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,540
I was quite close to him.

212
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,100
We were sent to the countryside together.

213
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,900
He could write and draw.
He was artistically talented.

214
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,700
After the National College Entrance
Examination was restored,

215
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,460
he finally got a chance to go abroad.

216
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,980
But he didn't want to leave that place

217
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,580
or leave me.

218
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,220
I scolded him,

219
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,060
"Hiding in the village,

220
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,660
you'll always be a timid worm.
You'll never be successful here.

221
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,220
I dare you to leave the mountain

222
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,340
and stand out among your
peers in the outside world."

223
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,100
So

224
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,420
the great woman behind Master Zhongshan Long

225
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,900
is you, grandma.

226
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,300
Pretty much.

227
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,420
But we haven't contacted
each other in a long time.

228
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,380
I'm not as cowardly as a worm.

229
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,500
I went abroad alone at age 23.

230
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,500
She promised to wait for me for 2 years.

231
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,580
But I came back after 3 years
and found her married.

232
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,740
Whose fault was it?

233
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,740
Whose fault was it?

234
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,540
Your love for her is deep.

235
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,460
You've remained single to this day.

236
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,140
She isn't the reason I've
been staying single.

237
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,220
I've grown used to solitude.

238
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,180
What's so bad about living alone?

239
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,420
Look how many things
I've done over the years.

240
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,020
This pot

241
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,540
may not be of high quality,

242
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,220
but its every detail

243
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,380
contains a story.

244
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,420
Yeah.

245
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,660
I've always believed Jiaxin
is artistically talented.

246
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,380
She is probably a future
artist waiting to be trained.

247
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,460
Having heard that from you,

248
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,020
I'm really interested

249
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,940
in meeting Zhenzhu's granddaughter-in-law.

250
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,060
Alright.

251
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,660
I've received a gift.

252
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,100
Now I need to give a gift.

253
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,580
Right?

254
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,540
What's the matter?

255
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,500
This place hurts a little.

256
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,860
I might have been injured yesterday.

257
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,420
Here.

258
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,300
Now I'm feeling much better.

259
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,460
And this place.

260
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,100
Sorry that you had to toil yesterday.

261
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,740
It's okay.

262
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,180
This place hurts too.

263
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,820
Here.

264
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,460
What's wrong?

265
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,220
I can't take it.

266
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,460
Go and get the ointment
plaster from auntie for me.

267
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,420
Okay. Wait for me.

268
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,820
Are you feeling better now?

269
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,140
How are you doing?
The ointment plaster is here.

270
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,020
Why are you naked?

271
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,980
Ximi's mother, I'm in so much pain.

272
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,460
I thought you said

273
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,180
you'd be there for me and I
wouldn't need to be afraid.

274
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,620
Yeah. You've got me.

275
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,420
I'm here.

276
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,300
Where do you need the plaster?

277
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,740
Stick the plaster anywhere you like.

278
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,860
So you don't like me.

279
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,580
No. I like every part of you.

280
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,100
You like me so much.

281
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,580
What's the matter?

282
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,100
It hurts.

283
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,220
Is there any problem with your waist?

284
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,820
There's nothing wrong with my waist.

285
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,500
My waist is perfectly fine. Look.

286
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,380
But you said this place hurt
and this place also hurt,

287
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,900
just like that place and this place.

288
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,580
Every part of me hurts.

289
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,300
Come here.

290
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,900
Stick the plaster to my body.

291
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,740
Stick all the remaining plasters to my body.

292
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,340
Let me go.

293
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,780
Xiyi.

294
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,180
Breakfast is ready. Come and eat.

295
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,420
Wait a second.

296
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,220
Tie my tie.

297
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,820
I can't do it.

298
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,980
You may teach me.

299
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,900
When I was little,

300
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,940
my mother taught me how to tie a tie.

301
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,660
She told me

302
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,500
my future wife

303
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,460
should be the person tying my tie.

304
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,860
Nobody else should tie my tie.

305
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,660
Otherwise, our relationship
would be damaged.

306
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,900
So,

307
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,180
this important job

308
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,500
will be yours

309
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,100
in the future.

310
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,700
From now on,

311
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,020
it'll be your biggest mission

312
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,820
for every morning.

313
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,060
(Anna)
I'll arrive the day after tomorrow.

314
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,340
I'm going to eat breakfast.

315
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,660
Chen Jiaxin.

316
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,460
Don't worry about me.

317
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
I just think

318
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,620
a person has been hurt because of me.

319
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,140
And that person is perfect

320
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,660
and considerate.

321
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,740
Jiaxin,

322
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,820
listen to me.

323
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,140
You haven't hurt anyone.

324
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,820
If Anna feels hurt,

325
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,260
it's due to my hesitation.

326
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,020
I admit

327
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,860
that I can't keep hurt

328
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,500
and sorrow from Anna.

329
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,860
I can't give her

330
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,780
the answer she wants.

331
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:03,980
Jiaxin,

332
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,060
I'll do my best to minimize the
negative impact on Anna's feelings.

333
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,740
Trust me, okay?

334
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,060
I trust you.

335
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,100
I'm going to eat breakfast.

336
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,260
Wang Xiyi,

337
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,940
Anna used to be your weakness.

338
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,100
But this time,

339
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,460
you must be brave and make a decision.

340
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,900
Hey...

341
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,020
I want...

342
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,460
Speak your mind.

343
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,980
Coward.

344
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,820
I'm not a coward.

345
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,220
I dare to say anything.

346
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,380
Liu Siqi,

347
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,940
hear me out.

348
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,820
I'll stop caring about the contract.

349
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,420
Starting from today,

350
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,100
you are my official girlfriend.

351
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,780
Alright.

352
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,940
Starting from today,

353
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,620
if you dare to look at any woman except me,

354
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,140
I'll flush you down the toilet.

355
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,220
Fine. I won't look at other women.

356
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,620
You need to report your daily
activities to me after work.

357
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,740
Can you do it?

358
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,820
Of course I can.

359
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,020
Don't just ask me to do things.

360
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,700
Can you give me a loving kiss

361
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,260
every day before I go to work?

362
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,100
That's easy.

363
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,300
Let's eat.

364
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,180
Hello?

365
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,860
Mom, go buy vegetables.

366
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,940
I'll take my girlfriend home
for dinner this weekend.

367
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,220
You'll finally bring Siqi home?

368
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,100
Okay. Okay.

369
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,500
Send me a WeChat message

370
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,980
listing Siqi's favorite dishes.

371
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,100
I'll make arrangements.

372
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,220
I'm waiting for you.

373
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,900
Okay.

374
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,940
Stop playing. Stop playing.

375
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,020
I have a serious matter to tell you about.

376
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,020
Our son just called and said

377
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,740
he'd take his girlfriend home to visit us.

378
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,700
He's been in a relationship for so long.

379
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,580
He's only taking his girlfriend home now?

380
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,260
Children nowadays focus on their careers.

381
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,940
I've seen Siqi before.

382
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,860
She is pretty and she
is a lawyer. She is good.

383
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,340
Our son is no longer a young man.

384
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,540
I'm warning you, you'd better
keep your mouth shut by then.

385
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,580
Good? So what?

386
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,900
As a lawyer,

387
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,980
she must be bustling
around for lawsuits all day.

388
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,420
She won't have the time
to take care of her family.

389
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,900
I think it's better to be a teacher.

390
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,740
That way, she can take care of her children
during summer and winter breaks.

391
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,500
You always be like this.

392
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,180
I need to consult you about something.

393
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,540
Grandma's birthday is coming.

394
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,060
We usually held grandma's birthday party

395
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,900
and the company's annual
meeting at the same time.

396
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,740
But this year,

397
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,660
I'd like to invite

398
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
all the employees

399
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,900
of the Huaniao Island Factory here.

400
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,900
Good idea.

401
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,820
When I threw the dinner
party at Huaniao Island,

402
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,860
I said we should gather together someday.

403
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,500
The annual meeting is the best opportunity.

404
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,500
Since grandma has spoken,

405
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,220
I'll start assigning tasks.

406
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,740
Auntie,

407
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,980
you get along

408
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,980
with my mother-in-law.

409
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:01,980
She happens to have

410
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,260
moved to Shanghai.

411
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,140
If circumstances allow, you may talk to her

412
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,700
and see who'll come

413
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,900
from the Huaniao Island Factory.

414
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,700
Alright.

415
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,020
My mother?

416
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,220
Elder brother.

417
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,220
My mother offends people

418
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,700
every time she speaks.

419
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
You should leave the task to me.

420
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,540
Brat.

421
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,020
Don't sabotage this for me.

422
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,860
I'm telling you, I may not
be good at networking,

423
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,300
but Xiyi has left the task to me.

424
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,740
I'll complete the task no matter what.

425
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,580
Don't worry.

426
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,860
Now that I've undertaken the task,

427
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,780
I promise I'll find out everything

428
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,300
about the family trees

429
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,740
of all the island residents.

430
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,980
Family tree my arse.

431
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,340
Don't be anxious.

432
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,580
I have a task for you.

433
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,380
Elder brother,

434
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,540
give your order.

435
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,340
At the company's annual meeting,

436
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,220
I'd like to dance

437
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,980
the opening dance with Jiaxin.

438
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,700
Yes.

439
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
This is your strong suit.

440
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,980
Teach your sister-in-law well.

441
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,020
You need to make better arrangements

442
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,660
than those for the European Heritage.

443
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,060
No problem.

444
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,020
Leave it to me.

445
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,220
Forget about it.

446
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,660
You know

447
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,900
I danced badly

448
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,020
on the cruise ship.

449
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,140
I know your dancing skills aren't that good.

450
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,420
But auntie has spoken.

451
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,140
You can't give yourself up.

452
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,900
I can't compare with auntie.

453
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,100
Auntie is

454
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,780
talented.

455
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,900
You have no idea

456
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,820
how my mother always praised auntie at home.

457
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,660
She said auntie

458
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,700
was beautiful

459
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,100
and kind-hearted.

460
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,980
Mrs. Chen surely knows
how to say sweet words.

461
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,300
But, Jiaxin,

462
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,380
you should give it a try.

463
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,060
I'm telling you,

464
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,740
not everyone

465
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,460
can dance

466
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,980
the opening dance.

467
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,780
Here is the thing.

468
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,340
The opening dance is a tradition

469
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,860
of Cheng Jie Group's annual meeting.

470
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,900
Before this year, grandma

471
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,820
always danced with me as
a substitute for the mistress.

472
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,220
Now

473
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,100
we have the mistress.

474
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,180
All those employees of the company

475
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,340
are waiting for you to dance.

476
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,300
Then...

477
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,780
I'll try my best.

478
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,500
Why aren't you eating?

479
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,500
I'm eating. I'm eating.

480
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,900
Of course I'm eating my own food.

481
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,660
You all have to eat.

482
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,060
Eat up, son.

483
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,340
Yeah. You should eat up too.

484
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,260
Grandma.

485
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,580
I hear from auntie

486
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,380
that you'll take Jiaxin
to the mall this afternoon.

487
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,340
I'm looking to buy

488
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,740
an outfit for my mother-in-law.

489
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,740
How about this?

490
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,340
I'll pay for the clothing items

491
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,300
of you, auntie, Jiaxin

492
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,060
and my mother-in-law.

493
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,340
Okay.

494
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,420
Also, I ordered a massage chair online.

495
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,820
I hope to have Zhengren drive and
bring the outfit and the massage chair

496
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,940
to my mother-in-law after you buy the outfit.

497
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,540
What made you want to give her

498
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,740
a massage chair?

499
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,140
Jiaxin and I went to my mother-in-law's

500
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,260
noodle restaurant that day to help her out.

501
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,900
Then I realized my mother-in-law
worked so hard.

502
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,380
After a day's work,

503
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,260
I suffered from back pain.

504
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,580
And I almost fell apart.

505
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,180
I think my mother-in-law
definitely needs a massage chair.

506
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,420
Xiyi, tell me

507
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,180
which is harder,

508
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,620
managing a family or managing a company?

509
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,140
They are both hard.

510
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,020
My family and my company

511
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,780
both have problems to solve.

512
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,140
What's different is

513
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,940
I'm the boss of the company

514
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,780
and we just earn money

515
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,780
and solve problems together.

516
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,020
Whether the company can survive

517
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,780
is my own responsibility.

518
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,620
Family is a different matter.

519
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,820
Everyone is part

520
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,500
of the family.

521
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,820
When there's a problem,

522
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,180
we all face it.

523
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,180
There are many emotional ties

524
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,020
and worries concerning my family.

525
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,260
But

526
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,500
I'm not alone at least.

527
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,020
Kid,

528
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,180
you're so much maturer now.

529
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,220
Mom,

530
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,100
I know it'll be the first time that
Jiaxin attends the annual meeting

531
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,980
and she should dress demurely and elegantly.

532
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,500
But look at these clothes.

533
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,220
Nothing here suits her.

534
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,180
I'm not asking you to
find clothes for Jiaxin.

535
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,580
I'm asking you to find clothes...

536
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,380
For myself?

537
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:51,940
Whoa, Mom.

538
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,020
Then I will suit myself.

539
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,900
Stop.

540
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,140
I haven't finished yet.

541
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,620
You often said you wanted to develop

542
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,580
good relationships with the island residents.

543
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,740
I'm asking you

544
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,460
to find an outfit for Jiaxin's mother,

545
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,580
so we can send the outfit to her.

546
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,380
So, all this bustling is to find
an outfit for another person.

547
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,300
Watch your attitude.

548
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,500
I'm asking you to find
an outfit for Mrs. Chen.

549
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,340
But I didn't say

550
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,700
you couldn't find clothes for yourself.

551
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,460
Xiyi said

552
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,020
to thank you for taking care

553
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,980
of Jiaxin these days.

554
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,500
He wants to dismiss me
with one single outfit?

555
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,340
No way.

556
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,260
My eldest nephew must cover

557
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,140
all my expenses today.

558
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,020
Don't you agree, Jiaxin?

559
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,980
You are right.

560
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,700
Xiyi's credit card

561
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,180
is at your disposal today.

562
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,580
Then I will suit myself, Mom.

563
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,500
That's the kind of person she is.

564
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,420
Come here.

565
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,220
Have a look.

566
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,260
The main business of European Heritage

567
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,620
can be handed over to Zhengren gradually.

568
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,380
Moreover,

569
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:48,980
leave the deal of hygiene products

570
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,860
for five-star hotels

571
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,740
to Zhengren.

572
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,420
Are you sure?

573
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,860
I know you have complaints about Zhengren.

574
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,380
But he has changed now.

575
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,700
When you're free,

576
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,140
read the reports of the
Huaniao Island Factory

577
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,380
and you'll see his changes.

578
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,740
One more thing,

579
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,500
I won't attend tonight's elite meeting.

580
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,580
Tell Zhengren to attend
the meeting in my stead.

581
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:04,900
Yes.

582
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,660
Are you sure?

583
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,660
I'm pretty sure.

584
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,540
And this

585
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,300
is the seating plan for the annual meeting.

586
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,260
How come the seats for
the Huaniao Island Factory

587
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,620
are so near the front?

588
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,580
Are you sure...

589
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,620
Why do you keep asking if I'm sure?

590
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,460
Have you started to question my decisions?

591
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,660
No.

592
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,540
I'm just curious.

593
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,180
When did Snail become
the center of your life?

594
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,540
Look, everything related to her

595
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,500
comes first here.

596
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,060
Snail is really powerful.

597
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,340
I don't think she is a snail.

598
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,700
She takes action in the guise
of a swine to eat the tiger.

599
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:34,900
No.

600
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,580
She takes action in the guise
of a snail to eat the lizard (Xiyi).

601
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,580
I'll do everything as you say.

602
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,660
Taking action in the guise of
a snail to eat the lizard (Xiyi)?

603
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,020
Are you excited?

604
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,780
We are!

605
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,580
Are you happy?

606
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,420
We are!

607
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:52,860
Mr. Yi!

608
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,740
Mr. Yi!

609
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,380
Jiaxin!

610
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:54,940
Jiaxin!

611
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,780
Cheng Jie!

612
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,780
Cheng Jie!

613
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,380
It's just an annual meeting.

614
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,500
It's not winning a 100-million jackpot.

615
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,660
Why are you cheering?

616
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,300
Mr. Wang,

617
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,820
look at this.

618
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,540
I saw it.

619
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,260
It's just the seating plan
for the annual meeting.

620
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,900
It's not just the seating plan.

621
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,500
It shows we have got the center seats.

622
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,060
Yeah. That's right.

623
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,980
Our Huaniao Island Factory

624
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,100
had no place in Cheng Jie Group.

625
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,020
You held an annual meeting every
year and we were always forgotten.

626
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,220
We could only download the videos
through cloud storage services.

627
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,660
The annual meeting was far from us

628
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,420
like the sun was far from Earth.

629
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,860
But it's different this year.

630
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,460
We can go to Shanghai

631
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,180
and we'll get the best seats.

632
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,420
With the best seats,

633
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,180
we'll have a bigger chance

634
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,180
to win money.

635
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,020
Right.

636
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,820
Right.

637
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:46,660
Win money!

638
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,380
Huh?

639
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,460
Alright. Okay.

640
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,100
Mom.

641
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,260
Zhengren might not be
able to come back today.

642
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,900
Didn't he promise

643
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,100
to practice dancing with Jiaxin?

644
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,220
The factory's goods must be shipped today.

645
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,220
They've been packing the goods in containers.

646
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,540
He needs to keep watch there.

647
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,980
How can you

648
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,540
find a male dancing partner
for her right away?

649
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,620
Grandma.

650
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,140
Another birthday gift for you

651
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,140
has arrived.

652
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,140
Here comes the dancing partner.

653
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,220
Dylan?

654
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:21,820
Here.

655
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,740
Take three steps rightward.

656
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,460
One.

657
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,180
Two.

658
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,460
Three.

659
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,580
Take two steps

660
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,500
rightward and backward.

661
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:38,780
One.

662
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,380
Two.

663
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,500
I'm sorry.

664
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,700
Sorry.

665
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:43,940
Jiaxin,

666
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,060
dancing is not an exam.

667
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,300
It doesn't have a correct answer.

668
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,820
The only mistake you can make

669
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,060
is not to trust your partner

670
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,540
with yourself completely.

671
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,500
Trust me.

672
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,180
Follow me.

673
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,340
I'll lead you

674
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,220
into dancing.

675
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,060
Good.

676
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,660
Turn.

677
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,140
Okay. Turn again.

678
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,700
One da da.

679
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,860
Two da da.

680
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,060
Nice dancing.

681
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,500
My teacher taught me well.

682
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,340
You didn't learn much about dancing.

683
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,740
How come you danced faster than me?

684
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,860
What's the next step?

685
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,620
The things your teacher teaches are boring.

686
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,300
Sit down.

687
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:03,900
Here.

688
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,300
Check this out.

689
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,260
You want me to dance this dance
in front of all the employees?

690
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,060
Grandma will be so mad that she'll pass out.

691
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,300
You're the only person who can't accept this.

692
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,460
You are thoughtful.

693
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,780
You gave my mother a lot of gifts.

694
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,660
I saw her toil those days.

695
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,540
As her son-in-law,

696
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,860
I should do something.

697
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,220
Hmm.

698
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,700
Don't change the subject.

699
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,180
Let's practice the dance in the video.

700
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,220
No.

701
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,340
In that case,

702
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,660
we should...

703
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,820
What?

704
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,020
Should...

705
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,220
Make a gift for grandma.

706
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,100
What gift?

707
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,740
Can you mold clay?

708
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,620
So that's on your mind.

709
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,580
Don't move too fast.

710
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,900
Maintain a constant speed.

711
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,300
Oh.

712
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:09,980
Slow down.

713
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,820
Slower.

714
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,980
Slower.

715
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,140
Maintain a constant speed.

716
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,580
Too fast.

717
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,540
Too fast.

718
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,500
Come here.

719
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,100
Put your hands over my hands.

720
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:24,820
Oh.

721
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,660
I've made a piece of corn bread.

766
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,340
The fact that Jiaxin

767
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,820
has fulfilled her wish in the end

768
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,900
makes me think that justice
still exists in this world.

769
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,460
At first,

770
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,660
I thought Jiaxin couldn't compare

771
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,820
with Anna.

772
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,380
Anna

773
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,140
is tall, elegant and good at dancing.

774
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,180
Your Jiaxin is ordinary and simple.

775
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,420
I never expected things to turn out this way.

776
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,260
That's because you are blind!

777
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,180
In my opinion,

778
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,300
Jiaxin is kind and gentle.

779
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,060
She is the best girl in this world.

780
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,660
If I weren't blind, I wouldn't
have fallen for you.

781
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,260
I have

782
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,580
a question for you.

783
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,740
What do you like about me?

784
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,780
Well,

785
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,260
do I have to answer?

786
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,340
Answer!

787
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,460
Okay. Okay. Okay.

788
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,700
To be honest,

789
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,060
I have a little fetish

790
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,100
for legs.

791
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,860
I love your long legs so much.

792
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,540
Shallow.

793
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,140
I knew I couldn't have an
exchange of thoughts with you.

794
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,540
No. Wait.

795
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,900
Now I've mentioned your virtue,
I should point out your defect.

796
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,660
Alright?

797
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,420
Do you know

798
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,020
what your biggest defect is?

799
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,340
You don't let other people worry about you.

800
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,260
What kind of logic is that?

801
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,140
It's a defect that I don't let
other people worry about me?

802
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,060
You really have no taste.

803
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,020
Sure.

804
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,780
If we put it in a nice way,

805
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,900
you're an independent woman.

806
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,140
If we put it in a mean way,

807
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,340
you're prone to staying strong in adversity.

808
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,500
You can be too hard on yourself.

809
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,740
Your being independent and self-reliant

810
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,100
means I've failed to protect you

811
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,020
as your boyfriend.

812
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,180
That's what you mean?

813
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,380
Sure.

814
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,300
Baby,

815
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,620
from now on,

816
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,300
let me worry about you and
rely on me more often.

817
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,980
It can make me feel useful

818
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,660
as your boyfriend.

819
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,060
You said it.

820
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:21,580
Yeah.

821
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,620
Don't loathe me for bugging you.

822
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,980
I will never do that.

823
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,900
With you, a long-legged beauty, at my side,

824
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,300
I'd never feel bugged.

825
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,660
Piss off.

826
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,580
Go wash the dishes.

827
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,620
Hurry up.

828
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,860
You don't even let me touch you.

829
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,100
These legs really are beautiful.

830
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,540
Auntie.

831
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,500
You're in a nice mood.

832
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,540
You have no idea.

833
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,780
I've been watching Jiaxin.

834
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,820
Look.

835
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,380
This is the dance

836
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,620
Jiaxin will dance at the meeting.

837
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,180
I watched them dance and I
was itching to dance myself.

838
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,460
Look.

839
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,300
Dylan cooperated with her well.

840
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,700
I'm telling you,

841
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,260
Jiaxin danced with her
hand and foot on one side

842
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,220
swinging simultaneously at first.

843
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,900
It cracked me up.

844
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,580
