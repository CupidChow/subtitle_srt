28
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,000
how is it going?

29
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,960
It seems that

30
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,120
her life is wonderful without me.

31
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,040
It's true that you're the golden couple.

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,640
Why do I feel a little bit upset?

33
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,000
It's so late.

34
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,240
Who is it?

35
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,800
It's me.

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,880
Here is your breakfast.

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,720
Thanks.

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,120
How is the drawing of
soap holder coming along?

39
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
Don't get me started.

40
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,560
I've become a layman now.

41
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,320
Hey,

42
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,640
I can tell that

43
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,880
your mind

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,440
is a huge mess.

45
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,200
If you're not gonna make
constructive suggestions,

46
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,440
please leave me alone.

47
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,680
I've only got two more days.

48
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,160
It's okay for me

49
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,440
if I fail to offer the drawing
and the sample.

50
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,160
But I wouldn't embarrass my master.

51
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,440
Look,

52
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm here to your rescue.

53
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,000
Have your breakfast.

54
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,240
Then I'll take you out to find inspiration.

55
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,080
Here you are.

56
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,920

if that's not enough for you.

Come.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,640
There are some French books,

62
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,160

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,040
It's kitschy.

168
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,640
It's…

169
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,480
Greasy.

170
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,080
Why don't you directly say it's greasy?

171
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,040
Why bother beating around the bush?

172
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,640
Wang Xiyi,

173
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,160
you're humiliating

174
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,680
and nitpicking me.

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,040
If I want to humiliate you,

176
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,120
why would I endorse you with my reputation?

177
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,360
Ask yourself,

178
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,880
don't you think it's a kitsch?

179
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm still practicing.

180
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,240
If you want a master,

181
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,800
why don't you turn to my master?

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,840
That's because I know

183
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,840
you can do better than this.

184
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,880
What would you like to change?

185
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,440
Do you really want to know?

186
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,040
Hello.

187
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,080
Hello, Elaine.

188
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,400
Do you have a reservation?

189
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,960
Yes.

190
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,080
Please come in.

191
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,320
Hello, Elaine.

192
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,280
Hello, Elaine.

193
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:17,960
Hi.

194
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,800
Hello.

195
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,720
Hi.

196
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,440
This way, please.

197
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,560
Thanks.

198
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,360
I'd like green salad,

199
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,480
assorted dishes

200
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
and selected beef soup.

201
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,080
Chen Jiaxin,

202
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,920
you are really different.

203
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,760
We're here to talk about business.

204
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,640
I am talking business to you.

205
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,240
You had a change of heart.

206
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,920
But the brand concept of Heritage
has remained the same.

207
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,880
It has always been the same.

208
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,560
With the new collection of essential oil,

209
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,520
Heritage remains the same.

210
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,200
What do you mean?

211
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,960
Look.

212
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,760
This one

213
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,560
is the Milanese version.

214
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,440
This one

215
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,720
is the Parisian version.

216
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,520
This one

217
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,000
is the Spanish version.

218
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,280
You're thinking of the European market
when you design the product.

219
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,880
But you overlooked something.

220
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Heritage is just Heritage.

221
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,680
It comes from China.

222
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,200
I need drawing paper
and colored pens, please.

223
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,040
The way I see it.

224
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,200
Your products

225
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,760
are aimed for European market.

226
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,040
But what I'm trying to do

227
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,800
is to enhance and localize it.

228
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
When it comes to aesthetics,

229
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,080
European countries have its own standard.

230
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,080
And Chinese culture is one of a kind.

231
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,680
Say, vermilion.

232
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,480
As a color,
there is nothing special about it.

233
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,200
However, this color gives a majestic look

234
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,000
when painted on the wall of Imperial Palace.

235
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,440
So,

236
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,280
what matters is the way you use it.

237
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,400
If you're going out of your way
to cater to people's taste

238
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
and losing yourself,

239
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,080
isn't it putting the cart before the horse?

240
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,240
Enjoy your food first.

241
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,680
I'm good.

242
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,640
Then I'm having mine.

243
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,480
Chen Jiaxin.

244
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,160
Waiter,

245
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,160
a glass of warm water, please.

246
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,680
“Have some warm water.”

247
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,160
Chen Jiaxin,

248
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,200
can I take it

249
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,840
as a gesture of care?

250
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,480
Nope.

251
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,400
Your cough is a distraction for me.

252
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,760
Keep fighting,

253
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,160
Chen Jiaxin.

254
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm feeling much better when I'm full.

255
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,440
Do you know any nice place to visit

256
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,680
in Budapest?

257
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,360
What are you talking about?

258
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,760
The design drawing is done.

259
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,600
Check it out.

260
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,280
Feel free to ask questions.

261
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,640
What's the hurry?

262
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,600
I don't feel like thinking

263
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,000
right after the meal.

264
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,280
Would you show me around, my tour guide?

265
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,880
Tour guide?

266
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,200
That's right.

267
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm a visitor here.

268
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,200
As a local resident, you're expected

269
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,560
to take me to some local buildings

270
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,320
where we can talk about the design.

271
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:44,920
Let's go.

272
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,800
We're at the Chain Bridge,

273
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,280
the very first bridge in Budapest
which crosses the Danube.

274
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,760
It's beautiful.

275
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,760
They say young people in Budapest

276
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,120
would do a special thing here

277
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,720
in the morning.

278
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,320
My tour guide,

279
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,200
what is that special thing?

280
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,640
It's said

281
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,520
that couples and newly weds

282
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,920
will be blessed with connection
with each other

283
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,400
and learn the truth about romantic love

284
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,840
by walking across the bridge
hand in hand in the morning.

285
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,680
I suppose there are
many impressive stories about it.

286
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,440
Since you have lived here for many years,

287
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
you must have heard some of them.

288
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,600
I'd like to hear about it.

289
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,840
There once was a boy

290
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,920
who were to attend
his father's funeral across the river.

291
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,320
However, the original wooden bridge

292
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
was washed away by heavy rains,

293
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,120
preventing him from seeing
his father one last time.

294
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,640
People then decided

295
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,920
to build another bridge.

296
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,440
Why don't you tell the story

297
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,680
about the boy who swam across the river

298
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,680
to see his crush living on the other side

299
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,880
before the river was frozen in winter?

300
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,320
You already know the story.

301
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,760
I really like it
when you're telling love stories.

302
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,600
I'm kind of getting intimacy from it.

303
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,640
That's nonsense.

304
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
It's a sunny place with fresh air.

305
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,080
No wonder you don't want
to go back to Shanghai.

306
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,040
When I was a kid,

307
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,760
I had a dream that someone

308
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,280
who loves me as deeply as my parents do

309
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,040
proposes to me

310
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,480
on the shore of a moonlit sea,

311
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,240
and then we get married
and have a pigeon pair.

312
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,440
We'd live like the prince
and princess in the fairy tale,

313
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,720
owning a carriage and living in a castle.

314
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,600
Jiaxin,

315
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,000
I can recite your childhood dairy.

316
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,400
Xiyi.

317
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,920
Jiaxin,

318
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,920
what we had

319
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,080
is special

320
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,680
and irreplaceable.

321
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,320
You're still the Snail I've been missing.

322
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,720
I'm surprised

323
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,720
that you're so…

324
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,600
Naïve.

325
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,200
I've grown up.

326
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,800
For me,

327
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,040
the memory about those innocent,

328
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,440
romantic days

329
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,400
has become a joke.

330
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,360
I'm surprised that
you're as nostalgic as a boy.

331
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,760
Are you

332
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,160
expecting something to happen?

333
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,200

I don't care what has become of you.

00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,840

Mr. Yi,

354
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,880
we had lunch and we took a tour.

355
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,760

You got all wet.

00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,680
If I didn't react in time,

366
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,320
you

367
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,320

368
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,880
Oh, great.

369

You're gonna shop with me for clothes.

370

Shop for clothes?

371
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,280
Anson just sent me a message,

382
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,360
The size of the suit is forty-eight.

383
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
And his pants are of thirty-three inches.

I'm not wet,
why do I need to buy new clothes?

399
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,560
You know them.

400
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,200
Are you sure you want to meet them

401
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
in casual clothes?

402
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,280
Compared with suit,

403
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,200
I think you look better

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,080
in this feminine dress.

405
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,800
Who says girls have to look feminine?

406
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
The way I see it is

407
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,360
that talented people like you

408
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,000
don't have to hide themselves
in a stiff suit.

409
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,040
Hum.

410
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,480
What's up?

411
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,280
Can you do me a favor?

412
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,600
I've got changed.

413
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,040
Turn around.

414
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,560
I'm ready.

415
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,200
You look pretty.

416
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,480
Here.

417
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,480
I help you with your zipper.

418
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,840
You help with me with my tie.

419
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,000
Only your wife gets to fix your tie.

420
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,360
You've become a man

421
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,920
with no standards in the past three years.

422
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,680
I've never changed my standards.

423
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,520
Do me the favor of fixing my tie.

424
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,400
I don't see any problem with it.

425
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,640
You're still the same old Xiyi,

426
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,800
with the same old moves.

427
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,880
For lecturing Gu Chi or for now,

428
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,440
it's all the same.

429
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,800
Let's go.

430
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,280
Ms. Xia is waiting for us.

431
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,640
Are you alright?

432
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,480
I'm alright.

433
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,640
Ms. Xia.

434
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,760
Ms. Xia, nice to see you.

435
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,000
Wow,

436
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,760
from Ugly Betty to Monica Bellucci,

437
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,600
you've become

438
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,440
a tasteful ceramist.

439
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,480
I hope your design
is as beautiful as your look.

440
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,040
Here is my design.

441
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,200
But

442
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,600
before looking at my work,

443
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,760
let's hope

444
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,160
that your taste for design

445
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,960
is not as shallow as your aesthetic standard.

446
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,400
It's not my plan

447
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,440
to make my work look fancy

448
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,240
simply with its package.

449
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,640
Let the work talk.

450
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,040
Women with spending power

451
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
who expect high-quality life

452
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,880
constitute the majority of
consumers of essential oil soap.

453
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,640
The design is a combination

454
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
of Chinese

455
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,360
and European elements.

456
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,600
It's made of Hungarian porcelain,

457
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,840
which reduces transportation cost
with its light weight

458
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,120
and improves product quality.

459
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,960
The exterior of the soap holder

460
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,240
is decorated with borage.

461
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,720
One the one hand,

462
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,400
it goes well with European decoration.

463
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,200
On the other hand, borage stands for courage.

464
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,200
Because it takes courage
to adhere to a certain spirit

465
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,680
and preserve the cultural legacy of a brand.

466
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,240
And this stands for…

467
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,920
As for the interior,
we adopt Chinese elements.

468
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,160
We chose dragon,

469
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,160
a Chinese symbol

470
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,840
of nobleness and auspice.

471
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,720
As the Chinese saying goes:

472
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,440
parents always hold high hopes
for their children.

473
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,200
It means that

474
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,040
parents want their kids
to make remarkable achievements.

475
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,960
It's not only about expectation

476
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,880
and blessing,

477
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,680
but also a symbol of generational heritage.

478
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,360
The love of parents

479
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,520
is something universal.

480
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,520
Interesting.

481
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,320
Ms. Xia thinks highly of your design.

482
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,560
Now, I feel even more confident

483
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,440
about our essential oil entering the market.

484
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:49,960
I owe it to you.

485
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,560
That goes without saying.

486
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,200
I told you before,

487
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,960
I have faith in my work.

488
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,560
Hello?

489
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,720
She is with me.

490
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,000
Wait a minute.

491
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,760
It's for you.

492
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,920
Three years have passed

493
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,360
and that girl lack of confidence
has totally disappeared.

494
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,280
What's the problem?

495
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,760
It's okay.

496
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,600
Just a bit dizzy.

497
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,880
Perhaps I didn't have enough sleep.

498
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,240
What did she say?

499
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,920
She said that

500
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,160
she wants to cooperate with me

501
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,280
on the new package of
some other products of her company.

502
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,880
She also asked me about my plan
for the next two years.

503
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:14,800
Chen Jiaxin,

504
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,520
you're not the girl I used to know.

505
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,240
You used to be lack of confidence.

506
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,840
No matter how I speak well of you,

507
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,920
you wouldn't believe me.

508
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,080
But now,

509
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,240
I'm the one who feel inferior to you.

510
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,080
You?

511
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,680
How come?

512
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,320
Someone who needed me

513
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,800
doesn't need me anymore.

514
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,800
Besides, I'm on her land.

515
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,560
I might be tricked by her.

516
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,480
That makes me feel unconfident.

517
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,120
I become a mature woman,

518
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,240
not a villain, okay?

519
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,280
It seems you're tired.

520
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,840
Go back to the hotel and have a good rest.

521
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,200
We'll find another time

522
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,760
to discuss the work to be done.

523
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,680
I'm returning to Shanghai.

524
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,880
Someone will be talking to you

525
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,320
about future work.

526
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,240
Oh.

527
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,200
That's good.

528
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,200
We're not working it out.

529
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,320
Anyway.

530
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
It's a good thing

531
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,120
to have someone else to talk about the work

532
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,080
to be done.

533
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,000
It will save us from quarrels.

534
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:42,760
That's right.

535
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,080
Well,

536
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,640
it's nice to work with you.

537
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,960
Thank you

538
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,840
for offering me this rare opportunity.

539
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:02,920
You're welcome.

540
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,000
You deserve it.

541
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,200
Well,

542
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,720
goodbye, then.

543
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,640
Goodbye.

544
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,160
Chen Jiaxin,

545
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,840
I'm sorry.

546
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,080

Wang Xiyi.

548
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,680
I'm lucky

549
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,520
to once have you as my husband.

550
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,000
I'll never forget

551

I owe it to you.

554
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,480

You're burning up.

590
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,080

It's okay.

00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,880
I'll accompany you to the hospital.

You're free to go.

If you don't want to go to the hospital,

I'll put the kettle on.

00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,720
please don't be so nice to me.

601
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,880
I'm ready to leave.

602
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,520
I might get the wrong idea

603
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,160
from what you're doing for me.

604
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,600
Rest assured.

605
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,840
I'm no longer the girl I used to be.

606
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,080
For me,

you're just a patient to be taken care of.
