25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,940
(Episode 25)

26
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:10,020
(Ximi's notebook)

27
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,420
(Ximi's notebook)

28
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,060
Hi.

29
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,300
I'm Ximi.

30
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,820
I'll make my debut soon.

31
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,380
I'm a lively, cheery and curious baby.

32
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,580
Though I'm still in Mom's belly,

33
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,780
I can't wait to see the outside world.

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,860
Due to the critical nature of the situation,

35
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,780
the enthusiastic Uncle Dylan

36
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,140
went to see the doctor with us.

37
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,740
Hi, Ximi.

38
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,620
Thanks to your father,

39
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,740
I became your Snail mother.

40
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,300
Your father thinks he's handsome.

41
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,540
Let's call him Father Cricket.
(Cricket sounds like handsome Xiyi in Chinese)

42
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,020
After you learn how to speak,

43
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,740
you'll call him that.

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,540
You've finally stopped being naughty.

45
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,060
Every time I listened to music
with your great-grandmother

46
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,500
and molded clay,

47
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,860
you behaved well.

48
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,580
Your great-grandmother said

49
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,660
you inherited her and my artistic senses.

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,540
I hope

51
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,740
you'll be a child

52
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,180
who loves art and music.

53
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,220
So I can draw and mold clay

54
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,380
with you.

55
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,660
But

56
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,940
if I fall asleep at a concert again,

57
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,020
you'll need to wake me up.

58
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,580
I was so careless.

59
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,300
I didn't have enough rest
because I was too absorbed in work.

60
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,300
I passed out on the first day
of your father's business trip.

61
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,940
The sight of your father

62
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,660
rushing back regardless of the consequences

63
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,020
touched me deeply.

64
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,420
But I blamed myself for
not taking care of you well

65
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,900
and messed up your father's itinerary.

66
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,060
Fortunately,

67
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,620
it was a false alarm.

68
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,260
Hearing your little heart

69
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,940
beat steadily,

70
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,180
your father and I felt happy.

71
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,700
To welcome you into this world,

72
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,820
we learned how to take care of you.

73
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,820
We're becoming more like a family.

74
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,900
We look forward to you
entering this world as a healthy baby.

75
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,860
However,

76
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,420
I can't watch you grow up.

77
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,180
But I hope you'll know

78
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,900
your mother loves you dearly

79
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,860
and your father

80
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,020
also loves you dearly.

81
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,820
How is Jiaxin?

82
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,860
What's the situation? Is she okay?

83
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,660
Didn't you go to the hospital?

84
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,300
How come you can't answer my questions?

85
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,300
Her cousin was guarding her ward.

86
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,180
Nobody could enter the ward.

87
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,100
Even Xiyi couldn't enter the ward,
not to mention me.

88
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,300
The child is gone,

89
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,820
but she should be fine.

90
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,220
She'll be discharged soon.

91
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,980
I asked Mr. Shen.

92
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,580
Wang Xiyi added the supplementary terms

93
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,820
to protect Jiaxin's rights.

94
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,860
I don't understand why things
turned out this way.

95
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,940
I'm Jiaxin's best friend

96
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,340
and a lawyer.

97
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,380
I had no idea

98
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,460
when she signed the divorce agreement.

99
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,660
I'm really incompetent.

100
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,420
You can explain to them for Mr. Yi.

101
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,660
Entrepreneurs like them

102
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,260
tend to notarize their properties

103
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,860
before getting married.

104
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,460
You're experienced and well-informed.
Surely you know.

105
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,460
Besides, they got married in a hurry.

106
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,700
That's why they signed the divorce agreement.

107
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,460
The supplementary terms were added later

108
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,940
to protect Jiaxin's rights.

109
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,540
It proves he has grown fond of her.

110
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,900
I can't talk to her.

111
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,700
She just lost her child.
This is the most painful moment in her life.

112
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,580
You want me to remind her and her family

113
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,300
of the car accident that was caused

114
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,180
by her overreaction on the road?

115
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,540
It's not that I don't want to
explain for Wang Xiyi.

116
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,980
You just shouldn't tell her
that even if you had the chance.

117
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,980
Ximi.

118
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,930
I've known about your situation.

119
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,620
I dreamed of Ximi.

120
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,780
Ximi.

121
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,180
He was so young.

122
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,740
Protecting him should be my priority.

123
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,820
But as his mother,

124
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,660
I failed to keep him safe.

125
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,940
It's all my fault.

126
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,540
I used to get through hard times like this

127
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,060
by crying

128
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,540
and sleeping.

129
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,340
Everything would be better after that.

130
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,420
But now,

131
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,540
whenever I close my eyes,

132
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,220
Ximi occupies my mind.

133
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,700
My child.

134
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,380
But I can't tell my mother.

135
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,740
If she saw me like this,

136
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,620
she would feel sadder than me.

137
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,260
Why are you here too?

138
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,700
Right after Xiyi heard you left,

139
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,820
he rushed off to look for you.

140
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,900
Before I could finish my words,

141
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,740
he unintentionally pushed me.

142
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,260
Now I can't have a baby for real.

143
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,580
How can it be?

144
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,220
You lost your child.

145
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,380
I lost the right to have a child.

146
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,100
Jiaxin,

147
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I understand your pain.

148
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,380
I'm sorry.

149
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,140
If not for me...

150
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,740
I don't blame you.

151
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,580
I also don't mean to blame Xiyi.

152
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,300
Jiaxin,

153
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,020
I'll leave Xiyi to you from now on.

154
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,540
Please take care of him for me.

155
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,500
No.

156
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,100
I can't face him calmly now.

157
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,540
Please

158
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,340
take this back.

159
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,380
I think you need this more than I do.

160
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,820
If we didn't know each other

161
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,740
under these circumstances,

162
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,220
maybe we could have been friends.

163
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,300
Anna,

164
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,660
if I didn't

165
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,060
come between...

166
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,300
There's no "if"

167
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,540
in this world.

168
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,540
Now I have

169
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,100
no chance whatsoever.

170
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,180
Why didn't you answer my call?

171
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,580
Where are you?

172
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,060
If you saw my WeChat message,

173
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,740
please call me back, okay?

174
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,740
Call me anytime.

175
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,900
I've tidied up the baby's room.

176
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,140
It's a man's job to assemble
the little rocking horse.

177
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,060
It has been assembled.

178
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,220
Jiaxin,

179
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,700
I miss you so much.

180
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,260
I'm sorry

181
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,540
for letting you suffer.

182
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,740
After you get discharged from the hospital,

183
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,900
I'll take you home, okay?

184
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,900
Let's start over.

185
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,140
Okay?

186
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,820
(Delete)

187
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,900
(Delete contact "Wang Xiyi"
and the chat history with that contact)

188
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,820
(Jiaxin has enabled Friend Confirmation.
[Send a friend request] to chat.)

189
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,620
Jiaxin.

190
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,260
You are leaving me, aren't you?

191
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,820
You won't forgive me, will you?

192
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,740
Why did I call you?

193
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,460
Why did I chase you?

194
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,740
I shouldn't have followed
the lawyer's advice.

195
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,460
I should have torn the divorce agreement.

196
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,860
I don't want a divorce.

197
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:18,980
Jiaxin.

198
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,220
Jiaxin.

199
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,060
I really want what's best for you.

200
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,060
I just want you to have
something to live off.

201
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,780
I don't want a divorce.

202
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,700
Now I have lost both of you.

203
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,580
Ximi.

204
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,260
I'm sorry.

205
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,380
I have lost you.

206
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,100
I have lost your mom as well.

207
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,740
Tell me.

208
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,180
Do you hate me?

209
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,060
Do you hate me?

210
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,460
Do you hate me? I hate myself.

211
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,940
It's all my fault.

212
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,060
Your self-torture

213
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,300
distresses me.

214
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,180
You think this will make
Jiaxin and Ximi forgive you?

215
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,500
How long are you going to wallow in despair?

216
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,740
Look what Jiaxin has turned into.

217
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,300
Ximi is gone.

218
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,860
Don't I feel heartbroken and sad?

219
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,980
But I'm still here to lift your spirits.

220
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,660
If you keep doing this,

221
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,660
Jiaxin may forgive you,

222
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,580
but will your mother-in-law

223
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,900
still trust you with her daughter?

224
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,060
When your father passed away,

225
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,660
I endured the pain of losing my son.

226
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,180
Faced with the covetous shareholders,

227
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,860
I ground my teeth

228
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,660
and held the company together.

229
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,380
When Xiuling and her ex-husband
sucked the company dry,

230
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,780
I ground my teeth again

231
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,940
and helped the company regain a foothold.

232
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,220
This time,

233
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,140
I really want to bear your burden.

234
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,820
But I'm old.

235
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,620
Do you understand?

236
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,060
Zhengren is inexperienced.

237
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,700
Rebuild the southwestern factory.

238
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,140
Handle the claims of your injured employees.

239
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,060
Check the inventories of other factories.

240
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,060
Distribute the goods.

241
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,140
Nobody except you

242
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,580
can do these things.

243
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,380
Sometimes it's good to be busy.

244
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,100
You'll get to think

245
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,220
things over,

246
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,340
get over the pain,

247
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,260
and care for the people you should care for.

248
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,740
I'll tell Xiuling to visit Jiaxin

249
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,900
after she gets discharged.

250
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,780
Both of you

251
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,380
need to endure this experience.

252
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
Calm your nerves.

253
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,260
Leave Jiaxin alone

254
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,500
for a few days.

255
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,340
You should take the time to think.

256
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,100
Don't disturb her.

257
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,220
You're back.

258
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,580
Why are you here?

259
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,860
You and Jiaxin didn't live here.

260
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,740
I heard that Jiaxin was coming home.

261
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,300
So I rushed here to pack my stuff.

262
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,980
I just made rice gruel.

263
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,580
Here. Have it while it's still warm.

264
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,300
Great.

265
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,780
Jiaxin, come on.

266
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,660
I don't want to eat.

267
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,060
Why? Sit down and have some food.

268
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:10,980
Mom.

269
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,060
You didn't have any appetite

270
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,900
at the hospital.

271
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,540
You relied on saline to survive.

272
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,140
Now you're home, grab a few bites at least.

273
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:18,900
Sit down.

274
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,060
I really have no appetite.

275
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,540
You...

276
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,580
Look at you. You've become scrawny.

277
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,620
Do you expect me to watch you

278
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,860
avoid foods and drinks?

279
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:31,780
Huh?

280
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,020
My daughter isn't what she used to be.

281
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,820
What have I done wrong

282
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,460
to incur such punishment from heaven?

283
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,300
Jiaxin,

284
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,740
your mother has been busy

285
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,020
looking after you these days.

286
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,380
Don't let her worry about you.

287
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,740
You have no appetite?
I'll cook some more dishes for you.

288
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,780
I'm sleepy.

289
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,420
I want to sleep.

290
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,940
I'll eat after I wake up, okay?

291
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,460
You think I don't know what you did?

292
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,820
During your stay at the hospital,

293
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,820
you sneaked out of your ward every night.

294
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,620
You stood outside the nurseries

295
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,220
and watched the newborn babies,
shedding tears.

296
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:12,940
Mom.

297
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,020
I just can't control myself.

298
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,460
I've been trying not
to think about Ximi.

299
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,700
But I lost sleep every night at the hospital.

300
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,780
Every time I closed my eyes,

301
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,460
I heard the baby's cry.

302
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,420
Mom, I really don't know what to do.

303
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,940
Don't care about other people's opinions.

304
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,300
I have always been proud of you.

305
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,260
But I always make you sad.

306
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,300
That's because you're capable.

307
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,980
Other people can't make me sad

308
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,180
even if they want to.

309
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,420
Mom.

310
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,460
Cry on my shoulder.

311
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,820
Cry if you want.

312
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,500
It'll make you feel better.

313
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,020
Mom.

314
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,740
Things will be fine after a cry.

315
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,380
The fastest way is to deliver the goods

316
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,540
from the Guiyang factory.

317
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,700
We must send the required amount
of goods from Chengdu to Europe.

318
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,580
Mr. Yi,

319
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,860
allow me to remind you.

320
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,860
Even if we got the goods ready,

321
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,260
we wouldn't have the time to load
the last train of China Railway Express.

322
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,700
If land transportation doesn't work,
we can transport the goods by air.

323
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,540
Mr. Wang,

324
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,220
do you know how many times higher
the cost of air transportation is

325
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,500
than that of land transportation?

326
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,620
If we transported

327
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,300
a ton of goods by air

328
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,700
and sold them out,

329
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,660
we'd still lose money.

330
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,340
I know.

331
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,180
But we are new

332
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,100
to the European market.

333
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,100
Delaying the arrival of the goods

334
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,620
means breaking the contract and promise.

335
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,980
Money couldn't buy back
our damaged reputation.

336
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,340
Right, brother?

337
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:30,900
Yes.

338
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,300
Zhengren is right.

339
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,260
Let's do this.

340
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,020
Coffee.

341
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,220
Let's take five.

342
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,980
Can't you see his look?

343
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,300
Why did you pour coffee into that mug?

344
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,540
Where is your workplace sensitivity?

345
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,420
But you told me

346
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,940
Mr. Yi liked that mug

347
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,060
and I should fill that mug with
whatever he wanted to drink.

348
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,100
I said that a long time ago.

349
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,900
Circumstances have changed, my friend.

350
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,300
Never mind. Just take it away.

351
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,540
(Cheng Jie Group)

352
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,380
Jiaxin,

353
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,140
I know you're mad.

354
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,020
You refused to meet me.

355
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,980
You refused to listen to me.

356
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,380
It's okay.

357
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,420
But send me a message at least.

358
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,900
Let me know you're doing well.

359
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,220
Okay?

360
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,220
It contains so much water.

361
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,580
What is that?

362
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,860
A shrimp.

363
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,220
Throw it away. Throw it away.

364
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,100
You've gone too far.

365
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,980
This place looks so beautiful.

366
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,620
What made you come to the island
and visit me today?

367
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:06,660
Well,

368
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,700
I was going to ask for a leave,

369
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,300
but my leave letter got confiscated
right after I submitted it.

370
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,660
Mr. Shen was worried about you.

371
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,180
He said there was no need to ask for a leave.

372
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,380
He just gave me a day off,

373
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,980
telling me to come here and check on you.

374
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,340
Thank him for me after you get back.

375
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,140
Tell him I'm fine

376
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,660
and don't worry about me.

377
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:29,620
Yeah.

378
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,020
Jiaxin.

379
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:48,980
I know

380
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,100
you don't want to see Wang Xiyi right now.

381
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,780
But I think

382
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,380
you should try to sit down

383
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,500
and talk things out with him.

384
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
Mr. Shen said

385
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,420
the supplementary agreement
he gave you that day...

386
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,260
Don't mention that to me again.

387
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,020
I don't want to hear anything about him.

388
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,700
Don't mention him to me again.

389
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,620
It's really getting cold.

390
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,500
Come on.

391
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,380
You should go back.

392
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,580
Let's go.

393
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,140
Dylan.

394
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,780
Here you are.

395
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,660
Your mother went to your cousin's home.

396
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,700
She told me to wait here for you.

397
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,460
How can I help you?

398
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,900
I'm leaving Shanghai.

399
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,540
A few days ago, I went to the Wang family

400
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,540
and took back the clay doll

401
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,460
Master Zhongshan Long had given you.

402
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,380
I met Grandma.

403
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,260
Grandma was worried about you.

404
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,540
But she didn't want to disturb you.

405
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,020
So she wrote a letter

406
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,220
and asked me to give it to you.

407
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:09,740
Jiaxin,

408
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,020
how are you doing?

409
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,140
Recently,

410
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,420
the thought of visiting you
has occurred to me repeatedly.

411
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,580
But I feared my presence would sadden you.

412
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,580
In the end, I decided

413
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,220
to write this letter.

414
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,140
This is to express my concern,
tell you I miss you,

415
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,220
apologize to you

416
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,260
and thank you.

417
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,740
I spent too much time
managing the company in the past.

418
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,060
I looked glorious,

419
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,260
but I lost kinship.

420
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,460
After I handed the company over to Xiyi,

421
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,460
I could only stay in the mansion alone.

422
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,900
It is a cold house.

423
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,660
Fortunately, you came to our house.

424
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,260
Your warmth and kindness

425
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,700
changed my family little by little.

426
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,500
Because of you, I was able to enjoy

427
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,340
my family's companionship.

428
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,620
I hope you and Xiyi

429
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,420
will live happily ever after.

430
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,340
But I'm not a selfish person.

431
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,220
I consider you my granddaughter.

432
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,420
Therefore I'm telling you this.

433
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,020
Forgive Xiyi or not,

434
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,060
don't blame yourself.

435
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,380
Don't be trapped
in the pain of losing Ximi.

436
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,220
I lost my child once.

437
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,340
I understand

438
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,180
the unforgettable pain.

439
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,460
No matter what your decision is,

440
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,940
I fully support you.

441
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:46,860
Good girl,

442
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,180
remember

443
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,220
that the Wang family

444
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,740
will always be open to you.

445
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,620
Hope you'll stay

446
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,180
safe,

447
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,380
cheery,

448
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,460
and happy in the days to come.

449
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,980
Love, Grandma Zhenzhu.

450
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,700
Here.

451
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:45,900
Do you plan

452
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,100
to return to the Wang family?

453
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,660
The trust has been destroyed.

454
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,980
There is no second chance.

455
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,460
I don't want to see him.

456
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:09,780
Then

457
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,260
will you leave?

458
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,100
Leave?

459
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,420
Where can I go?

460
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,060
Someplace

461
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,300
without him.

462
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,580
Here are some drugs.

463
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,940
Take these drugs along.

464
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,340
God knows how long

465
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,060
you'll be gone.

466
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,380
You'll be living in an unfamiliar country.

467
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,420
It'll be difficult to see a doctor
or take drugs there.

468
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,460
Besides, foreign people's physiques

469
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,780
are different from Chinese people's.

470
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,340
The more I consider it, the more I worry.

471
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,140
You need to take these drugs.

472
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,380
Look at your skin. You haven't
recovered from your allergy yet.

473
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:56,980
Yeah.

474
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,460
Nobody will apply medicine
for you in another country.

475
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,780
You need to take care of yourself.

476
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,660
Yeah.

477
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,060
If I make a mistake out there,

478
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,980
nobody will get to punish me.

479
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,740
Oh, you naughty girl.

480
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,020
I'll whip your ass right now.

481
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,500
Mom.

482
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,060
After I leave,

483
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,460
will you be okay living alone?

484
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,460
Don't worry about me.

485
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,020
I'm able-bodied.

486
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,740
What could possibly happen to me?

487
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,180
It's how I've been living all this time.

488
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,820
You were in Shanghai
and I was in Huaniao Island.

489
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,940
We didn't see each other normally.

490
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,260
We just met up

491
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,180
once a month.

492
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,300
We didn't call each other.

493
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,540
We occasionally called each other, right?

494
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,420
Don't take me as an excuse.

495
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,900
Do what you should do.

496
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:07,340
Alright?

497
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,500
You won't miss me?

498
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,180
I won't.

499
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,220
Go.

500
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,460
Leave this place and go somewhere,

501
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,020
free from your past and concerns.

502
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,140
Start over your life.

503
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,500
I will

504
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,100
wait for you.

505
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,180
I will wait for my daughter
to become independent

506
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,820
and beautiful

507
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,220
and come home happily.

508
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:00,620
Mom.

509
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,380
I'm sorry.

510
