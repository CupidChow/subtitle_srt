25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,940
(Episode 26)

26
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,380
Hello, Mister.

27
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,100
You must be here
to buy flowers for your girlfriend.

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,140
Take a look at this bouquet.

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,180
Its main note is red rose

30
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,980
and it symbolizes passion and love.

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,940
Love?

32
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,380
Our first meeting was a farce.

33
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,340
Oh, you are a pair of quarrelsome lovers.

34
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,100
You two met as strangers,
but have become close.

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,700
You need to know each other well

36
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,380
to make your relationship last longer.

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,140
How about lilies?

38
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,300
Lilies symbolize faithfulness.

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,980
Young women love this kind of flower.

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,940
The problem is

41
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,380
this woman doesn't know my feelings for her.

42
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,260
She has left me.

43
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,700
Madam,

44
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,740
what is this?

45
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,580
This?

46
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,780
This is borage.

47
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,460
European soldiers used to put a borage flower

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,620
in their wine cups before they went to battle

49
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,820
and shout,

50
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,700
"I'm a borage flower. I'm not afraid."

51
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,100
It's said they could win the battle this way.

52
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,420
Therefore borage is also known

53
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,820
as the Fountain of Courage.

54
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,700
This is what I want to tell Jiaxin.

55
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,700
No matter what happens,

56
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,820
we should muster up our courage

57
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,860
and carry on together.

58
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,660
Mister,

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,100
if you want this pot,

60
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,580
I can tell you about a game.

61
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,540
It's said

62
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,460
you can hold a borage flower in your hand,

63
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,860
call your lover's name silently,

64
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,180
and let the borage flower fall
into the water.

65
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,060
If the flower drifts away in the water,

66
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,020
then you and your lover
aren't destined to be together.

67
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,660
But

68
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,300
if the flower floats
in the center of the water

69
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,460
and doesn't drift away,

70
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,380
then you and your lover
will be together forever.

71
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,820
Try it, if you're interested.

72
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,460
Jiaxin,

73
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,620
feel free to scold me

74
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,700
and reprimand me.

75
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,180
I'll take it all.

76
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,780
But please come home with me.

77
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:46,940
Okay?

78
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,340
Madam.

79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,420
I'll have this.

80
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,300
Yes, Mister.

81
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,380
The last time I sent you off,

82
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,500
it was the day of your wedding.

83
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,980
You felt a little wronged at that time.

84
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,020
I didn't expect you to have

85
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,540
the same heavy heart for this journey.

86
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,700
I hope you'll forget all your griefs

87
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,820
when you come back.

88
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,540
I'll be here waiting for your return.

89
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,260
Mom.

90
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,660
Please give this to him.

91
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,980
I know.

92
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,540
You don't have to think about

93
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,820
the people and things here.

94
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,700
Leave with ease.

95
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,260
OK.

96
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,740
Mrs. Chen.

97
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,900
I know you and Jiaxin
aren't related or close.

98
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,500
But I'm still brazenly asking you

99
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,340
to take care of my daughter.

100
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,340
Mrs. Chen.

101
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,340
Don't worry.

102
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,980
I'll take care of Jiaxin.

103
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
You should take care of yourself.

104
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,180
Thank you.

105
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,380
Come on.

106
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,620
Mom.

107
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,100
Alright. Alright.

108
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,100
After you arrive there and get a new phone,

109
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,900
send me a WeChat message.

110
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,540
Okay?

111
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,100
Yeah.

112
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,140
If you are busy at work,

113
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,740
send me a photo

114
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,060
or video.

115
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,460
Let me know

116
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,020
you're doing well there.

117
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,140
Okay?

118
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,380
Mom.

119
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,060
Go.

120
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,740
Alright.

121
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,340
Take care of yourself.

122
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:23,980
Go.

123
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,020
Take care of yourself.

124
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,340
You too, Mom.

125
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,460
Take care.

126
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,100
Yeah.

127
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,380
Mrs. Chen, don't worry.

128
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,820
Jiaxin.

129
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,140
Chen Jiaxin!

130
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,660
Chen Jiaxin!

131
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,580
Don't go.

132
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,300
Chen Jiaxin!

133
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,020
Go. Go. Go.

134
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,140
Go. Go. Stay safe. Stay safe.

135
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,140
Don't go!

136
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,180
Jiaxin.

137
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,700
Let's talk things out. Come out.

138
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,900
We can talk things out.

139
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,900
You promised not to leave me, right?

140
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,780
Chen Jiaxin.

141
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,140
Chen Jiaxin, come out.

142
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,860
Jiaxin.

143
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,860
Jiaxin.

144
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,220
Jiaxin.

145
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,180
Let me explain.

146
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,940
Jiaxin.

147
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,420
Jiaxin. Chen Jiaxin.

148
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,300
Chen Jiaxin.

149
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,700
Chen Jiaxin.

150
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,820
Jiaxin, you can't do this to me.

151
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,860
You promised not to leave me, Jiaxin.

152
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,900
Chen Jiaxin!

153
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,980
Jiaxin!

154
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,540
Jiaxin!

155
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,540
Chen Jiaxin!

156
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,540
Chen Jiaxin!

157
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,300
Chen Jiaxin!

158
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,580
Chen Jiaxin!

159
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
Chen Jiaxin!

160
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,980
Chen Jiaxin!

161
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,900
Chen Jiaxin!

162
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,700
Chen Jiaxin!

163
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,300
Don't go!

164
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,940
Chen Jiaxin!

165
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,100
Chen Jiaxin!

166
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,580
You promised not to leave me alone.

167
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,060
Now that you are gone, what am I going to do?

168
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,580
What am I left with?

169
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,780
How can you leave me?

170
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,740
Jiaxin told me to give you this.

171
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,900
I'm not divorcing her...

172
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,020
I never wanted to divorce her.

173
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,940
No.

174
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,060
Perhaps...

175
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,580
Perhaps you know you made a mistake.

176
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,380
Perhaps you are in pain right now.

177
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,540
But has it occurred to you

178
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,980
that this ending

179
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,980
is the best for you two?

180
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,100
Asking for more
would make you both miserable.

181
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,420
Mom.

182
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,380
Tell me where Jiaxin is going.

183
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,860
I'll find her.

184
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,780
Mom.

185
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,140
Don't you understand?

186
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,620
She's running away from you.

187
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,740
She couldn't stay in Shanghai anymore.

188
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,700
She wants to go somewhere

189
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,940
without you.

190
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,460
Please consider this

191
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,180
the last favor you do her.

192
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,820
Don't look for her, okay?

193
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,620
I can't believe

194
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,860
I made every endeavor
to drive that girl away a few months ago.

195
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,340
Now I want her back.

196
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,420
It's you.

197
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,780
Why are you here?

198
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,420
Auntie.

199
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,380
I heard that Grandma is sick.

200
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,700
I'm here to visit her.

201
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,380
My mother

202
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,780
is not your concern.

203
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,580
Oh, and here is my advice.

204
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,340
Stop trying

205
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,500
to make up with Xiyi.

206
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,300
Even though Jiaxin isn't here,

207
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,820
you won't get him.

208
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:58,740
Auntie.

209
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,060
Don't be like this.

210
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,900
Jiaxin isn't here.

211
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,260
Please let me take care of you in her stead.

212
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,220
I'm not your auntie.

213
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,300
You should listen to yourself.

214
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,180
You can't replace Jiaxin.

215
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,140
Don't even think about it.

216
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,140
But I can throw you out

217
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,060
in Jiaxin's stead.

218
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,540
Get out.

219
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,420
Auntie.

220
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,180
Don't be like this. Please let me finish.

221
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,300
What's going on?

222
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,820
Mom.

223
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,500
Look at Xiyi's ex-girlfriend.

224
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,340
How shameless she is.

225
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,500
She came to our home

226
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,420
and claimed to replace Jiaxin.

227
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:28,980
Grandma.

228
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,580
That's not true.

229
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,380
I didn't mean that.

230
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,860
I know I was being too selfish.

231
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,060
To pursue my dream,

232
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,900
I kept Xiyi waiting.

233
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,940
I've reflected on my mistake
at the hospital recently.

234
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,740
I just hope

235
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,340
you and Auntie can give me a chance.

236
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,380
What do you mean?

237
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:46,900
Huh?

238
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,220
Even though Jiaxin
didn't give birth to Ximi,

239
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,460
she is still Mrs. Wang.

240
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,940
But

241
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,780
Jiaxin told me last night

242
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,820
that she was leaving.

243
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,900
Where would Jiaxin go?

244
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,220
She really is leaving.

245
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,380
Anna.

246
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,460
You can handle the relationship

247
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
between you and Xiyi yourself.

248
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,940
I'm too old

249
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,700
to meddle in your affairs.

250
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,260
Mom.

251
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,820
Are you really letting her be?

252
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,060
Don't think we'll accept you

253
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,860
just because Jiaxin is gone.

254
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,020
I'm telling you,

255
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,460
I only recognize Jiaxin

256
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,940
as my nephew's wife.

257
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,620
Get lost.

258
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,860
Auntie.

259
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,620
Please believe me.

260
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,060
No matter how long it takes,

261
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,300
I'll show everyone

262
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,300
the sacrifices I've made for Xiyi

263
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,620
and my feelings for him,

264
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,060
Auntie.

265
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,740
Get out.

266
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,460
Heck.

267
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,540
If you want to move on from a sorrowful past,

268
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,100
then Hungary

269
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,180
may be the best place.

270
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,780
In the first week,

271
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,820
she furrowed her brows.

272
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,300
In the second week,

273
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,620
she started to talk.

274
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,020
In the third week,

275
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,980
she went outdoors
to take a walk with me on Sunday.

276
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:18,940
This is

277
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,100
a famous location in Budapest

278
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,820
which is called the Love Locks.

279
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,980
It's said that lovers
from all around the world

280
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,380
would write their names on the locks,

281
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,540
so they would be locked together.

282
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,260
This way.

283
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,900
I'm here.

284
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,020
Yasmin.

285
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,180
Let's go.

286
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,620
Mom, where are you?

287
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,980
Mom.

288
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,700
Mom, where are you?

289
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,820
Mom, where are you?

290
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,700
Mom.

291
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,620
Hey.

292
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,700
Where is your mom?

293
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,980
Don't worry.

294
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,300
I will help you find your mom.

295
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,260
Okay?

296
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,300
William.

297
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,620
Thank you for taking care of my child.

298
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,300
No worries. Your child is lovely.

299
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,260
Your wife is really kind.

300
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,420
You're a lucky man.

301
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,740
Thank you.

302
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,100
Thank you. Bye.

303
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,180
Come on, Jiaxin.

304
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,580
Hey,

305
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,380
you can speak Hungarian.

306
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,540
Why did you stand by just then?

307
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,540
Because you've started

308
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,260
to rely on your own strength

309
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,860
when faced with problems.

310
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,220
Chen Jiaxin,

311
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,180
you're very attractive that way.

312
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,060
Then

313
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,860
what did that boy's mother say?

314
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,500
She said...

315
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,500
She said you were a strong
and considerate girl.

316
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,940
You would succeed for sure.

317
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,220
I haven't thought about

318
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,020
achieving success.

319
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,140
I just hoped to come here,

320
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,740
forget about my past

321
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,500
and start over in life.

322
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,180
Judging by your current state,

323
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,700
I think you can do it.

324
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,540
I hope so.

325
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,860
Come on.

326
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,140
I have got the lunch box ready.

327
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,860
Keep up the good work today.

328
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,060
Waking up after a business dinner night,

329
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,300
he tends to have a headache,
stomachache and loss of appetite.

330
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,020
Give him a bowl of chicken soup
to warm his stomach.

331
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,420
Then let him have some bland
and healthy food.

332
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,340
His suit has been ironed.

333
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,300
The shirt paired with his suit
is in the rightest corner of the drawer.

But

417
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,980
why Hungary?

418
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,700
Paris and Italy

419
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,700
are recognized art centers.

420
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,900
You don't understand.

421
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,780
During the Renaissance,

422
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,860
Hungary established itself as the center

423
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,860
of European arts and cultures

424
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,860
under King Matthias Corvinus' rule.

425
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,420
Besides,

426
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,980
going to Paris or Italy

427
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,620
to pursue art

428
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,260
sounds cheesy.

429
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,620
It's not my style.

430
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,060
It's many people's dream.

I like the coexistence of
Eastern and Western cultures here.

439
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,380

00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,420
I prefer teaching you how to fish

451
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,140

452
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,500
to stay here for a long time,

453
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
I need a job

454
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,580

455
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,540
You can work at my art gallery.

456
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,740
A work visa is easy to get.

457
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,100
I thought you wouldn't give me a fish.

458
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,900
I'm giving you a job.

459
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,780
Since you've decided to start over in life,

460
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,340
you'd better not live in ignorance.

461
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,380
Chen Jiaxin,

462
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,780
you need a plan.

463
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,540
Don't worry.

464
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,220
I won't limit myself like I did in the past.

465
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,500
I'll try everything

466
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,740

467
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,740

475
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,460

476
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,180

477
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,980

480
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,460
Why?

481
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,820
I saw a lot of your hair
in the bathroom the other day.

482
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,020
You must have worked too hard
under much pressure these days.

483
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,100
Use this.

484
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,220
It can prevent hair loss.

485
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,460
You won't need to worry
about your hair anymore.

486
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,460
You're being

487
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,500
so considerate today.

488
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,780
Whatever you say.

489
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,740
Well...

490
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,500
I don't know.

491
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,180
What do you mean?

492
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,580
I haven't even asked
and you already said you didn't know.

493
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,860
Drop the act.

494
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,620
You don't fawn upon me for no reason.

495
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,700
You just want to ask about
Chen Jiaxin's whereabouts for someone.

496
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,500
Look at you.

497
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,100
You're really paranoid.

498
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,780
I'm showing my care

499
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,580
and cherishing you from my heart.

500
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,140
Incidentally,

501
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,100
I'd like to ask about Jiaxin's whereabouts.

502
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,820
Incidentally?

503
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,220
Didn't you use my phone?

504
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,180
Didn't you dig into my WeChat messages?

505
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,900
You wanted to see if Jiaxin contacted me.

506
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,020
No.

507
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,060
I was...

508
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,420
Has the cat got your tongue?

509
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,660
I'm telling you,

510
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Jiaxin knows you're Wang Xiyi's scout

511
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,860
and I'm at your side.

512
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,100
So before she left,

513
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,220
she told me to take care of myself
and not to worry about her,

514
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,220
and she'd contact me if she had the chance.

515
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,420
It's your fault in essence.

516
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,500
That's impossible.

517
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,780
You're saying Snail is
so determined to disappear?

518
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,180
Come on, my darling.

519
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
Do you really have no idea

520
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,500
or did she tell you not to tell me?

521
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,180
I have no idea.

522
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,700
I wouldn't tell you even if I knew.

523
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,380
You...

524
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,580
Fine. Great.

525
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,820
Fine.

526
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,180
Hey.

527
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,340
That's for me.

528
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,340
I can't help.

529
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,660
If I can't find Jiaxin,

530
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,140
I'll get reprimanded at the company tomorrow.

531
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,420
I need a drink to calm my nerves.

532
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,740
Ouch. Stop. Stop.

533
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,740
Wife, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

534
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,620
The drink is yours.

535
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,180
I said I'm sorry.

536
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,020
Disgusting.

537
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,340
This is for your foul mouth.

538
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,220
Who says you can call me "wife"?

539
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,300
I will propose. I will propose.

540
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,820
I should be able to call you "wife"
after I propose to you.

541
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,700
You squandered money.

542
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,660
Check the balance in your bank account.

543
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,660
You think we have the money to get married?

544
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,020
I don't have much money in my bank account.

545
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,380
But I have the company's shares.

546
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,060
When the time comes,

547
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,700
I'll be rich in a trice.

548
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,660
So you know it takes time
to cash in your shares.

549
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,500
Then no marriage for us.

550
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,180
You want to jump the gun by proposing to me?

551
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,140
Dream on!

552
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:44,700
You...

553
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,140
Get lost.

554
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,860
Fine. I'll go sleep. I'll go sleep.

555
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,820
I'll go sleep.

556
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,500
Chen Jiaxin.

557
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,180
You are not a tourist.

558
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,100
You came here

559
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,580
to start a new life.

560
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,700
So,

561
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,500
the first step

562
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,780
is to learn about this city.

563
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,660
The second step

564
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,140
is to blend into the local life.

565
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,700
Good afternoon.

566
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,620
I want a...

567
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:56,900
Food.

568
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:57,860
To eat.

569
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,820
I want...

570
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,220
Thank you.

571
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,540
Bye.

572
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,860
The third step

573
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,420
is to live on my own hump

574
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,060
and support myself.

575
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,980
Excuse me.

576
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,220
How can I help you?

577
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,820
Is this your Wanted?

578
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,100
Pardon?

579
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,860
A shop assistant.

580
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,580
Do you need a shop assistant?

581
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,500
I don't understand.

582
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,300
I want to work here.

583
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,100
Sorry.

584
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,460
Look at this.

585
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,300
Can I help you work?

586
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,660
Are you sure?

587
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,380
I can do it very well.

588
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,620
Please.

589
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,580
Alright.

590
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,820
Alright. You can work at my place.

591
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,620
Thank you.

592
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,220
Give me.

593
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,380
The reconstruction of the Chongqing factory

594
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,100
has moved ahead of schedule

595
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,620
by 5%.

596
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,260
So,

597
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,860
it's estimated
the reconstruction of the factory

598
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,180
will be completed one month ahead of time.

599
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,380
That's all for today.

600
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,220
Mr. Yi.

601
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,260
Look at you.

602
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,740
I knew it.

603
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,780
If you want to ask about her,

604
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,780
I can tell you

605
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,420
that I've been monitoring

606
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,660
my girlfriend's every move recently.

607
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,300
I can only say...

608
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,860
I have got nothing.

609
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,420
I think she is trying hard

610
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,500
to prevent you from finding her.

611
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,260
She didn't even tell her bestie
where she was.

612
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
You might as well

613
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,900
ask around on Huaniao island.

614
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,180
There are a lot of people
and loose lips on the island.

615
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,940
Maybe someone

616
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,260
will spill the beans.

617
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,260
I had Zhengren ask around.

618
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,700
The people on Huaniao Island
aren't keeping any secret.

619
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,180
They simply don't know her whereabouts.

620
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,700
Even Jiaxin's cousin,

621
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:42,820
who is a big mouth,

622
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,460
doesn't have any answers.

623
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,540
And every time my mother-in-law

624
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,780
hears someone mention Jiaxin,

625
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,620
she flares out.

626
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,100
No way.

627
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,300
Snail is serious this time.

628
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,340
Let's talk.

629
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,700
Xiyi.

630
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,140
Let's make up.

631
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,100
Anna.

632
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,940
It's over for us.

633
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,460
I love Chen Jiaxin now.

634
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,780
But Chen Jiaxin has left.

635
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
She may have left,

636
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,500
but my love for her won't change.

637
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,020
Why?

638
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,620
I just want a chance to stay with you.

639
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,340
How come Chen Jiaxin
can be with you but I can't?

640
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,380
It's not the same.

641
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,620
How?

642
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,940
I'm supposed to be your girlfriend.

643
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,380
Just because she had a child,

644
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,180
our love doesn't count anymore?

645
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,220
It's all over.

646
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,620
Over?

647
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,860
You just cast aside
our three-year relationship like this?

648
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,460
I can't dance anymore.

649
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,980
I don't even

650
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,300
have much a chance to bear a child.

651
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,500
You felt like taking the responsibility
for Chen Jiaxin.

652
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,140
I need you to give me a chance, at least.

653
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,060
Xiyi.

654
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,060
If Chen Jiaxin hadn't come between us,

655
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,420
we would have been happy, right?

656
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,340
If Chen Jiaxin hadn't come between us,

657
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,820
you would have loved me, right?

658
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,100
But I love Chen Jiaxin now.

659
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:50,580
No.

660
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,420
I don't care.

661
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,780
Your relationship with her has ended.

662
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,460
We can start over.

663
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,460
I'll do my best to prove

664
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,060
that we're a perfect match.

665
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,140
Anna.

666
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,780
You are wasting your time.

667
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,980
This is my choice.

668
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,500
Hello?

669
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,500
Hello? Mom.

670
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,780
Is it noon at your place?

671
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,020
Have you had lunch?

672
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,140
Not yet.

673
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,740
I just went out shopping.

674
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,140
Grab something delicious.

675
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,260
Mom, now you're all on your own,

676
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,220
you need to take care of yourself.

677
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,540
Of course I haven't been
taking care of myself.

678
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,140
Heck. Just think about it.

679
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,900
Zishan always visits me
with Jia Fang in her arms.

680
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,260
I've been busy as a bee.

681
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,820
Hey, hear this out,

682
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,460
Tiancai brought me a fish head

683
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,740
from Han River Course today.

684
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,860
You know what? We made
Steamed Fish Head with Red Peppers.

685
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,340
Hmm.

686
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Yum yum.

687
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,260
The fish head was fat and fresh.

688
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,860
I had two more bowls of rice today.

689
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,820
I'm strolling the streets right now.

690
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,540
Come on, stop tempting me.

691
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,340
I'm going to drool.

692
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,060
Come back if you want to eat it.

693
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,820
Well, it's alright not to have
Steamed Fish Head with Red Peppers.

694
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,340
Goose livers and steaks are even better.

695
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,100
I'm telling you.

696
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,300
Well,

697
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,220
speaking of Zishan

698
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,020
and

699
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,460
Tiancai and your close friend Siqi,

700
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,380
they have been

701
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,740
calling me during every meal

702
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,300
as if working in shifts.

703
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,500
They said now that you were away,
they'd care for me more.

704
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,220
I think they just want

705
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,300
to find out where you are.

706
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,500
You haven't told them, have you?

707
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,020
Of course I haven't told them.

708
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,100
Who do you think I am?

709
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,660
Mom, I can't talk to you anymore.

710
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,940
While talking about
Steamed Fish Head with Red Peppers,

711
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,820
I missed my stop.

712
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,780
Be careful.

713
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,820
Go home as soon as possible.

714
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:30,620
Yeah.

715
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,060
Goodbye.

716
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,700
Okay. Okay. Bye.

717
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,820
Chen Jiaxin!

718
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,500
Sorry.

719
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,420
It feels like

720
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,380
the artist drew

721
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,540
these works casually.

722
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,820
Look.

723
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,460
He didn't even know how to title his works.

724
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,340
I think

725
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,940
this artist is quite interesting.

726
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,700
It's not that he didn't know

727
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,260
how to title his works.

728
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,860
He's just waiting for someone
who can appreciate his works.

729
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,420
So he left a piece of paper and a pen here,

730
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,180
waiting for fate

731
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,100
to introduce someone to him for exchanges.

732
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,420
So that's what you think.

733
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,620
I noticed you've been standing here
for a long time.

734
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,180
Yeah.

735
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,540
Because I think

736
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,900
these paintings

737
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,460
give me a special feeling.

738
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,860
Special?

739
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,020
What kind of special feeling?

740
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,420
They are very

741
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,620
free.

742
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,620
They

743
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,580
aren't bound by each other.

744
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,180
They complement each other.

745
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,260
They have found their true selves.

746
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,100
It's like these paintings

747
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,060
have infinite possibilities.

748
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,500
They are waiting to be discovered,

749
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,820
waiting for fate

750
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,540
to take someone here
to communicate with them.

751
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,460
You're exaggerating a little.

752
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,500
I think these paintings have little value

753
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,220
as exhibits and collectibles.

754
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,820
Then you might have underestimated them.

755
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,380
If I'm not mistaken,

756
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,820
that's Master Zhongshan Long's signature

757
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,260
in the corner.

758
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,460
You have keen eyesight.

759
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,300
Given everything you just said,

760
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,540
what do you think should be their title?

761
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,620
(The Only One)

762
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,140
