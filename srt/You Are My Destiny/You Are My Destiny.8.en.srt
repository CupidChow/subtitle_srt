00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,940
(Episode 8)

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,260
(Special Assistant Office)

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,320
From today onward,

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,000
you will be my special assistant formally.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,040
This is your office.

32
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,120
Now your position is special,

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,640
so your original working place

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,040
will no longer suit you.

35
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,000
Mr. Shen,

36
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,520
I know

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,720
there are no pies dropping from the sky.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,560
Did you

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,720
make such an arrangement

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,440
because of

41
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,920
my relation with Mr. Yi?

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,240
If I were you,

43
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,680
I wouldn't think so much about it.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,880
I would accept the arrangement

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,120
with pleasure.

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,640
From now on,

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,720
you will no longer need to do the printing,

48
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,960
to make tea and to run errands.

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,760
You need not do all such things.

50
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,560
Then,

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,720
what will be the main content

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,040
of my job?

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,040
You will do things

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,900
like attending the art exhibition,

55
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
attending the convention

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,840
and participating in social events

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
on behalf of me.

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,200
This is the musician

59
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,400
Mr. He Run,

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,080
who has long been sponsored
by the Zhou's Corporation.

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,080
In this afternoon,

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
he is about to give a mini concert.

63
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
On behalf of our firm,

64
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,240
you shall go to the concert.

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,000
If you spend money on it,

66
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,380
you can go to the Finance
Dept. for reimbursement.

67
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,360
(Special Assistant Office)

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,600
Jiaxin,

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,200
this is

70
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,320
a good chance for you to
accumulate social resources.

71
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,440
Just jump at it.

72
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,560
I will.

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,960
Mr. Shen,

74
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,120
in the days to come,

75
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,160
if you go to appear in court,

76
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,760
could I

77
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,640
go with you?

78
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,720
Because

79
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,640
I also want to be like you

80
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,360
who can decide his own life.

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
Of course. As you wish.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,800
Thank you!

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,480
There is another thing.

84
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,000
You should spare time to change
your hairstyle, get a facial

85
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,600
as well as buy some clothes you like.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,360
The costs of these things can be reimbursed.

87
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,640
All can be reimbursed.

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,400
Of course.

89
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,280
From now on,

90
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,560
you will represent me and our firm.

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,520
From now on,

92
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,560
please mind the image of our company.

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:42,920
Go for it!

94
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,680
I will do my best.

95
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,160
(Shen Dao Law Firm)
Mr. Yi,

96
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,320
I have made arrangements as you instructed.

97
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,440
Thank you!

98
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,200
In the days to come,

99
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,960
nobody shall order her about and bully her.

100
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,800
Besides,

101
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,840
all her spending will be handled by Anson.

102
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,640
(Shen Dao Law Firm)

103
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,320
Mr. Yi, you are so thoughtful.

104
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,800
It is the honor of our Party B

105
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,400
to have such a magnanimous Party A as you.

106
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,800
She is the mother of my child.

107
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
I don't want her

108
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,040
to be treated as a memo girl

109
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,880
and be kicked out after she is used.

110
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,160
Please look out for her.

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,560
OK. I got it.

112
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,100
(Haifei)

113
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,400
Our competitor has made it
to the Huaniao Island.

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,080
Is there still hope for
our old factory to thrive?

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,920
Zhou Zhan will show off again.

116
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,320
I dare not show off.

117
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,680
I just want to share my joy

118
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,400
with you, my junior schoolmate.

119
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,480
Senior schoolmate, what has brought you here?

120
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,840
(Haifei)
For a business man,

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,920
the most important thing
is to explore opportunities.

122
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,600
Wherever there is a good opportunity,

123
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,560
there will be me.

124
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,600
Good opportunity?

125
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,840
The ecological environment
of the Huaniao Island

126
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,440
can be said to be among the best globally.

127
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,200
Against the backdrop of
pursing healthy life with quality,

128
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,240
only by harnessing the nature,

129
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,960
can we produce

130
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
the health products that
enchant the urban residents.

131
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,960
In your words, this island
is like a paradise.

132
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,760
But the crucial problem is that

133
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,840
the factory here is outmoded

134
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,280
and can't catch up with the times.

135
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,880
No matter how clean the air is

136
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,040
and how lucid the water is,

137
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,000
only the fish and grass on
the island will be happy.

138
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,320
That is the past.

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,720
It used to be operated by impotent people.

140
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
But now it is a different case.

141
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,920
With you,

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,040
a miracle may occur anytime.

143
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,080
You are the person

144
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,520
who can bring the island back to life.

145
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,200
Bro, you are really a talent scout to me.

146
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
If my elder brother and grandma

147
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,160
had your discernment, it would be great.

148
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,120
How about it?

149
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,120
Are you interested in cooperation?

150
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,920
So we can reverse the fate of the island

151
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,640
and you can earn some respect from them.

152
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,640
How can we cooperate?

153
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,880
You know our Soft Water product series

154
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,000
are always unable to meet the demand, right?

155
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,440
Now our company

156
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,760
is planning to upgrade the Soft Water Series.

157
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,000
We are looking for an OEM.

158
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,320
How about it?

159
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,440
Are you interested?

160
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,140
-Be careful!

161
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,720
-It is such a coincidence.

162
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,120
-Are you all right?

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I am fine. Thank you!

164
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,280
What is the matter?

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,760
So

166
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,800
you are a caring and loving man.

167
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,840
Well, why are you here?

168
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,880
As a matter of fact,

169
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,280
I am here

170
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,360
on behalf of my boss.

171
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,280
This is my first participation
in such an important event.

172
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,960
Besides, I know nothing about music.

173
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,880
I am really worried that

174
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,760
I will fall asleep and slobber by then.

175
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,520
Music is good prenatal education.

176
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,160
Really?

177
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,920
Of course.

178
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
Moreover, even if you fall asleep,

179
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,200
the baby will benefit from it.

180
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,640
Here you are.

181
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,560
Thank you!

182
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,880
Anson,

183
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,640
remind the HR Dept. that

184
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,320
those people who are glib-tongued,

185
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,400
don't do real work day in, day out

186
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,320
and swindle money out

187
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,280
of old ladies

188
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,520
shall not be employed in any case.

189
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,520
Jiaxin,

190
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,680
you should ignore

191
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,880
the person who tends to talk big

192
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,560
and orders others about.

193
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,520
Just don't mind him.

194
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,240
He can talk as he likes.

195
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,120
You just do things as you like.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,520
Have you seen it?

197
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,800
Look at this!

198
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,840
It is really Mr. Zhou of Haifei Group.

199
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,320
The younger people are more capable for sure.

200
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,480
Without your recommendation,

201
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,800
we wouldn't have come into contact

202
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,040
with Haifei Group.

203
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,080
If our factory

204
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,600
becomes the OEM of the Soft Water Series,

205
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,080
our parent company won't think about

206
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,080
closing down it all the time

207
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,040
for the sake of automation.

208
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,800
Right.

209
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,080
Though my elder bother Wang Xiyi

210
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,200
take charge of the company now,

211
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,960
I will make decisions about

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,240
a lot of affairs of the
Huaniao Island.

213
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,120
Don't worry, everybody.

214
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,240
In the future,

215
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,400
I will try harder to guide
and teach my elder bother

216
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,440
and will ask the parent company

217
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
to deliver more benefits to you.

218
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,200
Mr. Yi is so lucky to have
a younger brother like you.

219
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,440
We are so lucky to

220
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,920
have you as our leader.

221
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,760
Right, everybody?

222
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,840
Exactly.

223
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,200
Mr. Wang, I am determined to follow you.

224
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,560
Good!

225
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,880
You mustn't abandon us, Mr. Wang.

226
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,200
You mustn't abandon us.

227
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,120
I fell asleep just now.

228
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
It is great disgrace, right?

229
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,280
No, it is not.

230
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,200
A lot of people fall asleep

231
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,600
with the help of the classical music.

232
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,280
You fell asleep,

233
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,720
which proves that he played well.

234
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,160
It is over.

235
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,760
Why don't you leave?

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,080
I am talking with you.

237
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,760
Why don't you go home after the concert?

238
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,960
It is late, so let me escort you home.

239
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,280
Didn't you say just now that

240
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,720
he required you to pretend not to know him?

241
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
If you go with him now,

242
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,160
you will disobey him.

243
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,560
Maybe

244
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,880
he is testing you.

245
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,920
Well, how can you?

246
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,400
Mr. Yi! Mr. Yi!

247
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,640
Come. Come here.

248
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,400
Well, do you really want to escort her home?

249
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,920
But you will have a
business dinner in a while.

250
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,000
I am afraid you may not have enough time.

251
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,600
Besides,

252
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,720
you can't bring her

253
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,720
to the dinner.

254
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,920
Didn't you say that

255
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,200
we should pretend to be strangers outside?

256
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,000
Dylan will escort me home.

257
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,080
You need not worry about me.

258
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,440
I am not worried about you.

259
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,760
Anson,

260
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,520
when is the dinner?

261
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,560
Right away.

262
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,200
Hurry up.

263
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,280
Let's go.

264
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,040
I will take you to

265
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,360
a pop music concert next time.

266
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,320
How do you like it?

267
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,840
I promise you won't fall asleep.

268
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,240
Today I am here to meet you

269
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,600
mainly to discuss about

270
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,920
why over the past several quarters,

271
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,520
especially during the Double Eleventh Event,

272
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,280
your online shopping platform

273
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,240
has been reducing

274
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,240
the ad positions of our company.

275
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,120
Is it because we did not pay
enough for advertising?

276
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,360
We are willing to give you the resources,

277
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,360
but we have to attract traffic.

278
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,680
Now the marketable products in the market

279
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,400
are obviously the Soft Water Series

280
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,520
of Haifei Group.

281
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,760
The highlight of their
products is very fresh.

282
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,400
Be advertised simply,

283
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,840
their sales volume

284
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,680
will soar up.

285
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,640
Compared with their products,

286
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,000
the products of your company

287
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,400
have been outdated.

288
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,200
We don't pursue freshness in the first place.

289
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,040
Whether in terms of market positioning

290
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,160
or in terms of consumer group,

291
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,480
our Heritage products are different
from the Soft Water Series.

292
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,000
If freshness is the advantage of Soft Water,

293
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,200
the highlight of our Heritage

294
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,120
is that it is classical without
changes for several decades.

295
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,520
We want to make products

296
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,560
that can be used by families

297
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,960
in a carefree manner.

298
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,640
In addition,

299
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,200
for the time being, consumers

300
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,360
are just temporarily

301
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,600
attracted by the propaganda
gimmicks of Soft Water.

302
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,920
We will roll out

303
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,560
new marketing schemes as soon as possible.

304
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,320
By then, I hope you can help us.

305
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,680
Come on. I propose this toast to you.

306
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,440
OK.

307
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,040
How are you?

308
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,800
Are you drunk?

309
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,240
I am fine.

310
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,000
I know

311
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,600
Heritage products

312
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,800
mean a lot to you.

313
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,120
However, in the last meeting,

314
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
someone dared to propose

315
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,240
we stop producing them in your face.

316
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,440
As I see it,

317
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,280
our people have really lost faith in them.

318
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:32,960
What?

319
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,080
You also lost faith?

320
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
No, I didn't.

321
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,200
I just report it to you.

322
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,240
Wang Zhengren is the junior schoolmate

323
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,440
of the President of Haifei Group, Zhou Zhan.

324
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,920
They are also on good terms.

325
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,560
Look at this!

326
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,000
It is not a big deal.

327
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,880
But do you think

328
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,680
he will

329
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,400
dupe others outside

330
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,440
in the name of Cheng Jie Group?

331
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,080
Respectable elder brother,

332
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,120
Mr. Zhou of Haifei Group
wants to cooperate with us.

333
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,920
He wants our factory on
the Huaniao Island

334
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,640
to take charge of the production
line of the Soft Water Series.

335
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,120
He gave me some samples.

336
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,400
I will ask sister-in-law to give them to you.

337
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,640
Such a good smell! What is it?

338
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,360
Is elder brother back?

339
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,480
Are you hungry? Would you like one bowl?

340
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,600
Yes.

341
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,360
It is very tasty.

342
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Would you like another bowl?

343
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,600
OK.

344
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,880
I am full. Thank you, sister-in-law.

345
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
Elder brother, you have worked so hard.

346
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,200
You eat first.

347
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,240
About the cooperation proposal from Mr. Zhou...

348
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,320
Now we have been off work.

349
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,040
Let's not talk about work.

350
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,240
OK.

351
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,800
I didn't know you would come back for dinner.

352
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,000
So I used

353
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,200
the ingredients left from the
morning to cook all these.

354
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
It is fine if they can fill up my stomach.

355
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,280
Well,

356
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
about what happened in the afternoon,

357
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:46,920
won't you explain yourself

358
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,120
to me?

359
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,720
What is wrong?

360
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,880
The scent from your body makes me sick.

361
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,800
Listen up.

362
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,280
Don't turn aside from the topic.

363
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,120
I told you not to

364
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,040
reveal our relation outside.

365
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,000
But that didn't mean

366
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,840
you could act like a single woman.

367
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,960
I know.

368
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,600
That's good. From today onward,

369
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,920
you must stay away from Dylan.

370
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,160
Ah, well, mom.

371
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,000
I came across my senior
schoolmate Zhou Zhan today.

372
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,400
He was active in cooperating
with our Cheng Jie Group.

373
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,600
He said he wanted our factory
on the Huaniao Island

374
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,480
to produce the Soft Water
Series for them.

375
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,400
Good son, you didn't let me down.

376
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,080
You finally did something right.

377
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,960
I am telling you.

378
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,800
If you secure the cooperation,

379
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,760
your grandma will definitely

380
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,960
look at you with new eyes in the future.

381
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,400
Right.

382
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,920
I have told you that

383
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,240
with my own capabilities,

384
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,960
I will make great achievement in my career.

385
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,600
However,

386
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,480
I have known Zhou Zhan for a long time.

387
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,000
I know he is a snob.

388
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,720
This time he gave me
the chance so generously.

389
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,280
Do you think it will be a trap?

390
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,120
If I get our group into trouble,
what should I do?

391
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,520
That will be fine.

392
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,360
In that case, the cooperation
will be more necessary.

393
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,360
Mom,

394
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,080
do you hold a grudge

395
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
against grandma?

396
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,600
I got a feeling that you are always trying to

397
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,720
bring down our family.

398
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,680
Crap!

399
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,120
I am doing this for you. Don't you know?

400
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:13,960
Think about it.

401
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,800
If you succeed in this,

402
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,320
you will render outstanding
service for our family.

403
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,160
In case that something goes wrong,

404
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
since you didn't affix
the seal to the contract,

405
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,720
you will not be blamed.

406
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,480
Chen Jiaxin, I haven't done talking.

407
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,440
Why are you evading me?

408
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,000
I want to tell you that

409
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,480
you should stay away from other men.

410
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,400
You are married now.

411
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,720
Chen Jiaxin.

412
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,680
I just rebuked you a bit.

413
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Why are you giving me the cold shoulder?

414
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,040
Sorry! I am not doing this on purpose.

415
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,640
I...

416
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,420
(Anna invites you to a voice call...)

417
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,520
(Speaker. Hang Up. Mute)

418
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,240
I am checking upon you.

419
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,520
You look so scared.

420
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,880
You seem to have done something bad

421
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,160
without letting me know.

422
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,800
Nonsense!

423
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,360
Well,

424
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,880
why do you have time to call me?

425
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
You are odd.

426
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,320
In the past, you often complained that

427
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,400
I didn't call you.

428
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,480
Today I called you, but you are not happy.

429
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,720
Did you really do something

430
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,720
that may disappoint me?

431
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,440
If

432
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,080
I really did such a thing...

433
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,920
I will swallow my dancing shoe.

434
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,120
I don't believe you will do it.

435
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,560
Well, by the way,

436
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,860
I dined together with others.

437
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,800
It is said to be difficult to
maintain long-distance love.

438
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,040
Only a man who is good for nothing

439
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,160
is willing to wait for a girl.

440
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,920
I said my boyfriend is very handsome

441
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,560
and very capable

442
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,600
as well as has no shortcomings.

443
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,840
You

444
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,120
showed off blatantly.

445
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,240
I told the truth.

446
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,040
Today they insisted my
showing them your photos.

447
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,160
I told them to search for your
information with Baidu.

448
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,120
You finally smiled.

449
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,720
Every time I see you,

450
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
I smile.

451
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,080
You lied.

452
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,920
When you picked up the phone,

453
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,760
I saw that you are unhappy.

454
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,160
I,

455
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,280
I just missed you.

456
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,720
Actually,

457
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,680
I really want you to

458
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,920
stay by my side every minute.

459
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,640
Thus,

460
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,760
when I am in trouble,

461
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
you will be my listener.

462
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,880
I won't feel guilty

463
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,200
because

464
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,080
I can't keep you company.

465
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
How about my flying back now?

466
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,200
Let's get married right away, OK?

467
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,440
Didn't you say you would
return the next year?

468
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,920
I expected that you would
jump out of happiness

469
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,400
and would confess love
to me facing the camera.

470
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,120
Xiyi,

471
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,240
you have changed.

472
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,120
I...

473
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,920
I was too excited just now, so...

474
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,160
So I had a slip of tongue.

475
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,960
I just kidded you.

476
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
I miss you, too.

477
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,560
It's so good to have you.

478
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,960
It's so good to have you.

479
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,960
You also go have a rest early.

480
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,000
Bye-bye!

481
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:47,800
Senior schoolmate,

482
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,160
after we build bonds of cooperation,

483
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,920
we will be business partners.

484
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,760
Come on. Cheers!

485
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,720
For sure.

486
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,680
Let's share woe and weal.

487
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,560
Cheers!

488
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,080
Cheers!

489
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,600
Cheers!

490
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,480
Mr. Zhou,

491
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,440
I am very curious about the cooperation

492
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,200
of Haifei Group and
Cheng Jie Group this time.

493
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,080
In some sense,

494
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,360
we are competitors.

495
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,400
In fact,

496
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,560
this has something to do
with my personal feelings.

497
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,480
To be honest,

498
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,520
I grew up

499
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,600
using the Heritage soap.

500
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,400
I have nostalgic feelings for Heritage.

501
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,800
Even if it is outdated,

502
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,960
it need not be eliminated.

503
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,440
Therefore, I hope that

504
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,640
the orders our Haifei places with you

505
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,320
can save Heritage.

506
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,680
After all, many consumers

507
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,320
are deeply attached to this brand like me.

508
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,840
A business partner like Mr. Zhou

509
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,080
who is both capable

510
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,840
and humane

511
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,920
is really rare.

512
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,040
Elder brother, this is the
contract prepared by them.

513
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,680
I think we need not think any longer.

514
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,680
Anson,

515
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,160
take the contract to our legal counsel

516
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,440
and then to our Chairman.

517
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,080
OK.

518
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:56,960
Mr. Zhou,

519
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,720
I will give you our reply
as soon as possible.

520
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,840
Mr. Yi,

521
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,560
today

522
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,400
I am here to sign the contract

523
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,160
with the greatest sincerity.

524
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,520
Why need it to be eyed by your Chairman?

525
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,200
Could it be that

526
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,360
you don't trust me?

527
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,720
Or may it be that

528
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,040
you

529
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,880
disdain to

530
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,200
cooperate with our Haifei Group?

531
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,920
Right, elder brother.

532
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,320
Why need you think about it?

533
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,000
Mr. Zhou,

534
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,440
you need not

535
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,640
give me such a bad name.

536
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,200
I attach great importance to our cooperation,

537
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,400
so I am very cautious

538
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,160
and want our Chairman
to look over the contract.

539
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,680
In addition,

540
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,560
it is a normal procedure
to let the legal counsel

541
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,280
check the contract before signing it.

542
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,280
Haifei Group is a big company.

543
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,520
The procedures of your company
should be finer than ours.

544
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,040
Why are you in such a
hurry to sign the contract?

545
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,240
Could the product be defective

546
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:52,800
or

547
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,960
could the contract be defective?

548
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,240
Mr. Yi, you got a point.

549
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,360
Everything is fine.

550
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,120
However,

551
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,040
Mr. Yi,

552
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
I must remind you that

553
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,000
you are only given one chance.

554
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,160
I will grant you one day for consideration.

555
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,960
OK. OK. Come on.

556
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,960
Dig in. Dig in.

557
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,160
Stop talking.

558
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,080
Come on, elder brother.

559
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,160
Come on. Come on.

560
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,480
Come on, Mr. Zhou.

561
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,040
Thank you!

why are you here?

thank you for your help.

Thanks to you, the Japanese side agreed to

lend us the authentic work of Toho Siotsuki.

570

It is not easy.

If more people come to know

572

the works of the Fauvism,

573
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,120
Mr. Siotsuki must feel happy

in the other world.

575

I will go greet her.

OK.

578
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,120
Curator, just go on with your business.

579
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,400
OK.

580
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,600

581
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,560
are you fine?

Help me hail a taxi.

583
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
I want to go home.

584
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Let me take you to the hospital first.

585
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
You'd better have a health check.

586
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,000
Take care.

(Haifei Group)

588
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,280
Doctor Hao,

589
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,080
she said she always has a desire to vomit.

590
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,280
And she also feels dizzy.

591
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,040
Is there something wrong with her body?

592
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,840
Or is it the normal pregnancy reaction?

593
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,000
Is there any way to alleviate these symptoms?

594
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,600
From the results of the blood test,

595
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,480
it can be seen that all
indicators are normal.

596
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,680
She may be just suffering

597
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,960
the vomiting during pregnancy.

598
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,800
This usually occurs to the
woman carrying her first baby.

599
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,680
Generally, all these symptoms

600
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
will decrease three months later.

601
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,920
I suggest you have a light
diet during this period

602
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,640
and not eat too much nutritious food.

603
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,720
Well, if I do that,

604
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,360
my baby may lack nutrition.

605
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,000
During the first three months,

606
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,160
the fetus is as small as a grain of rice

607
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,040
and is only several millimeters in size.

608
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,480
He only needs a small amount of nutrition.

609
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,800
Your words make sense.

610
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,720
Actually, the nutrition you
absorb during this period

611
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,120
will only make you gain weight.

612
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,080
However, I must remind you that

613
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,520
the fetus is very small and fragile,

614
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,920
and may be affected by your mood easily.

615
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,640
Thus, during this period,

616
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,600
you must keep yourself in a good mood.

617
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,280
Thus, the fetus can grow safely.

618
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,640
Should she have more meals
and eat less every time?

619
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,960
Can various Vitamin B complex

620
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,800
alleviate her vomiting?

621
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,440
It's rare that a husband

622
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,000
knows so much about pregnancy.

623
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,760
You have found a good husband.

624
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,680
-He is not my husband.
-I am not.

625
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,080
He is my friend.

626
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,760
My husband is too busy

627
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,760
to accompany me here.

628
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,680
Nonsense!

629
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,400
Nothing is as important as
accompanying his wife

630
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,680
as well as taking care of his wife and baby.

631
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,320
Ask your husband to accompany you

632
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,880
to the prenatal examination next time.

633
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,200
I will teach him.

634
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,440
Doctor, you misunderstood.

635
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,560
My husband really loves this baby.

636
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,160
He married me

637
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,360
because I got pregnant.

638
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,440
What?

639
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,400
He married you only because you are pregnant.

640
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,760
The baby is a life.

641
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,960
He is not the product of your selfishness.

642
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,000
No. No.

643
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,680
Doctor, you misunderstood again.

644
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,560
He is not like that.

645
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,560
Otherwise,

646
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,800
I would have had an abortion.

647
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,760
What did you say?

648
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,680
No. It's not like that.

649
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,080
Sorry, doctor! Sorry!

650
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,640
I put my foot in my mouth again.

651
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,360
Stop, Jiaxin. Stop explaining.

652
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,840
Doctor Hao, thank you!

653
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,080
Let's go.

654
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,320
Goodbye, doctor!

655
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,680
OK. OK.

656
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,720
I got it.

657
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,240
I have sent personnel to get it.

658
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,280
Grandma!

659
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,000
Grandma!

660
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,480
Thank you!

661
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,360
Grandma!

662
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,000
Grandma!

663
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,440
Haven't you gone to work?

664
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,400
Grandma,

665
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,600
we must sign the contract
with Haifei Group hurriedly.

666
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,080
It is such a rare chance.

667
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,880
It can not only save our company,

668
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,760
but also enable us to make a killing.

669
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,440
You can't be as stubborn as my elder brother.

670
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,120
Xiyi has sent me the contract.

671
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,000
I am still looking over it.

672
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,760
Why are you

673
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,960
in such a hurry

674
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
like a money climbing in the tree?

675
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,440
Zhengren,

676
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,320
you must be calm and prudent in business.

677
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,720
Grandma,

678
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,840
I will learn

679
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,360
your philosophy of life and success later.

680
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,640
Now the important thing is that

681
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,800
we are only granted one day.

682
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,720
If we let this chance slip,

683
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,360
what will happen to our factory on the Island

684
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,360
and what can we do to
save our Heritage product?

685
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,080
Hurry to sign the contract.

686
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,880
Grandma,

687
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,440
no matter what scruple

688
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,880
and what question you have,

689
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,400
I can tell Zhou Zhan.

690
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Now he is in a hurry, too.

691
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,200
He will agree to any proposal we put forward.

692
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,080
Fine. Fine.

693
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,280
Let's do it this way.

694
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,880
You go to the Finance Dept.
to fetch the contract.

695
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,720
OK. OK. OK.

696
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,720
I must tell you in advance that

697
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,880
I will ask the financial personnel
to add one clause.

698
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,680
If the other party doesn't agree to it,

699
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,200
we will have to call off the cooperation.

700
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,040
Thank you, Grandma!

701
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,520
This is for you.

702
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,160
The snail on it is so lovely.

703
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Will you try it on?

704
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,440
Thank you!

705
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,520
I will try it on.

706
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,840
It seems that I can't even smell the coffee.

707
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,560
Right.

708
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,280
You are always sensitive to smell, right?

709
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,840
Thus, this may help you.

710
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,480
Hmm.

711
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
Thank you! I like it very much.

712
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,160
I also prepared one for myself.

713
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,080
You are also sensitive to smell?

714
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,560
No, I am not.

715
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,560
I suspect that

716
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,080
you have a special aura.

717
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,200
People tend to guess

718
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,800
we are a couple.

719
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,880
Sorry!

720
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,920
I am not her husband.

721
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,000
It suits you a lot.

722
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,520
Where did you

723
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,080
get so many interesting facial masks?

724
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,440
Just now.

725
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,800
I bought them.

726
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,640
In this way, people won't
make guesses about us.

727
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,320
Thank you!

728
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,240
I'd like a cup of Americano.

729
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:18,880
I will take it away.

730
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,160
Mom.

731
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,560
Did you get the thing?

732
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,960
Yes.

733
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,920
Well, what is it?

734
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,760
Why must I fetch it in person?

735
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,360
Can't you have it sent by express delivery?

736
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,680
Hurry to bring it back and you'll know.

737
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,720
Hmm.

738
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,120
Don't look at it while you are outside.

739
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,200
I will go back right now.

740
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,960
How can you drink it with
your facial mask on?

741
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,200
Take it off.

742
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,200
Isn't that Chen Jiaxin?

743
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,640
I just know that

744
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,200
she is not so simple.

745
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,560
It is great.

746
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,280
Frist, my son

747
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,960
secured a large order for our company.

748
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,320
Now I found out

749
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,040
Chen Jiaxin is having an affair.

750
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,040
This time my son and I

751
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,160
have contributed a lot to our Wang family.

752
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,720
Mom!

753
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,360
Mom, Listen! Something is wrong.

754
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,640
Something serious happened.

755
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,720
Let me tell you.

756
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,240
Give it to me.

757
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,440
It is that

758
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,240
Chen Jiaxin,

759
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,840
your granddaughter-in-law

760
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,120
is not a decent person.

761
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,920
Just now I saw her

762
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,680
have a date with Dylan.

763
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,000
Right. You see.

764
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,200
You made the same reaction.
You are angry, right?

765
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,680
She blackened the name of

766
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,920
our Wang family, right?

767
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Zhengren has been led astray

768
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,080
by you.

769
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,320
You are short-sighted and selfish.

770
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,920
Our Wang family was almost humiliated by him.

771
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,360
What does this have to do with Zhengren?

772
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,760
Zhengren didn't seduce Chen Jiaxin.

773
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,720
Jiaxin told me that

774
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,120
after Xiyi had the shower last night,

775
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,480
she began to feel sick.

776
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,240
After I checked it out,

777
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,320
I found he used the shampoo

778
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,200
made by Haifei Group.

779
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,400
I sent it to be tested.

780
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,400
It turned out that

781
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,920
the aroma of the shampoo

782
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,320
is synthesized with phthalate.

783
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,840
What is that p-thing?

784
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,800
I can't understand.

785
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,880
Phthalate is the plasticizer.

786
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,200
It makes the shampoo more fragrant

787
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,280
and the hair smoother.

788
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,400
But it is actually toxic.

789
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,520
It not only increases the chances of cancer,

790
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,000
but also does harm to the fetus

791
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,520
in the womb of the pregnant woman.

792
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:51,880
Ah!

793
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,520
Well, what should we do now?

794
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,720
Zhengren

795
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,480
acted so rashly

796
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,040
and didn't think thoroughly.

797
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,400
I will ask our company to
suspend the contract.

798
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,000
Mom. Mom.

799
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,800
Please don't.

800
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,320
It has come to such a critical moment.

801
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,760
Could you turn a blind eye to it?

802
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,200
You see,

803
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,520
living in modern times,

804
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,720
everyone comes into contact
with chemicals every day.

805
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,560
They won't eat them, mom.

806
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,400
It won't be found out.

807
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,560
The Quality Supervision Dept. of
the Bureau of Industry and Commerce

808
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,480
will not look on and do nothing.

809
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,240
If they knew that we make such products,

810
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,320
our good reputation that has
lasted for decades will be ruined.

811
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,720
I didn't expect that

812
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,200
you make light of our reputation so much.

813
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,440
You also don't cherish your own reputation.

814
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,240
Enough, mom!

815
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,000
I have got it.

816
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,840
Why must you speak ill of me?

817
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,120
Why did I do this?

818
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
I did this because I am
worried about our family

819
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,240
and worried about Zhengren.

820
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,520
I know that you look down upon me.

821
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,400
But you can't show partiality for

822
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,320
Wang Xiyi.

823
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,600
My son has been working so hard,

824
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,920
but you just think poorly of him.

825
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,840
Why did he do this?

826
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
He did this just to make some achievements

827
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,400
to win your recognition.

828
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,160
What is wrong? Why is he wrong?

829
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,920
I don't think he did anything wrong.

830
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,680
You look down upon me and
blame me for everything.

831
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,200
You lecture me every day.

832
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,760
Right. Zhengren is my son.

833
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:02,920
Zhengren

834
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:03,880
is...

835
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,760
Mom.

836
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,560
Mom.

837
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,920
Mom.

838
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,520
Mom.

839
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,960
Mom, don't scare me!

840
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,520
Grandma, I am back.

841
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Why is she back at this time?

842
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,240
Grandma.

843
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,400
Mom.

844
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,160
Mom, wake up!

845
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,840
Mom.

846
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,360
What is the matter?

847
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,880
Why is grandma in a coma?

848
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,200
Well, it is because

849
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,400
your grandma

850
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,400
saw these pictures in my cell phone.

851
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,320
It is not what you expected.

852
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,360
We just ran into each other.

853
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,560
He saw that I didn't feel well.

854
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,280
So he accompanied me to
have the prenatal examination.

855
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,160
Who will believe that?

856
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,000
You know that grandma dotes on you.

857
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,760
Why could you do this to her?

858
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,360
Enough!

859
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,600
Doctor.

860
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,560
How is my grandma?

861
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,320
Now the patient is not in stable conditions.

862
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,520
You'd better arrange family to wait upon her

863
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,960
and pay close attention to her recovery.

864
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,400
I can do it.

865
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:18,760
Let me do it.

866
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,640
No, you can't.

867
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,160
Thank you, doctor!

868
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,840
Xiyi.

869
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,520
Jiaxin,

870
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,960
you are pregnant, so you can't stay up late.

871
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,400
Auntie, you go pack grandma's clothes

872
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,120
and come back tomorrow.

873
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,640
Anson, you shall stay here tonight.

874
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,280
OK.

875
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,360
Let's do what we should do.

876
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,000
Don't become flurried.

877
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,840
Xiyi.

878
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,160
Xiyi, well.

879
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,280
If I had accompanied you
to the prenatal examination,

880
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,520
such a thing wouldn't have happened, right?

881
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,160
I didn't want to trouble you.

882
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,560
So you'd rather trouble an outsider.

883
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,520
Dylan is a friend of you and grandma.

884
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,440
I am your husband.

885
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,680
I meant that

886
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,320
I am Ximi's dad.

887
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,600
I am responsible for

888
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,280
the health of you two.

889
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,200
I thought

890
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,280
our marriage is just a
marriage of convenience.

891
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,720
Chen Jiaxin,

892
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,040
could you be an obedient woman?

893
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,680
Could you stop being self-opinionated?

894
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,660
(Disqualified upon Inspection)

895
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,080
Mom.

896
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,240
Mom.

897
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,680
Mom.

898
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,120
Chen Jiaxin caused grandma
to fall into a coma.

899
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,200
Now she is in the hospital.

900
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,080
In terms of seniority, you
come first in our family now.

901
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,320
You must make decisions.

902
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,200
How can you allow Chen Jiaxin

903
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,520
to continue staying in our Wang family.

904
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,360
Your grandma is old

905
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,480
and her body is weak.

906
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,160
We can't blame Chen Jiaxin for all.

907
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,280
Well.

908
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,840
Grandma is in such bad conditions now.

909
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,280
Why can you care so little?

910
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,760
I have told you that

911
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,040
it is not time to hold
Chen Jiaxin accountable.

912
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,840
You should behave yourself,

913
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,120
keep your eyes wide open

914
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,120
and do your own business.

915
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,920
That will help our family a lot, all right?

916
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,880
Ah, wait up.

917
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,200
Have you signed the contract

918
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,800
with Zhou Zhan?

919
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:42,960
Yes, I did.

920
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,200
I brought the stamped contract

921
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,080
to Zhou Zhan myself.

922
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,920
I also told him I convinced grandma

923
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,000
and my elder brother didn't know.

924
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,400
I urged him to affix the seal to it

925
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,680
in case that things may change.

926
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,600
Guess what?

927
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,560
He stamped it without even reading it.

928
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,560
He also said that he only trusted
me in our Cheng Jie Group.

929
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
The most important thing is
that I had it done in one day.

930
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,840
Am I awesome?

931
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,320
Fine. Fine.

932
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,520
It has been a long day. Hurry to go to bed.

933
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,560
Then I will go to bed.

so that you won't see me and be angry.

961
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,640
I will take good care of myself.

962
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,920
I will go to visit grandma

963
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,520
frequently.

964
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,640
Your suits have been ironed.

965
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,800
The shirts are in the rightmost
part of the drawer.

966
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,560
Besides...

967
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,700
(Breakfast is ready, don't drink coffee on
an empty stomach, eat something first)

968
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
(If you have a social engagement,
remember don't drink on an empty stomach)

969
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,040
Snail,

970
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,000
you nagged so much.

971
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,920
Is this your reason for leaving?

972
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,160
The courier should arrive in the afternoon.

973
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,440
Why is the doorbell ringing in the morning?

974
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,320
Jiaxin.

975
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,600
What happened?

976
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,320
Come in quickly.

977
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,440
Hurry to get seated.

978
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,800
Sit down quickly.

979
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,680
Did he divorce you?

980
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,720
Did his family treat you as a maid?

981
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,960
If not, tell me

982
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,760
how Wang Xiyi

983
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,880
bullied you on earth.

984
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,320
He didn't bully me.

985
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,720
Then what happened?

986
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,160
Siqi,

987
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,960
I seem to have done something wrong

988
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,200
and caused grandma to be hospitalized.

989
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,840
Now the Wang family hates to see me.

990
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,600
Good gal.

991
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,000
It's all right.

992
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,720
I am with you.

993
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,080
It's OK.

994
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,160
Mr. Yi,

995
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,200
as for the sales channels
in the southern China,

996
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,000
the relevant contract will
expire in three months.

997
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,400
The distributors

998
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
have put forward some new terms.

999
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,040
Thus, we must renegotiate with them.

1000
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,440
If you don't have time for lunch,

1001
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,400
you can eat the food in this lunch box.

1002
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
Our new product development
cooperation with Haifei Group

1003
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
has kicked off formally.

1004
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,480
Afterwards,

1005
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,440
you and

1006
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,360
Zhou Zhan will be invited to

1007
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,800
attend the kicking-off and
ribbon-cutting ceremony.

1008
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,880
Ah, here comes Snail.

1009
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,840
I know you are angry with her.

1010
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,520
I am not.

1011
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,920
She can't make me angry.

1012
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,120
In my eyes,

1013
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,560
she is the same as air.

1014
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,160
Hmm.

1015
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,240
Just now you were not angry with her?

1016
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,360
She has caused Chairman
to fall down in a faint.

1017
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,320
She is not so capable.

1018
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,520
Think about what happened three years ago.

1019
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,800
Grandma disregarded ties of blood

1020
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,080
and drove Auntie to abroad.

1021
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,840
So, how could she have a heart attack

1022
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,920
just because of several photos?

1023
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,400
So you mean that

1024
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,480
Chairman didn't pass out

1025
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,280
because she saw the photos
of Dylan and Jiaxin.

1026
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,880
Why didn't you say so back then?

1027
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,840
When Grandma passed out,

1028
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,160
Auntie was the only person with her.

1029
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,040
Do you think I can ask her about the truth?

1030
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,400
Well, we will have to wait for
Chairman to come round

1031
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,680
to make clear of things.

1032
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,520
I am worried that after grandma wakes up,

1033
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,840
she will find Chen Jiaxin has left

1034
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
and will pass out again.

1035
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,600
Right.

1036
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,560
How could you let Snail leave?

1037
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,880
You are the person

1038
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,160
to blame.

1039
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,000
She...

1040
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,760
Well, Mr. Yi,

1041
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,280
I-I-I...

1042
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:16,880
I mean that,

1043
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,880
I mean that

1044
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,800
you'd better ask her to come back quickly.

1045
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,040
After all, it's your fault
to let her leave home.

1046
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,120
You are her husband.

1047
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,920
She looks tender and meek like a snail.

1048
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,720
I didn't expect that she is so stubborn

1049
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,800
when she gets angry.

1050
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,160
It is simple.

1051
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,240
Just deprive her of

1052
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,640
her shelter.

1053
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,280
Then she will be like a
snail without its shell.

1054
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,520
She won't have a roof over her head.

1055
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,680
She can only come back to you.
