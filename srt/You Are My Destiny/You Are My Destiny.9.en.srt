(Episode 9)

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,320
Quickly, go in.

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,920
Ms. Chen, who's this?

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,240
Well, Siqi,

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,880
Jiaxin has moved out.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,720
I can't keep her room vacant.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,160
I found you a new roommate.

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,920
Are you male or female?

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,360
How weird that question is.

36
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,120
I

37
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,840
am 100% a real man

38
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,160
both on the inside and the outside.

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,320
There you are.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,480
He's male and I'm female.

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,360
We can't live together.

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,680
Don't worry about that.

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,680
This boy is a real gentleman.

44
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,280
He works for a big company

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,680
and won't do anything to you.

46
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,840
Besides, the room has been vacant
for half a month.

47
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,520
I've lost so much money.

48
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,800
I can't even afford to play mahjong now.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,440
Okay, thanks, Ms. Chen.

50
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,240
You two get on with each other.

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,840
I'll be playing mahjong.

52
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,960
I'm gonna be late already.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,280
-See you around.
-Ms. Chen.

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,600
Is that my room?

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,720
Goodness!

56
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,920
That's my room.

57
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,720
Oh.

58
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Where's mine, then?

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,040
There it is. I'll go myself.

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
Stop. You're trespassing.

61
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,080
Don't bother. Don't bother.

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,680
You can't do this.

63
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,240
What are these?

64
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,040
It's my friend's room.

65
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,840
Well, well,

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,640
Ms. Chen said

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,960
this house can accommodate
two people at most.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
Two people.

69
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,240
So later I will gather

70
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,880
all your friend's things together

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,000
and put them in the hallway.

72
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,200
Tell her to collect them
as quickly as possible.

73
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,520
Can you put yourself in others' shoes?

74
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,320
If you throw her things out,

75
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
do you want her to sleep in streets?

76
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,760
How could I not think of that?

77
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,320
How about this? You move out

78
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,000
and let your friend stay.

79
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,520
Excuse me, I've got to change.

80
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,160
What? I move out?

81
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,600
By the way, let me remind you again.

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,560
Ms. Chen said

83
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,640
this house could only accommodate two people.

84
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,560
If you breach the contract,

85
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,120
you'll be kicked out at any time.

86
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,080
When that happens...

87
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
what a pitiful sight.

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,800
See ya.

89
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,600
I heard Grandma passed out.

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,880
How did it happen?

91
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,560
Auntie said

92
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,080
Grandma saw

93
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
the photo of us being together

94
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,400
and misunderstood my relations with you.

95
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,360
She got very agitated

96
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,960
and fell ill.

97
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,560
Is that true?

98
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,440
I don't believe

99
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,640
that Grandma passed out

100
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,720
because of us

101
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,360
but

102
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,240
given my situation,

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,040
I must consider Grandma's

104
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,040
and Xiyi's feelings before I do anything.

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,720
So we can't see each other again.

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,440
Take this back.

107
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,440
Thank you for helping me so much.

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
You're a good person

109
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,080
but I can't bother you anymore.

110
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,720
So is everything okay with the Wang family?

111
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,160
Did they make life difficult for you?

112
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,400
Now I...

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,120
Hey, Siqi.

114
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,160
Chen Jiaxin, where are you?

115
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
Someone's occupying your room.

116
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,160
Come back now.

117
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,240
That jerk obviously came to cause us trouble.

118
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,360
He looks like a chimpanzee

119
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,320
but he's so good at talking

120
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,520
and I couldn't outargue him.

121
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,560
It's okay.

122
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,560
If I drag you into my trouble,

123
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,160
it'll be hard for you
to explain to the company.

124
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,120
You know what?

125
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
I'll take you to check into a hotel.

126
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,560
Come on.

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,360
No, we can't do that.

128
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,800
I

129
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,680
don't have enough money.

130
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,520
What?

131
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,520
Have I misheard you?

132
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,440
You're married to Wang Xiyi.

133
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,800
You should not have enough time
to spend your money.

134
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,200
When I went out,

135
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,280
I didn't take anything from the Wang family.

136
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,160
I decided to move out myself.

137
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,520
How can I spend their money?

138
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,160
It's okay.

139
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,840
I've got the money.

140
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,240
Let's go!

141
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,440
Jiaxin.

142
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,160
Hi.

143
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,680
Hi.

144
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,040
Jiaxin,

145
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,960
I found you a place to live in.

146
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,600
Just consider it as a good deed of a warm guy

147
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,480
and the last favor from me.

148
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,200
And this.

149
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,320
Let it

150
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,320
stay with you.

151
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,880
Though it didn't bring me any good luck,

152
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,240
it seems to be quite useful to you.

153
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,760
It not only helped you find

154
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,760
your child a dad

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,200
but also a safe home.

156
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,920
I hope on the days to come,

157
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,640
it'll keep protecting you.

158
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's go.

159
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,920
Jiaxin's not coming with you.

160
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,240
She's going home with me.

161
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,760
Come on, Jiaxin.

162
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's go home.

163
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,120
Didn't you see the sticky notes I left you?

164
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,360
Did you discuss it with me

165
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,440
before you left me the sticky notes?

166
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:08,880
You...

167
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,960
you asked me

168
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,960
to be a quiet snail,

169
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,400
agree with everything

170
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,120
and spend this year peacefully, didn't you?

171
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Have I told you to keep

172
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,320
every one of my words in mind?

173
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
Do you mean you want them

174
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,920
to go in one ear and out the other?

175
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,400
Now that you said that,

176
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,680
let's just get things

177
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,800
straight one by one.

178
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,920
Why did you ask him to take you to have

179
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,880
a pregnancy checkup
instead of your nominal husband?

180
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,560
It was an emergency.

181
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,160
I felt dizzy and sick then.

182
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,360
And you happened to see him?

183
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,240
Goodness, she was at the gallery I work for.

184
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,640
Mr. Shen asked me

185
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,320
to sign in

186
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,320
for the company.

187
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,400
I didn't know Auntie would take a photo of us.

188
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,880
Shut up.

189
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,040
Wang Xiyi,

190
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,440
it's not Jiaxin's fault.

191
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,760
Don't take your anger out on her.

192
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,960
Besides, she's pregnant.

193
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,320
Why do you have a finger in every pie?

194
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,480
People who don't know it

195
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,680
will think that you're the child's dad.

196
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,080
Not everyone is as cold as you.

197
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,880
At least I can't bear to see

198
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,000
women, kids and old people suffering.

199
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,600
I asked you to shut up

200
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,320
because I want to tell you

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,200
I believe you have nothing to do
with Grandma's faint.

202
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,080
You trust me?

203
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,400
I believe in Grandma's discernment

204
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,000
and I don't think the person

205
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,000
she trusts will be a bad one.

206
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,080
In addition,

207
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,240
I'm well aware

208
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,560
that you don't have the guts to do that.

209
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,760
Jiaxin,

210
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,360
were you praised

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,840
or insulted?

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,920
Let me warn you one more time.

213
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,280
Jiaxin and I have got married
and held a wedding.

214
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,160
I don't welcome any attentions

215
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
of an outsider to my wife.

216
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,840
It's no business of yours where she lives.

217
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,480
Come on, Jiaxin.

218
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,040
Let's go home.

219
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,920
Get in the car.

220
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,800
Stop watching and go to bed now.

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,440
Yes.

222
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,920
Why do you pretend

223
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,200
that you're okay?

224
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,840
I can see that you're also sad.

225
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,520
Grandma,

226
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,920
you must wake up quickly.

227
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,440
Heritage will live.

228
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
So will you.

229
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,560
We've been agreed on that.

230
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,200
Grandma,

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
you remember our agreement.

232
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
I will definitely turn Heritage around.

233
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,160
You must also keep your promise and wake up.

234
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,920
This time

235
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,640
I will show you a brilliant success.

236
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,240
Keep going.

237
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,480
You can fulfil

238
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,960
what you promised Grandma.

239
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,260
(Joint Ribbon-cutting Ceremony
Heritage & Haifei)

240
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,200
Checked.

241
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,960
Red carpet.

242
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,720
Checked.

243
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,880
Representative.

244
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,400
Still not me.

245
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,640
I stitched up this major deal

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,040
but in the end

247
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,520
I can only watch offstage.

248
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,960
Mr. Wang,

249
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,360
try this pair of scissors
and see if it's good.

250
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Why should I try it?

251
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,040
The one who's cutting the ribbon
on behalf our company

252
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,720
is my brother

253
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,520
but not me.

254
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,040
You should ask him to try it.

255
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,280
Mr. Yi represents Cheng Jie Group

256
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,560
and you represent Huaniao Island

257
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,840
and all workers of the factory.

258
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,600
Am I right?

259
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,800
Yes.

260
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,120
Quick.

261
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,880
Me?

262
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,880
Yes, you.

263
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,120
We all want you

264
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
to cut the ribbon on behalf of us.

265
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,800
The credit for the reopening

266
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,200
of the factory is all yours.

267
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,920
We have thought of

268
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,280
a slogan to introduce you.

269
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,320
Give an enthusiastic welcome

270
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,560
to the representative of workers
from Huaniao Island,

271
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,880
Mr. Wang the younger,

272
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,320
Mr. Wang Zhengren.

273
00:11:49,520 --> 00:12:01,120
Wang Zhengren!

274
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Thanks, everyone. I'm touched.

275
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,080
The masses have sharp eyes.

276
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,080
You're all clear about it.

277
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,520
Who's contributing to the prosperity

278
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,800
of Huaniao Island?

279
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,800
Wang Zhengren!

280
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,240
And who sits in his pleasant office all day,

281
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,320
makes calls, tells his employees off

282
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,760
and tyrannizes just because he's the boss?

283
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,960
Wang Xiyi.

284
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,840
Exactly.

285
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,880
His wife is not a good person either.

286
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,840
She is calculating, acts pitiful

287
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,040
and has no morals.

288
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,600
Didn't you know?

289
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,280
Chen Jiaxin went on
a secret date with another man

290
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,000
and my grandma,

291
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,760
Chairwoman of Cheng Jie Group,

292
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
fainted out of anger.

293
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,120
She's still not awake yet.

294
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
How... how's that possible?

295
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,840
Chen Jiaxin...

296
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
Xishi just told me

297
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,240
the chairwoman liked Chen Jiaxin very much.

298
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,640
Chen Jiaxin shouldn't have done that.

299
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,240
Will it affect Cheng Jie Group's promise

300
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,400
to Huaniao Island?

301
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,320
What do we do?

302
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,800
What do we do?

303
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,440
What?

304
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,560
Resign?

305
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,440
It was so hard for you
to change from an office girl

306
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,600
to Mr. Shen's assistant.

307
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,680
It's a chance Fang Yuwei
and the others can never get.

308
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,040
How could you have that kind of thought?

309
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,800
You wanna quit a job
which your dependence is on?

310
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,920
I object to it.

311
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,800
You said the same

312
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,360
things as Wang Xiyi.

313
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,560
Did he really say so?

314
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,920
Mm.

315
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,040
Jiaxin,

316
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,880
you said you would establish

317
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,600
yourself in Shanghai on your own.

318
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,120
Don't forget about your dream.

319
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,800
Rest easy.

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,280
I won't give up

321
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,000
my own life for a marriage.

322
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,160
That's settled, then.

323
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,080
You can take some time off

324
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,280
but you should never resign.

325
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,040
Mm.

326
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,280
Hey.

327
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,360
Dear, you are my little angel.

328
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,600
Jiaxin,

329
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,360
while you met a little angel,

330
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,640
I was tortured by a demon.

331
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,120
You have no idea

332
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,440
how unbearable the man who lives with me

333
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,560
and looks like a chimpanzee is.

334
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,640
Save me.

335
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,760
Alright, alright.

336
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,160
She thinks she's Gianna Jun.

337
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,040
Can you believe that?

338
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,040
She has made so much noise,

339
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,880
showering and blow-drying
her hair at midnight.

340
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,320
What's worse, she even sings

341
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,240
using her hairdryer as a microphone.

342
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,320
I really want to let everyone know

343
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,120
and have it out with her.

344
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,880
Isn't that perfect?

345
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,800
You like singing.

346
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,440
I like singing

347
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,160
but I don't like to hear her singing.

348
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,440
And when she sings,

349
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,640
she behaves as if she's an opera singer.

350
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,400
How creepy that is
in the middle of the night.

351
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,400
Yes, it's so creepy.

352
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,440
Mr. Yi, boss,

353
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,800
here's the current situation.

354
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,840
I have completed the task of forcing

355
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,360
your wife to go home.

356
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Can I

357
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,720
move back?

358
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,960
Sure.

359
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,640
Thank goodness.

360
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,040
Only if you resign.

361
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,720
What?

362
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,720
Aren't you living there already?

363
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,680
What if one day Chen Jiaxin falls out with me

364
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
and goes back there again?

365
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,040
But Mr. Yi,

366
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,520
so what if you fall out?

367
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,640
Why do you worry so much?

368
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,760
She's not really your wife.

369
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,920
What's that about?

370
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,440
You really think of her as your wife?

371
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,160
What's this?

372
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,280
Isn't it the cooperation plan
with Haifei Group?

373
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,360
Mr. Yi,

374
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,080
come and sit.

375
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,800
Have a cup of tea.

376
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,240
I didn't come to drink tea with you.

377
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,240
Don't worry.

378
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,280
The product has been developing smoothly.

379
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,040
Mr. Zhou,

380
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,880
after we signed the contract,

381
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,120
our R&D departments had

382
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,120
several meetings.

383
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,400
It seems

384
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
we didn't reach a consensus.

385
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,120
How come?

386
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,200
The consensus is that we're developing

387
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,320
the upgraded version of Roushui,

388
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,640
Piaoxiang shampoo.

389
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,400
Piaoxiang will smell better than Roushui

390
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,520
and reach a new height in the world.

391
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,120
Come on.

392
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:21,920
Mr. Zhou,

393
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,560
we talked about cooperation in a new product.

394
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,040
When have we reached that consensus?

395
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,320
Mr. Yi,

396
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,320
Heritage has come to a dead end

397
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,560
and lost its brand value.

398
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,400
Otherwise,

399
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,880
would Cheng Jie have ended up

400
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,520
being the OEM of Piaoxiang?

401
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,920
Mind your wording, please.

402
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,080
Previously you offered

403
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,320
to cooperate with Cheng Jie

404
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,400
and said that you
had affection for Heritage.

405
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,760
And what happened?

406
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,160
You just turned on a sixpence.

407
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,080
Now that we're cooperating,

408
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,920
why should you make a unilateral decision?

409
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,000
Isn't it just the same?

410
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,280
Mr. Yi,

411
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,520
take my advice.

412
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,760
When we do business,

413
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,560
just focus on the business.

414
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,720
What matters is that we both make money,

415
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,760
isn't it?

416
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,200
If it hadn't been

417
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,360
for Cheng Jie's good image,

418
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,920
I wouldn't have agreed to work with you.

419
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,360
What do you think?

420
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,080
Aren't I considerate of your face?

421
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,640
You're taking advantage of Cheng Jie.

422
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,800
That's right.

423
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,440
I am taking advantage of you. What's wrong?

424
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,560
Okay, then we'll...

425
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,280
Don't say you're not cooperating with us.

426
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,400
We've signed a contract.

427
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,680
It clearly specifies

428
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,880
that Haifei will be in charge of the product.

429
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,560
That means

430
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,680
I am calling the tune.

431
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,760
Mr. Yi,

432
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,000
just sit at your office

433
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,080
and sign the confirmation.

434
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,240
You can't meddle in things about the product.

435
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,760
Just stay out of them.

436
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,240
What if I say no?

437
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,840
Then you'll wait until you make

438
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,280
Heritage sell well

439
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,600
and your stock prices rebound

440
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,680
before we decide who's in charge.

441
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,600
Mr. Zhou,

442
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,160
to be frank with you,

443
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,440
I think your taste in tea

444
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,200
is really bad.

445
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
I could never expect

446
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,480
Zhou Zhan would burn his bridges so quickly.

447
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,160
He said he wanted to help Heritage

448
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,880
and now he's making use of Cheng Jie

449
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,040
to promote Piaoxiang.

450
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,360
What a sly man.

451
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,800
Alright, take it easy.

452
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,880
Don't get too angry.

453
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,120
The chairwoman has fallen ill.

454
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,240
If anything happens to you,

455
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,640
the company will really be done for.

456
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,440
Grandma, we're using up the soap.

457
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,480
Give me your hand.

458
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,200
Look.

459
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,280
Press it.

460
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,080
Look.

461
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
They're stuck together.

462
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,040
That's right.

463
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,240
That is the meaning of Heritage.

464
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,080
It's real and conclusive.
It's natural and invisible.

465
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,440
The meaning of Heritage.

466
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,280
Grandma,

467
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,000
what should I do?

468
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,960
Where are you going?

469
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,480
I haven't washed my hands yet.

470
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,080
Wait for me. Wait for me.

471
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,160
Heritage has been given
a steady approval rating

472
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,160
only by target customers that are over 50.

473
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,280
The report is right.

474
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,040
But however high the approval rating is,

475
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,120
the sales are still decreasing year by year.

476
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,520
And there are more and more new products now.

477
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,760
Heritage has been defined
as an old product.

478
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,800
Young people won't buy old products.

479
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,640
Who says that?

480
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,080
The Market Analysis Dept.

481
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,840
Analyzing

482
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,520
is just to organize data for people

483
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,360
to understand.

484
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,200
It's not the truth.

485
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,320
Selling is a kind of creation.

486
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,440
Only when we do better

487
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,440
will analysts have things to do.

488
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,040
Many large enterprises abroad

489
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,920
are also trying to turn themselves around.

490
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,120
But Mr. Yi,

491
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,440
the point is that we have had

492
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
so much trouble already.

493
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,040
The quickest way to make a profit now

494
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,640
is to work with Haifei Group.

495
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,000
Of course we can't just rely on

496
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,600
our brute strength
and will to save Heritage.

497
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,200
We need a method, don't we?

498
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,120
The method

499
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,040
is here.

500
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,320
Hao Yongjun,

501
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,920
an authority on obstetrics at home

502
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,400
and a consultant to WHO.

503
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,000
I know this person.

504
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,400
He's quite famous.

505
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,240
A friend of mine who just had a baby

506
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,040
mentioned him to me.

507
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,480
He writes a column
for many authoritative periodicals

508
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,360
and disseminates pregnancy knowledge on TV.

509
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,280
Yes.

510
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,400
If he endorses Heritage,

511
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
our image will be improved

512
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,880
and people will talk about it.

513
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,600
You finally appeared.

514
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,080
I thought you were
the incarnation of sticky notes.

515
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,800
Sticky notes

516
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,120
are quite useful.

517
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,920
You can use them to tell
people things without seeing them.

518
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,640
My colleagues

519
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,840
all communicate with me like this.

520
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,080
They put a sticky note on my desk
to tell me what to do.

521
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,360
You haven't

522
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,360
used Roushui recently?

523
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,640
I won't use it anymore.

524
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,520
In that care,

525
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,240
can I put it away?

526
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,560
Why?

527
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,600
It seems I'm sensitive to its smell.

528
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,680
Don't get me wrong.

529
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,480
I'm not particular
about our personal care products.

530
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,760
Doctor Hao said

531
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,000
pregnant people needed to
avoid pungent smells.

532
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,720
Doctor Hao?

533
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,480
Do you mean Doctor Hao Yongjun?

534
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,160
Yes.

535
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,560
How did you meet him?

536
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,160
He's my obstetrician.

537
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,720
I have pregnancy checkups at his office.

538
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,640
Oh,

539
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,200
what's he like?

540
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,000
He's quite nice

541
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,560
but...

542
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,640
What?

543
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,720
I don't dare to say it.

544
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,440
Say it now.

545
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,360
He said

546
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,440
you never came with me
for my pregnancy checkups

547
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,240
or

548
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,240
showed up in Moms' Classroom.

549
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,400
He said

550
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,320
you weren't

551
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,840
a qualified

552
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,920
dad.

553
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,840
I didn't even know

554
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,960
who her obstetrician was.

555
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,520
Why did you come back?

556
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,240
Don't you have a class this afternoon?

557
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,320
How did you know?

558
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,480
I called the hospital.

559
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,840
Did you bring the textbook?

560
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:08,880
Mm.

561
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,360
Stop staring at me, then.

562
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,440
Let's go.

563
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,080
Yes.

564
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,200
If our marriage weren't an accident

565
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,440
and like other couples,

566
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,280
we'd been through rapid heartbeats,
a crush, a courtship

567
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,120
and finally entrusted each other
with our happiness,

568
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,000
would we be just like this?

569
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,640
What are you thinking?

570
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,120
Nothing.

571
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,320
Right.

572
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,600
Don't these people have to work?

573
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,040
Why do they have time to have classes here?

574
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,000
Alright,

575
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,960
today we talked about
how to massage your hands.

576
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,440
Please remember it, everyone.

577
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,520
That's it for this class.

578
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,760
You can go now.

579
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,240
Hello, Doctor Hao.

580
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,680
Hi.

581
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,560
Doctor Hao.

582
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,200
Hello, Doctor Hao,

583
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,520
I'm Jiaxin's husband.

584
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,360
My name is Wang Xiyi.

585
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,600
A big name. You seldom come here.

586
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,400
I was too busy before and couldn't come

587
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,040
for the previous
pregnancy checkups and classes.

588
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,880
I felt rather unsettled.

589
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,560
Later I realized

590
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,200
that the baby would only grow up once.

591
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,920
I mustn't miss

592
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,200
such a precious experience.

593
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,800
If our child needs anything in the future,

594
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,400
just tell me straightforwardly.

595
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,800
I'll ask Anson to change my schedule

596
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,760
and put you first.

597
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,440
That's more like it, lad.

598
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,680
Your wife's condition changes easily.

599
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,280
You've got to care more about her.

600
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,000
You had a bad appetite recently

601
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,960
and often threw up, right?

602
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,040
Let's eat something light.

603
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,960
I know several Japanese restaurants nearby.

604
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,400
I'll take you to have sashimi later.

605
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,120
(Heritage Soap Factory)
Have you used Haifei's shampoo?

606
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,160
I used it yesterday

607
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,720
and my hair smelled so good

608
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,040
that my wife couldn't help smelling it.

609
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,640
I'll never need to use it.

610
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,040
Mr. Wang, you're here.

611
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,800
Mr. Wang.

612
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,360
Drink some water.

613
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,960
Sit, sit, sit. Don't stand on ceremony.

614
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,840
Thank you so much.

615
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,720
We're counting on your leadership

616
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,480
to safeguard the future of Huaniao Island.

617
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,120
If I can be of help,

618
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,360
it doesn't matter however hard it is.

619
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,240
I hope our cooperation
with Haifei will go smoothly.

620
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,880
Perhaps when Grandma hears this good news,

621
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,080
she'll wake up early.

622
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,800
If you want my opinion,

623
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,400
it's all Chen Jiaxin's fault.

624
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
The chairwoman was so nice to her

625
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
and she messed around with other men.

626
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,040
You wretch,

627
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,040
mind your language.

628
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,360
Did you see

629
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,240
Chen Jiaxin doing things of that kind?

630
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,280
Mr. Wang the younger
has shown us the picture.

631
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,680
It's indeed improper.

632
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,560
Otherwise, the chairwoman
wouldn't have fallen ill.

633
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,040
Are you out of your mind?

634
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,520
Is Jiaxin that kind of person?

635
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,400
Honey, honey, honey,

636
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,280
don't be angry.

637
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,040
It's bad for the baby.

638
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,960
We're just worried about
the future of the factory

639
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
and safety of the chairwoman.

640
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,280
Let's judge this matter on its merits.

641
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,240
We can't justify a fault,

642
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,720
can we?

643
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,360
Jia Tiancai,

644
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,440
you've also been insane, haven't you?

645
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,880
Fine,

646
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,320
enjoy your last lunch.

647
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,760
I'll never take food to you again.

648
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,400
Honey, honey,

649
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,040
don't... don't... My wife...

650
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,560
Honey, let's talk.

651
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,880
What a short temper she has.

652
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,600
Yes.

653
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,160
Nonsense.

654
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,320
These people have watched Jiaxin grow up.

655
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,960
Don't they know
what kind of person Jiaxin is?

656
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,240
I can't believe it either.

657
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,480
In my opinion,

658
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,360
Jiaxin is a stick-in-the-mud.

659
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,920
It's by an accident and a mistake

660
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,920
that she got married with her husband.

661
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,440
How's it possible for her

662
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
to meet another man?

663
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,560
How could Huaniao Island have supported

664
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,120
these ungrateful

665
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,440
and faithless rats?

666
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,200
No wonder flies that came recently

667
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,320
are even more than customers.

668
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,080
Right.

669
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,400
They can really drive people mad.

670
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,200
That's true.

671
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,600
How dare they talk about Jiaxin like that?

672
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,400
Xiyi, thank you.

673
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,080
What?

674
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,920
It's not your responsibility

675
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,880
but you're willing to come with me.

676
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,440
I'm really grateful to you.

677
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,640
Ximi is also my child.

678
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,920
Of course I can't let you face this alone.

679
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,000
And you just moved to my house.

680
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,360
I don't want you to feel lonely.

681
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,080
You need to go back
to the company, don't you?

682
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,000
I'll go home myself.

683
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,480
Mind how you go, then.

684
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,880
Oh, I forgot to ask Doctor Hao the questions.

685
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,920
Sit, Doctor Hao.

686
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,240
I was wondering if you could do us

687
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,640
the honor of being our endorser.

688
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Be your endorser?

689
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,160
These are the program and the contract.

690
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,040
I haven't decided the endorsement fee yet.

691
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,640
It mainly depends on your opinion.

692
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,840
Everything can be talked about.

693
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,560
When a person is in a relationship,

694
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,200
he or she may be a little phoney

695
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,600
and it's hard to be detected.

696
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,680
But whether a husband cares

697
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,880
about his pregnant wife

698
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,640
is absolutely clear to me.

699
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,840
To be honest,

700
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,360
I don't think you care
about your wife at all.

701
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,680
In order to get my endorsement,

702
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you were well prepared

703
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,440
and specially came to
have a class with Jiaxin today.

704
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,440
You put on a play to impress me

705
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,680
but it's a shame that you were given away.

706
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,840
You don't even know a pregnant person

707
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,680
can't eat sashimi.

708
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,400
I won't endorse products

709
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,000
of such a selfish and hypocritical person.

710
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,240
Doctor Hao.

711
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,240
It's true that I came for your endorsement.

712
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,560
I was indeed acting when I did and said

713
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,040
all those things to Jiaxin.

714
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,240
But you don't know the situation.

715
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,640
She's...

716
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,440
What's she?

717
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,760
She's a tool that's pregnant with your child?

718
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,240
Or this child is just an accident?

719
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,360
I've heard this kind of excuse so much.

720
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,640
Off you go.

721
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,840
Now that you don't know
my relations with her,

722
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,360
why should you judge me?

723
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,120
Because it doesn't matter.

724
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,720
Let me ask you a question.

725
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,800
Why would a woman

726
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,760
willing to lose her figure,

727
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
endure poor condition of her skin,

728
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,800
and all kinds of pain in her body

729
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,560
just to have a baby for you?

730
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,920
Is it because she's infatuated
with your handsome face

731
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,720
or she has a masochistic tendency?

732
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,560
Let me tell you.

733
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,800
It's because she believes

734
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,960
this child will be protected by you

735
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,600
and be happy because of you,

736
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,960
just like the way she felt about you before.

737
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,400
How about you?

738
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,160
You didn't do your duties

739
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,960
as a husband and a father.

740
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,680
You even lost her trust.

741
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,520
Off you go with your contract.

742
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,280
I've never asked you to be nice to me.

743
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,640
I don't need you to pity me either.

744
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,440
But please don't use me and Ximi.

745
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,560
It's really cruel.

746
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,000
Grandma,

747
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,560
wake up quickly.

748
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,360
Otherwise,

749
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,240
I really don't know

750
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,920
how to stay in this family.

751
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,400
Jiaxin.

752
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,640
Hello.

753
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
Thanks for your good wishes.

754
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,920
You came to see Grandma before you leave.

755
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,080
You're really on good terms with Grandma.

756
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,920
I don't have any relatives.

757
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,360
In this world,

758
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,280
she's the closest to me.

759
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,200
Are you feeling better?

760
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,240
I can't read people's mind.

761
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,120
Your negative emotions
are all shown on your face.

762
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,840
What's the matter?

763
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,080
Is it because of him?

764
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,600
Are you willing to share it with me?

765
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
I don't know

766
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,000
whether I've thought too much

767
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,720
or he's always like that

768
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,280
and I didn't notice it.

769
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,740
(Keep going)

770
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,720
I've never asked you to be nice to me.

771
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,960
I don't need you to pity me either.

772
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,800
But please don't use me and Ximi.

773
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,000
It's really cruel.

774
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,200
Mr. Yi.

775
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,040
This is the list of people who will cut

776
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,600
the ribbon on Huaniao Island tomorrow.

777
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,160
I'll read it later.

778
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,640
You and Zhou Zhan are both attending.

779
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,200
The list.

780
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,960
Shouldn't Huaniao Island

781
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,280
be represented by Director Jia?

782
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,400
Finally got down to business.

783
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,600
So are you also wondering

784
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,760
why Director Jia would let

785
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,880
Mr. Wang the younger steal the show?

786
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,520
Let me answer it.

787
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,560
Mr. Wang the younger
is in the limelight on Huaniao Island.

788
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,000
But it's you...

789
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,440
it's you who signed with
Haifei Group for the factory.

790
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
However, in their mind,

791
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,520
you are the executioner who was wiping out

792
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,400
all workers of Huaniao Island

793
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,640
and Mr. Wang the younger is

794
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,800
the hero who saved the factory.

795
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,360
I don't care about that.

796
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,040
Let him steal the show.

797
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,160
You don't care.

798
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,760
But he's doing it by slandering Snail.

799
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,200
Mom.

800
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,520
You're in a good mood. Where are you going?

801
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,560
Did you forget it?

802
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,160
Today I'm gonna represent the factory

803
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,000
and attend the ribbon-cutting
ceremony with Haifei.

804
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,800
I'm no longer the person who's neglected.

805
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,200
Mom, wait and see.

806
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,320
Very soon

807
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,760
you will have a different life.

808
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,160
No.

809
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,600
No. Don't go, darling.

810
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,800
How can I not?
I won't always be seen in public.

811
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,400
You should be happy for me.

812
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,640
Oh dear, you got me wrong.

813
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,640
Of course I'm happy for you.

814
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,600
But listen,

815
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,160
Grandma

816
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,120
never let us

817
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,600
meddle in business of the family.

818
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,280
And suddenly you're
gonna be this representative.

819
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,240
It must be a trap

820
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,280
and the purpose is to embarrass you

821
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,280
in front of everyone.

822
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,440
Embarrass me?

823
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,720
Listen,

824
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,880
only Chen Jiaxin will be embarrassed.

825
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,080
She doesn't even dare to go home now.

826
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,960
People on the island,
especially those workers,

827
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,120
all know that Grandma
was angered by Chen Jiaxin.

828
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,320
Grandma agreed not to lay them off

829
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,960
and I secured the cooperation with Haifei.

830
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,280
Those workers of the factory are

831
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,720
sparing no effort in sucking up to me

832
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,440
and believe everything I say.

833
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,280
I said Grandma fell ill
because of Chen Jiaxin

834
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,520
and they also said that.

835
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,600
I know you and Jiaxin don't love each other.

836
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,760
You got married because you acted on impulse

837
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,880
and made a mistake.

838
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,640
But you still need to
be responsible for Jiaxin.

839
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,480
She's the commonest one among so many people

840
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,680
you could marry.

841
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,800
But she's my only daughter.

842
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,160
I think this time

843
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,520
even Chen Jiaxin's family
are dissatisfied with her.

844
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,880
My brother doesn't dare to help her at all.

845
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:39,960
Xiyi.

846
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,600
Go to the hospital with me.

847
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,480
My... my mom told Jiaxin
she'd take over this afternoon.

848
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,320
Go with her, then.

849
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,120
Aren't you a dutiful son?

850
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,600
But I...

851
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,920
Listen to your brother. We're not going.

852
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,400
Go to the hospital with me. Come on.

853
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Let go. Let go.

854
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,040
Why shouldn't I go?

855
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,480
I've worked on it for such a long time.

856
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,320
I entertained customers every day.

857
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,440
I've even lost two briefcases for it.

858
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,600
Why shouldn't I go?

859
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,080
I'm definitely going.

860
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:07,760
Come back.

861
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,360
Let go of me.

862
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,160
What a rebellious child.

863
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,120
What are you doing here?

864
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,000
Aren't you gonna attend
the ribbon-cutting ceremony?

865
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,040
Someone important must go as well.

866
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,160
Don't move Grandma about.

867
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,520
She'll be happy for you.

868
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,160
Come with me.

869
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,200
What for?

870
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,680
We're going to Huaniao Island.

871
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,440
You're cutting the ribbon. Why should I go?

872
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,840
I only want to look after Grandma now.

873
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,560
I don't want to go anywhere.

874
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,800
Do you not want to or dare to?

875
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,960
Can you model yourself on Ximi?

876
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,040
He didn't want you to smell the shampoo

877
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,920
and made you vomit.

878
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,000
He didn't like what you ate

879
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,080
and changed your taste.

880
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,680
He's paid even more attention than you.

881
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,280
I really don't want to go.

882
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,480
Look,

883
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,240
if you don't go to Huaniao Island with me,

884
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,720
I'll fire all workers of the factory.

885
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,880
Huaniao Island will be fully automated

886
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,040
and I will carry out my AI plan.

887
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,600
I'm not a nice person.

888
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,360
Wait for me here.

889
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,240
He's here. He's here.

890
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,660
(Joint Ribbon-cutting Ceremony
Heritage & Haifei)

891
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,720
What's Jiaxin doing here?

892
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,360
I'm going back to the hospital.

893
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,640
Do you know what they said about you?

894
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
If you do, tell them you didn't do it.

895
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,000
I want to go.

896
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,760
Tell them you didn't do it first.

897
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,340
(Joint Ribbon-cutting Ceremony
Heritage & Haifei)

898
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,680
Chen Jiaxin,

899
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,200
I trust you.

900
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,240
Why didn't you trust yourself?

901
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,160
When you gave a speech,

902
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,920
everyone laughed at you and you accepted it.

903
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,760
When people gossiped about you,

904
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,200
you gave no explanations.

905
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,840
You always stay in your own world

906
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,560
and only mind what you care about.

907
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,880
Do you really think
a clean hand wants no washing?

908
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,800
Do you know if you don't do it,

909
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,240
how many people will be involved?

910
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,800
I...

911
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,280

912
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,000
who am I?

914
