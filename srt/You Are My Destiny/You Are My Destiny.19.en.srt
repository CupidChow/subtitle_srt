(Episode 19)

26
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,900
He actually gave it to me.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,620
And I'm sorry that I've opened it.

28
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,060
This pen is quite pretty!

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,180
Wang Xiyi doesn't like it?

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:00,980
Actually,

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,020
he thought it was a chopsticks box
and didn't open.

32
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,820
So he...

33
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,420
he...

34
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,260
Go get the door!

35
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,980
Why me?

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,620
Why do you let me open the door
for a person I don't like?

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,300
I'm not going!

38
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,860
Come on! Open the door!

39
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,700
Alright! Alright!

40
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,340
I'm always being bullied!

41
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,620
Welcome!

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,580
Sorry for letting you wait!

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,460
Please come in!

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,420
You are here!

45
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,380
Jiaxin.

46
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,580
Happy birthday!

47
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,220
Thank you!

48
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,420
What's wrong?

49
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,140
Isn't this the birthday gift
you've prepared for Wang Xiyi?

50
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,700
He gave it back

51
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,140
before he had a chance to open it.

52
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,500
Come with me!

53
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,380
Where to?

54
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:10,780
Hey.

55
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,980
Where are you going?

56
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,020
Wait.

57
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,500
Go ahead! Go!

58
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,020
Take Jiaxin and run away with her!

59
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,820
Give Wang Xiyi a good lesson!

60
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,540
Hi, excuse me!

61
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,260
Could you please give this

62
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,780
to that gentleman sitting over there?

63
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,060
Just tell him

64
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,340
it's a surprise.

65
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,020
Thank you!

66
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,740
You mean that gentleman?

67
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,420
Yes.

68
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,540
Now that you've brought him the gift,

69
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,420
let's go.

70
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,100
Wait.

71
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,020
I want to see his expression
when he opens the gift.

72
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,660
Okay.

73
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,860
But I don't want to see his smug face.

74
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,540
I'm leaving.

75
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,180
Alright.

76
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,580
Wang Xiyi,

77
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,580
I hope you'll cherish this woman

78
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,980
who's willing to do anything for you.

79
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,740
Hi, sir.

80
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,900
A Miss asked me

81
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,540
to give this to you.

82
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,780
Where is she?

83
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,260
She said,

84
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,940
"It's a surprise".

85
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,300
Hi, Miss. Would you like something to drink?

86
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,700
Orange juice, please.

87
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,220
Okay.

88
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,140
I can't believe Anna
has really found this pen!

89
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,080
(Shi Anna, I'm sorry.)

90
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
(Shi Anna, I'm sorry. Ximi.)

91
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,400
(Shi Anna, I'm sorry. Ximi. Chen Jiaxin.)

92
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,700
Wow!

93
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,380
Holy cow!

94
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,500
What is this?

95
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,540
Jiaxin's birthday meal!

96
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,780
But she left right after it was delivered.

97
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,380
Magret de Canard with fig sauce,

98
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,060
grilled Boston lobsters,

99
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,340
Australia Tasmania premium beef,

100
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,900
Dry aged ribeye steak.

101
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,020
You've got a bonus today?

102
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,700
So generous for your best friend's birthday!

103
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,740
Well, I'm not gonna pay for it anyway.

104
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,300
You are not?

105
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,780
Nope!

106
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,780
Then who's gonna...

107
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,100
Your boss!

108
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,780
He said you would reimburse

109
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,100
for the expenses!

110
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,340
Here, the receipt!

111
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
No wonder you would splurge like this!

112
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,500
Well, they are not refundable anyway.

113
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,060
Let's eat together.

114
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:11,700
Wait,

115
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,300
there's Bordeaux red wine

116
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,260
on the receipt.

117
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,620
Are pregnant women allowed to drink?

118
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,620
She certainly can't drink.

119
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,500
But I can!

120
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,300
I... I...

121
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,580
You're taking advantage of my boss!

122
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,140
What?

123
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,020
You are gonna give me away?

124
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,780
Am I that petty?

125
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,820
After all, as far as Mr. Yi's concerned,

126
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,220
you are my girlfriend.

127
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,700
Right?

128
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,580
If I gave you away,

129
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,300
I'd be in trouble, too.

130
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,460
Good that you get that!

131
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,220
You'll take pictures, too?

132
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,380
This is Jiaxin's birthday meal.

133
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,980
How can we eat without her?

134
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,340
Jiaxin, my dear!

135
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,660
Happy birthday to you!

136
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,300
As your best friend,

137
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,860
I wish you a happy

138
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,940
and lovely year!

139
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,660
Don't stand me up again!

140
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,620
And then,

141
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
I hope we can take a trip abroad

142
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,980
to go shopping!

143
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,620
Let's have a fun time together!

144
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,820
I'll eat on your behalf now.

145
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,220
Stop playing your phone.
The dishes will get cold.

146
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,380
Since the birthday girl is here, we should
invite the "sponsor", too!

147
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,740
Mr. Yi, my best buddy!

148
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,900
May I wish you many happy returns of the day!

149
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,380
Something is wrong!

150
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:28,900
Wait.

151
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,420
I should say, may this birthday girl's baby

152
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,020
bring you good luck,

153
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,540
and hope by this time of next year,

154
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,860
all your bad luck will have been completely gone.

155
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,220
Wish you a successful,
happy and wealthy life!

156
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,940
God bless you!

157
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,540
How come I feel like we are celebrating

158
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,140
their birthday in front of their deadees?

159
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,740
It does feel like it! It does!

160
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,820
It's okay. How about this?

161
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,980
Let's drink more and imagine

162
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,340
that they are here with us!

163
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:53,980
Good idea!

164
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,100
-Cheers!

165
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,420
Cool!

166
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,460
Ladies and Gentlemen!

167
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,740
It's time for our birthday show again!

168
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,740
Every year on this day,

169
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,220
a beautiful lady would celebrate

170
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,540
a handsome gentleman's birthday

171
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,740
in our restaurant.

172
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,980
And it's even more special this year.

173
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,180
Miss Shi Anna said,

174
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,380
"no any gorgeous stage

175
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,580
can compare to spending

176
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,900
your birthday with you!

177
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,340
And this time,

178
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,060
I want to be Mr. Wang Xiyi's

179
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,860
exclusive White Swan!"

180
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,140
Are you looking forward to the show?

181
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,140
Yes!

182
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,580
Good!

183
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,180
It's show time!

184
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,820
Shouldn't she be here already?

185
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,420
No worry. Let's wait a little longer.

186
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,020
Where is she? We are waiting!

187
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,660
Are we supposed to just listen to the music?

188
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,060
Maybe it's part of the show.

189
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,620
Is there a show or not?

190
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,860
Where is she?

191
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:27,940
Oh, no!

192
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,740
If Anna didn't come,

193
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,980
Xiyi would be very disappointed.

194
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,780
I can't let Xiyi

195
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,260
be alone on his birthday.

216
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,780

to help her with the show.

218

really touched me.

After all, I've only mentioned once to her.

I didn't expect she'd remember.

Thank you!

226
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,700
Thank you

227
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,620
for your performance.

228
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,580
At least

229
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,020
I'm not alone on my birthday this time.

230
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,660
And I

231
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,020
won't become the butt of a joke.

232
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,620
So, you are very amazing.

233
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,460
You remind me

234
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,580
of a nobody girl I know.

235
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,820
She

236
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,020
always does something silly

237
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,540
when she's needed

238
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,900
the most.

239
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
But those silly things

240
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,100
are quite touching.

241
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,740
Alright.

242
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,620
Since

243
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,260
you are a double of Anna,

244
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,300
I do have something

245
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,900
to tell her,

246
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,300
which is also the main reason
I came here today.

247
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,460
I want to tell Anna

248
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,500
that I am actually married
another woman already,

249
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,340
and she's pregnant.

250
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,740
At the very beginning,

251
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,500
I did see her as an accident.

252
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,260
But now,

253
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,820
I want to make

254
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,140
this nobody girl's dream come true.

255
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,940
I want to give her

256
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,940
and our baby

257
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,180
a complete home!

258
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,220
I feel much better after saying it out loud.

259
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,220
But, you are not Anna,

260
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,420
so, never mind.

261
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,580
I'll leave now.

262
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,900
It's time for me to take care
of my nobody girl.

263
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,260
Today is also her birthday.

00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,620

Thank you!

(Aurora)

364
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,700
I feel so happy.

365
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,820
If you like it,

366
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,820
we can bring Ximi here in the future!

367
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,500
Sure!

368
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,900
It's such

369
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,420
a magical day!

370
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,420
When Anson told me

371
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,780
that you didn't take the pen,

372
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,300
I thought today was going
to be disappointing.

373
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,020
That pen was from you?

374
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,220
Yes.

375
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,660
I didn't know.

376
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,340
But,

377
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,780
whom did you buy it from?

378
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,940
A collector named Gu Yitian.

379
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,660
Gu Yitian?

380
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,500
You know him?

381
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,500
Not only do I know him,

382
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,860
I also know he's a tough nut.

383
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,100
So,

384
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,060
he hasn't given you a hard time?

385
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,060
Not really.

386
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,540
Chen Jiaxin.

387
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,740
Yes?

388
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,940
You are such a bad liar!

389
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,380
When you lie,

390
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,740
you always look up.

391
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
I also tried to buy the pen

392
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,820
from that Gu Yitian.

393
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,820
But he refused and gave me such a hard time.

394
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
He was so

395
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,620
arrogant,

396
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,780
and even yelled at me!

397
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,140
I don't believe that he'd sell you the pen

398
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,380
without giving you a difficult time.

399
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,940
Actually,

400
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,660
I just told him

401
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,340
that I wanted to give it

402
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,780
to someone who means a lot to me.

403
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,880
So, he's sold it to me.

404
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,540
Nothing else?

405
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,020
Nothing.

406
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,980
It was pretty much it.

407
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,020
Without these stories,

408
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,740
I'd be like the priced collectibles

409
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,340
you talked about

410
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,060
and only be defined by the secular world.

411
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,580
Mr. Gu.

412
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,140
Before I met my husband,

413
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,580
I thought

414
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,700
love was just a responsibility.

415
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,300
So I'd always lived in fear

416
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,420
and never dared pursue

417
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,540
anything beyond responsibility.

418
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,420
But because of him,

419
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,740
I began to learn

420
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,340
that love should be a kind of freedom.

421
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,100
I used to be

422
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,380
timid and shy.

423
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,940
I was a nobody that others always ignored.

424
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,380
But he's kept encouraging me
and giving me confidence,

425
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,740
making me who I am today.

426
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,420
I used

427
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,420
to be afraid of opening my heart

428
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,420
and talking about my feelings like this.

429
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,220
When I was wronged,

430
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,100
I could only take it on my own.

431
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,140
But he understood me.

432
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,740
He knew my struggle and my trouble.

433
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,540
It feels like

434
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,700
as long as I'm with him,

435
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,540
I won't be afraid of
any difficulties in the future.

436
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,860
I'm willing to accept anything,

437
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,860
either happiness or painfulness.

438
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,460
I think

439
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,740
this is love.

440
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,060
He's taught me

441
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,180
how to define happiness,

442
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,860
and let me realize my value.

443
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,940
Because of you,

444
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,060
I began to understand love,

445
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,940
marriage,

446
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,020
and happiness.

447
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,780
Though one day

448
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,980
I may lose it all,

449
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,140
I won't be afraid

450
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,500
of getting back to where I was.

451
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
Hi, sister!

452
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,900
Why are you calling so late?

453
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,180
Jiaxin, I came to Shanghai to visit your mom.

454
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,460
It turns out she's sick!

455
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,860
You'd better come over and check on her!

456
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,820
What?

457
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,420
Excuse me.

458
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,900
Where am I?

459
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,540
How long have I been in a coma?

460
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,140
This is hospital.

461
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,540
You finally wake up! I'll go call the doctor.

462
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,920
(Saturday, September 28th)

463
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,260
I've missed Xiyi's birthday!

464
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,420
Why didn't mom tell us

465
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,700
she was coming to Shanghai?

466
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,820
I also just found out today.

467
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,180
Jiaxin, here!

468
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:28,900
Sis!

469
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,900
What's going on?

470
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,580
I think your mom was too exhausted.

471
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,780
(Anna)
She came all the way to Shanghai alone.

472
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,660
And she's been busy with finding apartment

473
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,220
and taking care of the noodle shop.

474
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,340
No wonder she'd get sick.

475
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,700
Over here.

476
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,660
See, she didn't even have time to unpack.

477
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,020
This place is such a mess!

478
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:54,980
Where's my mom?

479
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,140
In the room.

480
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,220
Mom!

481
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,700
How do you feel?

482
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,220
I'm fine! I've taken some medicine
and slept for a while.

483
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,540
I feel better. I can even get
off the bed now.

484
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,000
-Are you still having a fever?
-Jiaxin.

485
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,820
I'm not.

486
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,140
You are pregnant.
Be careful of getting infected.

487
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,780
Watch out for your health.

488
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,400
-It's okay!
-Sit over there.

489
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,700
I... I want some water.

490
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,300
Mom, I'll go get you some.

491
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,740
Mom.

492
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,580
I'm so sorry!

493
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,660
I just met you earlier

494
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,860
but I didn't notice that you weren't well!

495
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,820
Sorry that you had

496
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
to go through this alone.

497
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,300
You've never told me

498
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,540
what you've been through,

499
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,900
so how could I tell you about my concerns?

500
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,220
I thought you were married
off to a good family.

501
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,020
Turns out it's not that simple.

502
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,540
Mom.

503
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,620
Mom, here's some water.

504
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,740
Put it there.

505
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,580
Oh.

506
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,180
I feel a little hungry.

507
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,060
Would you go with Zishan and get me

508
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,340
some food and some daily necessities

509
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,860
that you think I can use?

510
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,940
Sure. I'll go now.

511
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,180
Take a good rest.

512
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,180
We'll be back soon.

513
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:24,740
Okay.

514
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,380
Mom, then I...

515
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,500
Your water.

516
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,140
Put the water down.

517
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,420
Wang Xiyi!

518
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,660
Do you remember the first time
you came to my home?

519
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,820
You snatched away the broom in my hands,

520
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,540
and you told me that you'd treat Jiaxin well!

521
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,460
But what about now?

522
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,180
When I went to your house,

523
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,960
I found

524
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,520
that you still hung your
ex-girlfriend's picture

525
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,860
in your wedding room!

526
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,140
Why would you do that?

527
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,660
Mom.

528
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,060
I... I know I've made a mistake!

529
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,140
It's my fault!

530
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,300
It's not the only mistake you've made!

531
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,380
You asked Jiaxin to sign a divorce agreement

532
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,700
right after you married her!

533
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,980
Is she just a baby maker for you?

534
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,700
You... You've known?

535
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,340
Wang Xiyi!

536
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,060
If you don't want her to
be your wife, just say it!

537
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,020
As a man,

538
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,740
how can you be so irresponsible?

539
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,660
She's just a girl,

540
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,180
and she's pregnant with your child.

541
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,260
Are you going to get rid of her
after the baby's born?

542
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,540
Mom!

543
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,140
Sorry! I know I was wrong!

544
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,260
I was actually going to discuss with her

545
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,780
about the divorce agreement.

546
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,900
Discuss?

547
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,140
Discuss what?

548
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,660
Discuss how you can kick her out?

549
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,500
Should the three of us sit down
and have a meeting?

550
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,580
Mom! What happened?

551
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,900
How... How come you came back so fast?

552
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,500
The restaurant is right next door. Here.

553
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,300
Sit down.

554
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,940
I still feel a little dizzy.

555
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,780
Sit here.

556
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,100
Sis,

557
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,100
please get the porridge for my mom.

558
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,700
Mom,

559
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,260
I'll go outside for now.

560
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,940
Get more dishes.

561
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,500
Okay.

562
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,020
Leave it to me.

563
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:17,900
It's okay.

564
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,180
Does mom feel better?

565
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,740
Yes. Much better.

566
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,500
Zishan is with her.

567
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,060
Xiyi.

568
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,060
Yes?

569
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,100
I think I should stay here tonight.

570
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,220
I'm concerned about my mom.

571
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,860
Of course, I'll stay here with you.

572
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,300
Actually, you don't have to do this.

573
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,100
In fact,

574
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,380
I quite envy you.

575
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,420
I envy you

576
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,660
that you have such a good mother.

577
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,300
When I was in the first grade,

578
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,060
a car accident

579
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,620
took my parents' lives.

580
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,780
Mom, don't leave me!

581
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,780
I'm afraid!

582
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,620
In the future, no matter how afraid you feel,

583
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,940
you've got to pretend that you are not.

584
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,940
Don't let people see your fear.

585
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,740
Can you do that?

586
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,060
My mom told me

587
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,100
to be brave

588
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,100
and hide my fear from others

589
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,300
before she passed away.

590
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,500
So,

591
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,380
you became braver and braver?

592
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,940
I was more and more

593
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,020
good at hiding my feelings.

594
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,260
After we spent the night
together on the boat,

595
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,100
after I realized

596
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,340
that our marriage was real,

597
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,860
after I found out you were pregnant,

598
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,780
after I realized working with Zhou Zhan
would destroy my company,

599
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,740
after my grandma passed out,

600
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,620
I felt fearful of them all.

601
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,980
But fear can't solve any problem.

602
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,700
And I knew that long ago.

603
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,100
I feared that my parents would leave me,

604
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,860
but they've left me anyway.

605
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,660
I feared that I'd be blamed if I failed,

606
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,580
but it wouldn't help me

607
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,740
to make things better.

608
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,180
In that case,

609
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,300
why would I show my real feelings to people?

610
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,460
Since no one would help me,

611
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,940
I'd rather keep my real feelings to myself.

612
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,780
I thought

613
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,900
it was quite unfortunate to be a nobody,

614
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,260
but it sounds like

615
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,540
it's also kinda sad to have a hard exterior.

616
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,260
Chen Jiaxin.

617
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,540
I didn't tell you these

618
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,420
so that I can have your sympathy.

619
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,340
I'm not in the position to sympathize you.

620
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,100
From now on,

621
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,140
if you feel afraid again,

622
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,700
don't hold it back anymore.

623
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,940
You can tell me.

624
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,860
It's like

625
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,100
two people

626
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,140
watch a horror movie.

627
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,140
Screaming with someone together

628
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,420
is always better than being terrified alone.

629
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,740
When you are at work,

630
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,020
you can pretend

631
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,540
to be as strong,

632
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
cool,

633
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,100
and bossy

634
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,580
as you want.

635
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,460
But when you come back home,

636
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,100
you don't have

637
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,060
to pretend anymore.

638
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,660
You can tell me everything.

639
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,300
And you don't have to put on a smile

640
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,420
even when telling a sad story like this.

641
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,340
Xiyi,

642
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,820
I'll be there for you and share your pain.

643
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,620
Anyway,

644
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,100
we

645
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
are

646
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,460
family.

647
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,580
Xiyi.

648
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,260
Why did you

649
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,580
say something like this all of a sudden?

650
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,140
Because

651
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,020
it's the first time

652
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,180
you've shared your feelings with me.

653
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
It feels like

654
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,380
we are closer now.

655
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,780
We now know each other's secrets.

656
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,060
Actually, I'm quite afraid.

657
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,540
Don't be. You have me!

658
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,460
But you are the one I'm afraid of.

659
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
I'm afraid

660
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,340
that I'll get used to the current life,

661
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,260
and get used to

662
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,660
staying with you.

663
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,540
Jiaxin,

664
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,180
as Ximi's father,

665
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,860
I want to have

666
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,340
a happy life

667
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,220
with Ximi and Ximi's mom.

668
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,420
I want to

669
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
live a happy life

670
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,780
with Ximi and Ximi's dad!

671
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,620
You saw my wish tablet?

672
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,700
Jiaxin,

673
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,260
let's give Ximi

674
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,700
a complete home, okay?

675
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,380
But,

676
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,020
what about our divorce agreement?

677
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,300
The divorce agreement

678
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,300
is the most stupid thing I've ever done.

679
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,060
I was only thinking about

680
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,580
how to protect myself

681
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,700
and steer clear of you.

682
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,940
I was too selfish.

683
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,500
So this time,

684
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:57,940
I will

685
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,300
alter our divorce agreement.

686
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:06,980
The new version will be:

687
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,300
Wang Xiyi,

688
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,980
Ximi's father,

689
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,060
will from now on

690
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,740
take good care

691
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,020
of Chen Jiaxin, Ximi's mother,

692
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,940
and treat her genuinely.

693
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,860
I'll let her

694
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,180
give birth to Ximi with no worry

695
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,020
and have

696
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,540
a happy life with me and Ximi.

697
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,380
You are

698
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,260
no longer a nobody.

699
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,140
You'll have all my attention

700
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,300
and all my love.

701
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,380
Let's give Ximi a nice future.

702
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,540
Let's have

703
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,100
a lovely

704
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,860
and happy life

705
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,660
together!

706
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,820
Where is it?

707
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,100
Fang, you'll see mom soon, okay?

708
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,780
Honey!

709
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,100
Brother-in-law!

710
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,040
Hi, Jiaxin!

711
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,920
-Brother-in-law.
-What brought you here?

712
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,260
I'm here to... to find your sister.

713
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,500
What are you doing here?

714
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,100
Honey,

715
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,020
Jia Fang cried every day after you left.

716
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,220
I don't know how to calm him down.

717
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,420
So I rent a boat to come find you.

718
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,460
But it's mainly because I missed you!

719
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
By the way, today is Jiaxin's birthday.

720
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,860
I bought her a birthday cake!

721
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,420
Thank you, brother-in-law!

722
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,120
You're welcome.

723
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,700
Happy birthday to us!

724
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,900
Happy birthday to us!

725
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,300
Happy birthday to us!

726
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,780
Happy birthday to us!

727
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,020
Blow the candles!

728
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Three! Two! One!

729
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,980
Are you stupid? Why did you make the noise?

730
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,660
I was excited.

731
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,140
You've woken up your son!

732
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,980
Oh, it's okay! Jia Fang, don't cry!

733
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,380
Don't cry!

734
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:08,660
Jia Fang!

735
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:09,820
Jia Fang!

736
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,100
It's alright! Don't cry!

737
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,420
Let me try.

738
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,860
Jia Fang,

739
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,940
I'm Ximi's father.

740
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,260
Listen to me.

741
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,620
I'm also Jia Fang (means Party A) at work.

742
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,860
As Jia Fang, we should be strong.

743
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,500
Got it? Don't cry!

744
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,220
Right?

745
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,900
Wow, Xiyi!

746
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,700
How did you do that?

747
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,020
How did you make he stop crying?

748
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,340
You know what?

749
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,220
This is a way I learned from the Internet.

750
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,620
Maybe you got married

751
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,580
because of the baby at the beginning,

752
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,740
but over time,

753
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,580
you might find

754
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,460
that you actually completed each other.

755
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,620
Be good! Don't cry!

756
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:23,780
Jiaxin,

757
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,100
before your brother-in-law left,

758
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,380
he told me there were cockroaches here.

759
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:26,900
Is that true?

760
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,100
Should I buy some chemicals?

761
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,380
What chemicals?

762
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,940
Mom, he's worried about cockroaches.

763
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,460
I didn't say I was worried about that.

764
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,700
No worry. It's quite clean here.

765
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,220
I rent this two-bedroom apartment

766
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:42,900
in case

767
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,460
you guys have a fight,

768
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,940
Jiaxin could have a place to stay.

769
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,620
Good that it's not because of that today.

770
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,420
Alright, go to bed.

771
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,980
You too, mom.

772
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,780
Good night.

773
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,220
Good night!

774
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,900
"I'll cancel the divorce agreement."

775
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,780
You've said it!

776
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,300
