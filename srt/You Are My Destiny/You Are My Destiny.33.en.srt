Jiaxin.

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,920
The path we walked through
together was too short.

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
Yet the regret we left behind

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,240
was too much.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,800

(Siqi)

57
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,720
Welcome back!

58
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,920
I can hide nothing from you!

59
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,560
Of course!

60
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,960
So, how did you feel?

61
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,000
The business class was
super comfortable, wasn't it?

62
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,960
How did you know?

63
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,600
Such a lucky thing

64
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,520
was surely arranged by President Wang!

65
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,880
He didn't want you

66
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,640
to transfer during a long trip.

67
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,760
So he asked my hubby to
do everything he can to upgrade you.

68
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,360
It was all on President Wang!

69
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,080
Since he already humbled himself this much,

70
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,960
why don't you just
get back together with him?

71
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,840
When I decided to leave,

72
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,080
I was already determined
to leave him forever.

73
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,360
Though I know

74
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,400
you must think I'm a fool.

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,920
Compared to being fooled by Gu Chi,

76
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
it's a little bit better.

77
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,080
Chen Jiaxin,

78
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,600
you've really changed.

79
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,120
As your best friend,
I feel so happy for you!

80
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,920
Of course!

81
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,320
I've learned my lesson.

82
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,200
I bet you didn't expect

83
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,840
that three years later,

84
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,880
you'd look back on
those silly things with a smile on.

85
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,960
Just don't know

86
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,880
how many more years it'd take for you

87
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,360
to get over the pain that
President Wang caused to you.

88
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,020
(Xishi Noodles)

89
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,680
These people came for noodles so early!

90
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,160
The noodles here
get very good reviews online!

91
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,920
Sir,

92
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,440
you look so familiar.

93
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,800
Are you from Huaniao Island?

94
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:54,880
Well...

95
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,880
Please start cooking. We are so hungry!

96
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,320
Come on!

97
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,400
That's right. We'll be late for work.

98
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,880
Yea! Hurry, please!

99
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,920
I'm so hungry!

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,040
That's right! We'll be late for work.

101
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,280
Alright! Come on.

102
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,700
(Xishi Noodles)

103
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,160
Rice noodles take 10 minutes.

104
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,080
Sauce noodles take 7 minutes.

105
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,040
Soup noodles take 8 minutes.

106
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,920
Wontons take 6 minutes.

107
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
There are altogether 6 ladles,

108
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,200
so

109
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,640
my mother-in-law can cook
six bowls of noodles at once.

110
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,440
Besides, she needs to boil
the vegetables for 40 seconds,

111
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,200
stirs eight times to mix the noodles,

112
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,480
and adds soup and other ingredients

113
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,280
in the noodles.

114
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,080
Therefore, it should take about 8 minutes

115
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,040
for my mother-in-law
to cook one bowl of noodles.

116
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,680
Oh.

117
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,400
Now, remember,
you've got to finish the noodles.

118
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,920
So, the ones who eat there
should be divided

119
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
into a group of four for each table.

120
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,720
And the ones who order to go

121
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,040
should start ordering
after two or three people

122
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,000
sitting at the table ordered.

123
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,640
Got it?

124
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,640
Finish the noodles! Remember!

125
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,720
Let's move!

126
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,880
Let's go!

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,080
Over there! Go!

128
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,040
You guys, go!

129
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,080
See, President Wang.

130
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,160
It's all settled!

131
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,360
I really admire educated people like you.

132
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,280
But how will you figure out

133
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,880
the best time for showing up?

134
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,040
Cause when they get hectic

135
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,280
and overwhelmed,

136
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,240
they'll need a hand to wash the dishes!

137
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,600
Mom.

138
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,120
Yes?

139
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,920
We still need to cook two bowls
of tomato and egg noodles for table 3.

140
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,640
Oh, no!

141
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,360
We only have two bowls left.
What are we gonna do?

142
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,440
I'll wash the dishes!

143
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,040
I'll do it.

144
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,880
Let me wash the dishes!

145
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,160
Why are you here?

146
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
Cause you need me.

147
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,280
Who needs you?

148
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,720
Who do you think you are?

149
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,360
Hey, are my noodles ready?

150
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,360
We've been waiting!

151
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,320
Sorry! Sorry!

152
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,720
They'll be ready soon!

153
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,600
Please wait for a moment! So sorry.

154
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Just a moment! Please!

155
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,240
They'll be ready soon!

156
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,880
Hurry up!

157
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,520
Okay!

158
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,160
Hurry!

159
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,800
So slow!

160
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,800
See?

161
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,920
They need you.

162
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,720
And you need me more.

163
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,520
Since Jiaxin is back,

164
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,600
you can go.

165
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,720
I can't afford to use
such an expensive part-timer like you!

166
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,280
Mom,

167
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,080
I'm not a part-timer.
I'm your son-in-law!

168
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,720
It's only normal that I help my family.

169
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,200
I don't need payment.

170
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,280
No wonder!

171
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,640
Huh?

172
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
So many factory people
came here for noodles.

173
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,120
Wang Xiyi,

174
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,520
did you ask them to come?

175
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,200
Today is the 8,125th day

176
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,880
since Huaniao Factory was established.

177
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,400
So I rewarded the staff
with a one-day trip in Shanghai.

178
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,160
Makes sense, right?

179
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,440
And I told them to come

180
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,360
at different times,

181
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,320
in case you'll get too busy.

182
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,680
So lame!

183
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,560
Jiaxin,

184
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,480
I just want you to know

185
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,200
that I'd love to do anything

186
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,320
as long as I can be with you.

187
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,480
Plus, I am quite useful, aren't I?

188
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,600
I feel happy whatever I do.

189
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,200
Don't just think of your own happiness.

190
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,880
My daughter is happy or not,
It's still up to her.

191
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,840
Mom,

192
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,920
Jiaxin will happy
when you make more money.

193
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,920
Let's fight together!

194
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,040
You've been asking about this person.

195
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,000
I happened to bumped into her

196
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,760
and followed her for a while.

197
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,560
She was trying to get a loan

198
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,320
from a bank,

199
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,560
but she got rejected wherever she went.

200
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,600
Is she short of money?

201
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,000
I guess.

202
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,840
She was fired by the dance group
three years ago

203
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,000
in Europe after the accident.

204
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,240
In the past three years,

205
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,800
she barely got any chance to perform.

206
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,240
Besides, she just opened

207
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,240
a dance studio for children.

208
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,840
She spends much more than she makes.

209
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,720
Since I was already on it,

210
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,600
I thought I'd just help you all the way.

211
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,600
Take a look.

212
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,680
I went there and checked

213
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,960
her dance studio.

214
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,720
It's on Huaihai Road.

215
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,520
The rent there isn't cheap.

216
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,200
I also heard

217
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,480
that her landlord is quite snobbish.

218
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,080
After learning she has
a relationship with Cheng Jie Group,

219
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,000
he's going to increase the rent.

220
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,480
Thank you!

221
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,640
Dylan,

222
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,040
you've been trying to
find your sister for years.

223
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,880
I know how hard it's been for you.

224
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,240
Hope this time

225
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,320
you can finally

226
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,680
reunite with her.

227
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,240
Thanks

228
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,680
to someone today,

229
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,400
our profit breaks the record.

230
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,400
Tell me about it!
We've got so many customers today,

231
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,840
but I don't feel tired at all!

232
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,680
That's right.

233
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,160
And there are barely

234
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,280
any leftovers.

235
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,440
Mom,

236
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,120
I know it's quite tiring to roll the dough,

237
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
and you have to wash the vegetables in the morning, too.

238
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,160
So I told them

239
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,320
to finish their noodles.

240
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,800
Otherwise, I won't reimburse them!

241
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,000
Really?

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,600
No wonder, there aren't leftovers.

243
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,720
Well done!

244
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,680
Mom,

245
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,760
I think we should

246
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,040
get more refrigerators.

247
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,040
We can prepare the cold dishes
ahead of time

248
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,680
and put them in there.

249
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,400
That way, you don't have to roll the dough

250
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,080
and chop the dishes at the same time anymore.

251
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,280
That's a good idea!

252
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,160
How come I've never thought of that?

253
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:41,960
Besides,

254
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,200
we can get more sorting containers

255
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,440
for the bowls and chopsticks,

256
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,240
so that we can save tons of time

257
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,400
before we wash the vegetables,

258
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,640
or wash the dishes.

259
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,120
In addition,

260
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,720
after working here for days, I notice

261
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,480
that if we

262
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,440
make some changes to the menu,

263
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,600
we can double our turnover!

264
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,640
Turnover?

265
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,000
You mean turn the tables over? Why?

266
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, turnover

267
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,600
doesn't mean turn the tables over.

268
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,400
It means

269
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,280
the number of customers we receives.

270
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,560
In that case, you can make more money!

271
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,440
For example,

272
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,480
currently, we have

273
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,360
thick, fine, hand-pulled
and broad noodles.

274
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,360
We usually braise,

275
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
mix or fry the noodles.

276
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,720
If we recategorize them...

277
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,480
Her situation is already this bad.

278
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,840
Noodles will be ready soon.

279
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,480
Mom.

280
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:11,800
Here.

281
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,640
These two are ordered by Mr. Wang.

282
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,080
Careful! They are hot!

283
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,340
(Xishi Noodles)

284
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,960
There you go! They are hot! Careful!

285
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,400
What's wrong?

286
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,360
You got burned?

287
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,040
I'm fine!

288
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,760
Let me see.

289
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,160
Are you okay?

290
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,400
Why didn't you be more careful?

291
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,000
Feel better?

292
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,240
Jiaxin.

293
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,880
Please come home with me.

294
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
What are you doing?

295
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
I really miss you!

296
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Come home with me!

297
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,980
(Xishi Noodles)

298
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,960
If

299
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,280
you still have feelings for Xiyi,

300
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,960
then stop hesitating.

301
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,760
I don't.

302
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,920
Stop fooling yourself.

303
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,560
Just go home with him.

304
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,220
It's okay.

305
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,760
Thank you.

306
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,840
I have a question,

307
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,360
which is about love.

308
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,320
Can I ask for your opinion?

309
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:00,960
Go ahead.

310
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,440
It's about my ex.

311
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,080
Actually,

312
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,080
my feelings of him

313
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,000
are quite complicated.

314
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,760
What do you mean?

315
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,040
We were one of those

316
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,240
"no discord, no concord" type of couples.

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,080
My presence

318
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,720
disturbed his life.

319
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,280
I think he must hate me a lot.

320
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,160
Then why did you fall in love with me?

321
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,920
So, do you hate him?

322
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,360
He thought it was his responsibility

323
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,640
to take care of me.

324
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,840
But at that time,

325
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,680
there was also someone else in his heart.

326
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,000
There was no one at all!

327
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,800
I told you that I wanted to be with you!

328
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,880
You think it was easy for me
to make that decision?

329
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,160
What?

330
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
He was a two-timer?

331
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,600
Not exactly.

332
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,600
The situation

333
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,160
was a little complicated.

334
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,160
But I do know

335
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,120
that he tried very hard
to solve the problem.

336
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,920
Good that you still have a heart!

337
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,200
Unfortunately, we still
ended up breaking up.

338
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,320
So, when I met him again,

339
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,440
I got mix feelings.

340
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,200
I find

341
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,280
that he still can easily affect my emotions.

342
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,360
So, do you still have feelings for him?

343
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,560
Maybe.

344
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,560
I'm not sure.

345
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,480
It's just that he's been

346
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,320
by my side these couple of days,

347
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,440
I think...

348
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,360
Think what?

349
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,280
I think

350
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,400
maybe we can still be friends.

351
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Being friends with each other

352
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,760
will be a good start.

353
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,560
If he still can easily affect your emotions,

354
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,800
does it mean

355
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,040
you still have feelings for him?

356
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,200
Still no reply?

357
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,680
Why are you here?

358
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,320
Because you need me.

359
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,400
Jiaxin,

360
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,280
I just want you to know

361
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,120
that I'd love to do anything

362
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,080
as long as I can be with you.

363
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,400
Plus, I am quite useful, aren't I?

364
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,480
I feel happy whatever I do.

365
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
If you were me,

366
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,480
would you give him

367
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,480
another chance?

368
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,040
I see.

369
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,720
I was being too impulsive.

370
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,440
Stop eating!

371
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,120
Since President Wang will help us,

372
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,280
Let's enhance our taste a little!

373
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:16,880
Okay.

374
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,120
Let's do.

375
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,080
What do you think of this one?

376
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,480
Everything goes.

377
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,960
What does that mean?

378
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,760
Do you want trouble?

379
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,560
I mean...

380
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:24,920
I...

381
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Your phone! Your phone!

382
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,680
Come on!

383
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,600
Answer it!

384
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,640
Hello?

385
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,760
Hi, Siqi.

386
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,840
Chen Jiaxin, let me tell you.

387
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,800
You've got to choose wisely
before getting married!

388
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,680
You know

389
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,760
that I'm the type of person

390
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,600
who always pursues perfectionism.

391
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,560
But my fiancé

392
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,600
is okay with everything!

393
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,360
That's actually good.

394
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,160
You have good taste,

395
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,080
and he won't interfere,

396
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,520
so that you can plan your perfect wedding

397
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,120
the way you want it to be!

398
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,640
If It's work, I wouldn't worry at all.

399
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,280
But this is my wedding!

400
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,160
How can I plan it alone?

401
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
I'm in a panic!

402
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,840
Chen Jiaxin,

403
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,920
please come over and be my company!

404
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,840
You've married before.

405
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,840
I'm sure you can give me many good tips.

406
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,680
I also want to see you.

407
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,280
But

408
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,680
the restaurant has been busy,

409
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,160
I need to stay and help my mom.

410
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,800
Who is it?

411
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,560
Siqi.

412
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,360
She wants me to go with her
and look at wedding dresses.

413
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,800
Really?

414
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,720
Then go with her!

415
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,840
But the restaurant is so busy.

416
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,640
Come on!

417
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,200
If you aren't there,

418
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,840
Wang Xiyi won't come to help every day.

419
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,960
There aren't so many customers

420
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,040
when you guys are not there.

421
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,040
Just feel free to go with Siqi.

422
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,880
It'll be less busy for me, too.

423
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
That's right, Jiaxin!

424
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,760
Please come with me

425
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,080
and give me some advice!

426
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,080
At least you can give
me support spiritually

427
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,000
when you are with me.

428
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,720
Okay!

429
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
I also wanna see

430
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,280
how hard it is to pick a wedding dress,

431
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,920
since it drives you so crazy.

432
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,400
It's a deal!

433
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,960
Let me show you
how a bridal shop looks like!

434
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,160
Clean up nicely

435
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,200
and come to me tomorrow!

436
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,520
Alright.

437
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,640
I'll be there to help you!

438
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,840
See you tomorrow.

439
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,480
I see.

440
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,280
I was being too impulsive.

441
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
If you were me,

442
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,280
would you give him

443
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,200
another chance?

444
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,040
I'm such a bonehead!

445
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,720
Thank you for listening and giving me advice.

446
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,520
I really should learn

447
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,080
from my experience.

448
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,720
Since I've decided to say goodbye to the past,

449
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,920
I should draw a clear line

450
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,040
and stop hesitating.

451
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,080
It's not cooking recipe!

452
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,600
There's no such fixed rule!

453
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,760
I didn't send that sticker

454
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,240
on purpose!

455
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,840
It was sent by accident!

456
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,360
I made a mistake!

457
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,640
It's okay.

458
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,400
I think you were right.

459
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,840
I was too impulsive yesterday.

460
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,400
Maybe because I saw him
too often recently,

461
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,000
so it made me wonder.

462
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,880
So,

463
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,920
I will

464
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:19,920
go hang out

465
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,280
with my best friend today!

466
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,080
She wants to get me out of her head,

467
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,760
and even draw a line between us.

468
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,960
You wish!

469
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,840
Liu Siqi!

470
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
Jiaxin!

471
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,080
I missed you so much!

472
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,920
Me, too!

473
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,320
Now, let me take a look at you!

474
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,400
So?

475
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,480
Am I prettier?

476
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,560
You are stunning,

477
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,480
and very confident!

478
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,440
Bravo!

479
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,440
Let me hug you again!

480
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,560
But how come you've lost weight?

481
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,000
Have you been bullied?

482
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,080
Yes!

483
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,960
I have!

484
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,000
Thank you for welcoming me downstairs!

485
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,600
Cause I missed you too much!

486
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,520
But you didn't even

487
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,880
visit me after you came back to Shanghai!

488
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,960
If I didn't ask you to come here today,

489
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,200
who knows when we'd see each other?

490
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,280
After I came back,

491
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,880
I should go see my mom first, right?

492
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,800
How come you've become so nagging?

493
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,960
You are like my mom!

494
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,640
It's all because you were

495
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,840
always in trouble before.

496
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,120
You were like a punching bag!

497
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,480
But I missed you so much!

498
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,800
Me, too!

499
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,560
For the three years I was in Budapest,

500
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,880
I didn't have anybody
to go eat or manicure with me.

501
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,800
Neither did I!

502
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,680
See, I haven't got a manicure yet.

503
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,280
Let's go home!

504
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,280
Let's go!

505
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,240
Hi.

506
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
Chen Jiaxin!

507
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
How did you know I'm here?

508
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,200
I...

509
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,920
I asked our mom!

510
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,880
Our mom?

511
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,560
My mom can't keep any secret!

512
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,400
What "our mom?"

513
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,880
She's my mom!

514
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,560
Oh,

515
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,920
you guys wanna go out, right?

516
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,160
Where do you wanna go,
or what do you wanna eat?

517
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,560
Jiaxin,

518
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,200
how about going to Disneyland?

519
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,720
Wait!

520
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,040
President Wang.

521
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,040
Thank you for sponsoring my wedding.

522
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,760
No big deal!

523
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,480
Jiaxin...

524
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,240
Good!

525
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,640
I'm a straightforward person.

526
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Jiaxin is back and you've all

527
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,720
fulfilled your agreement.
You don't own each other anything now.

528
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,640
Though you will sponsor my wedding,

529
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,400
today is our girls' day out,

530
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,720
there's no room for men.

531
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,880
If you want to ask her out,
find another time.

532
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:34,840
In addition,

533
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,600
no matter how you feel about Jiaxin,

534
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,960
you need to respect her feelings.

535
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,800
She's the one to decide

536
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,920
if she wants to be with you.

537
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,360
If she doesn't,

538
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,120
then please stop bothering her.

539
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,040
Yes.

540
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,200
Siqi

541
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,480
has explained it very clearly.

542
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,800
If you've heard her,

543
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,720
then bye!

544
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,000
Jiaxin!

545
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,600
Did you see that?

546
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,080
That's what an independent woman
is supposed to be!

547
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,480
Make sure you know what you want first.

548
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,120
don't ever humble yourself to humor men!

549
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,040
That's right!

550
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,480
I was a little nervous
just now when I saw him.

551
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,080
I should keep learning

552
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,320
and improving myself!

553
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,320
I'll learn from you!

554
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,200
Exactly! Learn from me!

555
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,120
I haven't been here for three years!

556
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,280
It's changed a lot!

557
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,120
It's become homier!

558
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,640
Come on in!

559
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,680
Why are you standing there?

560
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,240
Nothing.

561
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,480
It's been three years.

562
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,200
Huaniao Island

563
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
and here

564
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,480
have all changed.

565
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,000
It feels like all the things

566
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,880
that I was familiar with are gone.

567
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,080
Not really!

568
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,920
Ta-da!

569
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,680
You still have your pajamas!

570
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,320
Tonight I'll have

571
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,720
something to wear.

572
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,520
You know what?

573
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,600
That damn Anson doesn't even know
how to pick my wedding dress!

574
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,600
Please help me!

575
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,560
Alright,

576
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,480
let me take a look.

577
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,040
This one.

578
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,480
Slinky dress with decorative border.

579
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,440
Slinky dress with decorative
border and lace.

580
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,680
(The Best Wedding)
Slinky backless dress with decorative border and lace.

581
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,520
Which one is better?

582
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,560
You have good taste for sure.

583
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,720
You'd look good in any of them.

584
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,200
That's exactly what Anson said!

585
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,320
I haven't finished yet!

586
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,240
It's not that easy

587
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,960
to choose a wedding dress.

588
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,240
You see,

589
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,120
just indoor and outdoor wedding

590
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,880
would require totally different styles.

591
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,360
If you want to wear
something heavy and opulent,

592
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,000
yet you hold your wedding outside,

593
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,440
your makeup will

594
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,920
be smudged.

595
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,080
So, do you wanna hold you wedding on the beach,

596
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,520
or in a church,

597
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,240
or

598
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,640
on a lawn...

599
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,240
Alright! Alright!

600
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,040
Let's talk about that later.

601
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,480
I'll go change first.

602
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,440
Will you go with me

603
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,880
and check out some venues first?

604
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:01,960
Sure.

605
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,640
I'm free today anyway.

606
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,640
Wait for me!

607
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,000
Okay.

608
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,480
What a bad luck I had!

609
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,560
Jiaxin already forgave me!

610
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,600
Yet only one day after,

611
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,920
she wants to forget about me again!

612
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,880
Also, because of your fiancée,

613
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,920
Jiaxin totally abandoned me!

614
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,120
Oh my goodness!

615
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,880
I missed this feeling so much!

616
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,520
You've got distracted from work again!

617
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,600
I'm so happy!

618
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,360
So happy!

619
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,040
I have an idea.

620
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,680
How about this?

621
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
Why don't you let me off so that I can

622
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,960
go check out the wedding dresses with Siqi.

623
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,960
That way, you'll get a chance
to approach Jiaxin.

624
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,280
Though you can lure Siqi away,

625
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Jiaxin still has her own judgment.

626
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,880
If she ignores me,
I still don't get to talk to her.

627
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,280
If you worry too much,

628
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,760
you may as well just forget about it.

629
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,680
Just... Just go back to work!

630
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,800
Bye!

631
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,280
I see that you were really torn last night.

632
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,960
Are you free

633
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,720
for a cup of coffee this afternoon?

634
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,400
Being able to meet in Shanghai
is quite a destiny.

635
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,800
Chen Jiaxin,

636
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,400
don't say no to me.

637
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,120
I also have something to give to you.

638
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,920
Okay.

639
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,040
Let me know the time and place.

640
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,880
Chen Jiaxin!

641
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,640
When I asked you out,
you chose your best friend!

642
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,480
But now you said yes so quickly

643
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,480
when a stranger asked you out!

644
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,200
can't believe you
put this stranger before...

645
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,760
Siqi!

646
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,000
What's up?

647
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,200
I'm sorry,

648
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,520
but something's up and I need to go.

649
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,680
Can we go check the venues tomorrow?

650
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,600
Why?

651
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,480
I

652
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,360
will have a date

653
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,680
with Mr. W.

654
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,200
Who's Mr. W?

655
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,680
I'll explain to you later.

656
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,400
Is your makeup inside?

657
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,520
I'll do a quick touch-up.

658
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,960
Tell me, who's Mr. W?

659
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,000
Listen to me.

660
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,640
How can you meet

661
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,520
a stranger in person?

662
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,480
Have you lost your mind?

663
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,120
We are just having coffee.

664
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,040
Nothing's gonna happen
with so many people around.

665
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,680
It's be a meeting

666
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,720
between artists.

667
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,400
Then why are you putting on makeup,

668
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,400
and choosing a lipstick

669
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,080
with seductive color?

670
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,040
What does that mean?

671
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,480
I just want

672
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,640
to leave him

673
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,520
a good first impression.

674
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,640
That's not

675
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,680
important.

676
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,960
But don't give him any chance
to take advantage of you!

677
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,080
Got it?

678
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,720
You've got to order the coffee yourself.

679
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,880
don't drink anything unless
it's brought by the waiter,

680
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,800
especially the coffee he ordered
before you arrive.

681
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,920
Also, don't drink anything
after you went to the bathroom.

682
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,800
You've got to be alert

683
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,000
going out with a stranger.

684
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,120
Wait! No!

685
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,520
I'm concerned about you! I'll go with you.

686
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,400
Let me put on some makeup.

687
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,440
don't worry!

688
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,000
I'm not a kid.

689
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,160
Here I go.

690
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,080
No worry!

691
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,440
Call me if you need me!

692
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,200
Okay!

693
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,480
Stop worrying! Bye!

694
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,600
Bye!

695
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,480
Welcome.

696
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,800
What would you like to drink?

697
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,840
A cup of latte, please.

698
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,560
Okay.

699
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,560
A cup of latte.

700
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
Surprise!

701
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,320
Chen Jiaxin.

702
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,040
So?

703
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,040
Aren't you

704
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:08,880
surprised

705
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,800
to see me?

706
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,040
In fact, I'm Mr. W.

707
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:15,880
Well,

708
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,040
why are you

709
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,680
getting so angry?

710
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,120
Don't you

711
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,080
want to see me?

712
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,200
Of course, she doesn't.

713
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,360
I'm the last person she wants to see.

714
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,640
If I confess to her now,

715
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,640
I might never have a chance
to see her again.

716
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:04,920
Oh, my!

717
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,520
What a small world!

718
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,040
I thought you were busy today.

719
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,040
Don't sit there.

720
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,280
Why?

721
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,920
I'm waiting for someone.

722
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,320
No problem.

723
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,920
I'll leave when your company gets here.

724
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,520
You look a little blue.

725
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,080
What's wrong?

726
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,080
Why are you being so melancholy?

727
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,000
I am.

728
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,960
Because I see you.

729
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,840
See me?

730
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,080
I'm an optimistic and energetic person.

731
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,000
Why would I make you melancholy?

732
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,000
Because I don't want to see you.

733
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,280
What

734
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,960
is this?

735
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,520
You brought it here?

736
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,560
Why did you

737
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,320
bring a plant to a café?

738
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,520
It's none of your business!

739
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,520
You are here to meet a net friend?

740
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,600
Is it a blind date?

741
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,480
Chen Jiaxin.

742
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,920
You are just back to Shanghai,

743
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,040
Yet you are already on a blind date!

744
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,200
Hey,

745
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,640
I wasn't wrong about you.

746
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,080
Chen Jiaxin,

747
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,360
you've really changed a lot!

748
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,560
You've never done this before.

749
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,080
How long have you known him?

750
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,000
When will you meet?

751
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,640
3:00 p.m.?

752
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:53,760
Oh.

753
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:55,720
3:30 p.m.

754
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,880
I don't think

755
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,400
he'll be here.

756
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,840
Because 80% of the men

757
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,720
who aren't punctual

758
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,000
on the first date

759
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,720
are scums.

760
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,800
He's called Mr. W.

761
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,520
He's late

762
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,240
because he's busy at work.

763
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,400
He's not like you.

764
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,000
Though you are a President,

765
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,880
you ditched your work

766
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,800
and came here to chat with me.

767
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,120
Did he tell you how late he'd be here?

768
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,880
Actually, there's another possibility.

769
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,120
Maybe

770
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,720
he was already here,

771
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,560
but when he passed by the door

772
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,480
he thought you weren't his type,

773
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,360
so

774
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,640
he made up an excuse to avoid meeting you.

775
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,600
Actually, you really don't have to
force yourself to talk.

776
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,520
He's not that shallow as you think.

777
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,280
You really trust him that much?

778
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,600
Yes.

779
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,520
But you haven't changed at all!

780
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,480
You are still so self-absorbed

781
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,240
and like

782
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,360
judging people from your point of view.

783
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,280
I'm judging him?

784
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,440
Unlike you,

785
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,200
he understands me

786
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,520
and my feelings.

787
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,160
He won't give me the cold shoulder at first,

788
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,000
then tell me he likes me,

789
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,520
but finally dump me.

790
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,040
Most importantly,

791
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,240
he wouldn't

792
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,480
force me to give up my child!

793
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,920
Chen Jiaxin!

794
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,840
I was distressed,

795
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,960
heart-broken,

796
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,000
