(Episode 7)

28
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,640
Tonight,

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,320
how will we sleep?

30
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,440
Of course we can't sleep together.

31
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,960
You're pregnant. You sleep in the bed.

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,080
Sorry.

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,720
There you go again.

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,400
Chen Jiaxin, what are you sorry for again?

35
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
I didn't go to the Bahamas and divorce you

36
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,240
as you had planned.

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,160
And a wedding ceremony was held for us.

38
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,400
Now,

39
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,880
you even became my baby's dad.

40
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,400
I'm the baby's dad from the very beginning.

41
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm the one who didn't go to the Bahamas.

42
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,520
I'm the one who signed and betrayed Anna.

43
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,520
If you really feel sorry,

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,240
get some money from me
and disappear from my life,

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,800
because I feel apologetic
at the sight of you.

46
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,640
I just feel...

47
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,960
I feel...

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,400
I've completely lost control of my life.

49
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,160
All of you are satisfied.

50
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,600
And I'm considered a joke.

51
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,240
Forget about it.

52
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,160
I know.

53
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,040
I know that

54
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,080
you were forced to marry me.

55
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,560
I promise.

56
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,760
As long as I give birth to the baby,

57
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,120
I'll leave quietly

58
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160
and never show up
before you and your girlfriend.

59
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,640
I'll completely disappear from your life.

60
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,480
I promise.

61
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,280
I'm going out for a walk.

62
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,840
I know you must be sleeping,

63
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,800
but

64
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,080
I have very exciting news to share with you.

65
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,280
Do you know who will come to the Paris Opera

66
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,480
and watch my performance today?

67
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,280
It's Tom Hiddleston.

68
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,320
Tom Hiddleston will come
and watch my performance.

69
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,800
I've never dreamed that someday

70
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,040
my idol would sit there
and watch my performance.

71
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,680
Xiyi,

72
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,680
if only you were staying
by my side at this moment.

73
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,640
I miss you.

74
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,160
Anna,

75
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,080
how I wish I could stay by your side,

76
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,040
but I married someone else.

77
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,360
What should I do?

78
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,880
Hello? Mr. Shen,

79
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,680
please prepare a divorce agreement for me.

80
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:43,660
Right.

81
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,200
I'll tell you the details
after I go back tomorrow.

82
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,920
Mrs...

83
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,600
Mom.

84
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
It's late. Instead of going to bed,

85
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,880
why are you staying here?

86
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,800
I...

87
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
The scenery on the island is great.

88
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,520
I want to look around.

89
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,120
It's your wedding night,
but you're leaving Jiaxin alone.

90
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,960
Unreasonable.

91
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,080
Right.

92
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,960
I'm going back now.

93
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,440
I know you don't
have strong feelings for Jiaxin.

94
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,200
You made a mistake out of impulse

95
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,720
and had no choice but to marry her.

96
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,520
But now that you're married,
you must take responsibility.

97
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,440
Jiaxin must be the most ordinary girl

98
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,800
among your numerous
potential marriage partners,

99
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,200
but for me,

100
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,640
she's my only daughter.

101
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,800
If I know

102
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,760
you cheat on her

103
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,320
or

104
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,920
you let her suffer wrong,

105
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,280
I'll let you pay the price

106
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,360
even if I have to go to Shanghai by swimming.

107
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,840
It'll be of no use
to hide behind your grandma.

108
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,560
I won't

109
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,320
let you go.

110
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm done.

111
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,120
You're free to go.

112
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,640
Oh.

113
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,760
Come back.

114
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,240
This way.

115
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,520
Ms. Wang,

116
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,160
please forgive me

117
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
for waking you up in the early morning.

118
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,240
Don't say that.

119
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,800
I haven't expressed my gratitude.

120
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,680
Thank you for marrying
your precious daughter into our family.

121
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,520
Yeah. She's my only child.

122
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,720
It was all of a sudden that they got married,

123
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
but for betrothal presents,

124
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,520
those home appliances are enough.

125
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,600
I can't accept these gold ornaments

126
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,720
in any case.

127
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,240
Please take them back.

128
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,840
No, no.

129
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,520
I'm serious.

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,960
These are dowries

131
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,840
I prepared for Jiaxin.

132
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,720
You don't need to do that.

133
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,320
Listen to me.

134
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
The old saying goes that

135
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,440
a couple coming from families
of equal status will live a happier life.

136
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,160
In social and economic status,
we're inferior to yours.

137
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,400
But I should say that

138
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,960
although in this condition,

139
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,680
I don't want my daughter

140
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,160
to be looked down upon.

141
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,080
So, I can't ignore anything

142
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,560
as for dowries we should prepare

143
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,040
or customs we should follow.

144
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,080
These are

145
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,640
the most valuable things we have.

146
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,960
Please accept them.

147
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,440
Listen to me.

148
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,360
In this case,
villagers won't laugh at me at least.

149
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,000
I've taken out my most precious stuff

150
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,040
for my daughter's sake.

151
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,640
If it can make you feel at ease,

152
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,920
I'll accept them.

153
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,200
But I'm doing it on behalf of Jiaxin.

154
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,840
They're your most precious stuff.

155
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,240
They should stay with Jiaxin forever.

156
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,320
Trust me.

157
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,400
I'll treat Jiaxin like my own granddaughter.

158
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,480
I won't let her suffer any wrong.

159
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,360
Trust me.

160
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
Ms. Wang, I believe you.

161
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,480
Okay.

162
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:39,760
Okay.

163
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,280
We've really bothered you these days.

164
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,680
Don't worry.

165
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,600
We'll take good care of Jiaxin.

166
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,280
Jiaxin,

167
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,320
pack up your stuff and move to our house

168
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,320
when we go back to Shanghai.

169
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,960
Xiyi, get it arranged.

170
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,320
Grandma, will she move to our house?

171
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,200
Of course.

172
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,720
You're her husband.
Both of you should move back.

173
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,280
Then I can take better care of her.

174
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,400
Grandma, isn't it too much trouble?

175
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,040
No, it's not.

176
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,320
Not at all.

177
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,280
Mrs. Chen,

178
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,840
I'll call you Xishi, okay?

179
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,600
You can call me Grandma Zhenzhu.

180
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,040
We're a family, anyway.

181
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,520
I'm telling you.

182
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,920
I'm inquiring about maternity matrons.

183
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,680
We're sure to hire the best one

184
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,800
to take care of Jiaxin.

185
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,200
Jiaxin just needs to

186
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,680
keep herself healthy.

187
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,000
Ms. Wang,

188
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,640
I feel much relieved
after hearing your words.

189
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,040
Alright. Get aboard.

190
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,160
If anyone bullies you,

191
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
just give me a call

192
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,960
and I'll teach him a lesson.

193
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,080
Time to go.

194
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,040
Grandma,

195
00:12:59,400 --> 00:12:59,880
let's go.

196
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay.

197
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,400
See you.

198
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,640
Okay. Take care.

199
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,160
Bye.

200
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,280
Well.

201
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:07,960
Get aboard.

202
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,640
Jiaxin.

203
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,400
If you want to eat noodles cooked by me,

204
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,040
give me a call.

205
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,040
Mom.

206
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,320
Alright. They're waiting for you.

207
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,400
The ship is about to start. Go.

208
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,320
Go.

209
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,040
Mom, take care.

210
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
So do you.

211
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,380
(No hazardous articles are permitted
to brought aboard. No climbing.)

212
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,220
(No entry)

213
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,040
Mom, take care.

214
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,120
Keep warm.

215
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,360
Eat more.

216
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,840
Rest more.
You don't need to call me that often.

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,840
Got it, mom.

218
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,920
Take good care of yourself.

219
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,600
Take care.

220
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,120
Thank you.

221
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,560
No problem.

222
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,200
Grandma asked me to take care of you.

223
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,240
Mom, you're back.

224
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,640
Go upstairs

225
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,040
and clean up the master bedroom.

226
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,760
Great.

227
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,360
I always think my room is too small.

228
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,760
I've long wanted to move there.

229
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,920
It's not for you.

230
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,640
For whom is it?

231
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,640
It's for Xiyi and Jiaxin.

232
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,840
Who is Jiaxin?

233
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,040
My granddaughter-in-law.

234
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,560
What?

235
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
When did he get married?

236
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,240
How come?

237
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,080
Yesterday.

238
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,600
Alright. No more talks.

239
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,800
Go clean up the room.

240
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,760
Does anyone in the family

241
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,720
care about us?

242
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,320
Don't offend me.

243
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,760
Siqi.

244
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,720
Chen Jiaxin, you're capable.

245
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,120
You got pregnant all of a sudden.

246
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,360
Then you got married in secret

247
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,680
without letting me know.

248
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,880
Siqi,

249
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,440
it was all very sudden.

250
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,960
Yes, it was.

251
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,000
Your mom told me

252
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,160
a wedding ceremony
was already held in your hometown.

253
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
I'm disappointed.

254
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,400
You got married in secret.

255
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Don't you want the red envelope?

256
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,280
Thank you.

257
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,760
I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

258
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,800
So,

259
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,760
will you tell me

260
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,480
who's your baby's dad?

261
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,080
Will you take him here

262
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,920
and let me see

263
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,120
which guy

264
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,680
married my good friend?

265
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,880
I'm afraid I can't.

266
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,080
He's very busy.

267
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,600
Besides,

268
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,040
we planned to keep it a secret for now.

269
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,840
Why?

270
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,920
You want to become pseudo-singles
like some celebrities do?

271
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,760
Chen Jiaxin,

272
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,200
is it possible you were fooled

273
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,480
and became the other woman?

274
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,880
I'm telling you.

275
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,440
Your marriage won't be legally valid

276
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,240
with just a wedding ceremony.

277
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,320
No.

278
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,120
You got it wrong.

279
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,040
We've got a wedding certificate.

280
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,520
Chen Jiaxin,

281
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,840
are you treating me as your friend?

282
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,640
Tell me now!

283
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,920
It's Wang Xiyi.

284
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,520
Wait.

285
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,320
Sorry.

286
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,520
Sorry.

287
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,720
There were too many people,

288
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,240
so I'm late.

289
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,920
-Why are you so slow?
-Come on.

290
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,080
The coffee is sugar-free, right?

291
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes.

292
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Are you sure?

293
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,640
Yes.

294
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,200
I emphasized it.

295
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,720
If I drink coffee with sugar,

296
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,560
I'll...

297
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,880
Hey. Jiaxin.

298
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,360
You're silent at ordinary times,

299
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,960
but it turns out you're so easy.

300
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,560
As your colleagues,

301
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,280
we're curious

302
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,640
what kind of man your husband is.

303
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,200
Tell us about it.

304
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
Which kind of family is he from?

305
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,440
Is your matrimonial home in the middle ring

306
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,320
or the inner ring?

307
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,560
Tell us about it.

308
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,280
-Tell us.
-Alas.

309
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,000
Jiaxin often does odds and ends for you.

310
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,480
Don't just show your concern verbally.

311
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,880
Do something practical.

312
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,440
Tell me.

313
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,440
How much money will you give her

314
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,960
in a red envelope as a wedding gift?

315
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,200
Wedding gift?

316
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
As your colleague,
I'm bound to give you a red envelope.

317
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
How about 300 yuan?

318
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,040
Come on.

319
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,720
There isn't any wedding ceremony.

320
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,640
We don't need to do that.

321
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,800
What?

322
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,400
You won't give her a red envelope?

323
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,640
Jiaxin could have charged a lot
even for running errands for you,

324
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,280
but you even won't give her a red envelope.

325
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,000
Fine. In this case,

326
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,680
just run errands for her in return.

327
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,520
Am I right?

328
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,560
And you.

329
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,840
Jiaxin gave you 600 yuan in a red envelope

330
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,320
when you got married.

331
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,080
You just want to give her a half of that!

332
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,080
You're so shameless.

333
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,160
I'll give her 600 yuan.

334
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,080
Okay?

335
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,800
Great.

336
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,520
How about you?

337
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,920
I'll give 1,000 yuan in a red envelope.

338
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,360
That's more like it.

339
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,160
We're colleagues,

340
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,240
right?

341
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,600
We should help each other, right?

342
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,320
Right.

343
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,480
Now that Jiaxin is pregnant,

344
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,960
we all need to take good care of her.

345
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,920
So,

346
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,240
from now on,

347
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,760
she won't run errands for you.

348
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,320
If there is something you want to eat,

349
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,840
go get it yourself.

350
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,160
Jiaxin, let's go.

351
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,840
Uh. It...

352
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,000
I paid for it.

353
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,960
He's really...

354
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,640
How can she do that?

355
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,040
Remember.

356
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,120
It's best to consume bird's nest soup
in the morning or evening on an empty stomach.

357
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
Pearl powder is good for her trachea.

358
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,760
Black sesame soup lubricates the intestines.

359
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,120
Let's get a chicken
when we pass by the food market.

360
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,120
Make chicken soup as soon as we go home.

361
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,040
You asked me to do that?

362
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,040
Mom, I've never done that before.

363
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
I can't do it.

364
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,920
Search information on the internet.

365
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,600
You're old enough.

366
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,120
Why can't you make chicken soup?

367
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,680
You really let me down.

368
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,840
Where on earth did you hide our kid?

369
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,840
I'll report it to the police
if you still don't tell me.

370
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,280
Agree to my terms,

371
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,880
or you'll never have a chance
to see our kid again.

372
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,960
Stop threatening me.

373
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,040
I couldn't have married you

374
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,680
if it hadn't been for the kid.

375
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Then let's get a divorce.

376
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,800
Stop there.

377
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,200
-Mom, look.
-Make it clear!

378
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,440
Nowadays, it's easy to get married,

379
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
but it's not

380
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
to stay married.

381
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
I got married to Zhengren's dad

382
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,440
in a hurry

383
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,840
without the marital friendship.

384
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,680
In the end,

385
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,200
I found

386
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,120
he married me for my money.

387
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,440
How could I let that happen?

388
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
So, I decided to

389
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,400
correct the mistake at once.

390
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,840
Without thinking too much,

391
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,360
I signed the divorce agreement.

392
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,920
Then,

393
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,320
he left without any hesitation

394
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,640
and without any burden.

395
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,520
He doesn't need to do anything
to make it up for me.

396
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,000
Tell me.

397
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,720
If

398
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,760
you had a chance to turn back the clock,

399
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,680
what would you do?

400
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,960
Now that

401
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,920
he married into...

402
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,600
No, I married into

403
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,760
his family,

404
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,800
he should be responsible for me.

405
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,160
Before divorcing him,

406
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,280
I'd have my property

407
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,240
transferred into my name.

408
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,160
Then I'd let him

409
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,440
write down his responsibilities

410
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,840
in black and white clearly.

411
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
In a word, as women,

412
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,680
we should learn to

413
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,040
protect ourselves.

414
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,400
You're right.

415
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,600
A marriage without marital friendship

416
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,960
or legal protection

417
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,960
is so dangerous.

418
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,160
Mom.

419
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,760
You're worrying about me, right?

420
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,240
You finally understand how I feel wronged.

421
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,560
Yeah.

422
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,840
If you hadn't reminded me,

423
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,680
I must've forgotten

424
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,400
who I should protect most.

425
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,360
Isn't it me?

426
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:17,960
Mr. Yi,

427
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,080
according to what you meant,

428
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,440
the agreement has been prepared.

429
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,760
Okay.

430
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,440
Have Chen Jiaxin's rights and interests

431
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,640
been included in it?

432
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,240
Yes. It's fair and impartial.

433
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,200
By then,

434
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,880
neither you nor Miss Chen will suffer losses.

435
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,360
I'll let Miss Chen take it back to you.

436
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay.

437
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,680
But don't let her

438
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,680
know about it.

439
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,200
Okay. I see.

440
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,000
Trust me.

441
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,840
I gotta go.

442
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,320
OK.

443
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,240
Divorce can never

444
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,440
be a win-win for both parties.

445
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:55,920
Come in please.

446
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,920
Mr. Shen,

447
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,360
you want to see me?

448
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,840
Take this

449
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,000
to Mr. Yi.

450
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,520
You knew it?

451
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,960
Don't forget

452
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm Mr. Yi's lawyer.

453
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,220
(Innovation Coordination
Greenness Openness Sharing)

454
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,840
Chen Jiaxin, I'm telling you.

455
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,000
When you move to the Wang's house,

456
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,040
don't do housework.

457
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,240
Wash your own clothes at most.

458
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,120
Got it?

459
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,400
Yeah.

460
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,920
I'm moving out.

461
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,320
Buying in bulk is unnecessary.

462
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,680
Alright.

463
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,520
I'll change them into smaller sizes.

464
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,680
Then...

465
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,080
You look around

466
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,480
and see if there is anything else
you need to buy.

467
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,280
Let's meet up at the Fresh Produce Zone.

468
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,200
Okay?

469
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,200
Got it.

470
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,200
See you around.

471
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:11,980
(Purchase day)

472
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Chips.

473
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,920
Chen Jiaxin.

474
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,400
Ms. Chen Jiaxin.

475
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,400
Please come to the reception desk.

476
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,400
Didn't she ask me to meet up
at the Fresh Produce Zone?

477
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,880
Luckily, you haven't gone far.

478
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,160
You're the one who wants to see me?

479
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,520
These

480
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,920
are yours, right?

481
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,120
Thank you.

482
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,320
I don't know why,

483
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,600
but I've got a bad memory these days.

484
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,520
Is this file important to you?

485
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,160
It's our company's confidential documents.

486
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,840
I'm responsible for delivering it.

487
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,840
How have you been doing?

488
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,520
Great.

489
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,480
Knowing the baby's dad is responsible,

490
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,760
I'm so happy for you.

491
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,000
It seems the lucky chip I sent you

492
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,600
really works.

493
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,400
Oh.

494
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,080
Thank you.

495
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,080
But

496
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,960
it's time to give your luck back to you.

497
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,080
Chen Jiaxin,

498
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,000
what's going on?

499
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,240
I told you to meet up at...

500
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,880
He's...

501
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,120
He's

502
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,320
one of my friends.

503
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,520
Hi, I'm Dylan.

504
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,400
I'm Jiaxin's friend.

505
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:07,960
Hi.

506
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,320
Jiaxin, you know my mobile phone number.

507
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,160
If I can be of any help,

508
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,320
just give me a call.

509
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,320
Oh.

510
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,760
I'm leaving.

511
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,920
Bye.

512
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,720
Sales in the first
half of this year rose by 5%

513
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,440
over the same period last year.

514
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,280
But sales of our old brand

515
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,680
Heritage Soap

516
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,320
have dropped for 18 consecutive months.

517
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,120
Consumers prefer body washes nowadays,

518
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,640
which results in a decreased demand for soap.

519
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,240
Mr. Yi,

520
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,760
shall we stop producing Heritage Soap?

521
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,240
No way!

522
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,920
Mr. Yi means

523
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,520
we can lay the topic aside for the moment.

524
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,760
So much for the discussion, okay?

525
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,400
The meeting is over.

526
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,620
(Market share of last year:
bath & shower products 48.2% soap 51.8%)

527
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,900
(Market share of this year:
bath & shower products 64% soap 36%)

528
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,840
What's up?

529
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,760
Are you in a bad mood?

530
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,480
I'll never let Heritage
be taken off the shelves.

531
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
I think you'd better figure out

532
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,960
who can be sent
to the factory on Huaniao Island.

533
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,240
Your grandma refused to reduce the staff,

534
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,280
but the working conditions are so bad

535
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,560
that nobody in the headquarters
wants to go there.

536
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,000
I've got a suitable person.

537
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,600
Who is it?

538
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,200
He's on the way.

539
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
I need to take Jiaxin
to my home this afternoon.

540
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,480
I'll leave the company affairs to you.

541
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,960
Keep a close eye.

542
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,360
Got it.

543
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,620
(Heritage Soap Factory)

544
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,380
(Crackdown and root out local crimes
and remove hidden danger)

545
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,060
(to improve people's sense of safety)

546
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,480
Mr. Wang, this way please.

547
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,100
(Clemency, lofty aspiration and fortitude)

548
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,800
Your

549
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,520
office is so narrow.

550
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,880
There is even no sofa.

551
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,560
Where can I ask my guests to sit down?

552
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,520
I know why the headquarters
didn't have this factory dismantled.

553
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,920
They're just doing charity.

554
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,880
If you dislike this place,

555
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,160
just go back to Shanghai.

556
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,840
You're making criticisms upon your arrival.

557
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,800
Who do you think you are?

558
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,160
Guys,

559
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,560
actually,

560
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,880
I usually keep a low profile,

561
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,760
but I want to give you some advice.

562
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,520
Before you play rough
to someone from the headquarters,

563
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
you'd better

564
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,000
find out his background.

565
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,000
We know

566
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,320
you're Mr. Yi's cousin.

567
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,400
But it's of no use.

568
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,920
Jiaxin is Mr. Yi's wife,

569
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,240
but she never shows off.

570
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,800
Young man,

571
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,680
don't be too arrogant.

572
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,600
Once Jiaxin's baby is born,

573
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,360
Huaniao Island will become
his or her hometown.

574
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,160
Then it'll have nothing to do with you.

575
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,200
What? My cousin will have a baby?

576
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,120
You're back.

577
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,520
You're finally back.

578
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,960
You're

579
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,120
Xiyi's

580
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,200
wife.

581
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,240
You're Jiaxin, right?

582
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,560
Alas.

583
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,080
You look delicate and pretty.

584
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,440
I heard you're a dancer.

585
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,000
You've performed in many places, right?

586
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,960
Um...

587
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,520
Jiaxin, let me introduce her to you.

588
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,480
She's my auntie Xiuling.

589
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,840
She embezzled public funds

590
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,600
and ran away with money

591
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,880
after it was found out.

592
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,080
Now she's divorced

593
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,960
and has nowhere to go,

594
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,440
so she has to stay
in our house for the time being.

595
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,080
Hi, Auntie.

596
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,200
I'm Jiaxin.

597
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,760
Xiyi and I

598
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,360
met each other on a cruise ship.

599
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,680
Great.

600
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,080
Cruise ship. It's great to meet there.

601
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,600
You're here.

602
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,320
Grandma.

603
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,760
Xiyi,

604
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,600
put Jiaxin's luggage away.

605
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,840
I'll show her

606
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,080
around the house.

607
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,520
OK.

608
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,720
There is something

609
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,280
I have to show you.

610
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:09,920
Come on.

611
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,280
Look.

612
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,920
This place is special, right?

613
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,680
Xiyi's grandpa and dad

614
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,560
often stayed here chatting.

615
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,240
Xiyi often played here too

616
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,560
when he was a kid.

617
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,480
Sometimes,

618
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,800
he hid himself somewhere

619
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,360
and made us look for him.

620
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,080
That's right.

621
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,760
"Blue."

622
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,520
Thanks to you,

623
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,680
I got it from Dylan.

624
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,440
Speaking of that,

625
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,320
I guess someone up there
really wants us to see each other.

626
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,160
What?

627
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,760
Your cousin is pregnant?

628
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,600
I mean, his wife is pregnant?

629
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,520
Why is he so fast?

630
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,440
Impossible.

631
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,600
It's true.

632
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,920
Everyone on Huaniao Island knows it.

633
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,880
We're the only ones
who were kept in the dark.

634
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,000
They also said

635
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,240
everyone on the island
went to their wedding ceremony.

636
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,320
Mom, they just didn't inform us.

637
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,200
He's never treated us as his family.

638
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,280
This is too much.

639
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,360
They've gone too far.

640
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,800
I can't stand that!

641
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,440
Exactly!

642
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,160
In their mind,

643
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,680
we're insignificant.

644
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,600
Now that Xiyi's wife is pregnant,

645
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,520
grandma will focus on her great-grandson.

646
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,880
By then, we'll be totally ignored.

647
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,760
You stupid.

648
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,680
Insignificant?

649
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,000
If you want to be somebody,

650
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,560
do something to impress your grandma.

651
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,640
I...

652
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,080
Besides, what's the point
of getting pregnant?

653
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,240
Most miscarriages

654
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,880
happen in the first trimester.

655
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,040
It's too early to draw a conclusion now.

656
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,560
There is only one bed.

657
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,960
Where should I sleep tonight?

658
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,000
Should I...

659
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,080
This must be the difference

660
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,040
between an ugly duckling and a white swan.

661
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,600
I've promised to your boyfriend.

662
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,640
Once I give birth to the baby,

663
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,520
I'll leave quietly.

664
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I won't let you find I once stayed here.

665
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,360
He really cares about you.

666
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,160
He also loves you.

667
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,560
Are you done saying to yourself?

668
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,640
It seems only the sofa can be used as a bed.

669
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,040
Thank you.

670
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,760
I'll sleep on the sofa.

671
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,720
It's okay.

672
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,360
Sure.

673
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,240
I didn't plan to let you sleep in my bed.

674
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,920
Hot milk.

675
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,640
Grandma prepared it for you.

676
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,640
Now, let's get down to

677
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,480
something serious.

678
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,500
(Grand Sofitel Hotel)

679
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,360
Madam,

680
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,160
your guest has arrived.

681
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,400
Take a seat please.

682
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,560
Ms. Wang,

683
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,760
do you want to see me late at night

684
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,000
because of something urgent?

685
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,720
Relax.

686
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,840
It's not urgent.

687
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,800
I hope you can draft a file for me,

688
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,600
but you must

689
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,480
keep the content a secret to everyone else.

690
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,760
Okay.

691
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:20,700
(The Divorce Agreement entered into by
and between Mr. Wang Xiyi and Ms. Chen Jiaxin)

692
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,400
This is for me?

693
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,720
Both of us know

694
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,040
why we got married.

695
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,400
You won't be part of my future.

696
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,480
This sounds cruel,

697
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,000
but it's the truth

698
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,120
we must face.

699
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,680
Chen Jiaxin,

700
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,880
you're a good girl.

701
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,680
I don't want you to suffer losses.

702
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,920
Everything is clearly written

703
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,840
in the contract.

704
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,760
Alimony, a house and a good job...

705
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,480
I'll get all these arranged.

706
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,400
Unnecessary.

707
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,280
Chen Jiaxin,

708
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,720
think twice

709
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,040
before you say no.

710
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,720
You're Ximi's mom.

711
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,240
I can protect you, take care of you

712
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,760
and even bring fair back
to you in the office,

713
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,080
but it couldn't last your whole life.

714
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,840
In the future,

715
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,160
who can take care of you

716
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,880
when I'm not there?

717
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,880
Are you afraid I'll come back to you

718
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,560
in the name of seeing Ximi?

719
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,080
I won't.

720
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,920
You may or may not.

721
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,240
No one knows what would happen in the future.

722
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,560
Before you trust anyone,

723
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,920
protect yourself.

724
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,200
That has always been my principle.

725
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,760
If I were you,

726
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,160
I wouldn't give a reply so quickly.

727
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,160
Instead, I'd figure out

728
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,200
what I can get from this marriage.

729
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,280
You have three days

730
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,400
to think about it.

731
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,320
It's also the best time for you

732
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,040
to try to get what you want.

733
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,040
As long as it's not that unreasonable,

734
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,160
I'll satisfy all your demands.

735
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,400
This is a castle

736
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,200
that belongs to a prince and a princess.

737
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,160
I just happened to pass by.

738
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,600
Morning.

739
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:56,600
Morning.

740
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,400
It's signed.

741
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,180
(The Divorce Agreement entered into by
and between Mr. Wang Xiyi and Ms. Chen Jiaxin)

742
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,880
I did it

743
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,160
because I know it's best for Ximi

744
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,040
to live with you.

745
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,240
But I don't need your money,

746
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,600
because I'm not selling my kid.

747
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,360
Nobody would say that.

748
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,960
I know.

749
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,120
But I still don't need your money.

750
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,040
I'll try harder than anyone else to live well

751
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,320
and come back
to see my kid in a dignified way.

752
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,600
And...

753
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,240
Take this back.

754
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,020
(The Divorce Agreement entered into by
and between Mr. Wang Xiyi and Ms. Chen Jiaxin)

755
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,000
Chen Jiaxin.

756
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,080
Don't worry.

757
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,720
I won't tell your grandma.

758
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:09,840
I...

759
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,420
(Party A: Wang Xiyi Party B: Chen Jiaxin)

760
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,900
(Article 7: The total divorce compensation
and the payment method thereof)

761
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:54,840
Stop the car.

762
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,040
What do you want?

763
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,160
You don't need to drive me there.

764
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,360
I'll get off here.

765
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,120
Grandma asked me to drive you to...

766
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,760
She won't know about it.

767
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,000
It's out of your way, right?

768
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,920
You're mad at me.

769
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,400
No.

770
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,960
You were telling the truth.

771
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,840
It's just that you were too unconcerned,

772
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,560
too rational

773
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,160
and too cruel.

774
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
What you said is right.

775
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,320
Obviously, you're mad at me.

776
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,400
I can also understand what you mean

777
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,360
if you say it in another way,

778
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,880
but you chose to do it

779
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,040
in the worst one.

780
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,280
I know.

781
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,760
You're eager to let me recognize the reality,

782
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
but don't I even

783
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,440
have the right

784
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,560
to feel bad and remain silent?

785
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,680
Um.

786
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,880
Yes, you do.

787
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm leaving.

788
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,160
Weird.

789
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,720
Why don't Yuwei and others

790
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,360
ask me to get stuff for them?

791
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,160
Excuse me.

792
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,640
Excuse me.

793
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,960
Thank you.

794
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,200
Excuse me.

795
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,560
Thank you.

796
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,360
Hi, Mr. Zheng.

797
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,240
Mr. Zheng.

798
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,760
Thank you.

799
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,320
I'll do it myself.

800
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
Leave it to me.

801
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,240
Get me a cup of coffee.

802
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,200
Okay.

803
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,760
Jiaxin.

804
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,240
Let me do it.

805
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,120
Go have a rest.

806
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,520
I'll do it.

807
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,520
Who can help me type in the file?

808
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,560
I'll do it.

809
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,720
Here you are.

810
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,120
How can I let you do this?

811
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,900
(Cease to the struggle
and you cease to live.)

812
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,520
It...

813
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,920
I think it's my table, right?

814
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,360
I'm sorry.

815
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,880
It's my first day of work.

816
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,440
They told me to sit here.

817
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,760
Is there any misunderstanding?

818
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,880
It's okay.

819
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,440
Jiaxin.

820
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,720
Come to my office.

821
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,080
