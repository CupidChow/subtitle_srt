27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,940
(Episode 14)

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,920
I have a dinner to attend today.

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,840
I don't need a lunch box.

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,600
You can't just go against

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,200
or yield to its momentum.

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,360
That's the way with pottery.

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,240
What's going against it
and what's yielding to it?

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,800
Now you're back to where you started.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,920
The key is to live in peace with it

36
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,080
so that it becomes one with your palms.

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
This process

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,360
requires patience.

39
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,840
You and Xiyi

40
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
are newlyweds.

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
You're still adjusting
yourselves to marriage.

42
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,160
Take it easy.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,080
But

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,200
I'm afraid that I might never
be able to adjust myself.

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,240
You're afraid, but Xiyi will suffer as well.

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,560
Your uneasiness will only
make him more uneasy.

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,040
Sometimes

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,280
you just need to give each other some space.

49
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Don't think I know nothing about it.

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,760
Your relationship with Xiyi

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,280
is as fickle as the weather

52
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,360
in early autumn.

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,120
He bullied you again, didn't he?

54
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,160
No.

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,680
He's just been a little busy lately.

56
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,480
For nothing.

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,400
I heard him calling you Snail.

58
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,720
He took you for a pushover.

59
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,680
Let me teach you a few tricks

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,680
that will certainly bring him to heel.

61
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,000
What's the matter?

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,240
Feeling guilty about your canceled flight?

63
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,400
Anna grilled me over the phone

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,880
and I tried hard to make up an excuse

65
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,760
for your change of mind.

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,440
I get it.

67
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,520
Anna stood you up many times, didn't she?

68
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,080
So you wanted to get back at her for once.

69
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,680
But you can't handle
a relationship like this,

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
or you'll lose Anna sooner or later.

71
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,960
Maybe I should

72
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,320
explain it to her again?

73
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,080
I'm hungry.

74
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,400
Didn't Snail pack a lunch for you today?

75
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,880
I don't want her lunchboxes anymore.

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,280
I get it.

77
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,960
What do you get?

78
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,120
A successful man's trouble, of course.

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,960
You're caught in an excruciating dilemma.

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,880
You don't see what I mean?

81
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,440
Look.

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,560
Anna is your first love,
the first girl you fell for.

83
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,120
She's important to you.

84
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,800
Snail is pregnant with your child.

85
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,640
You have to take care of her.

86
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,720
You dare not tell Anna the
truth for fear of a breakup.

87
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,520
You don't want to lose her.

88
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,080
Snail is tender and sweet.

89
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,000
You've begun to feel attracted to her.

90
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,840
So you're torn between the two women,

91
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,440
wishing you could have them both.

92
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,400
But you can't.

93
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,240
Stop.

94
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
I think a successful man's biggest trouble

95
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,960
could be his gossipy assistant,
who deserves to be sacked.

96
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,680
An assistant is supposed
to be frank with his boss.

97
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,280
He stays tight-lipped towards others.

98
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,080
Tell me, have you wondered why you don't want

99
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,840
to bring Snail's lunchbox
to your office anymore?

100
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,080
Why the reluctance to visit Anna in Europe?

101
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,880
And you know why?

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,800
Look.

103
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,480
Look. You're torn between the two women.

104
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,280
So you've decided to hide

105
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,560
from them both.

106
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,160
Just cut it out.

107
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,800
I shouldn't have asked
you in the first place.

108
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,320
Chen Jiaxin and I have long since agreed

109
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,400
to go our separate ways
when the time has come.

110
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,320
We'd made the agreement before
we got our wedding certificate.

111
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,280
Then why did you look so frustrated

112
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,960
when you returned from the airport?

113
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,480
Because that docile Chen
Jiaxin has been acting

114
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,680
like a different person
since she got pregnant.

115
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,800
I've begun to lose control of her.

116
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,400
It's easy to figure out the change in her.

117
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,800
Many of our staff members are mothers.

118
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,080
Just ask one of them how
pregnancy would influence

119
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
a woman.

120
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
But I don't want to understand her.

121
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,840
Then why...

122
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,520
Turn around.

123
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,240
Why?

124
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,520
I've got dirt on my clothes?

125
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,200
Get out.

126
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,560
It's your turn.

127
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,040
Oh.

128
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,520
I feel so sleepy.

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
We're playing snooker?

130
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,560
It's too hard.

131
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,120
I give up. I give up.

132
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,880
I'm tired.

133
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,440
I want to go home and rest.

134
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,760
I'm so tired.

135
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,440
I give up. I quit.

Once our products take off,

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,240
like a complete stranger.

170
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,140
♪and lean against your shoulder.♪

171
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,040
Only by losing the right

172
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,360
to care and be cared about

173
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,880
will we stop putting pressure on each other

174
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,560
and give each other

175
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,680
real freedom.

176
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,040
Wait.

177
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,560
You're so eager to fight with me?

178
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,120
Can't we do that back at our department?

179
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,560
Wang Xiyi,

180
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,240
I know that you're our VIP client

181
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,880
and that I might get dismissed

182
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,240
for having this conversation,

183
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,520
but as Chen Jiaxin's bestie, I
have to ask you this question:

184
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,280
What do you take my friend for?

185
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,120
She's pregnant with your child.

186
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,360
She's your family if not your sweetheart.

187
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,840
How could you fool around
with your ex-girlfriend

188
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,160
and give your wife the cold shoulder?

189
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
How could you be so...

190
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,880
Hold on.

191
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,280
What did you just say?

192
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,320
I said,

193
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,960
how could you fool around
with your ex-girlfriend and...

194
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,120
No. I meant the sentence before that.

195
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,040
Jiaxin is pregnant with your child.

196
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,440
The next sentence.

197
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,240
For heaven's sake.

198
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,960
Could you stop interrupting my talking?

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,320
What do you think you're doing?

200
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:51,800
Yes.

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,400
You...

202
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,120
You mentioned family.

203
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
You said family.

204
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,280
So what's between us

205
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,760
is the bond between a father and a mother.

206
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,680
Yes.

207
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,920
That's right. Yes.

208
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,040
I thought too much.

209
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,040
Hey.

210
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,840
Hey, I'm not finished yet.

211
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,200
I heard a man under too much
pressure could suffer mental illnesses,

212
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,760
like feeling depressed at one
moment and overjoyed the next.

213
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,560
Do you think Mr. Yi could be such a case?

214
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,920
Yeah.

215
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,880
I think so.

216
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,680
A patient should receive timely treatment.

217
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,920
Yes.

218
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,840
Why am I wasting my time here?

219
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,120
Wait for me.

220
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,200
Take a look, guys.

221
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,400
This is Jiaxin's first work.

222
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,800
Even the teachers at the pottery
class found it hard to believe

223
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,880
that Jiaxin, a newbie in pottery,

224
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,200
could produce such a nice work.

225
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,160
You have a gift for it, Jiaxin.

226
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,760
Besides,

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,320
this shows your grandma
had the unique insight

228
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
in tapping Jiaxin's artistic potential.

229
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,120
Listen, Jiaxin.

230
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,880
Maybe you could devote yourself to pottery

231
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,080
after the baby is born.

232
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,560
Perhaps we'll have a
pottery master in our family.

233
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,840
Xiuling,

234
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,200
Jiaxin needn't go to work now

235
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,000
and she's no longer in your way.

236
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,320
Look at you.

237
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
You look so well these days.

238
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,680
Mother,

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,200
stop teasing me.

240
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,840
Well,

241
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,840
I consider Jiaxin my family, too.

242
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,680
Right?

243
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,440
So do I.

244
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,000
When I first returned home from abroad,

245
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,440
I wasn't used to having a sister-in-law.

246
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
But now I've grown attached

247
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,120
to the dishes Jiaxin
prepares for us every day.

248
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Thank you, guys.

249
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,760
To show my gratitude,

250
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,560
I plan to make

251
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,320
a ceramic cup

252
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,120
for everyone.

253
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,000
Really? Fantastic. I look forward to it.

254
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,640
Jiaxin.

255
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,040
Yes?

256
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,120
Go to see your mother

257
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,600
and your sister sometime.

258
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,400
A woman needs attention
more than anything else

259
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,840
after giving birth.

260
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes.

261
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,880
Right.

262
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,400
Jia Tiancai often looks sour these days.

263
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,200
He has to get up several times
in the middle of the night

264
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,480
to change diapers for Jia Fang.

265
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,160
During the day he has to pacify
his crying wife over the phone.

266
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,960
That's too bad.

267
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,840
She's just family.

268
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,560
I'd appear odd

269
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,680
if I avoided her.

270
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,800
I'm home.

271
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,400
Oi.

272
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,560
You've left nothing for me to eat?

273
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,800
You're old enough to
figure it out on your own.

274
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,200
Look.

275
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,520
There's a large bowl of soup on the table.

276
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,280
Enjoy yourself.

277
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,240
Enjoy yourself.

278
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,000
Alas.

279
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,800
That Snail has been ignoring me

280
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
and bullying me, and what's worse,

281
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,600
now she's inciting my family to isolate me.

282
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,280
What?

283
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,960
My dear Mr. Yi, it's been
your style to ignore people.

284
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,960
How did you get isolated by a little Snail?

285
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,040
She deliberately ignored me

286
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,320
as if I were invisible.

287
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,840
And she refused to give me sticky notes.

288
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,200
More importantly,

289
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,320
I managed to come home early today,

290
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,080
but she'd had dinner without me.

291
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,640
Really? You mean even your grandma...

292
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,320
Yeah.

293
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,080
I must hang up now.

294
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,120
Hello.

295
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,160
Xiyi.

296
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,760
Yes?

297
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,040
That book is mine.

298
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,900
(Mom and baby)

299
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,560
I thought we share everything

300
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,760
since we live in the same room.

301
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,240
I need to read it now.

302
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,720
Chen Jiaxin.

303
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,480
What will you be doing tomorrow?

304
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,840
Grandma and I will go shopping for Jia Fang.

305
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,000
Party A?

306
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,560
Which one?

307
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,040
I know our company's
biggest Party A very well.

308
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,640
Shall I...

309
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,920
Jia Fang is my sister's child.

310
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,600
Jia is his surname, which
he got from Jia Tiancai,

311
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,880
and Fang is his given name.

312
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,880
Hey.

313
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,840
What are you doing?

314
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm off to sleep with Grandma.

315
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,000
The bed is all yours now.

316
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,480
Did you complain to Grandma about me?

317
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,640
I only told her

318
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,080
you're a snorer.

319
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,560
How dare you run me down in front of Grandma?

320
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,520
You don't want to sleep on this bed, huh?

321
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,880
Fine.

322
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,040
It's more comfortable to have it for my own.

323
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,480
You called him a snorer?

324
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,080
Well done, Jiaxin.

325
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,520
Grandma,

326
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,120
should we really be doing this?

327
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,680
Yes, of course. We should
have done this sooner.

328
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,160
Tell me how he looked.

329
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,080
It must have been very funny.

330
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,680
He...

331
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,600
He was fuming,

332
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,640
but couldn't give vent to his anger.

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
So he had to suck it up

334
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,520
and he was blue in the face.

335
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,360
Good.

336
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,880
Xiyi has been accustomed

337
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,360
to being egocentric.

338
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,160
He must learn to cherish

339
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,200
people's loving care for him,

340
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,520
and stop taking it for granted.

341
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,240
And he's got to learn

342
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,320
to take care of you.

343
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
I'm just a little worried

344
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,840
that he might find it hard to adapt

345
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,320
to this huge change.

346
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,560
Didn't he say he wants more freedom?

347
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,680
You're just granting his wish.

348
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,360
We can say nothing more

349
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,280
if this really is what he wants.

350
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,640
But I'll feel gratified

351
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,280
if he could learn to cherish

352
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,640
his current happiness

353
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,840
and be content with it.

354
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,280
I don't want my silly grandson

355
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,520
to bitterly regret his decision

356
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,000
for the rest of his life.

357
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,440
Family ties.

358
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,280
Family ties.

359
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,840
Family ties.

360
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,360
What's between us is family ties.

361
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,080
I'm not in love with her at all.

362
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,640
Where are you going?

363
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,800
Didn't I tell you yesterday evening?

364
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,160
I'm going shopping for Jia Fang with Grandma.

365
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,440
Wait for me.

366
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,840
Hello, Anson.

367
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,760
Clear my schedule today.

368
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,440
Yes.

369
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,800
I'm not going to the office.

370
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,200
Give me a call if anything happens.

371
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,760
Yes. Bye.

372
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,920
I couldn't figure out

373
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,000
why you've been so cold to me lately.

374
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,880
Dr. Hao recommended it to me.

375
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,000
After finishing it, I learned

376
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,720
that a pregnant woman's mood swings

377
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,960
have much to do with her hormone secretion.

378
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,880
Now I see why

379
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,000
you've been treating me like this.

380
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,960
You're so good at putting a label on others.

381
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,920
You're the one

382
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,640
who plays hot and cold with me,

383
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,840
but your conclusion is that it's my fault.

384
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,640
Mood swings caused by hormones?

385
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,720
Right.

386
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,080
I easily lose control due to
endocrine and hormonal disorders.

387
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,640
So stay away from me.

388
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,560
Or I'll shout at you.

389
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,040
(Encyclopedia of Pregnancy Knowledge)
Hey. Look.

390
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,080
A button has come off your shirt.

391
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,720
Ximi has lost his temper in protest.

392
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,560
Get out of here.

393
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,160
Leave me alone for a while.

394
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,600
What has got into her?

395
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,400
She yelled at me even though
I'd done my homework

396
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,080
and behaved so well?

397
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,480
Hello.

398
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,080
Would you stop being mad at me

399
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,360
if I told you I've bought
you a beautiful dress?

400
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,960
Hey.

401
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,600
Get changed already.

402
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,360
Then we'll go shopping for a handbag.

403
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,280
A handbag is said to be a cure-all.

404
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,920
I'll buy you whatever you want.

405
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,400
My boss is getting more and more wayward.

406
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
He just decided not to show up.

407
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,040
We've got three important meetings today.

408
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,880
How could I manage them on my own?

409
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,600
Tell me. How did your bestie do it?

410
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,440
What are you talking about?

411
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,200
She got Mr. Yi abandoning his business here

412
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,760
and asking me to clear up the mess.

413
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,800
Good job, Chen Jiaxin.

414
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Didn't I tell you?

415
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,880
No women should be underestimated.

416
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,800
Let's check out the stores over there.

417
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,560
What are you doing?

418
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,320
I'm off to bed.

419
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,240
Why don't you take a look around?

420
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,120
I'll catch up with you in a minute.

421
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,800
OK.

422
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm doing shopping

423
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,480
with a relative of mine.

424
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,040
He came to work in Shanghai recently.

425
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,480
Sounds fun.

426
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,200
I envy him for your company.

427
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,840
I must go to bed now.

428
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,800
Kiss bye.

May I have the honor

437
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,720
of taking a picture for you?

438

-Sorry.
-No.

439
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,440
No, thanks.

440
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,880
Oh, right.

441

-Song!
-It'll take just a minute.

446
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,760
Just a moment, please.

447
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:57,920
What's the matter?

448
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,640
Don't push it. They wouldn't comply

449
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,120
if they're not actually a married couple.

You're right. How stupid of me!

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
Orange juice contains much sugar.

508
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,920
If the baby gets too much sugar,

509
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,160
he'll get too big for the delivery.

510
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,360
How come you know this better than I do?

511
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,720
I told you. I did my homework.

512
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,720
I borrowed a book for you.

513
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,120
You might as well read it.

514
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,320
A lying-in woman really needs

515
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,920
understanding and support from her family,

516
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,720
and psychological counselling, in particular.

517
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,640
If her mood changes

518
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,760
get neglected,

519
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,560
she's very likely to have
postpartum depression.

520
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,040
It'll be a risk you can't afford to take.

521
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,920
Well, I gathered you here because...

522
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,120
Relax, everyone.

523
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,360
I'd like to consult you

524
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,280
on the physical changes

525
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,400
a woman undergoes during pregnancy.

526
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,960
Who'd like to share with us first?

527
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,480
As I grew heavier,

528
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,480
I'd find walking really tiring.

529
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,280
After taking a long walk,

530
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,560
I'd feel my feet swelling

531
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,160
and I'd get blisters from my shoes.

532
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,160
Yes. And I often got anemia.

533
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,880
Sometimes I experienced
urinary frequency and urgency.

534
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,560
Sometimes I'd get grumpy for no reason.

535
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,920
Afterwards I couldn't
believe I'd lost control.

536
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,800
Me, too.

537
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,920
Yeah, I felt so insecure

538
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,360
when my husband was not around.

539
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,720
Don't worry.

540
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,200
I know what's going on in your body,

541
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,200
and since I'm Ximi's father

542
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,520
and you're his mother,

543
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,320
we're linked together by the family ties.

544
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,360
So feel free to tell me if you've
got any problems during pregnancy.

545
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,480
We'll work them out together.

546
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,400
Wait a second.

547
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,000
You consulted so many people, but
why didn't you ask me directly?

548
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,960
You have the final say on everything.

549
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,560
But I'm the one with the right answers,

550
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,480
don't you think?

551
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Let's eat our dinner first.

552
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:15,880
Thank you.

553
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,760
Please enjoy your dinner.

554
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,360
We'll take a walk after dinner.

555
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,360
Then you can tell me what I've got to do

556
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,880
to make things right.

557
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,720
Taking a walk can help with
relaxation and digestion.

558
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,920
Do you agree, Ximi?

559
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,840
Wait a moment.

560
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,560
My feet hurt a little.
I need to take a break.

561
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,600
Stop.

562
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,480
You've got blisters on your feet.
You can't wear these shoes anymore.

563
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,000
But I got them only six months
ago. They're pretty new.

564
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,200
It'll be a pity if I throw them away.

565
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,200
Are you feeling sad for
your shoes or for your feet?

566
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,280
I'm feeling sad for my feet,

567
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,600
as it'll take some time for them
to see pretty shoes again.

568
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
I can help with that.

569
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,120
So?

570
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,360
They're quite comfortable.

571
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,440
What about the other two pairs?

572
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,760
We'll have them both.

573
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,440
Thank you, sir.

574
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,120
Let's go.

575
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,040
Look.

576
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,680
They've got a nice tea house over there.

577
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,640
Wang Xiyi,

578
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,560
shouldn't you be with Anna in Paris?

579
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,720
Who's this?

580
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,360
Well...

581
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,400
Mr. Yi, um,

582
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,200
I should go back to the office now.

583
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,040
I'll leave you two alone.

584
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,160
I've finished the market report,

585
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,480
and I'll send it to you
as soon as I get back.

586
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,960
I must be off now. I'll carry
the bags back for you.

587
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,240
Hello.

588
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,160
Ask Jiaxin's snappish bestie

589
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,160
if she got a call from Jiaxin today.

590
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:58,840
Huh?

591
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,800
What's going on?

592
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,320
Hello?

593
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,240
He hung up on me again.

594
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,320
Where has that Snail gone?

595
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,480
Siqi is at work.

596
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,320
If I go home now,

597
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,120
Grandma will ask me

598
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,960
why I'm home without Xiyi.

599
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,840
Where on earth should I go?

600
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,320
He's been good to you

601
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,360
for Ximi's sake.

602
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,320
Anna is the woman he loves.

603
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,960
Anna is the one whom he
really wants to marry.

604
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,080
He helped me out so many times.

605
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,960
It's mean of me to feel wronged

606
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,640
after helping him this once, isn't it?

607
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,820
(Wang Xiyi)

608
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,720
Darn Snail, how dare you hang up on me?

609
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,160
You've acquired a quick temper, eh?

610
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,600
Silly Snail,

611
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,080
she must be hiding somewhere
in a miserable mood.

612
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Not again. Couldn't he just leave
me alone when I'm at work?

613
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,960
What a nutcase!

614
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,160
Liu Siqi,

615
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,680
why did you keep hanging up on me?

616
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,200
Huh?

617
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,200
He's gone crazy.

618
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,400
Who's gone crazy?

619
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,120
What are you doing?

620
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,800
What's wrong with you?
Don't you see I'm busy?

621
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,200
You can't barge in and
make a scene in our firm

622
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,960
even if your company is a VIP client of ours.

623
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,920
Cut it out. Just tell me

624
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
if Snail came to see you today.

625
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,000
Where does she usually go
when she's in a mood?

626
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,360
Sir, I'm at work now.

627
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,880
Do you know how much I charge for
my consulting service by the minute?

628
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,120
Stop wasting my time

629
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,080
on your boss's personal affairs.

630
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,480
Don't mix personal matters with work.
I'm not obliged to answer you.

631
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:21,920
Come on.

632
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,240
It is work for me, because Mr. Yi

633
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,440
asked me to find Snail for him.

634
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,680
It's your work.

635
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,000
Your boss's family affairs aren't my work.

636
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,040
You don't want to help me out, do you?

637
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,320
Fine.

638
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,360
Oh,

639
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,400
I shouldn't have helped
you by giving you a kiss...

640
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,400
He meant a kit, a tool kit.

641
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,520
A tool kit.

642
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,080
I warn you: If you dare
mention that incident again,

643
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,560
I'll make the rest of your life

644
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,080
a living hell.

645
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,840
Come on. Let's make a compromise.

646
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,240
Just tell me where Chen Jiaxin often goes

647
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,520
when she's in a mood, OK?

648
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,960
I'd never betray my friends. Never.

649
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,560
You...

650
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,120
Stay here. I'll be back in a sec.

651
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,440
Mr. Yi, she wouldn't tell me.

652
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,040
OK.

653
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,280
Mr. Yi wants to speak to you.

654
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,200
Just tell me

655
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,960
if you want to renew your contract

656
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,560
with your law firm for next year,

657
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,520
or if you want me to call Mr. Shen.

658
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,040
Hello, Mr. Yi. Jiaxin must
have returned to Huaniao Island

659
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,440
since she didn't come to see me.

660
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,520
What a changeable women!

661
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,480
You betrayed your bestie

662
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,680
soon after pledging your loyalty to her.

663
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,160
What an insincere friend you are!

664
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,200
Disgusting.

665
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,240
You know nothing at all. It's getting dark.

666
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,920
I'm worried about Jiaxin's safety.

667
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,000
Besides, I'd rather do Mr. Yi a favor

668
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,800
than help you. Who do you think you are?

669
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,560
Vixen. What a vixen!

670
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,080
Bravo.

671
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,160
It was good on the whole.

672
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,880
You've trained hard today. Take a break.

673
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,720
Thank you.

674
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,960
Hello, beauty.

675
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,880
Shouldn't you be on a shopping spree,

676
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,000
or cutting a figure at the dinner party

677
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,280
after going to the spa?

678
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,360
Why are you calling me instead?

679
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,280
Because I thought I should tell you

680
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,120
about my encounter with
your boyfriend earlier today.

681
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,240
You ran into Xiyi? What a coincidence!

682
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,120
Listen, you'd never guess
where I ran into him.

683
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,600
In front of a baby store.

684
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,760
He was acting strangely, saying
he was out on business.

685
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,200
A baby store? I can't believe it.

686
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,160
He never likes going shopping.

687
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,320
Anna,

688
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,760
you've been abroad for a long time.

689
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,560
As your friend, I need to
remind you something:

690
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,080
Xiyi was talking and laughing with a girl,

691
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
and they looked really close.

692
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,320
When he saw me, he said
they'd disguised themselves

693
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,080
as consumers to learn more
about their future channel partner.

694
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,120
He asked me to keep it secret,

695
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,520
calling it a trade secret.

696
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,080
How could I believe it?

697
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,260
(Shang'an Pier)

698
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,720
What are you doing here?

699
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,080
I was about to ask you to dinner.

700
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,920
But you sounded upset over the phone.

701
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,360
So I came to see you.

702
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,440
I wanted to go back to Huaniao Island,

703
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,760
but I missed the last ferry.

704
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,360
I'm alright. You shouldn't
have bothered to come.

705
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,440
It's no bother at all.

706
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,440
So? What happened?

707
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,240
Tell me about it.

708
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,040
I just

709
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,360
don't know how to face them anymore.

710
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,880
When I was a kid,

711
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,000
I was overjoyed to find 100 yuan

712
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,520
at my mother's noodles stall,

713
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,760
because she'd never given
me any pocket money.

714
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,920
And each year I had to hand
in all my lucky money.

715
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,600
So I spent the 100 yuan

716
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
on some stationery and my favorite snacks.

717
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,800
That was normal. You were just a kid then.

718
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,560
But the next day,

719
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,000
a woman came to the stall
with tears on her face,

720
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,440
asking my mother if she'd found 100 yuan.

721
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,080
The money was for buying
her kid some milk powder.

722
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,760
I was so frightened that I burst into tears.

723
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,960
I have become a thief.

724
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,760
Did you tell that woman

725
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,680
you'd spent the 100 yuan?

726
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,760
I wanted to,

727
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,760
but I didn't have the courage.

728
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,440
But my mother took out
100 yuan from her pocket

729
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,440
and gave the money to the woman.

730
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,200
She said she'd found it and had
been keeping it for its owner.

731
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,560
My mother cast me a glance as
she handed the money to the woman.

732
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,520
I thought my mother

733
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,440
would give me a good beating at home

734
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,440
after we closed the stall for the night.

735
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,640
But she didn't beat me.

736
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,120
She just told me seriously,

737
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,360
"You mustn't take

738
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,920
what isn't yours.

739
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,440
Take a lesson

740
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,640
from the 100 yuan."

741
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,720
Xiyi

742
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,240
is like the 100 yuan I found.

743
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,600
But I can't be a thief this time.

744
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,200
Everything I have now

745
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,440
