(Episode 29)

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,680
Don't move.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
You pervert.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
You'll be sorry

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,520
if you follow me again.

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,800
How come it's you?

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,880
Jiaxin!

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,240
The result of the brain CT

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,640
has come out. There's no concussion.

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,200
Only a little bruises,

35
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,440
and you can go.

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,400
Thank you.

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,600
Where's the man who sent me to the hospital?

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,040
You mean your husband?

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
He's not my husband.

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,440
He paid the fee for your medicine.

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,880
You can go.

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,200
Okay.

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,160
Thank you.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,600
Thanks.

45
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,960
How come he's in Hungary?

46
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,920
It's a coincidence,

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
or he's been looking for me?

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,320
Chen Jiaxin.

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,560
Jiaxin.

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,400
Chen... Chen Jiaxin.

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,320
I'm fine.

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,280
Just leave me alone.

53
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,480
Wait. Chen Jiaxin, listen to me.

54
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,640
Stop calling me!

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,800
I am Chen Jiaxin. So what?

56
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,600
If nothing else, please go away.

57
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,240
I won't.

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,320
Chen Jiaxin!

59
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,800
How come you've become like this?

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,600
Aren't you curious about why I'm in Hungary?

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,440
What I've become is none of your business!

62
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,800
As long as I'm happy with who I am now!

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,840
And

64
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm not curious about
what you are doing here.

65
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,640
Then aren't you curious

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,360
about how I've been doing
for the last three years?

67
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,960
Should I be?

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Who do you think you are?

69
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,040
My wishful ex?

70
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,040
Wang Xiyi,

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,200
we've signed the divorce agreement.

72
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,560
We don't own each other anything!

73
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,680
Let's forget about the bistro thing
and what happened today.

74
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,560
Just stop bothering me,

75
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,520
or things will go wrong.

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,640
Chen Jiaxin!

77
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,920
What are you doing?

78
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,880
I wanna care about you wishfully,

79
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,280
my ex.

80
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,400
You said that I was a perverted stalker,

81
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,680
then I don't mind becoming a real one.

82
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,440
Go!

83
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,480
Hello?

84
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,480
You haven't paid.

85
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,080
Okay.

86
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,620
It's okay. It's all for you.

87
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,500
Thank you.

88
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:24,960
Bye.

89
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,960
What are you doing?

90
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,960
Put me down!

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,760
I've come this far. I won't stop now.

92
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,080
I'll go back to China after sending you home.

93
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,800
Oh, by the way,

94
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,400
you can scream if you want.

95
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,000
Let the neighbors hear you.

96
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,040
I don't mind whatsoever.

97
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,640
You think of me as a pervert anyway.

98
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,720
Jerk.

99
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,640
The elevator is broken.

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's go.

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,720
Note me if we have arrived.

102
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,480
I don't know where's your room.

103
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,680
Here it is.

104
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,240
Put me down.

105
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,880
Put me down.

106
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,640
Okay.

107
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,280
You can leave now.

108
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
You are really not curious

109
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,760
about how I've been
over the past three years?

110
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,320
I'm in fact quite curious
about how you've been doing.

111
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,280
Hey,

112
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,520
do you have water?

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,480
No.

114
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,800
Then I'll help myself.

115
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,000
You still don't know how to lie,

116
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,520
just like three years ago.

117
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,440
Are you hungry?

118
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,680
No.

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:11,960
Alright.

120
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,960
Then maybe I am.

121
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,320
I'll just be less picky

122
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,520
and cook myself some noodles.

123
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,800
Wow,

124
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,680
so many food materials here.

125
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,640
You are very domestic.

126
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,800
But it makes sense.

127
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,800
You always like cooking.

128
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,680
I need a bowl.

129
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,880
By the way,

130
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,240
I renovated the empty meeting room

131
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,560
the year before last year

132
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,000
and changed it into a lactation room,

133
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
which is well-equipped now.

134
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,240
I didn't think it was a good idea before.

135
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,240
But later I realized that you were right,

136
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,440
and I was wrong.

137
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,000
Not only that.

138
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,320
I also remember

139
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
your advice

140
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,840
about tea break time for staff

141
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,880
and the staff room.

142
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,360
Oh, and

143
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,040
Jia Fang

144
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,520
has grown into

145
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,760
a naughty

146
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,160
little boy now.

147
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,400
I even included him

148
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,600
into a commercial for the company.

149
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,520
He felt like he was a little star.

150
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,680
Also,

151
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,400
as for your best friend Siqi,

152
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,040
Anson

153
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,080
proposed to her,

154
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,440
but failed.

155
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:00,800
Why?

156
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,320
She's your friend. How would I know?

157
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,240
How about grandma?

158
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,520
She's fine.

159
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,000
Aside from pottery,

160
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
she also fell in love with floristry.

161
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,080
She urges auntie to buy
her flowers every day.

162
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,680
Noodles are ready!

163
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:10,840
Here.

164
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,640
Taste it.

165
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,520
I told you I'm not hungry.

166
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,160
Just have a taste.

167
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,560
Seriously.

168
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,000
Chen Jiaxin,

169
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,240
what have I done that makes you

170
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,120
treat me like this?

171
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,800
Did I abuse you?

172
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,400
Was I irresponsible for you

173
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,840
or for Ximi?

174
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,160
As a husband,

175
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,400
I've done everything I could.

176
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,080
I know you were in pain.

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,800
So was I!

178
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,360
But how could you just disappear
like that for three years

179
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,880
without saying anything?

180
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,520
Don't you think you've gone too far?

181
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,400
Compared to how you cheated and used me,

182
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,040
I don't think it's too far!

183
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,240
I shouldn't have trusted you

184
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,520
that you'd really see me as your family,

185
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
and that you'd really love me and Ximi!

186
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,640
Of course I really loved you!

187
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,360
If I didn't care about you,

188
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
why would I change
that contract into a guarantee?

189
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,120
Guarantee?

190
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,240
Sure!

191
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,400
The contract is always
in the best interest of Party A.

192
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,680
As one who's used to being Party A,

193
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,920
you've always made deal with me
from a businessman's point of view!

194
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,400
I was the one ended up getting hurt.

195
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
Only me!

196
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,680
Was it Anna?

197
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,800
Let's just drop this.

198
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,240
Please leave.

199
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,360

Mom,

225
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,280
the pottery instructor is unavailable today.

226
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,920
He found you a substitute instructor.

227
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,400
Let him in.

228
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,040
Oh, okay.

229
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,000
This way, please.

230
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,680
Mom,

231
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,080
the instructor is here.

232
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,040
Careful.

233
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,600
Mrs. Wang, nice to meet you!

234
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,880
Nice to meet you, too!

235
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,800
Xiuling.

236
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,160
Yes?

237
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,280
You can leave now.

238
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:40,840
Okay.

239
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
Being sick in bed

240
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,760
and won't live for long.

241
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,960
Are you kidding?

242
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,480
I was already wondering on the plane

243
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,040
if it'd be a trick of yours!

244
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,360
You see,

245
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,000
your willful

246
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,960
personality

247
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,840
hasn't been changed

248
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,320
at all.

249
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,600
Why are you laughing?

250
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,600
Laughing about what?

251
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,960
Though you knew it was most likely a trick,

252
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,280
you still hurried here by plane,

253
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,400
didn't you?

254
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,000
You silly old woman.

255
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,440
You grumpy old man.

256
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,800
Silly Zhenzhu.

257
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,960
Coward Dragon.

258
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,480
Coward?

259
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,080
Coward Dragon.

260
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,160
I've thought it through.

261
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,680
If I didn't trick you to come back,

262
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,640
we wouldn't have another dozens of years

263
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,880
to be angry with each other.

264
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,960
We are too old to keep

265
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,320
holding grudge against one another.

266
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,040
Dignity is the last thing I care about.

267
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,800
If you do,

268
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,760
you can take it all.

269
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,000
I feel satisfied

270
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,280
as long as I can see you

271
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,680
and hear you say you are well.

272
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,840
It's the same as my grandson

273
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,000
and his wife.

274
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,680
You know, Jiaxin...

275
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,040
How did you know

276
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,560
my grandson's wife is named Jiaxin?

277
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:53,880
Huh?

278
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,760
Oh...

279
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,320
Well...

280
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,320
Dylan once mentioned her to me.

281
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,800
No.

282
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,240
You know her!

283
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,040
Where is she?

284
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,080
No. No.

285
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,760
I don't know. I know nothing. Don't ask me.

286
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,080
Coward Dragon. Look at me!

287
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,200
Tell me

288
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,160
what you know exactly.

289
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,480
Hello? Grandma.

290
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,960
What's up?

291
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,960
Xiyi,

292
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,600
don't come back so soon.

293
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,880
I've talked to Xiazhilu.

294
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,880
She suggests we design
a soap holder before the IPO.

295
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,320
I've found a perfect designer.

296
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,560
I want you

297
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,880
to take care of this thing.

298
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,440
I see.

299
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,160
What?

300
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Design a soap holder?

301
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,960
Master,

302
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,360
I thought you wouldn't do commercial design.

303
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,520
But Jiaxin,

304
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,440
it doesn't mean you can't.

305
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,400
You haven't fully exerted your talent yet.

306
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,160
You should make the best use of your talent

307
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,840
in different fields.

308
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,080
What?

309
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,600
You just sold one piece of work

310
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,160
and you are already satisfied?

311
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
No. Of course not.

312
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,720
Thank you, master.

313
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,320
I promise I won't let you down.

314
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,680
Alright, I've talked to the client,

315
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,680
who

316
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,680
will go to our studio tomorrow to see you.

317
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,920
Be nice

318
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,120
and don't be so short-tempered.

319
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,760
Okay.

320
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,480
I got it, master.

321
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,840
That's great.

322
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,840
Though they've separated for three years,

323
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,000
they are still in love with each other.

324
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,040
And now they'll finally get reconnected.

325
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,600
Stop laughing.

326
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,000
Now that I made the phone call,

327
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,280
Jiaxin will find out sooner or later
that I gave her away.

328
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,680
My image in her mind

329
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,280
will be totally ruined.

330
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,600
Don't worry!

331
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,520
Jiaxin will thank you for that.

332
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,700
(Seeyoung)

333
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,600
Xiyi,

334
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,880
are you coming back?

335
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,280
Sorry, Anna.

336
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,760
My grandma just called

337
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,320
to ask me to stay a few more days in Hungary.

338
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,880
I need to talk to a designer

339
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,720
about the soap holder design
for our new product.

340
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,000
Sure.

341
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,120
It's okay.

342
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Work comes first.

343
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,200
Take good care of yourself.

344
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,720
Okay.

345
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,880
Bye.

346
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,200
Seven, eight.

347
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,800
Six, two, three, four.

348
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,240
Five, six, seven, eight.

349
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,880
Seven, two, three, four.

350
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,160
I'll go talk about a business proposal
for the first time.

351
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,840
Should I present myself
as an artistic and casual,

352
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,960
or professional person?

353
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
How come it's you?

354
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,960
I thought you were going back.

355
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,400
Why are you still here to bother me?

356
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,720
I came to see
Master Zhongshan Long's student.

357
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,960
I'm the one.

358
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,920
You?

359
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,760
Is this the representative
for Master Zhongshan Long?

360
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,720
I'm his student.

361
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,200
Nice to meet you.

362
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,880
I'm Xiazhilu's President.

363
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,920
Your Chinese is very good.

364
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,360
I'm Elaine, Master Zhongshan Long's student.

365
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,760
My master asked me
to be in charge of this proposal.

366
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,000
Please come in.

367
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,580
(Zhongshan Long Studio)

368
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,640
I'm here because of
the reputation of Zhongshan Long.

369
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Elaine is too young.

370
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,520
I highly doubt her professional ability.

371
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,080
I believe

372
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,600
that Master Zhongshan Long
won't do anything to ruin his name.

373
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,280
Neither will Cheng Jie
sabotage its own credit.

374
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,520
I trust her.

375
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,960
Okay.

376
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,040
Then I'll give her this opportunity.

377
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,000
Did you meet Jiaxin?

378
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,240
Grandma,

379
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,600
you did this?

380
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,800
Master,

381
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,960
why did you meddle in my personal affair?

382
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,600
He and I are completely over.

383
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,240
We have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

384
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,240
Jiaxin, I didn't mean it to
meddle in your business.

385
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,200
It just reminded me of my life

386
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,760
over these years.

387
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,880
Back then,

388
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,720
when Zhenzhu got married,

389
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,480
I was just as

390
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,480
miserable as you are right now.

391
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,760
I hated myself

392
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,240
for coming back too late.

393
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,760
I blamed Zhenzhu

394
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,160
for not waiting for me.

395
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,720
And I ended up

396
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,920
living alone for all these years

397
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,640
in hatred and complaint.

398
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,240
I've suffered too much throughout the years.

399
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,880
Is that the life

400
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,000
you wanna experience too?

401
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,280
Master,

402
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
please don't force us to be together.

403
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm already over with Wang Xiyi.

404
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,480
I can't wait to get away from him.

405
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,240
If he means nothing to you,
why would you care avoiding him?

406
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,360
Huh?

407
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,320
And why a good young man like Dylan

408
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,440
still can't catch your attention

409
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,200
after pursuing you

410
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,480
for years?

411
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,760
I...

412
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,960
Stop lying to yourself.

413
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,200
Just bravely face your ex.

414
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,080
Jiaxin,

415
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:13,960
listen to me.

416
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,560
Just see him as a client

417
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,160
that you'll meet for the first time.

418
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,320
Got it?

419
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,240
Stop hesitating.

420
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,920
-It's my grandma who...
-It's my master who...

421
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,040
My master wants

422
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,640
to help your grandma

423
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,800
for the old time's sake.

424
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,120
My grandma also said

425
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,960
she found your team because she had faith

426
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,880
in Zhongshan Long's design.

427
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,800
As an artist,

428
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,800
I'm willing to accept any challenge.

429
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,760
But you have only three days

430
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,680
to alter your first draft.

431
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,840
I will send you the details later.

432
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,540
Wish us a happy cooperation.

433
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,760
Wish us a happy cooperation.

434
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,700
(Legal Advisers: Shen Dao, Zhuo Yue, Liu Siqi)

435
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,560
We haven't seen each other for three years.

436
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,960
How have you been doing?

437
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,960
Hello?

438
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,600
Chen Jiaxin.

439
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,280
I can't believe you.

440
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,840
You abandoned your best friend

441
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,840
and disappeared for three years.

442
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,560
How could you?

443
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,160
Siqi.

444
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,160
I was just thinking about you,

445
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,600
and you called me.

446
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,880
Don't call my name.

447
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,160
You are just a stranger to me now.

448
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,080
You are the most ruthless
woman in this world.

449
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,160
You think you were pretty cool, huh?

450
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,920
You just left like that, huh?

451
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,720
I'm sorry.

452
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,760
I really was reluctant to leave you.

453
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,080
Whenever I felt sad,

454
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,400
I'd think about the time

455
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,400
when you complained about your clients

456
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,720
in the office

457
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,760
while eating takeout.

458
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,400
Whenever I wanted to give up,

459
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,480
I'd think about

460
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,880
how tough you were

461
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,920
when you fought for your cases.

462
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,600
After thinking of those,

463
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,360
I regained the strength to stick to it.

464
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,520
I really,

465
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
really miss you a lot!

466
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,560
Chen Jiaxin. I...

467
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,520
I can't believe you.

468
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,480
You made me cry before I finish my words.

469
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,560
Sorry.

470
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,600
I had no other choice.

471
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,880
You knew

472
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,680
the situation back then,

473
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,600
and you knew me very well.

474
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,760
If I had stayed in Shanghai,

475
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,200
I could have never

476
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,320
gotten over with that painful memory.

477
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,120
So, I could only escape.

478
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,080
I'm so sorry.

479
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,040
I don't care.

480
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,440
You need to make it up to me.

481
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,160
Okay. Okay.

482
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I'll give you

483
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,520
whatever you want.

484
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,440
Remember your words.

485
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,760
So I want Zhongshan Long's

486
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,440
most representative work
with his autograph on.

487
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,480
The rarer, the better.

488
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,880
I'll take it to my office

489
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,160
and show it off.

490
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,920
How did you know

491
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,240
I...

492
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,400
We all know that you

493
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,480
are now working with Wang Xiyi.

494
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,720
Don't change the topic.

495
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,600
I haven't finished my list.

496
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,040
Alright.

497
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,720
Just continue.

498
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,440
You need to give me 1,000 eye masks.

499
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,200
Or, just stop me
from getting married. Seriously.

500
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,440
I really need a reason

501
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,520
to not to get married.

502
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,440
Moreover...

503
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,000
Boss,

504
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,000
you just couldn't wait to jump

505
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,960
into the Chairwoman's trap, could you?

506
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,640
Let me tell you.

507
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
It's just a business

508
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,680
that I have

509
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,200
to work

510
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,920
with someone I knew.

511
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:18,640
Really?

512
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,160
Is it that simple?

513
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,160
Then why there's a new bottle
of perfume behind you?

514
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:22,960
Huh?

515
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,920
Don't think I have no idea.

516
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,440
I bet you bought it right

517
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,760
after you met Chen Jiaxin.

518
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,840
What's wrong with remaining
a good image in front of her?

519
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
I just want her to know

520
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,000
that I've let her go,

521
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,120
and my life is still good

522
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,480
without her.

523
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,560
Sure.

524
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,360
But do you believe that?

525
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,000
I...

526
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,440
Hey! Will you just leave me alone?

527
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,200
Why do you always doubt my feelings?

528
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,840
Why wouldn't I believe that?

529
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,200
It's just business.

530
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,160
Sure. It is.

531
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,960
You are the boss. You are always right.

532
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
But let me warn you,

533
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,440
if you mix your personal
feelings with business,

534
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,040
you will break the peace that the four of you

535
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
finally achieved after a long time.

536
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,880
In that case, the price you've got to pay
will be even bigger than three years ago.

537
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,420
(Heritage)

538
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,840
Don't sign it.

539
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,580
(Signature of patient's relative)

540
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,040
Heritage. Heritage.

541
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,520
Why I can't help thinking

542
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,080
about our past and Ximi

543
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,680
when I see this word?

544
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,360
I was going

545
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,560
to buy Elaine's works secretly,

546
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,120
and I even priced them higher on purpose.

547
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,680
But who would know

548
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,680
that she found a prestigious teacher so fast?

549
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,480
Elaine is really

550
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,960
very special to you.

551
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,520
Hello?

552
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,560
He did it on purpose.

553
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,160
I bet he did.

554
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,440
Elaine!

555
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,520
What happened?

556
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,800
Take it easy.

557
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,120
Why would I design for the Heritage product?

558
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,000
Why would I think about
the history of the Heritage?

559
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,480
My head is filled with Ximi

560
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,040
as soon as I close my eyes.

561
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,360
I finally got rid of the memory

562
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,800
that I was once a mother.

563
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,760
But now I'm forced to face
the most painful memory I've ever had.

564
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,360
Why must he do this to me?

565
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,920
Why must he be so brutal to me?

566
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,560
What did I do wrong?

567
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,280
What on earth do you want?

568
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,680
Don't you think you've made
Elaine suffered enough?

569
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,440
Why are you disturbing her life again?

570
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,680
You mean our cooperation?

571
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,800
It's a decision made

572
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,080
by Zhongshan Long and my grandma.

573
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,400
I had no idea before.

574
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,000
You know clearly

575
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
what the Heritage represents.

576
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,640
If you really care about Elaine,

577
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,240
you shouldn't have revealed her wound

578
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,000
and forced her to face
the pain of losing Ximi.

579
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,880
What you should do right now

580
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,160
is to leave here

581
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,640
and stop bothering her!

582
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,040
You are such an interesting person.

583
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,680
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

584
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,440
Moreover,
from a professional point of view,

585
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,000
Elaine is my partner,

586
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,200
and I can see how confident she is

587
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,160
about her design.

588
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,360
It's a good opportunity
for her to show her talent.

589
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,520
If I neglected her feelings

590
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,400
and she wanted to give up,

591
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,360
I'd find someone else to do it.

592
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,320
Because I respect her decision.

593
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,760
Jiaxin,

594
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,680
it's me.

595
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,480
Dylan.

596
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,520
Come in. The door is open.

597
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,480
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?

598
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,040
I bought something for you.

599
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,040
Eat some before it gets cold.

600
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,520
The food of this restaurant is very popular.

601
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,560
Come on.

602
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,920
I went to talk to him earlier.

603
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,880
Why would you do that?

604
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,720
I wanted to help you get rid of this trouble.

605
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,120
He said

606
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,640
he'd respect your decision.

607
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,640
You can give up on this case.

608
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,760
But if I give up now,

609
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,040
my three years of effort

610
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,360
will go in vain.

611
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,760
Are you sure you can do this?

612
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,720
If I can't escape,

613
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,120
I'll just have to face it bravely.

614
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,360
I don't want to disappoint myself.

615
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,240
Okay.

616
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,320
Since you've decided to do it,

617
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,680
I'll just try to straighten it out

618
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,760
based on your thoughts.

619
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,360
What happened between you two

620
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,520
is always part of your life.

621
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,200
Just like eating while you are hungry,

622
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,480
you can't escape from it.

623
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,120
And only

624
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,960
by bravely confronting your past

625
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,320
can you truly come out of it.

626
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,560
Otherwise, no matter how proudly you act

627
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,880
in front of Wang Xiyi,

628
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
you know that in your heart

629
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,880
you are still afraid of him.

630
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,480
I know I shouldn't bring it up

631
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,400
to make you sad

632
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,600
at this point,

633
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,240
but just because you once had Ximi,

634
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,800
and you experienced the pain
when you lost your baby,

635
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,880
so you understand life more than others

636
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,680
and you cherish it more.

637
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,560
Also, objectively speaking,

638
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,200
no one else can do this job

639
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,520
better than you.

640
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,680
Just take this project as a regular job,

641
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,680
and take Wang Xiyi
as one of your ordinary clients.

642
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,560
But he isn't

643
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,000
that ordinary to me.

644
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,040
Okay,

645
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,640
then he's a client who's not that ordinary.

646
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,240
Elaine,

647
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,320
you can do it!

648
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,200
I have faith in you.

649
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,680
Come on.

650
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,360
Then let me give it a try.

651
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,040
It's getting cold.

652
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,320
Have a taste.

653
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,160
Jiaxin,

654
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,320
I hope you can find out the real problem,

655
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,720
but I'm also afraid that you would.

656
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,160
I you can walk out of your past,

657
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,040
will there be a place for me

658
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,840
in your future?

659
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,960
I remember

660
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,920
that this tea kettle set was bought

661
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,280
by a Japanese years ago.

662
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,920
How come you have it?

663
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,320
Five years ago,

664
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,200
that buyer's investment failed

665
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,200
and was in need of money,

666
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,240
so he separated the set
and sold them in parts.

667
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,200
The cups and kettle
ended up in different places.

668
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,440
It took me quite a while

669
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,160
to gather them back.

670
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,600
Reunion.

671
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,080
Reunion...

672
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,360
It's just like us.

673
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,800
We finally get together

674
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,040
after years of separation.

675
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,280
In the future,

676
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,040
I'll just stay here and wait for you.

677
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,400
But I still can't get over the fact

678
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,000
that you hid my grandson's wife

679
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,240
for three years.

680
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,440
Oh, by the way,

681
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,000
you really

682
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,000
should take a look

683
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,480
at Jiaxin's pottery works.

684
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,120
Though she didn't major in it,

685
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,160
her mind is never framed.

686
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,480
Her creation is full of imagination

687
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,640
and boldness.

688
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,800
But your grandson

689
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,480
probably hurt her too badly,

690
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,800
pushing her to a dead-end.

691
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,440
Otherwise,

692
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,760
she wouldn't have met me.

693
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,920
Hearing you say this,

694
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,120
I really feel quite sad.

695
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,000
If I could choose,

696
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,640
I wish Jiaxin could
still be that ignorant girl,

697
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,920
so that she wouldn't get hurt

698
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,160
by my grandson.

699
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,920
I don't agree with you.

700
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,000
If I were the one to choose,

701
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,840
I'd rather she experience
some pain and mishaps.

702
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,400
Mishaps are treasure to artists.

703
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,880
Don't you remember how painful it was

704
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,800
when we had to separate from each other?

705
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,800
After all,

706
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,160
it has all

707
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,680
become my inspiration for creation now.

708
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,600
Say, if they hadn't

709
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,800
experienced those twists and turns,

710
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,920
how could they have been able

711
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,240
to design the soap holder together

712
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,080
as equals?

713
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,200
That makes sense.

714
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,400
How could they appreciate each other more

715
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,600
without those mishaps?

716
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,560
We've been through that.

717
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,520
So have Jiaxin

718
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,640
and Xiyi.

719
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,960
Hope that this time

720
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,040
they can cherish each other.

721
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,720
We didn't let the past go and enjoy our life

722
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,200
till we are already old,

723
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,400
so I hope they won't take
too many detours like us.

724
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,400
Good evening, sir.

725
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,240
Good evening.

726
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,360
Hello? Anna.

727
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,640
Sir, can I come inside?

728
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,080
Be honest.

729
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,120
Are you dating someone in Hungary?

730
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,840
No. I'm working.

731
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,600
I meant

732
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,960
if you were dating your work in Hungary.

733
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,680
Enjoy.

734
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,480
Is there someone in your room?

735
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,680
Oh,

736
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,600
I didn't have time to eat,
so I called room service.

737
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:41,720
Alright.

738
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,120
I'll stop disturbing you.

739
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,840
Hope you'll come back soon.

740
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,720
I miss you so much.

741
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,680
I'll be back

742
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,400
after I confirmed the design.

743
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,520
Okay.

744
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,520
Then,

745
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,120
enjoy your meal.

746
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,160
