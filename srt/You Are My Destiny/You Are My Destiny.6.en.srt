(Episode 6)

28
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,360
Sorry. Hold on a minute.

29
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,080
I'll untie you.

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll take it out.

31
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,080
Are you okay?

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,040
What do you think?

33
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,600
Your family just tied me up

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,920
without looking into the rights and wrongs.

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,000
If you were tied up for the whole night,

37
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,960
how would you feel?

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,880
My whole body is sore.

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,040
You must be hungry. I brought you two zongzi.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,480
I'll peel them for you now.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,640
No.

43
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,760
I'm really sorry.

44
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,920
Here. Eat a zongzi.

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,520
Why is this zongzi translucent?

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,600
It's Huaniao Island's specialty,
the crystal sago zongzi.

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,560
It's made of sago, not glutinous rice.

48
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,160
One zongzi can't be enough.
I'll peel another one for you.

49
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,280
It tastes like sago pudding.

50
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,680
Very chewy and smooth.

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,480
Every time I worked overtime

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,000
alone in Shanghai,

53
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,800
I missed Huaniao Island's sago zongzi.

54
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,200
You can eat this one.
I'll put it here.

55
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,000
I also brought a quilt here.

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,000
Huaniao Island is different from Shanghai.

57
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,000
The temperature here is low.

58
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,960
Have a good sleep.

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,040
You'll leave tomorrow by the earliest ship.

60
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,400
I'm really sorry.

61
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,520
My mom meant no harm.

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,160
She only wanted to protect me.

63
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
It doesn't matter whose turn it is,

64
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,760
I'm always the student
who cleans up the classroom. Why?

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,280
I finished my drawing soon.

66
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,960
The teacher said my drawing was good.

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,040
Someday a boy who loves me

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,840
like my father loved my mother

69
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,320
will propose to me.

70
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,440
So you've been a pushover since childhood.

71
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,640
Don't read that.

72
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,600
That's my diary.

73
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,960
Hold on. Don't move.

74
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,160
When will you change yourself a little bit?

75
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,640
What do you mean?

76
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,960
Say "no" bravely. Dream boldly.

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,640
Muster up the courage to make a bigger wish.

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,840
Who says I don't have a wish?

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,040
Your wish

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,720
is to find a man who loves you

81
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,880
like your father loved your mother

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,480
and proposes to you on the moonlit ocean

83
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,880
and have a pigeon pair with him.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,960
Why are you apologizing again?

86
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,760
I think I made the wrong wish.

87
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,840
You already have a girlfriend.

88
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,160
And I seem to have screwed up everything.

89
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,120
You're so weird.

90
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,720
It's not your fault, but you apologize.

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,480
Even if it's your fault,

92
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,640
your apology

93
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,960
won't make other people forgive you.

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,560
I'm telling...

95
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,200
What?

96
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,800
A cockroach! A cockroach!

97
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,760
Squash it!

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,480
Squash it right now!

99
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
Okay. I'll take care of it.

100
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,360
Come on. Hurry.

101
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,880
I'll take care of it.

102
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
Just stamp on it.

103
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,280
What are you doing?

104
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,880
It's a life after all.

105
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,680
I'll throw it out.

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,200
No need to kill it.

107
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,720
Hey.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,040
What if it comes back?

109
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,440
I'm telling you,

110
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,200
if it comes back to me,

111
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,640
I will make you pay.

112
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,840
Then...

113
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,840
Then I will leave after you fall asleep.

114
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,240
I don't need it. Just cover yourself.

115
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,960
You should have it.

116
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,280
You're shivering.

117
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,440
It's okay. You don't understand.

118
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,920
I'm just

119
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,240
flexing my muscles.

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,760
It's a process of burning brown fat
and producing heat.

121
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,120
Do you think

122
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,400
if you didn't receive that call,

123
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,800
we would be free now?

124
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,040
Our lives will never be the same

125
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,960
as when we stayed away from each other.

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
If we don't get rid of this trouble,

127
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,200
we'll never get

128
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,280
our lives back.

129
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
You think this is trouble?

130
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,600
That's not what I mean.

131
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,320
Don't get me wrong.

132
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,040
I was thinking...

133
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,520
Ah. Never mind.

134
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,800
We'll figure it out
after Grandma arrives tomorrow.

135
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,880
I'll go to sleep now.

Aunt.

Xiaodouzi.

160
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,800
Your home appliances are here.
Sign and receive the parcels.

161
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,080
I didn't buy these things.

162
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,760
You must be mistaken.

163
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,200
Don't play with me, Aunt.

164
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,760
Look. This is your address.

165
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,040
It's my address.
But I didn't buy these things.

166
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,840
No way, Aunt, you must be mistaken.

167
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,840
I said I didn't buy these things.
And it's true.

168
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,840
Take these things away.

169
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,800
I bought these things.

170
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,640
Take everything inside.

171
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,640
Hey, stop it.

172
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,160
You must be Mrs. Chen.

173
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,800
I'm Xiyi's grandmother.
My name is Wang Zhenzhu.

174
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,080
Look. Here is the wedding
certificate of our children.

175
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,200
I can't read it.

176
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,880
Don't worry. It's a Bahamian
wedding certificate.

177
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,360
It's legally valid.

178
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,440
It means

179
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,480
Jiaxin is our Wang family's

180
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,680
legitimate granddaughter-in-law.

181
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,800
Her child will be born

182
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,600
with the right to inherit Cheng Jie Group.

183
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,120
Inherit? What group?

184
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,200
Inherit Cheng Jie Group.

185
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,600
Xiyi is such a rude boy.

186
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,760
Although they have got married,

187
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,680
he still needs to follow
the normal procedure.

188
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,600
For instance, the husband should
give the wife betrothal gifts

189
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,640
and presents.

190
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,320
Nothing must be left out. Am I right?

191
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,720
Mrs. Chen,

192
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,520
where are my grandson
and granddaughter-in-law?

193
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,040
If I gave birth to the child,

194
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,520
but failed to provide the child
with a complete family,

195
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,440
I'd feel sorry for him
for the rest of my life.

196
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,200
Besides, his existence would always

197
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
be a hindrance between you and Anna.

198
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,520
I wouldn't want him to think

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,520
that his birth

200
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,600
wasn't blessed.

201
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm going to the hospital.

202
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,120
Jiaxin.

203
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,280
Where is the hospital?

204
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,480
Grandma.

205
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,720
You're here already?

206
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,440
Are you ill? Why do you
need to visit the hospital?

207
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
It's not about me.

208
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,600
It's about Chen Jiaxin.

209
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,640
Jiaxin? What's wrong with Jiaxin?

210
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,000
She left to have an induced abortion.

211
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,760
What?

212
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,320
What have you done to her?

213
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,200
I haven't done anything to her.

214
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,560
Jiaxin left to have an induced abortion.
And you're still standing here.

215
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Are you a man or not?

216
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,840
Just tell me where the hospital is!

217
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,100

Shengsi County People's Hospital)

219
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,920
Chen Jiaxin.

220
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,240
Chen Jiaxin, it's your turn.

221
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Are you here for a pregnancy checkup?

222
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,400
Ah.

223
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,280
Is the hospital far from here?

224
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,760
It's right ahead. Speed up.

225
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,160
How many weeks?

226
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,520
Have you brought your medical record?

227
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,680
Actually,

228
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,080
this is the first time I've been here.

229
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,600
There is Xiyi.

230
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,600
Driver, please speed up.
Catch up with the young man ahead.

231
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,880
Xiyi!

232
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,280
Wang Xiyi!

233
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,480
Come on. Get in the car.

234
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,920
Get in the car.

235
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,040
Come in.

236
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,480
Soon, the doctor will perform
a B-scan for you

237
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,840
and check on the child.

238
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,120
Don't be afraid.

239
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,240
Our Department of Gynecology
and Obstetrics is excellent.

240
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,960
This is your first child, right?

241
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,720
Women bearing children
for the first time do behave like this.

242
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,200
It's okay. Don't worry.

243
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,920
But the child's father isn't doing his job.

244
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,080
No matter how much work he has,

245
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,000
he shouldn't have let you
come here alone in this stage.

246
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,880
I didn't want to trouble him.

247
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,400
The child belongs to the two of you.

248
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,880
You wouldn't trouble him.

249
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,520
Wait here for a while.
The doctor will be here soon.

250
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,040
Yes.

251
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,680
What's wrong with the car? Keep driving.

252
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,040
What happened?

253
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,600
It ran out of power at the critical moment.

254
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,920
Worst timing ever.

255
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,360
Why are you still dangling here?

256
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,720
You think you are a lizard?

257
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,400
Run to the hospital. Hurry up.

258
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,720
Run.

259
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,120
You might feel a little cold.
Bear with it. It'll be over soon.

260
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,600
Here. Lift it up.

261
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,680
Where is the Department
of Gynecology and Obstetrics?

262
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,640
The third room in the corridor ahead.

263
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,920
Okay. Thank you.

264
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,040
Do you have a patient named Chen Jiaxin?

265
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,760
How are you related to her?

266
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,840
I'm her husband.

267
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,320
Look. It's your child.

268
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,360
My child.

269
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,480
So tiny.

270
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,480
Like a tiny grain of sago.

271
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,560
Listen. It's the child's heartbeat.

272
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,560
The child already has a heartbeat.

273
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,080
Yeah.

274
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,080
The child's heartbeat sounds strong.

275
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,920
The child must be healthy.

276
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,160
Alright. Get up.

277
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,840
The child is healthy.

278
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,040
There's no problem. Don't worry.

279
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,000
However, you need to come here and
take a pregnancy checkup on a regular basis.

280
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,560
Here. Your report.

281
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,320
Doctor.

282
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,320
I have a question.

283
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,720
If I

284
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,240
get an abortion,

285
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,160
will the child be painful?

286
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,120
I thought you were here
for a pregnancy checkup.

287

00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,520
Of course the child is cute.

338
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,560
Sago.

339
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,000
Little Ximi (sago) is a good name.

340
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,360
I'm Wang Zhenzhu (Pearl).
And the child is Wang Ximi (Sago).

341
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,640
We are both round and plump.

342

Little Ximi, I'm your
great-grandmother Zhenzhu.

(B-scan Examination Report)

Now that the child is safe,

345
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,080
we only have one problem to solve.

346
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,680
Grandma Zhenzhu,

347
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,240
as Jiaxin's family and friends,

348
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,560
we all know she is pregnant.

349
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,280
But nobody knows

350
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,680
who the child's father is.

351
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,360
That problem is easy to solve.

352
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,800
Today,

353
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,960
we'll invite all our friends
on the island to our place

354
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,480
and I'll declare that Jiaxin
is the granddaughter-in-law

of the head of Cheng Jie Group.

You're really decisive, Grandma Zhenzhu.

357
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Good boy.

358
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,440
So cute.

Chen Jiaxin, you are having
your wedding photos taken.

364
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,160
You aren't having your graduation photos
taken with your schoolmates like before.

365
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,400
Give me a more natural facial expression.

366
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,000
The two of you, move closer to each other.

368
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,760
Well, we already have a wedding certificate.

369
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,640
We should have some
proper wedding photos taken.

370
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,880
After all, the wedding photos will be of use.

371
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,880
Come on. Get ready.

Says who?

376
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,480
You think this kind of design is outdated.

377
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,160
But this is different.

378
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,080
Your father used up his savings

379
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,400
to buy these wedding dresses for both of us.

380
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,200
My father treated you really well.

Except for the central part,

384
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,200
the whole piece of jewelry is gilded.

385
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,680
Back in the day, no one on the island

386
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,880
wore this kind of jewelry for their wedding.

387
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,720
Your father went to Shanghai

388
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,280
and found a gold jewelry store

389
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,120
to make this piece of
jewelry specially for me.

390
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,720
I scolded him

391
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,400
for wasting money.

392
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,760
But he said

393
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,280
it could be passed down

394
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,880
to our future daughter or daughter-in-law.

395
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,600
Does it look good?

396
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:56,960
Yes, it does.

397
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,080
Go put on your wedding dress.

398
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,480
Yes.

399
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,920
How is it?

400
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,280
It's so beautiful.

401
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,560
So beautiful.

402
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,120
Seeing you

403
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,000
is like seeing the younger me.

404
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,960
I remember I was so nervous

405
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,480
on the night before the wedding day
that I couldn't sleep.

406
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,160
Your father lost sleep too.

407
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,360
He sneaked up on the window
of my room at midnight.

408
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,560
I remember he took my hand

409
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,800
that night and told me

410
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,960
he'd leave me in charge of all his income.

411

412

Then...

413
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,120
Then his words turned out to be lies.

414
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,360
A shipwreck took him away.

415
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,080
I was left alone...

416
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,040
I was left alone to bring you up.

417
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,200
How come men brag so much?

418
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,440
He shouldn't have
talked big without thinking.

419
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,080
At least, he should make sure
there would be two people bringing you up.

420
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,200
You were pretty hard to raise, you know?

421
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,880
Mom.

422
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,760
I'm sorry

423
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,400
for making you worry about me.

424
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,520
I want to worry about you.

425
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,800
But I won't get the chance anymore.

426
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,600
You'll have your own family and child.

427
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,640
And I won't be able

428
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,080
to call you back at will.

429
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,560
I won't...

430
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,200
I won't be able to bring you with me anymore.

431
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,800
But remember this.

432
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,720
You'll always be my girl.

433
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,680
I don't yet know

434
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,680
what kind of person

435
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,400
that young man

436
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,160
named Wang is.

437
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,720
But keep this in mind.

438
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,920
This place will always be your home.

439
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,320
Your mother will always be your mother.

440
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,760
Understood?

441
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,080
It's all my fault.

442
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,400
Don't cry. Don't cry.

443
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,080
Crying will make you look ugly.

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,600
Congratulations.
Congratulations. Congratulations.

451
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,240
Take a seat.

You can't smile?

455
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,600
But you must smile at the wedding.

You know I...

458
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,160
I only know you arranged
the wedding on the cruise ship,

459
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,920
you turned the act into a real relationship,

460
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,040
and you decided to keep

461
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,840
the unborn child in the end.

462
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,360
You shouldn't be feeling
wronged as the groom.

463
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,200
Grandma Zhenzhu.

464
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,280
Yes.

welcome to the wedding of Chen Jiaxin,

00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,480
the daughter of Xishi.

471
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,600
Let's welcome the groom and the bride

472
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
with the most enthusiastic applause.

473
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,760
Now the officiant will deliver a speech.

474
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,520
Thank you. Thank you all.

475
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,600
Oh,

476
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,120
I'm so delighted today.

477
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,920
I managed to arrive
on Huaniao Island to see you

478
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,560
and attend the wedding of my grandson
and granddaughter-in-law.

479
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,520
However,

480
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,400
the banquet was held in a rush.

481
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,680
My granddaughter-in-law
and you all deserve better.

482
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,600
When the child is one-month-old,

483
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,800
I'll book a whole ship
and take you to Shanghai.

484
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,040
Hope to see you there.

485
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,040
A thank-you to the officiant.

486
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,640
Now the bride's mother,

487
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,320
Xishi, whom you are familiar with,

488
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,680
will deliver a speech as well.

489
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,560
Let's hear from her.

490
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,880
Greetings to you, folks.

491
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,040
Oh,

492
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,240
I'm feeling so...

493
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,720
I...

494
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,680
I'm really grateful that you came

495
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,480
to attend Jiaxin's wedding.

496
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
I'm really grateful.

497
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,200
I...

498
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,080
I just called her yesterday

499
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,520
and told her to come back.

500
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,800
I didn't expect to witness her wedding today.

501
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,200
She has become a man's wife.

502
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,120
Our Xishi

503
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,440
is too excited today.

504
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,240
Give her some time to calm down, okay?

505
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,520
Okay.

506
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,280
Now let's hear from the bride,

507
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,800
who is the most beautiful woman today, okay?

508
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,320
Yeah!

509
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,840
Hello.

510
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,160
I...

511
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,560
I...

512
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
I...

513
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,600
I... I am Chen Jiaxin.

514
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,360
Come on, everyone here knows you.

515
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,160
That's not what we want to hear, right?

516
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,480
Yeah.

517
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,240
We want to know how you met the groom.

518
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,200
Am I right?

519
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,680
Yeah!

520
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,320
Tell us.

521
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,440
How did you two meet?

522
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,280
Say something.

523
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,240
Tell us about it.

524
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,600
Say something.

525
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,200
Say it!

526
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,720
We...

527
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,000
We are like any other couple.

528
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,120
How so?

529
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah. Don't be shy.

530
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,440
You're married now.

531
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,320
Tell us.

532
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,720
Think about it.

533
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,160
Don't be shy.

534
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
Stop being shy. Say something else.

535
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,920
We are

536
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,640
the same as any other couple.

537
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,720
We just moved a little faster in our relationship
and went through more unexpected events.

538
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,600
Enjoy the foods and drinks.

539
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,080
You aren't leaving so soon.

540
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,560
You have to kiss.

541
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,200
Yeah.

542
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:48,320
Kiss.

543
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,120
You need to kiss on the lips.

544
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,520
That won't do.

545
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,760
How about this? Let's count to ten.

546
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Before we finish counting to ten,

547
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,880
the groom and the bride must not separate.
What do you say?

548
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,960
Yeah!

549
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:15,960
Kiss on the lips.

550
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,040
I'm telling you,

551
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,800
this doesn't count as a real kiss.

552
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:34,160
Kiss on the lips.

553
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
This must be a dream.

554
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,120
I'll realize that nothing
happened after I wake up.

555
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,800
I only love Anna.

556
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,080
I only love Anna.

557
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,840
The ritual has ended.

558
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,120
Now feel free to enjoy

559
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,480
the dinner prepared
by the groom and the bride.

560
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,200
Wish you a lifetime of happiness.

561
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,920
May you have a lifetime
of harmony and a child soon.

562
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,040
Here.

563
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,720
Congratulations. Congratulations.

564
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,960
Assistant Anson, I'm sorry that I didn't know

565
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,960
you were here yesterday.

566
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,360
I'll have a drink as my punishment.

567
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,000
No. The Chairwoman said

568
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,600
we were a family now.

569
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,200
We are a family.

570
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,200
Let's have a joyful toast.

571
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,680
No formalities between
family members. Cheers.

572
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,280
Cheers. Here.

573
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,640
The groom and the bride
are here to toast you.

574
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,840
Come on.

575
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,880
Let's congratulate the newly wedded couple

576
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,000
and congratulate the Chairwoman.

577
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Come on. Let's have a look there.

578
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,680
Don't drink too much.

579
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,040
Come on. Back to drinking.

580
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,480
What's the matter?

581
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,440
Why are you here?

582
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,640
I... I...

583
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,360
I thought you came for business.

584
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,600
But you ended up holding a wedding.

585
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,520
Grandma is here.

586
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,160
Can't you see what's going on?

587
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,960
I don't understand.

588
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,120
Chen Jiaxin is pregnant.

589
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,040
My goodness.

590
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,160
I can't believe this small probability
event happened to you.

591
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,280
I... I... I didn't do it on purpose.

592
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,240
I thought the woman was Anna.

593
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,120
Have I blamed you?

594
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,840
Can I make you marry her
or give birth to a child for me

595
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,960
by blaming you?

596
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,000
I can't do those things for you. I can't.

597
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,240
Do those things yourself. I can't.

598
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,560
Hey,

599
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
that woman

600
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,640
feels shrewd to me somehow.

601
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,720
Chen Jiaxin?

602
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,720
It's Chen Jiaxin.

603
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,240
She would apologize non-stop

604
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,760
for the most trivial matters.

605
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,360
If she was a little evil or greedy,

606
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,600
this would be so much easier.

607
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,640
That's what I mean.

608
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,560
Take it easy. Listen to me.

609
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,520
You don't understand what I'm saying.

610
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,720
Dude,

611
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,040
I have seen numerous women.

612
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,040
Many women can turn
a marriage into a divorce.

613
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,600
But few women

614
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,440
can suddenly turn a divorce

615
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,200
into a marriage.

616
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,400
Listen to me. Just think about it.

617
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,120
She may be pure-minded right now.

618
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,720
But she, a nobody,

619
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,800
has suddenly become the center of attention

620
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,760
because she is pregnant.

621
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,440
You think the nobody will go back

622
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
to lead a miserable life after all this?

623
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,240
As an onlooker, I think

624
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,680
she is like

625
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,720
a little snail

626
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,080
that looks meek and cowardly.

627
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,200
But do you know
what the snail's biggest trait is?

628
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,720
The snail's biggest trait

629
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,920
is its high absorption capacity.

630
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,360
It won't let go of anything it sticks to.

631
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,560
It will climb slowly

632
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,680
and reach the destination eventually.

633
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,160
It will climb up to your head.

634
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,080
Are you done talking?

635
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,200
Go back and drink.
I want to have some alone time.

636
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,320
But I'm afraid that you...

637
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,160
Don't worry.
The factory won't dismiss anyone.

638
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,440
Then what about the money?

639
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,040
Yeah.

640
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,000
We all have got paid.

641
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,200
Don't worry. The Chairwoman just said

642
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,360
we were a family from now on.

643
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,120
Family members won't be dismissed. Right?

644
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,400
Yeah. You are right.

645
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,200
We are a family now.

646
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,840
Hello? Dylan.

647
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,680
Have you received the photos I sent you?

648
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,160
Yes. Yes.

649
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,600
If you hadn't informed me,

650
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,440
I wouldn't have had a wedding to attend.

651
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,160
You are a great matchmaker.

652
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,720
Alright. I'll hang up now.

653
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,720
I need to go back.

654
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,760
So, you all see me as a joke.

655
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,200
Don't be afraid. You must be scared.

656
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,440
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,120
Are you hungry?

658
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,640
No, Mom.

659
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
I'll make some bland food for you.

660
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,800
The dishes the cook made tonight
were strong-flavored.

661
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,200
I saw you barely eat anything.

662
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,480
No, Mom, I'm not hungry.

663
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,840
Don't stand in my way.

664
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,240
If I spent the time cooking
instead of talking to you,

665
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,120
the food would be ready by now.

666
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,800
Would you like to eat noodles
with tomato-egg sauce?

667
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,240
Yeah.

668
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,680
Go get the dried noodles
in the fridge out there.

669
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,440
Okay?

670
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,440
Okay. I will go.

671
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,800
I was more miserable than you
as an expectant mother.

672
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,040
Nausea tortured me all the time.

673
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,640
I felt like vomiting
every time I smelled food.

674
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,960
After I ingested some food,
my urge to vomit grew stronger.

675
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,480
I couldn't taste anything.

676
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,800
Same here.

677
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,360
Bitterness lingers in my mouth.
Not even candy can remove the taste.

678
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,520
Is that so?

679
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,360
Have a bite.

680
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,360
Will this work?

681
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,680
Give it a try.

682
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,000
Pass the salt to me.

683
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,640
How do you feel?

684
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,640
My taste has improved greatly.

685
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,880
Oh, you

686
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,440
can't even take care of yourself.

687
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,480
How can you take care of little Ximi?

688
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,840
Alright.

689
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,800
So delicious.

690
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,320
I ate so many kinds of noodles in Shanghai.

691
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,320
But your noodles are the best.

692
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,880
Do you remember what I told you

693
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,880
before you left for Shanghai?

694
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,440
You aren't smart enough

695
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,200
and you aren't that pretty.

696
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,760
You should try to
humor other people out there.

697
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,280
Do a little more work than other people.

698
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,960
Suffer a little more losses
than other people.

699
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,120
Heaven will know your sacrifices and efforts.

700
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,080
Yeah.

701
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,800
Over the years,

702
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,160
I've been doing as you said.

703
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,600
From now on, you should
stop thinking for other people.

704
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,600
Put yourself first no matter what happens.

705
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,880
You're a mother now.

706
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,800
People say that a woman becomes stronger
when she has children.

707
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,600
You need to fight for little Ximi's benefits,

708
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,600
and you need to fight until the end,

709
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,280
you know?

710
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,040
So that's why you filed a complaint

711
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,600
against the teacher who called me dumb.

712
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,920
After my desk mate in elementary school

713
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,920
dragged me by the braid and bullied me,

714
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,000
you went to my desk mate's home
and complained fiercely.

715
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,280
I couldn't afford not to be fierce.

716
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,600
Heck.

717
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,120
If I hadn't acted fiercely,

718
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,080
they would have thought

719
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,760
the fatherless girl and the widow
were easy targets.

720
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,800
It's okay if they bullied me.

721
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,080
But if they bullied my daughter,

722
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,960
I'd scold them and let them call me a shrew.

723
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,360
Go use that rag to wipe that place dry.

724
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,640
You can find a dry rag over there.

725
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,560
I'm sorry, Mom.

726
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,440
What? What did you say?

727
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,240
I said sorry.

728
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,920
Why you apologize all of a sudden?

729
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,760
When I was little,

730
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,240
I always thought you were ferocious.

731
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,480
My schoolmates feared you.

732
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,480
I envied my schoolmates

733
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,880
for their gentle mothers with good tempers.

734
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,880
My biggest fear was you going
to the parent-teacher conference

735
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,200
and embarrassing me.

736
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
Now I look back on it,

737
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,040
I was so childish back then.

738
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,280
I'm sorry, Mom.

739
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,920
It's not a big deal.

740
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,440
You're crying.

741
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,920
No bride sniffs and cries

742
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,280
like you do.

743
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,360
You shouldn't apologize to me.

744
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,000
You should apologize
to little Ximi in your belly.

745
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,160
Little Ximi,

746
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,480
your mother must have given you
a good scare today.

747
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,040
I'm sorry, baby.

748
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,920
Tonight is your wedding night.

749
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,040
Go upstairs and sleep.

750
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,680
Stop hesitating. Go.

751
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,640
Go upstairs.

752
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,000
I think I've started to know

753
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
