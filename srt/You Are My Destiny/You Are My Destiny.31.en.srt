00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,940
(Episode 31)

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,800
Do you know

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,880
what is the wonderful cure for colds?

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,840
It's to find a silly girl who comes to me

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,800
and then pass the virus

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,240
to her.

31
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,480
The water is boiling.

32
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,000
Why did you allow me to kiss you?

33
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,240
I want you to get it over faster.

34
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,720
I'll get a towel for you.

35
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,640
What a fool.

36
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,160
Sorry.

37
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,200
I shouldn't have done that to you.

38
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,120
It's fine.

39
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,520
I've got cold medicine at home.

40
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,120
I'll take some after I go back.

41
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,560
Chen Jiaxin.

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,240
I kissed you not to get the cold over.

43
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,320
I just wanted to do that.

44
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,120
I feel regret.

45
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,840
I want Ximi.

46
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,720
And I want to live happily

47
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,880
with Ximi's mom together.

48
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,120
I should've realized this three years ago.

49
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,280
Your wishes

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,760
are my birthday wishes.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,240
Stop it.

52
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,400
The first time I saw you in Hungary,

53
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,800
I fell for you.

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,920
I told myself

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,640
not to bother you any longer.

56
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,000
But my curiosity pushed me

57
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,240
to see

58
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
how you're doing.

59
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,600
I found that

60
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,480
it's a right decision for you to leave me.

61
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,720
You've become so confident.

62
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,880
As Elaine, you're so charming

63
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,080
and happy.

64
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,720
You don't need me any longer.

65
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,800
But just now...

66
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,680
...when I saw you take care of me,

67
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,120
I feel so happy

68
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
and blessed.

69
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,120
Maybe

70
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,880
in your mind,

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,880
there is still some room for me.

72
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,240
Chen Jiaxin,

73
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,200
I feel regret.

74
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,720
I should've protected you better.

75
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,120
I should've known you better earlier.

76
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,480
I should've

77
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,880
learned to cherish you earlier.

78
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,760
I...

79
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,680
I became Elaine through great efforts,

80
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,920
but sometimes,

81
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm still afraid

82
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,840
and cowardly,

83
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,760
especially

84
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,320
in front of you.

85
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,600
Actually,

86
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,040
I still want to be your Chen Jiaxin.

Daddy Cricket.

100
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,520
Elaine, the excellent designer,

101
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,840
have you arrived home?

102
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,880
Sorry.

103
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,120
Sorry.

104
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,600
Sorry.

105
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,000
Anna,

106
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,600
why are you here?

107
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,880
I miss you. Okay?

108
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,200
Why are you so surprised?

109
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,680
Are you hiding something from me?

110
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,920
Just tell me. Did you miss me?

111
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,160
Alas.

112
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,640
Your forehead is hot.

113
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,480
Come on. Sit down.

114
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,160
You should've taken better care of yourself.

115
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,680
I'm really worried about you.

116
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:30,880
Anna,

117
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,320
listen to me. I...

118
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,280
It's not the right time

119
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,360
to explain why you
didn't take care of yourself.

120
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,280
You're running a high fever.

121
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,040
Come on.

122
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,200
Do as I say.

123
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,680
Forget about all your work

124
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,720
and have a good sleep tonight.

125
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,840
I'll go and get you some cold medicine

126
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,840
and also some porridge. Okay?

127
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,040
Wait for me.

128
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,920
Take this back.

129
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,760
I suspect that

130
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,040
it betrayed me

131
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,560
and made me unable to shake off Wang Xiyi.

132
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,640
Have a talk with it.

133
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,640
Liar.

134
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,360
Obviously he's a liar.

135
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,240
How could I be so stupid?

136
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,400
I shouldn't have got close

137
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,880
to him.

138
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,600
He treated me like that.

139
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,320
I really don't understand why I did that.

140
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,800
Why?

141
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,360
What on earth was on my mind?

142
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,240
Do you know?

143
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,720
At that time,

144
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,720
he did that to me just for Anna.

145
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,240
He asked me to give birth
for the two of them.

146
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,640
He treated me like that.

147
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,880
I shouldn't have approached him again.

148
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,120
I'm so cheap.

149
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,240
I thought he's still into me.

150
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,440
The two of them

151
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,720
didn't separate at all.

152
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,080
Several years have passed.

153
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,480
It's such a long time.

154
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,480
I thought I've forgotten him.

155
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,160
I thought I won't give a shit about it.

156
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,920
Really.

157
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,120
But why am I...

158
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,480
...still feeling so bad?

159
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,960
Did you forget

160
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,320
the pain you bore three years ago?

161
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,440
Do you want to go through

162
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,920
the same sufferings again?

163
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,640
From the very beginning,

164
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,080
you shouldn't have accepted this job.

165
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,080
Now you know

166
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,680
how negatively Wang Xiyi can influence you.

167
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,760
I just don't want to give up
a development opportunity

168
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,360
because of what happened before.

169
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,640
You're lying.

170
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,240
You accepted this job

171
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
because some part of you

172
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,760
still can't forget your feelings for him.

173
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,360
What should I do?

174
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,240
Run away.

175
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,160
It's shameful,

176
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,840
but it works.

177
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Do you know

178
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,160
what is the wonderful cure for colds?

179
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,880
It's to find a silly girl

180
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,040
who comes to me

181
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,360
and then pass the virus

182
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,760
to her.

183
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:27,880
Anna.

184
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,720
Just tell me. Did you miss me?

185
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,080
Why are you so surprised?

186
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,480
Are you hiding something from me?

187
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,480
Shi Anna,

188
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,080
why are you so humble in this relationship?

189
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,640
Why don't you have the guts to question him?

190
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,720
Why did you run away?

191
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,120
Are you that afraid to lose him?

192
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,120
How are you doing?

193
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,000
Are you feeling better after taking medicine
and having a good sleep?

194
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,000
Are you hungry?

195
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,440
Let's have some breakfast.

196
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,760
Anna,

197
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,120
let's stop forcing ourselves.

198
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,800
No.

199
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,480
You've tried hard for three years

200
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,200
and I've cooperated for three years.

201
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,000
But we have to face the fact.

202
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,360
Let it go.

203
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,280
I'll let you know
when I'm ready to let it go.

204
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,960
Currently, I'm not.

205
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,240
Go and get cleaned up.

206
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,480
I'll wait for you downstairs.

207
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,200
Sir,

208
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,680
a lady sent a letter here
in the middle of the night.

209
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,280
She asked the front desk
to hand this over to you.

210
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,280
Thanks.

211
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,440
What happened in the evening
is just an accident.

212
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,160
I hope you won't get it wrong.

213
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,080
There is no possibility for me
to reconcile with you.

214
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,200
I don't want to be the old Chen Jiaxin again.

215
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,600
I like to live as Elaine.

216
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,000
I sold my first artwork

217
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,200
and finished my first design.

218
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,040
Now that we agreed to move on,

219
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,040
let's take good care of ourselves

220
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,360
and not see each other again.

221
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,000
Don't come to me.

222
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,360
Don't call me.

223
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,040
Elaine.

224
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,960
Chen Jiaxin.

225
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,200
Open the door, Chen Jiaxin.

226
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,200
Chen Jiaxin.

227
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,440
Open the door, Chen Jiaxin.

228
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,880
Chen Jiaxin.

229
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,560
Chen Jiaxin.

230
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,360
Jiaxin.

231
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,000
It's enough.

232
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,400
You've been chopping wood the whole morning.

233
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,040
Hurry.

234
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,320
Come here and eat something.

235
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,880
Chen Jiaxin.

236
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,240
Chen Jiaxin.

237
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,880
What do you mean by this?

238
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,320
I've made it very clear.

239
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,960
We'd better not see each other again.

240
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,240
And,

241
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,240
I'm Elaine.

242
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,200
There is no Chen Jiaxin here.

243
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,200
Jiaxin,

244
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,400
I'm sorry.

245
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,960
You don't need to apologize.

246
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,400
Wang Xiyi,

247
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,400
forget about the past.

248
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,560
Let bygones be bygones.

249
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,760
But I can't get over you.

250
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,680
Since I saw you again,

251
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,360
I found that

252
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,840
what I want is just you.

253
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,040
Only you can make me feel warm

254
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,800
and happy,

255
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,360
and give me the family life I want.

256
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,000
Jiaxin,

257
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,200
can you give me one more chance?

258
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,360
I...

259
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,320
Jiaxin.

260
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,120
Let go of me.

261
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,600
It's all my fault.

262
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,800
Please forgive me.

263
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,760
We can

264
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,000
have one more baby like Ximi.

265
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,800
You're not qualified to mention Ximi.

266
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,560
Jiaxin!

267
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
So far, you still haven't realized

268
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,400
what your problem is.

269
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,640
Do you really understand

270
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,840
how much Elaine has suffered
from the loss of Ximi?

271
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,480
You think she hates you.

272
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,120
Actually, she hates herself

273
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,520
because she thinks
she failed to protect Ximi.

274
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,800
She can't really cheer up.

275
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,520
On the same day of every year,

276
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,280
she'll punish herself

277
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,560
by locking herself in a dark room.

278
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,960
She said she wants to know

279
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,480
how Ximi felt in the darkness.

280
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,880
How dare you say

281
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,600
you'll have another Ximi?

282
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,720
Don't chase after Elaine.

283
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,320
You've never chased after her.

284
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,000
Three years ago,

285
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,280
you married her

286
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,680
just because of an incident.

287
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,920
Now you want her to accept you

288
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,000
without doing anything for her.

289
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,640
Why should she do that?

290
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,760
I'll protect Jiaxin

291
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,760
in my own way.

292
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,000
It's none of your business.

293
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,280
What a small world.

294
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,520
Qing.

295
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,760
Anna is Qing,

296
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,760
my younger sister I tried
so hard to find.

297
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,600
I can't believe she's Wang Xiyi's girlfriend.

298
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,200
What can I get you?

299
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,680
A cup of coffee.

300
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,120
Okay. It's 890 Forint.

301
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,440
I'm sorry.

302
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,960
I'll come back next time.

303
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,520
Thank you.

304
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,000
Okay.

305
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,280

Please put it in this.

336
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,160
Okay.

337
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,160
Here?

338
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,600
Yep.

339
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,280
No problem.

340
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,560

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,400
Have a nice day.

343
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,760
There is still affection between you two.

344
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,720
Why aren't you back together?

345
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,400
Chen Jiaxin,

346
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,000
you're too hesitant.

347
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
I'd better forget about it.

348
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,480
It's so demanding

349
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,720
to maintain a relationship.

350
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,520
And it may break your heart at anytime.

351
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,240
That's too much for me.

352
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,520
Stay with him if you're still into him.

353
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,640
Don't make things complicated.

354
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,720
Could it be that

355
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,600
you're now in a dilemma

356
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,040
because of Dylan?

357
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,680
Dylan and I are just friends.

358
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,320
Don't say that again.

359
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,160
You've got a package. Please sign it.

360
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,240
I gotta go.

361
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:16,680
Bye.

362
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,920
Okay. Bye.

363
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,040
Your package.

364
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,760
Please sign it.

365
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,640
Okay.

366
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,520
Bye.

367
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,400
Bye.

368
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,540
(Ryan: Mr. W sent this to the art gallery.)

369
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,560
The "courage" is a gift for you.

370
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,440
I hope it can put you in a good mood.

371
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,880
Have you finished any new design recently?

372
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,280
If you want to have more communication

373
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,240
with me, your big fan,

374
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,640
please add me on WeChat.

375
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,680
Shi Anna.

376
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,560
(Shi Anna)

377
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,840
Little is known about her biological parents.

378
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,400
Her foster mother is Shi Manfei,
a well-known dancer.

379
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,520
Born with talent
and influenced by her foster mother,

380
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,200
Shi Anna became the first Asian dancer

381
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,440
who played Odette in the Paris Opera.

382
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,560
The same year,

383
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,440
she was injured by accident
during a rehearsal

384
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,160
for the closing show in the Paris Opera.

385
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,320
Since then, the No.1 white swan in Asia

386
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,280
has never appeared on stage.

387
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,720
Has she received the flower?

388
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,400
Why hasn't she added me on WeChat?

389
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:55,920
She did!

390
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,440
Hi.

391
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,680
I'm Elaine, the creator of "Memento".

392
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,880
Thank you for taking it home.

393
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,080
Why do you like it at first sight?

394
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,280
You said

395
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,880
you felt a little sadness on "Memento".

396
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,960
It's a rocking horse

397
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,840
with a pair of wings.

398
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,960
It can't fly away

399
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
although it wants to.

400
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,160
What it can do is to stay in situ.

401
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,960
"Memento"

402
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,600
is just like my kid.

403
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,920
A kid

404
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,600
who came to me with blessings.

405
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,480
Because of this kid,

406
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,200
I got much happiness

407
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,720
and much love.

408
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,760
I also have to endure such pain.

409
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,440
Whenever I feed sad,

410
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,800
I'll look into the distance

411
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,480
and imagine he's gone to a better place.

412
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,920
Only when I give him freedom

413
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,280
can he really be free.

414
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,520
Give him freedom?

415
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,040
You're right.

416
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,400
Next time,

417
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,120
I'll give him bigger wings.

418
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,240
Thank you.

419
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,840
I really hope I can have a chance to see you.

420
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Pitifully, I failed to meet you
at the gate of the church.

421
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,320
Do you live around there?

422
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,640
I'm here on a business trip.

423
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,240
I'm leaving in a few days.

424
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,760
Maybe we can't talk at ease

425
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,240
like this after we meet each other.

426
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,040
Maybe someday

427
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,360
we'll run into each other
in the street of Budapest.

428
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,560
Then it'll be a big surprise.

429
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,800
Why is it you again?

430
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,080
What do you want to tell me this time?

431
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,160
Did I do anything wrong again?

432
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,600
Don't misunderstand.

433
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,920
I'm here for Anna.

434
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,560
At first, it's Jiaxin.

435
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,560
And now, it's Anna.

436
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,400
Why do both of them

437
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,440
have something to do with you?

438
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,320
Why do you always keep an eye on me?

439
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,840
What's wrong?

440
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,960
You even can't recognize Anna's wallet?

441
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
How did you get it?

442
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
I picked it up
after two thieves threw it away.

443
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,680
Now, can you tell me
Anna's contact information?

444
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,720
Hello?

445
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,240
Good evening, Ms. Shi.

446
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,400
A gentleman picked up your wallet.

447
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,720
He wanted to return it to you personally.

448
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,400
He's waiting downstairs in the restaurant.

449
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,000
He said he won't leave until you show up.

450
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,480
In the restaurant?

451
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,400
Okay.

452
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,920
I will be there right away.

453
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:17,920
Thank you.
