=You Are My Destiny=

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,940
(Episode 32)

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,800
So you're Dylan?

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,440
Yes.

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,520
And it was you who found my wallet?

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,720
Yes.

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm surprised that you still remember

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,840
our first meet at Ms. Wang's house.

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,640
And I never thought

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,560
you'd find my wallet

34
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,440
and so that we'd meet again.

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,600
Was it Xiyi who told you my room number?

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,360
Yes.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,120
Thank you.

38
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,000
What I need most now

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,560
is the feeling of finding something back.

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,080
I thought that

41
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,400
everything around me has gone.

42
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,560
Sometimes, what you've lost

43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,400
will find its way back to you

44
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
and protect you in a silent way.

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,760
Is that true?

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm afraid I'm not that lucky.

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,000
Once, I finally got something back

48
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,560
but then

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,600
I lost it again.

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,240
Trust me.

51
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,160
Your bad luck is coming to an end.

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,520
You're so different as I thought.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,080
Ah?

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,840
I used to think of you

55
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,840
as an art dealer

56
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,320
who is a cynic and indifferent person.

57
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,280
Getting to know you,

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,840
I find that

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,360
you're actually compassionate.

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,080
Besides,

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,200
I get the feeling that we're so familiar.

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
You're also different than I thought.

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,200
I thought you'd give up on yourself

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,320
due to your encounter in childhood.

65
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm impressed that
you drew strength from adversity

66
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,160
and even became
the best ballet dancer in Asia.

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,300
That's really impressive.

68
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,560
You even know that.

69
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
No wonder you're a successful broker.

70
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
You got a professional sensitivity.

71
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,680
Anyway,

72
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,520
thank you.

73
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,760
There is a precious photo in my wallet.

74
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,840
It's a lovely photo.

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,800
I also have a younger sister.

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
I was a lovely kid.

77
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,400
But I don't want to recall my past.

78
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,560
If you really don't want to,

79
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
why would you put that photo

80
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,920
inside your wallet?

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
That photo

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,960
is to remind me

83
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,160
of my miserable childhood,

84
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,200
being abandoned by my own family

85
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,080
and crowded out by the adoptive family.

86
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,480
Are you sure you were
abandoned by your own family?

87
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,520
If not so,

88
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,080
why have they never tried to find me

89
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,240
all these years?

90
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,320
When I was kicked out by my foster mother,

91
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,800
when I took on several part-time jobs

92
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,440
in order to survive,

93
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,720
when I was bullied,

94
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,320
and when I was in desperate need of my family,

95
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,440
where were they?

96
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
I hate them.

97
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
The irony of all these

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,840
is that such hatred

99
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,680
has turned me into a lonely white swan.

100
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,880
Let's stop talking about these sad memories.

101
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
It's weird.

102
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,200
I never told so much about me to a stranger.

103
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,400
Hope you don't mind.

104
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,480
It's okay.

105
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,400
Maybe we can catch up later.

106
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,400
I should get going.

107
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,120
Qing,

108
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,880
it turns out you have
so many misunderstandings about us.

109
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,400
Hello, Tom.

110
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,800
Hello, Elaine.

111
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,800
Check this out.

112
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,400
The owner of that fruit stand is really nice.

113
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,560
Three, two, one.

114
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,400
See? I wasn't making it up.

115
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,360
The fruit today is really sweet.

116
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,400
Did you find the book?

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,680
Yes, I did.

118
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,160
I'm enjoying sunshine in the afternoon.

119
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,120
That's a lie.

120
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm driven crazy by a bunch of emails.

121
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,480
I got sore eyes.

122
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,680
It might sound out of the blue,

123
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,520
but I'd like to ask you a question.

124
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
What is it?

125
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,720
Have you ever thought of having another baby

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,240
to make up for your regret?

127
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,520
Ximi is Ximi.

128
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,240
He is special to me.

129
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,840
It's impossible for me to make up for regret

130
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,840
by giving birth to another child.

131
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,760
I see.

132
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,800
Would you do me a favor?

133
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,080
Help me pick up
something at a craft store.

134
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,160
I got it.

135
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,400
How am I going to give it to you?

136
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,000
Actually, it's a gift for you.

137
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,440
Just open it.

138
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,440
Do you like it?

139
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,880
Thanks.

140
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,600
It's very thoughtful of you.

141
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,480
If your "Memento"

142
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,640
has left you along with your regret,

143
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,120
I hope this little rocking horse
can make you happy

144
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,240
and accompany you to every part of the world,

145
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,800
turning your experience

146
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,080
into a source of inspiration.

147
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,000
Master,

148
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,320
the workshop has been cleaned up

149
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
and the inventory check has been done.

150
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,720
I've chosen several locations
for our workshop in Shanghai

151
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,320
and have sent you the addresses.

152
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,880
You can check it out when you're free.

153
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,840
Also,

154
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
there is a special exhibition
later this year.

155
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,520
You're not gonna miss it.

156
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,760
The soap holder.

157
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,480
The soap holder.

158
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,640
Oh, well,

159
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
what about the design of the soap holder?

160
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,560
Oh,

161
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
the details of the design drawing

162
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,160
are under discussion
in the company of Xiazhilu.

163
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,960
I've contacted the OEM

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
of Cheng Jie Group.

165
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,640
It can be put into massive production
when all is ready.

166
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,120
Ask her

167
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,800
about their relationship.

168
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,360
She didn't mention it at all.

169
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,080
Give them a rest.

170
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
If we keep pushing them,

171
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,560
everything is gonna be out of control.

172
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,600
Alright, alright.

173
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,160
Jiaxin,

174
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,920
what's your plan

175
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,760
before the special exhibition?

176
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,520
When will you return to Shanghai?

177
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
I'm not returning to Shanghai.

178
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,080
I want to

179
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
travel around the world.

180
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Thanks for your encouragement.

181
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,600
I made an important decision.

182
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,400
You're welcome.

183
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,960
Tell me about your decision.

184
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,800
You said that

185
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,960
this little rocking horse

186
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,120
is to make me happy

187
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,440
and accompany me to every part of the world

188
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,560
and then

189
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
turn my experience
into a source of inspiration,

190
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,280
right?

191
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,200
Yes.

192
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,680
So, you've figured it out?

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,480
Yes,

194
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,920
I've decided to travel around the world.

195
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,880
I'll be leaving in a month.

196
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,240
You'd be happy for me, right?

197
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Actually, I got this idea three years ago.

198
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,760
Back then, I was lack of courage and confidence.

199
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,520
After three years of self-improvement,

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
and with your encouragement,

201
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
I've decided to embark on this journey.

202
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,000
Thank you,

203
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,200
Mr. W.

204
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,280
That's not what I mean.

205
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,640
What am I gonna tell you?

206
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,280
Are you in the middle of something right now?

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,280
I'll leave you to get on.

208
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,480
No, no, no.

209
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,160
I'm not busy now.

210
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,840
I just think

211
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,360
you need a detailed plan

212
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,280
for travelling around the world.

213
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
You don't have to rush it.

214
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,560
Besides,

215
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,000
some countries are too dangerous

216
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,640
for a single girl to visit.

217
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,680
You used to say

218
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,040
that I sucked the fun

219
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,440
out of all the wonderful moments

220
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,720
in my life

221
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,520
by making too many plans.

222
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,600
This time,

223
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,200
I'm heading for somewhere

224
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,200
without a plan.

225
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,800
Chen Jiaxin,

226
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,880
I'm talking exactly about you.

227
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,320
Calm down.

228
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,000
Calm down, calm down.

229
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
How about taking Shanghai as your first stop?

230
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,760
I don't think so.

231
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,320
I know Shanghai too well.

232
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,320
It will make it
less of a departure of a journey.

233
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,680
Shanghai

234
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,560
should be the last stop.

235
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,240
Food delivery.

236
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,800
I've got to go.

237
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,680
Talk to you later.

238
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,320
Bye-bye.

239
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,960
Wang Xiyi,

240
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,880
are you stupid or something?

241
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,440
You want her back.

242
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
But what you're doing is pushing her away.

243
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,720
Come on.

244
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,160
I have to find an opportunity

245
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,400
to lure her back to Shanghai.

246
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,800
Hello?

247
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,520
What are the terms
of Chen Jiaxin's best friend

248
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,640
for your wedding?

249
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,320
Why do you ask for this suddenly?

250
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Come me, just name it.

251
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,040
A house of 100 square meters
in the central area.

252
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,600
A diamond ring of no less than one carat.

253
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,160
Honeymoon in Europe.
Wedding banquet on the Bund.

254
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,560
It's all on me.

255
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,560
Are you serious?

256
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,280
What's going on here?

257
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,760
I asked for a raise,

258
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,760
but you wouldn't approve.

259
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,920
Why are you being so generous now?

260
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,600
Do you want to get married or not?

261
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,760
Go and buy a ring now

262
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
and propose to her immediately.

263
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,440
Get it done by tonight.

264
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
If you fail,

265
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,520
you'll be fired.

266
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,280
Make it clear?

267
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,440
Wow,

268
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,040
it's a diamond larger than one carat,

269
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,440
which is of collection value.

270
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,520
It's nice of you

271
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,960
to buy this for me.

272
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,520
We'll be house hunting this weekend.

273
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,280
You can choose any restaurant
on the Bund you want

274
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,560
and spend our honeymoon
in whichever country you like.

275
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,680
In a word,

276
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,200
spend it however you want.

277
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,000
It's so generous.

278
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,480
Am I in a dream?

279
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,080
It's okay even if it's a dream.

280
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,400
Wait a minute.

281
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,680
Tell me the truth.

282
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,200
Did you win the lottery
of one hundred million yuan?

283
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,880
Don't worry about the money.

284
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,720
I earn it properly.

285
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,440
You know,

286
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,080
working with Mr. Yi

287
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,480
brings me benefits.

288
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,240
What do you say?

289
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,240
Are you going to marry me this time?

290
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,840
This is a one-time offer,

291
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,760
and the clock's ticking.

292
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,880
I'm not saying that I wouldn't marry you.

293
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,280
Why so rush?

294
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,200
Okay.

295
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,400
If you're going to marry me,

296
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,240
I have a small request to make of you.

297
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,280
I just knew it.

298
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,160
Bring it on.

299
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,880
Well, it's not a big deal.

300
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,880
Here is the thing.

301
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,240
According to Mr. Yi,

302
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
as the title sponsor

303
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,680
of our wedding,

304
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,000
he gets to designate
the maid of honor of our wedding,

305
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,920
which has to be Chen Jiaxin.

306
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,120
What?

307
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,160
Am I someone who would betray
my friend for money?

308
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,560
I marry for love.

309
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,800
How could I
betray my friend for this?

310
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,440
I just knew it.

311
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,640
I just knew you'd say that.

312
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,080
Mr. Yi also said,

313
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,280
if my proposal is turned down,

314
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,600
I'd be fired.

315
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,640
Since I'm not going to work tomorrow,

316
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,280
I might as well return all these things.

317
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,360
Return them all.

318
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,440
Now that Jiaxin and Dylan
haven't got any progress,

319
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,720
and there is affection between Jiaxin and Xiyi,

320
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,440
perhaps it's time to give her a little push.

321
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,840
If I tell her about it,

322
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,640
she'd complain

323
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,600
but still come to my wedding.

324
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,000
I admire you

325
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,000
and respect your decision.

326
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,840
I admire you for standing firm

327
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,400
against the lure of money.

328
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,360
Well,

329
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,280
let's hope

330
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,760
Mr. Yi would be generous
about the severance pay

331
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,560
for the sake of our brotherhood.

332
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,280
Anson, my darling,

333
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,680
will you

334
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,480
marry me?

335
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,880
Ah?

336
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,480
Hello?

337
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,040
Hello, babe.

338
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,280
Although you're so bad

339
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,880
to left me worrying about you,

340
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,960
as an incredible friend of yours,

341
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
I want you to be the first to know.

342
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,440
To know what?

343
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,160
Listen,

344
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm

345
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
getting married!

346
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,640
I thought

347
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,720
you said Anson doesn't love you enough

348
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,800
to give you a grand wedding.

349
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,560
Well,

350
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,600
now that he has the money,

351
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,040
I don't feel like refusing him.

352
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,400
Did he borrow money

353
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,760
in order to marry you?

354
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,320
Nope.

355
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,280
He

356
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,480
got a sponsor.

357
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,200
I have your generous, rich ex-husband

358
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
to thank for it.

359
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,000
Let's get to the point.

360
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,600
Are you not coming to my wedding

361
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,600
because of his sponsorship?

362
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,960
You promised to be

363
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,240
my maid of honor.

364
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,720
Don't you ditch me.

365
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,000
You're such a snob, Liu Siqi.

366
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,200
As a sophisticated lawyer,

367
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,720
you're too smart to neglect the fact

368
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,920
that the wedding is sponsored by Wang Xiyi.

369
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,760
You're sure that I'll return
to Shanghai for your wedding.

370
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,560
Last time, you asked me to talk you
out of getting married.

371
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,920
Now, let me give a good reason.

372
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,760
He is marrying you with an agenda.

373
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
I know, I know.

374
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,720
I know Wang Xiyi's purpose.

375
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,280
That's why I'm being honest with you,

376
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,760
right?

377
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,800
Besides,

378
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,560
it doesn't matter at all.

379
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,920
He can't do anything to you,

380
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,880
right?

381
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,840
Jiaxin,

382
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,800
please do me this favor.

383
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,200
As long as you make it here,

384
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,440
I can have my dream wedding.

385
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,880
Don't you care about

386
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,480
my lifetime happiness?

387
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,840
It's inhumane of you to do this.

388
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,040
Well,

389
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,920
it's like you're the most
humane person in the world

390
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,920
who disappears

391
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,880
for three whole years.

392
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,800
So, Jiaxin,

393
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,960
Jiaxin,

394
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,200
please come to my wedding.

395
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,240
For the sake of the grand
wedding on the Bund,

396
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,680
the house in the central area,

397
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,640
and the one-carat diamond ring,

398
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,960
please do me this favor.

399
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,000
It would be my biggest regret

400
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,560
if I don't have you at my wedding.

401
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,480
And Anson and I
are not gonna be happily married.

402
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,680
Come on,

403
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,160
I'm not buying it.

404
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,560
I'm being blamed for
your betrayal of our friendship.

405
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,480
I can't believe it.

406
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,880
Fine.

407
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,080
send me the date and address.

408
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,440
Jiaxin,

409
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,960
you're the best.

410
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,200
Hey,

411
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,040
is it okay for you to come back
to Shanghai earlier?

412
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,640
It would be nice if you accompanied me

413
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,000
to pick the wedding dress and site.

414
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,320
I miss you so much.

415
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,520
I miss you, too.

416
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,520
Love you.

417
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,640
Farewell,

418
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,600
Budapest.

419
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,320
I'm back,

420
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,520
Shanghai.

421
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:46,960
Mom,

422
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,480
grandma and Mr. Zhongshan
are visiting their old friend.

423
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,840
There are only two of us.

424
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,360
Why did you buy so many things?

425
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,040
You don't know anything about it?

426
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,760
We found Jiaxin.

427
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,920
She was in Hungary.

428
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,120
I mean... isn't it the fate?

429
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
She has been found?

430
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,560
Yes.

431
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,640
Who did it?

432
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,920
Your brother, of course.

433
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,800
No matter where she is,

434
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,760
he can always find her.

435
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,680
He is so awesome.

436
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,040
I spent three years in Huaniao Island,

437
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,320
wondering and asking about

438
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,680
Jiaxin's whereabouts.

439
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
However,

440
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,240
it was my brother

441
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
who found her in Hungary.

442
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,800
As fate would have it,

443
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,480
they're a match made in heaven.

444
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,520
I'm gonna cook a delicious meal tonight

445
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,480
in case Jiaxin came back with your brother,

446
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,040
which would be great.

447
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,320
That's right.

448
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,280
Speak of the devil.

449
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,720
You're back.

450
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:38,960
Why?

451
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,240
Why are you here all alone?

452
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,840
Yeah.

453
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,480
Where is Jiaxin?

454
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,560
Didn't she come back with you?

455
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,680
Jiaxin is back to Huaniao Island.

456
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,400
In the past three years,

457
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,680
I've been expecting

458
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,240
to meet Jiaxin again.

459
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,920
However,

460
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,480
I don't see it happening.

461
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,320
Alright, don't stand here.
Let's get back in the house.

462
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,080
Let me help you.

463
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,840
It's okay.

464
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,600
Do you feel tired?

465
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,560

Hello, there.

508
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,680
Would you care to check out our new products?

509
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,520
It's really great.

510
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,560
Have a look. It's half off.

511
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,200

526
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,920
Jiaxin?

527

Skinny monkey?

528
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
You become so pretty

529
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,880
that I can hardly recognize you.

530
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,560
Long time no see.

531
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,720
Where have you been?

532
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:48,880
Hey,

533
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,120
where did you get these potted plants?

534
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,600

the park and library on the island

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,040
have been purchased by Mr.Yi

539
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,000
and Cheng Jie Group.

540
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,880
Hey,

541
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,280
look at this.

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,360
Yes,

545
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,200
they've been generous.

546
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,960
They boosted the development of the island,

547
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,840
by starting tourism,

548
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,760
upgrading medical equipment

549
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,440
and building a library.

550
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,320
Hey, jIaxin.

551
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,760
Let me show you a nice place.

552
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,080
Come on.

553
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,160
This way.

554
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,260
(Ximi's Home)

555
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,480
It's down there.

556
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:19,880
Look.

557
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,600
How beautiful it is.

558
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,920
At the ribbon-cutting ceremony,

559
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,880
Mr. Yi said

560
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,920
he wants to build a sunny place

561
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
for kids to have fun.

562
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,600
He said that kids have

563
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,240
the purest

564
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,400
and the most beautiful

565
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,000
smile.

566
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,680
I think

567
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,880
he is right.

568
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,720
No matter how hard life is,

569
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,240
one feels much better

570
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,240
by looking at these kids.

571
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,120
Also,

572
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,040
Cheng Jie Group has funded

573
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Ximi Hope Primary School,

574
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,560
in an effort to enable

575
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,200
every child on the island

576
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,600
to receive education.

577
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,080
Sure.

578
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,320
Mr. Yi spent a lot of money

579
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,920
on this grand dream.

580
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,680
We call him the awesome guy,

581
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,800
in honor of the contributions

582
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,440
he made to Huaniao Island.

583
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,440
Let's play the game
of eagle catching chicken.

584
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:37,840
Okay.

585
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,880
Jiaxin?

586
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,600
Mom?

587
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,280
Mom.

588
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,360
I can hardly recognize you.

589
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,600
Mom.

590
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,400
I told you to wait at the wharf.

591
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,360
Mom,

592
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,240
it's okay.

593
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,680
I know the place well.

594
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,320
I'm just walking around.

595
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,880
Uncle, auntie,

596
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,280
you're here.

597
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,640
These neighbors insist on seeing you

598
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,840
when I told them I'm meeting you here.

599
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,160
Jiaxin,

600
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,520
I haven't seen you for ages.

601
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,120
You've changed a lot.

602
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,800
It's a change of luck.

603
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,080
A change of luck.

604
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,760
What are you talking about?

605
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,920
It sounds like Jiaxin

606
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,520
was having bad luck in the past.

607
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,000
I envy you

608
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,960
for having Mr. Yi as your son-in-law.

609
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,440
Son-in-law?

610
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,760
I told you hundreds of times

611
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,760
that he has had nothing to do with Jiaxin.

612
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,200
Let's go.

613
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,160
Let's go.

614
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,560
I haven't been here for a long time.

615
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,200
Don't take the neighbors' words personally.

616
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,920
Not at all.

617
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,800
The island

618
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,040
has changed a lot.

619
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,400
Luckily, our house has always been the same.

620
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,480
Of course, this place is not gonna change.

621
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,880
No matter how much money Wang Xiyi has spent,

622
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,240
it's not gonna work for me.

623
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,320
Unlike those people on the island,

624
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,760
my personality does not sway with the wind.

625
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,840
Actually,

626
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,600
something has changed.

627
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,000
Back then,

628
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,080
your father and I saved
every penny to buy this house,

629
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,520
in the hope of providing you

630
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,240
a safe haven.

631
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,520
When you grew up,

632
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,520
you decided to study and work in Shanghai.

633
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,480
I thought it would be nice for you

634
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,120
to see the world

635
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,120
and that you'd come back home one day.

636
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
However,

637
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,040
you married into
a Shanghai family out of the blue.

638
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,000
And the next thing I knew

639
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,160
is that you went abroad.

640
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,920
I thought you'd come back here
sooner or later

641
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,840
as long as I live in this house.

642
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,640
However, even I have left the house.

643
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,880
I had to tell my clients

644
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,960
before my visiting the hometown
on public holidays.

645
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,320
Isn't that ridiculous?

646
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,680
The house

647
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,200
has become empty.

648
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,520
Mom.

649
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,320
Hey, don't cry.

650
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,400
Don't cry.

651
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,880
Come on, it's okay.

652
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,400
It's okay.

653
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,360
You're doing well in a foreign country.

654
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,520
I'm so proud of you.

655
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,320
If you stay on the island,

656
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,520
you're never gonna make such achievements.

657
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,440
It's a right decision.

658
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,120
It's selfish for parents
to keep their children around

659
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,240
just because they can't live without them.

660
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:30,760
I mean it.

661
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,320
Mom,

662
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,000
I always come first for you,

663
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,720
but sometimes I forget to take care of you.

664
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,680
It's only natural

665
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
that you're my priority.

666
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,320
How about we invite Zishan

667
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,560
to hotpot at our house?

668
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,040
Help me clean the house.

669
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,520
I'll prepare the meal.

670
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,720
Enjoy it.

671
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,760
Enjoy it.

672
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,040
Sweetie.

673
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,320
It's dinner time. Did you wash your hands?

674
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,120
Yes, I did.

675
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,840
You did?

676
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,600
You've changed a lot since you went abroad.

677
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,360
You're so pretty

678
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
that I can hardly recognize you.

679
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,880
Ah,

680
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,400
you look prettier, too.

681
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,400
Now you have fair skin and look graceful.

682
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,080
Her beauty is made of money.

683
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
Thanks to Mr. Yi,

684
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,400
we're...

685
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,360
Don't wear your suit when having hotpot.

686
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,920
Take it off. Help me, hurry up.

687
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,880
This is all Wang Xiyi's fault,

688
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,880
otherwise life will be much easier for us.

689
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,440
Tiancai,

690
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,960
help me with it.

691
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,680
Does it taste bitter?

692
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,120
Yes, it does.

693
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,760
I feel bitter in my heart.

694
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,640
It's been three years since you left.

695
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,080
You can't image our life

696
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,480
on the island.

697
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,480
My house

698
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,240
has been fully booked.

699
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,200
I don't even get the time to take a rest.

700
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,640
What's more,

701
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,800
as the island

702
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,000
is getting rich,

703
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,760
people are not as simple as they used to be.

704
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,200
Now, everything is about business.

705
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,840
And Jia Fang,

706
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,040
a member of Party A of the Heritage,

707
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,360
has become

708
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
the pitchman of baby products
of Cheng Jie Group.

709
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,640
With his endorsement fee,
we don't even have to work.

710
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,000
There are piles of products
all over the house.

711
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,760
The last thing we need to buy is diaper.

712
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,480
That sounds a good thing

713
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,280
to me.

714
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,480
That's exactly what they're trying to do.

715
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,960
They're afraid to speak well
of Wang Xiyi in front of you.

716
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,800
So,

717
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,240
they keep creating new ways
to say good things about him.

718
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,240
Am I someone
who'd betray my cousin for money?

719
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:52,920
Really?

720
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,000
If you really have a spine,

721
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,400
how about you donate
Jia Fang's endorsement fee every year?

722
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,960
Alright, alright.

723
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,960
It's been long
since I had hotpot made by Xishi.

724
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,160
I can't wait to eat.

725
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,320
Jia Tiancai,

726
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,200
hurry up.

727
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,360
Call me brother-in-law.

728
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,840
Add some water.

729
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,640
Add some water.

730
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,440
Hello,

731
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,080
Miss Shi.

732
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,560
It's the owner of the shop on Huaihai Road.

733
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,640
Oh,

734
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,320
hello.

735
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,360
Is there anything wrong?

736
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,560
I'm calling to inform you

737
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,560
that I decided to increase the rent

738
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,040
of the dance studio by two thousand yuan

739
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
from next month.

740
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,480
Uncle,

741
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,800
we have a three-year contract.

742
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,960
How can you

743
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,200
jack up the price all you want?

744
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,520
Then tell me,

745
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,160
why would I agree on the original price?

746
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,520
That's because I thought

747
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,960
it was not easy for a girl
to start a business.

748
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,120
However, at the opening,

749
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,960
I saw the congratulation flowers
from Cheng Jie Group.

750
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,800
Are you making a fool of me?

751
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,960
I feel like a fool every time I think of it.

752
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,680
Uncle,

753
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,320
I'm the one who starts the business.

754
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,640
It has nothing to do

755
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,280
with my boyfriend.

756
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,280
Listen,

757
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,680
I don't care about your relationship
with your boyfriend.

758
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
You're gonna pay me
the rent of the amount I told you.

759
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,600
I spent most of my savings

760
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,920
on the renovation and decoration.

761
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,520
I just opened it.

762
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm losing money at the beginning.

763
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,600
You see,

764
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,840
my money can only sustain me for two months.

765
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,240
You can move

766
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,320
all you want.

767
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,040
Did you get back home?

768
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,240
Yes.

769
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,920
I thought you're traveling around the world.

770
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,280
My friend is going to get married.

771
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,080
I'm back to be her maid of honor.

772
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,840
In fact, hometown is the best place

773
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,840
to start a world tour.

774
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,720
You see,

775
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,600
one can always draw support from hometown.

776
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,400
I guess you're right.

777
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,920
My mom was thrilled to see me.

778
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,560
I feel much better as I see that

779
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,160
my hometown is getting better.

780
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,000
What about you?

781
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,640
Is everything alright?

782
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,440
