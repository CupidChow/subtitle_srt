25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,880
(Episode 22)

26
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,340
Having fish soup to drink is fine already.

27
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,900
And he wants it to be warm.

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,500
So demanding.

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,620
You can have this cup of coffee.

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,260
Ah?

31
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,900
The doctor said I needed

32
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,300
to avoid excitant foods and drinks

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,140
but I really wanted some coffee.

34
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,740
So I bought it secretly

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,180
and smelled it.

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,500
You're so sleepy.

37
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,300
You can drink it.

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:22,900
Oh,

39
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,780
thanks, then.

40
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,420
Night owls like me

41
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,620
just can't start a day without coffee.

42
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,420
Dazhu,

43
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,940
I'm not seriously injured.

44
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,260
Why do you insist I stay in hospital?

45
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,420
It'll cost so much money.

46
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,580
Dad,

47
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,500
let's not worry about the money, okay?

48
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,100
This hospital has the best orthopaedics

49
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,060
and rehabilitation center in Shanghai.

50
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,540
If you don't have a thorough check-up here,

51
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,500
how can I rest easy?

52
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,300
Besides,

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,180
what if you're not completely cured?

54
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,020
Don't you know old people

55
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,940
can't afford to fall over now?

56
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,580
Who's old?

57
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,420
I... I'm still young.

58
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,940
Yes, yes, you're young.

59
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,380
But Dazhu took you all this way

60
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,980
from Anhui to Shanghai.

61
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,780
He just wants to be a dutiful son.

62
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,700
Do you want him to stay silent after he knows

63
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,820
you were in a car accident?

64
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,980
Fine, fine, fine.

65
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,260
Here comes the fish soup.

66
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,220
Did you heat it up?

67
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,860
Here you go, Dad.

68
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,220
Taste it.

69
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,860
Goodness,

70
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,900
why is it so fishy?

71
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,220
Well,

72
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,540
lady,

73
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,180
you seldom do housework, don't you?

74
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,260
You often order takeaways, right?

75
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,900
Let me tell you. When you stew fish,

76
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,300
you must put in ginger
to remove the fishy taste.

77
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,580
Look at the soup.

78
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,900
There are no pieces of ginger.

79
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,820
It's... it's...

80
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,420
Mr. An, I've looked it up.

81
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,940
Ginger will accelerate blood circulation

82
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,540
and cause your wound to heal slowly.

83
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,180
So I didn't put it in.

84
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,340
I was looking out for you.

85
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:57,980
Right.

86
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:58,860
Goodness,

87
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,500
I said one word and she said so many.

88
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,020
This is...

89
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,860
Just shut up and drink your fish soup.

90
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,500
Qiqi was so considerate.

91
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,940
Even I didn't make fish soup for you.

92
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,140
Don't talk so much.

93
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,940
Mr. and Mrs. An,

94
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,820
I've only got half a day off

95
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,180
and I need to get back to work now.

96
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,580
I'll come and see you again.

97
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,260
I'm sorry, Qiqi.

98
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,820
Mr. An's bark is worse than his bite.

99
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,300
He criticized

100
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,100
but he knows you're a good person.

101
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,700
You young people

102
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,140
mustn't take it to heart.

103
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,580
Mm.

104
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,620
Dazhu, see her out.

105
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,340
Okay.

106
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,820
It's your fault.

107
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,260
Qiqi.

108
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,060
Drink your soup.

109
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,180
Siqi. Siqi!

110
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,980
Don't go, Siqi.

111
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,420
Don't go.

112
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,020
Don't get cross.

113
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,900
I've told you my dad is demanding.

114
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,900
No matter what he says,

115
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,460
just let it go in one ear and out the other

116
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,100
and that's all.

117
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,700
What did you get so angry for?

118
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,700
Your dad is not ordinarily demanding.

119
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,220
I asked for leave and looked at a recipe.

120
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,420
I stewed a fish so early in the morning.

121
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:01,900
Yes, yes, yes.

122
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,940
He didn't thank me

123
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,460
but find fault with it.

124
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,740
Even my parents haven't had fish soup I make.

125
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,500
-I just had a meeting.
-I missed you so much.

126
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,340
Just because...

127
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,940
What are you doing? There are people here!

128
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,660
I really didn't know

129
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,140
how I should cool you down

130
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,700
so I could only do this stupid thing.

131
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,380
Qiqi,

132
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,620
if you think it's not enough, I'll...

133
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,660
Do you think I'm a fool?

134
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,620
You should be thankful

135
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,820
that I didn't ask you to kneel on a keyboard.

136
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,060
And you want to kiss me?

137
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,140
How about this? Come.

138
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,500
Come, come, come.

139
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,260
How about this?

140
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,500
Tonight

141
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,900
after we knock off and arrive home,

142
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,500
close the door and punish me hard,

143
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:39,940
okay?

144
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,860
It's in broad daylight.

145
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,020
Don't talk nonsense.

146
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,100
You're not angry now, are you?

147
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,740
Yes. Why shouldn't I be angry?

148
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,820
But I won't be frustrated.

149
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,820
I don't believe I can't handle your dad.

150
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,740
Okay, okay.

151
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,620
Cool down. Cool down.

152
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,340
Let's go.

153
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,780
Let's go in, okay?

154
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,180
I brought you some clothes.

155
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,220
Though you'll leave hospital tomorrow,

156
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,500
you'll feel better after taking a shower.

157
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,460
And a phone.

158
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,260
Wow,

159
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,220
it's the latest one.

160
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,780
I like it. Thank you.

161
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,300
What's wrong?

162
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,020
Why do you keep looking at me?

163
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,060
I just haven't seen you

164
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,060
being so happy for a long time.

165
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,780
Alright, it's my fault.

166
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,660
I promise.

167
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,620
I won't leave you again.

168
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,620
Oh, by the way,

169
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,140
have lunch first.

170
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:40,860
Mm.

171
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,300
Ah,

172
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,540
rice porridge and greens.

173
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,060
This is lighter than dietetic meals

174
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,860
I had before a show.

175
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,180
Are you ill-treating a patient?

176
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,420
You're a patient.

177
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,340
These are what you should eat.

178
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,540
Okay.

179
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,620
It hurts so much.

180
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,740
Allow me.

181
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,420
Mm.

182
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,020
Which would you like to eat?

183
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:19,900
This.

184
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,940
Be careful. It's hot.

185
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,900
Don't you think it's a shame?

186
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,900
I didn't remember I danced Swan Lake

187
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,100
at the Paris Opera.

188
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,380
That was the biggest dream in my life.

189
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,180
I'll send you photos about it later.

190
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,580
Mm.

191
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,500
Mm.

192
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,740
How did I celebrate

193
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,100
your birthday with you this year?

194
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,860
You couldn't manage

195
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,380
to come back before my birthday this year.

196
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,100
Ah?

197
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,020
Okay.

198
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,260
I know you must have forgiven me

199
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,380
but I still need to tell you I'm sorry.

200
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,900
It's my bad.

201
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,380
I shouldn't have let you

202
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,540
be alone on your birthday.

203
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,300
You can punish me any way
you want when I get well.

204
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,460
It's okay. It wasn't a terrible birthday.

205
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,500
Someone was with me.

206
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,140
That's great.

207
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,300
After I leave hospital,

208
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,660
ask him to have a meal with us.

209
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,140
I've got to thank him.

210
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:36,900
Mm.

211
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,060
Here.

212
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,180
Oh, by the way,

213
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,780
let's meet Grandma next week.

214
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,900
I haven't gone to see her long, have I?

215
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,860
Anna.

216
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,300
Yes?

217
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,900
Actually...

218
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,340
Actually I have work to do in the company.

219
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,980
I'll go back there
and come to see you tonight.

220
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,580
Don't knock off too late.

221
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,460
I don't want to stay here alone.

222
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,660
Come back quickly.

223
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,620
Mm.

224
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,500
You finally came, Jiaxin.

225
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:30,900
Quickly.

226
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Be my counselor.

227
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,220
Oh dear, awesome.

228
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,620
Didn't see it before.

229
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,220
Dear, dear, you've got a knack for it.

230
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,900
Didn't expect it. Didn't expect it.

231
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,660
Wow,

232
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,780
fantastic. Mm.

233
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,060
What on earth do you want to say?

234
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,020
Nothing.

235
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,100
I'm just full of admiration for my boss

236
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,780
and I can't stop expressing it.

237
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,180
Goodness, I could never expect it.

238
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,500
I thought you'd choose one from two.

239
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,940
But in fact, you want both of them.

240
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,660
I've seen it in the hospital.

241
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,420
I'm impressed. I'm impressed, honestly.

242
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,380
You've seen it in the hospital.

243
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,900
That's because Anna is sick.

244
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,140
Who could have realized that,

245
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,540
given the way she ran towards you?

246
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,660
That's...

247
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,540
Chen Jiaxin, are you crazy?

248
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,620
You let Wang Xiyi look after his ex.

249
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,740
Do you know

250
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,780
what a divorce lawyer told me?

251
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,420
Many a divorce starts

252
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,660
with the rekindling of old love!

253
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,740
But Anna was hurt

254
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,140
because of me and Xiyi.

255
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,620
She has no relatives in Shanghai.

256
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,140
If Xiyi doesn't look after her,

257
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,500
who can do that?

258
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,060
Are you out of your mind?

259
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,420
Who will look after you?

260
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,900
You're pregnant.

261
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,340
Are you still thinking

262
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,660
about others at this point in time?

263
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,500
Can you not be so selfless?

264
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,060
Isn't it normal to keep the person

265
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,780
you like around you?

266
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,260
Isn't it in humans' nature?

267
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,740
I'd better request the chairwoman

268
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,540
to make decisions about these documents.

269
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,700
If you don't make yourself clear,

270
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,780
never come back after you leave here.

271
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,060
Fine.

272
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,860
Seriously,

273
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,540
did you forget you have been torn

274
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,460
between them over the past three months?

275
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,660
It was so hard for you to say it

276
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,900
and make up your mind.

277
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:30,980
Now what are you doing?

278
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,740
Do you want to experience it again?

279
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,700
To be irresolute would only spell disaster.

280
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Why am I irresolute?

281
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,340
Chen Jiaxin,

282
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,620
you need to think it over.

283
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,380
However solid your love is,

284
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,020
it can't stand being messed around with.

285
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,500
Anna was away before.

286
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,980
Wang Xiyi was with you and liked you.

287
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,620
Now she came back

288
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,100
and you let them be with each other.

289
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,220
You're not being considerate

290
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,580
but digging yourself into a hole.

291
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,180
Xiyi.

292
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,780
Xiyi.

293
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,980
I'm going home.

294
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,540
Anson will pick you up tomorrow.

295
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,740
It's weird.

296
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,780
No matter how busy Xiyi was before,

297
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,420
if I was sick,

298
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,100
he would spare all his time
to keep me company.

299
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,780
Why's Xiyi so different now?

300
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,580
What on earth happened?

301
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,060
Did I...

302
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,980
Did I forget something?

303
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,060
Take it easy, Shi Anna.

304
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,420
Take your time.

305
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,820
You can remember it.

306
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,740
Are you staying up late

307
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,180
to wait for me?

308
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,660
Anna will

309
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,660
leave hospital tomorrow.

310
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,300
Before she recovers,

311
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,180
I may need to spend some time with her.

312
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,740
If you're worried...

313
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,380
This isn't right.

314
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,460
I think you should be a little jumpy.

315
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,580
You can eat with me in the company every day

316
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,020
as well as

317
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,340
check what I'm up to.

318
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
Well then,

319
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,780
if you insist.

320
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,220
What would you like to eat?

321
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,420
Fried shrimp balls,

322
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,220
Sanhuang chicken,

323
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,740
red braised pork belly

324
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,700
and

325
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,780
wine preserved crabs.

326
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:33,900
Wine preserved crabs?

327
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,100
You don't know how to make it?

328
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,300
I know

329
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,780
but there's not enough time.

330
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,100
It takes six hours
to preserve the crabs alone

331
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,020
and there aren't any at home.

332
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,580
If you want to eat it at noon tomorrow,

333
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,660
I've got to start now.

334
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,580
It's okay if you don't make it.

335
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,500
After all,

336
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,540
my delight doesn't reside in the wine

337
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,700
or the crabs,

338
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,740
but you.

339
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,740
I beg you, my lady.

340
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,100
Keep smiling, okay?

341
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,580
It'll just be a week.

342
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,260
I'll do whatever you want afterwards.

343
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,580
I've got it,

344
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:41,980
man.

345
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,740
You've been saying it all morning.

346
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,700
You're talking my ears off.

347
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,180
I'm just afraid

348
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,380
you'll lose control of yourself.

349
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,620
That time I have exhibited

350
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,380
all my gentleness.

351
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,420
I just didn't kneel down.

352
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,340
Didn't you see it?

353
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,500
Look,

354
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,260
if you weren't having a meeting,

355
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,260
there's no way I would take food
to your dad alone.

356
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,580
Yes, yes, yes.

357
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,340
Don't make me do this again.

358
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,860
I'm hanging up.

359
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,460
My son's

360
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,300
bones were broken.

361
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,980
You said it was our fault.

362
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,820
Won't you have a guilty conscience?

363
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,140
Ma'am,

364
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,540
be reasonable, okay?

365
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,700
Your son went to the opposite lane

366
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,060
when turning around

367
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,740
and my husband

368
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,820
was hit by him.

369
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,260
It's not our fault

370
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,220
however you look at it.

371
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,620
It's not your fault?

372
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,380
It takes two to tango.

373
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,020
Two parties involved

374
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,180
in a car accident are both to blame.

375
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,620
Right.

376
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,220
Your bone was slightly fractured

377
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,940
and you'll be alright in a few days
having it in plaster.

378
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,100
My son is still in the ICU.

379
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,380
If it's not your fault, whose is it?

380
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,740
A loud voice doesn't mean you're right.

381
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,380
It's none of your business, Miss.

382
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,460
I'm Mr. An's attorney.

383
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,980
From now on,

384
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,660
talk with me if you need to.

385
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,980
Don't disturb my client.

386
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,140
Attorney.

387
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,460
You engaged an attorney. Big deal.

388
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,660
I've gone through lots of things.

389
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,740
Don't try to frighten me.

390
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,260
First,

391
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,860
I'm a lawyer.

392
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,580
I was being polite passing you my card

393
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,780
and I didn't want to frighten you.

394
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,220
Second,

395
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,660
please be clear about this.

396
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,780
The liability for a traffic accident

397
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,020
depends on the traffic law

398
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,660
but not how seriously you're hurt.

399
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,460
If you don't even know about this,

400
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,900
I'd advise you

401
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,700
to find a lawyer

402
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,980
to talk about the compensation with me.

403
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,700
Certainly,

404
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,860
what I mean is that

405
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,660
you

406
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,060
compensate my client.

407
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,060
Don't think you can get

408
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,380
a single penny from him.

409
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,460
Wonderful.

410
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,820
Of course.

411
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,660
Jiaxin was dancing with me.

412
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,900
Zhengren,

413
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,220
you didn't go to work today.

414
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,380
Is it okay to hold up things

415
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,140
in the factory?

416
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,060
I'm wondering, too.

417
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,380
There's so much work to do

418
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,780
but my cousin insisted
I dance with Jiaxin at home.

419
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,860
He said I'd be on leave

420
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,580
with good reasons.

421
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,180
Your cousin

422
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,100
is worried

423
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,820
his wife will be held by Dylan in his arms

424
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,340
when she practices dancing.

425
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,540
Auntie.

426
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:12,900
Mom,

427
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,460
that day

428
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,780
Xiyi saw Jiaxin dancing

429
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,780
with Dylan in my iPad.

430
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,700
His face changed immediately

431
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,860
and he was so unhappy.

432
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,580
So today

433
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,900
he specially told me

434
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,540
to film her and send videos to him.

435
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,060
He said he wanted to see

436
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,260
how Jiaxin was dancing

437
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
and if it was good.

438
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,780
In my opinion,

439
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,780
he just doesn't want

440
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,340
Jiaxin's dance partner

441
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,340
to be Dylan.

442
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,020
Great.

443
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,540
At the year-end party,

444
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,460
I'll let everyone see

445
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,980
how charming

446
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,580
my granddaughter-in-law is.

447
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,900
Even our Xiyi who's like an ice cube

448
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,820
has been melted.

449
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,100
Grandma,

450
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,460
what are you talking about?

451
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,940
It's about time.

452
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,180
I'll bring lunch to Xiyi.

453
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,460
Good.

454
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,100
Seeing him during breakfast
and dinner is not enough.

455
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,700
Meet him at noon

456
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,820
and watch him eating.

457
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,580
This is a good idea.

458
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,060
Zhengren.

459
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,460
Yes?

460
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,460
Drive

461
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,420
and take Jiaxin.

462
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,380
Okay.

463
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,580
Mom,

464
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,660
look.

465
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,500
What do you think of my filming?

466
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,780
Very good.

467
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,540
It's right to have a few classes.

468
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,300
Mm.

469
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,500
Why don't we

470
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,620
learn from a teacher, too?

471
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,580
I'm old.

472
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,620
How am I supposed to dance?

473
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,100
Qiqi,

474
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,220
is it okay to make an enemy

475
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,580
of those people?

476
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,140
It's okay, Mrs. An.

477
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,820
They were just...

478
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Bluffing.

479
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,940
Shut up your mouth.

480
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
If it hadn't been for Qiqi's

481
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,540
professional knowledge of the law,

482
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,540
I have no idea when they would go.

483
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,580
What do you know?

484
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,300
I mean that scoundrel

485
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,980
was just bluffing in the end.

486
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,140
He has been

487
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,380
frightened by Siqi.

488
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,100
I guess now

489
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,460
he has bought a ticket to go home.

490
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,260
Mr. and Mrs. An,

491
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,740
Anson needs to work.

492
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,940
I brought you breakfast.

493
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,300
Eat it while it's warm.

494
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,820
It's so nice.

495
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:08,980
An,

496
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,700
try it.

497
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,380
This is a steamed bun Siqi made.

498
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,820
It smells good and it's elastic.

499
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,540
It's nice. Nice.

500
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,940
Mrs. An,

501
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,500
they weren't

502
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,700
made by me.

503
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,940
I bought them downstairs.

504
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,500
Mr. An was right yesterday.

505
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,980
I indeed can't do housework

506
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,340
and I often order takeaways.

507
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,820
To my eye,

508
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,100
there are only 24 hours in a day

509
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,860
and compared with doing housework,

510
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,580
I'm better at dealing with cases.

511
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,700
So I'm willing to spend money I made

512
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,940
on hiring someone to do it for me.

513
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,940
I know you like girls who can cook

514
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,980
and I tried to make fish soup

515
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,860
for Anson's sake yesterday.

516
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,020
But obviously,

517
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,740
it wasn't even barely satisfactory.

518
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,340
That's alright. That's alright.

519
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,100
Okay, I'll go to work, then?

520
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,020
-Okay.
-Go, go.

521
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
Go.

522
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,420
Siqi,

523
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,580
well,

524
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,300
I've drunk the fish soup

525
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,100
you made yesterday.

526
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,340
After you knock off,

527
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,380
come back

528
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,820
with Dazhu.

529
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,660
Let's eat out together.

530
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,220
Mm.

531
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,700
Be careful.

532
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,980
Be careful.

533
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,740
It's you.

534
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,620
Are you leaving hospital?

535
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,860
Yes.

536
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,340
The doctor said I just needed to rest at home

537
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,700
and I could vacate a bed in the hospital.

538
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,940
It's great to leave early, too.

539
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,820
Home is more comfortable than hospital.

540
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,340
That's true.

541
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,540
Where are your family?

542
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,660
Are you leaving hospital alone?

543
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,700
My family are not in Shanghai

544
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,180
and my boyfriend is busy.

545
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
I don't want to bother him.

546
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,380
You're too good-tempered.

547
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,900
If my boyfriend doesn't pick me up

548
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,020
when I'm leaving hospital,

549
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,620
I'll go to his company directly

550
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,220
and see what's more important than me.

551
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,500
You're so funny.

552
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,980
Take care of yourself.

553
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,020
Get well soon.

554
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,820
Okay, okay.

555
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,780
I'm going.

556
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,900
The bed is too neat.

557
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,820
Didn't Xiyi come back to sleep yesterday?

558
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,180
I'm going home.

559
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,180
Anson will pick you up tomorrow.

560
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,180
It's okay.

561
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,420
It wasn't a terrible birthday.

562
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,420
Someone was with me.

563
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,700
You're too good-tempered.

564
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,260
If my boyfriend doesn't pick me up

565
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
when I'm leaving hospital,

566
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,020
I'll go to his company directly

567
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,420
and see what's more important than me.

568
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,600
(China's personal care products market size)

569
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,780
The silicone-free scalp care effect

570
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,740
of Seeyoung shampoos

571
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,420
has won the approval of younger consumers.

572
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,180
They stood out

573
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,820
in the market once they were launched.

574
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,540
(Seeyoung stands out in China's personal care
brands. It holds 31.5% share of the market.)

575
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:55,940
Among them,

576
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,740
as our major product,

577
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,060
the ginger root strength shampoo

578
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,420
has become

579
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,620
the best-seller of Cheng Jie Group,

580
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,380
which is very rare.

581
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,380
Besides,

582
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,700
Heritage

583
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,740
has successfully got in the European market.

584
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,700
But I want

585
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,580
more than that.

586
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,100
What we need to achieve is

587
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,820
a continuous

588
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,540
and steady

589
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,460
growth of sales.

590
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,860
I'm almost there.

591
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,860
Wait for me at the office. Good girl.

592
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,140
The Marketing Dept. has specially

593
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,620
set up an European business group

594
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,980
and we'll focus on

595
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,220
putting forward a marketing plan

596
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,500
for the European market

597
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,980
as quickly as possible.

598
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,500
Please have a look at it then, Mr. Yi.

599
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,780
What you need to do

600
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,020
isn't just asking me to read it.

601
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,860
Before you put forward a plan,

602
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,020
you need to discuss it
with the Business Dept.

603
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,140
because they are

604
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,220
the spearhead.

605
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
They know the market best.

606
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,860
The Business Dept. also needs

607
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,900
to communicate with the Marketing Dept.

608
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,660
If nothing else is the matter,

609
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,420
we'll break up the meeting here.

610
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,880
(Delta Health)

611
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,540
Hello.

612
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,020
Mr. Yi,

613
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,980
I need to tell you something,
but please don't get mad at me.

614
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,980
What is it?

615
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,340
Here is the thing.

616
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,140
I went to the hospital
right after the meeting

617
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,020
but they said

618
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,540
Anna had left.

619
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,420
Okay,

620
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,260
got it.

621
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,180
Surprise.

622
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,540
What are you doing here?

623
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,420
Hey,

624
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,300
why aren't you happy to see me?

625
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,580
Last night I woke up and you weren't there.

626
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,820
So I came to see how busy you are.

627
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,820
You left your girlfriend who's sick alone

628
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,900
so I could only come to see you.

629
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,180
Eat out with me, will you?

630
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,940
I really need your company now.

631
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,580
Chen...

632
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,700
Who's she?

633
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,100
Anna.

634
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:38,780
Yes?

635
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,060
She's actually my w...

636
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,100
I'm your dietitian.

637
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,380
You're Anna,

638
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,420
aren't you?

639
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,540
Mm.

640
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,140
I'm the dietitian

641
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,140
Mr. Yi hired for you.

642
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,820
I'll be responsible for your meals

643
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,740
when you're recovering.

644
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,340
Chen Jiaxin.

645
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,380
Mr. Yi,

646
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,780
haven't we agreed

647
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,260
that we'll look after Anna together?

648
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,860
Not bad.

649
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,300
You've become so sweet.

650
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,260
You must be hungry.

651
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:21,980
This

652
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,460
is today's lunch.

653
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,860
I will

654
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,380
talk about the other things with Anson.

655
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,180
Enjoy your meal.

656
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,140
Miss Shi.

657
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,740
Yes?

658
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,660
If you have any suggestions for the food,

659
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,740
just tell Mr. Yi.

660
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:46,700
Mm,

661
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,020
okay.

662
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,340
I'll see you around.

663
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,980
It smells so good.

664
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,020
The dietitian you hired is really good.

665
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,660
I haven't even had breakfast yet.

666
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,860
Do you want some, too?

667
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:08,860
Come.

668
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,740
You can't work without eating anything.

669
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,500
What?

670
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,460
You said you were a dietitian

671
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,100
and you'd prepare meals for her every day?

672
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,180
Chen Jiaxin,

673
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,900
I always say you're a stick-in-the-mud

674
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,860
and you never do crazy things.

675
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,700
But when you actually did one,

676
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,980
it's simply a disaster!

677
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,380
Can you lower your voice?

678
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,180
You're the woman in his marriage certificate

679
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,540
and the person who he married formally.

680
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,500
When you ran into his ex,

681
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,900
you should have told her you're his wife

682
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,220
and Wang Xiyi is yours.

683
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,300
You're really incurably silly.

684
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,860
I want to be as frank as you

685
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,020
but I'm not you.

686
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,500
When this happened to me,

687
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,820
I only wanted to think
of an excuse and escape.

688
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,740
How could I tell her

689
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,620
I'm Wang Xiyi's wife?

690
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,540
Besides,

691
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,220
Anna has just left hospital
and is recovering.

692
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,940
If I said so,

693
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,700
wouldn't she fall ill again?

694
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,100
You're really incurable.

695
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,460
Incurable.

696
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,220
Hey.

697
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,700
What's going on?

698
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:21,420
What happened?

699
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,180
Just now I went in the office

700
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,060
and saw Mr. Yi and Anna eating food you made.

701
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,860
I was like being struck by lightning.

702
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,740
Luckily Mr. Yi and I
can read one another's mind.

703
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
He said I got half a day off

704
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,060
and I could go on a date with my girlfriend.

705
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,980
I knew he wanted me to check on you.

706
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,540
What's going on?

707
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,460
She's incurable.

708
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:37,820
Ah?

709
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,260
Answer it.

710
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,260
Turn on the speaker.

711
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,220
Anna.

712
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,020
Hey, Anson.

713
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,460
I need you to tell

714
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,220
the dietitian Xiyi hired

715
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,700
to make pork rib and sweet corn soup tonight.

716
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,060
It's lighter.

717
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,300
The lunch

718
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,900
was too oily.

719
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,820
She...

720
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,780
she...

721
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,460
Okay.

722
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,980
I will talk

723
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,020
about it with her.

724
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,340
And also tell her

725
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,060
things she made were nice.

726
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,540
Xiyi and I are both satisfied.

727
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,300
Okay.

728
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,260
No problem.

729
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,620
This woman is really a tough nut.

730
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,660
She went to the company
right after she left hospital

731
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,500
and came between you
and Wang Xiyi with a concussion.

732
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,260
Who knows if she's pretending?

733
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,660
And you.

734
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,060
Are you really gonna make that soup for her?

735
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,140
You're damaging my prestige

736
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,740
by being a friend

737
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,380
who can only run and hide!

738
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,780
Don't talk like that.

739
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,980
Jiaxin is pregnant.

740
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,300
I'm looking out for her.

741
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
Calm yourself down.

742
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,660
There are many people in our company.

743
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,380
I believe

744
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,660
Jiaxin just didn't want to
make the situation worse.

745
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,100
If this is spread in the company,

746
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,780
how awful it'll be.

747
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,780
Don't forget

748
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,140
that we're holding a year-end party.

749
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:58,820
Yes, yes, yes.

750
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,380
That's what I was thinking.

751
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,540
People in our company

752
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,620
love gossiping about their boss.

753
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,780
I don't want to be their subject.

754
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,820
But

755
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,580
Snail,

756
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,180
I also want to tell you something.

757
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,220
Perhaps you think

758
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,740
if you don't expect anything in return,

759
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,740
one day people will see
what you've done for them.

760
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,260
But is it really like that?

761
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,140
Think about it. All along

762
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,540
you kept doing things for Xiyi.

763
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,500
Will it bring about a good result

764
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,900
or the more

765
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,100
you give in,

766
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,580
the more you'll feel wronged?

767
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,900
He's right.

768
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,260
That's true in the real world

769
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,180
and it's truer in a marriage.

770
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,140
You kept

771
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,500
giving in.

772
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,700
And actually

773
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,700
you're also giving up.

774
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,980
You're giving up Wang Xiyi

775
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,540
to his ex-girlfriend.

776
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,260
I know

777
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,700
what you're saying.

778
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,580
Actually,

779
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,100
I'm angry

780
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,300
and sad, too.

781
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,380
But...

782
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,540
but

783
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,980
I'm more afraid of losing Xiyi's heart.

784
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,020
At this critical juncture,

785
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,940
except wait for Anna

786
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,820
to recover with Xiyi,

787
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,700
I really don't know what else I can do.

788
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,900
If anything happens to Anna,

789
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,460
Xiyi and I will feel guilty

790
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,020
for the rest of our lives.

791
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,100
Now I just hope

792
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,260
Anna can regain her memory

793
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,180
and they can break up peacefully.

794
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:24,980
That's

795
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,580
the best result, isn't it?

796
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,180
Come on in.

797
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,340
Later

798
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
I'll give this card to you

799
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,180
and then

800
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,660
you can go in and leave here conveniently.

801
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:47,660
Here,

802
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,340
give it to me.

803
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,100
Thanks.

804
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,340
Actually

805
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,820
before Mr. Yi met you,

806
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,100
he was just like this house,

807
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,300
which is cold

808
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:09,980
and dull.

809
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,860
Anson.

810
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,500
Yes?

811
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,100
Come here.

812
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,220
What's up?

813
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,300
This...

814
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:25,900
this is

815
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,820
Anna?

816
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,420
Yes.

817
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,140
She's beautiful, isn't she?

818
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,700
A ballet dancer of genius.

819
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,300
Her arms and legs are so long

820
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,780
and she spins around with them.

821
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,020
Look at her hands.

822
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,020
You don't

823
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,220
need to wait here.

824
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,740
Go home.

825
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,940
I'll go when I finish making the soup.

826
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,500
We'll be off then,

827
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,460
Jiaxin.

828
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,100
Here's the card.

829
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,180
As the saying goes,

830
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,140
"Cross that bridge when you come to it."

831
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,780
I know

832
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,780
my sweetheart is

833
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,500
kind-hearted and worried about her friend.

834
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,500
But no matter how worried we are,

835
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
we can't do anything

836
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,700
about it, can we?

837
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,980
Just let nature take its course.

838
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,460
Look.

839
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,260
I bought this before.

840
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,020
It's the latest product of our company,

841
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,980
Seeyoung shampoo.

842
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,100
Now it has become

843
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,180
young people's new favorite

844
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,540
and many of them bought it again.

845
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,900
Hello,

846
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,820
would you like to try

847
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,900
Seeyoung shampoo which is super popular now?

848
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,260
It's silicone and sulfate-free,

849
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,500
mild and non-irritating.

850
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,220
Use it and your scalp won't be

851
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,100
burdened anymore.

852
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,220
Really?

853
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,020
Can it wash all my trouble way

854
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,580
and let me be free of burdens?

855
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,140
Excuse me.

856
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,460
What's the matter?

857
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,420
Your face is squeezing up.

858
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,860
It was so small already

859
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,140
and now it's like a bun.

860
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,820
You don't have to be troubled

861
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,660
so much about Snail, do you?

862
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,380
It seems I made a mistake.

863
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,580
What shall I do?

864
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,260
You mean that matter?

865
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,580
It's okay.

866
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,900
After my dad heard what you said,

867
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,980
he changed right away

868
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,900
and he said

869
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,020
girls must be talented

870
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:31,580
and competent.

871
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,140
Only then...

872
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,980
No.

873
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,060
Anna and your dad were in the same hospital

874
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,380
and we've met each other.

875
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,300
It's such a big hospital

876
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,500
and you didn't know each other.

877
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,660
But still you talked with her?

878
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,260
That's not all.

879
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,340
In the end,

880
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,180
I saw her being alone

881
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,820
and weak.

882
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,100
I said

883
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,260
if I was sick

884
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,460
and my boyfriend didn't pick me up,

885
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,220
I would go to his company directly

886
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,140
and see what was more important than me.

887
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,220
It's you...

888
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,060
Oh dear.

889
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,980
So after all we've talked about,

890
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,980
it's because of you that Jiaxin met

891
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,140
Anna at the office?

892
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,700
My goodness!

893
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,460
Don't say my goodness.

894
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,100
What shall I do?

895
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,580
I didn't know it was Anna.

896
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,740
I'm so stupid.

897
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,660
How could I drop the ball at this juncture?

898
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,340
What shall I do,

899
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,220
Anson?

900
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,340
It's okay.

901
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,660
Things have happened.

902
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,580
Let's go home first.

903
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,540
I sat at your office all afternoon

904
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,660
and it was so boring.

905
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,380
Finally you can go shopping with me now.

906
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,740
I found

907
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,940
that your aftershaves had been used up.

908
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,660
Shall I

909
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,540
buy you one?

910
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,100
Okay.

911
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,380
Our house is so clean.

912
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,980
When I was in Paris,

913
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,140
were you living with Grandma?

914
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:48,980
By the way,

915
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,300
let's watch a movie

916
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,100
in the living room tonight.

917
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,900
What are the recent movies?

918
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,220
Anna.

919
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,780
Yes?

920
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,300
I can't be with you tonight.

921
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,620
Why?

922
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,980
I have an appointment.

923
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,420
You can't even have dinner with me?

924
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,900
How about coming back after dinner?

925
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,660
Is it business?

926
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:08,940
Yes,

927
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,500
it's business.

928
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,020
I need to have a video conference

929
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,940
with those in Europe

930
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,700
and I'll take long.

931
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,780
But I wouldn't mind.

932
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,820
I don't want to disturb you

933
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,700
and I'm living at home now.

934
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,140
I haven't told Grandma you're back yet.

935
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,420
Okay then,

936
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,780
I'll let you go.

937
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,380
Because you forgave me

938
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,260
every time I stood you up before.

939
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,380
I'll forgive you this time.

940
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,860
When I get well,

941
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,180
we'll visit Grandma together.

942
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,020
At that time,

943
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,620
you must put in a word for me.

944
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,180
Mm.

945
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,300
I'll go and buy you an aftershave.

946
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,020
Are you okay?

947
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Yes, I'm okay.

948
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,660
Wow,

949
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,820
it smells so good.

950
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,220
The dietitian must be

951
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,860
preparing something nice for me.

952
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,500
Be careful.

953
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,260
What are you doing?

954
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,300
Don't you know pregnant people
can't climb so high?

955
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,820
You don't need to do these things.

956
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,940
If anything happens to you,

957
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,900
how shall I cope with it?

958
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,420
I'm okay.

959
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,340
You're pregnant?

960
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,020
You're pregnant and came to help me clean.

961
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,460
I'm really sorry.

962
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,540
Don't be.

963
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,740
It was no bother.

964
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,460
I didn't know you were pregnant.

965
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,860
Tell me about things

966
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,060
like this in advance.

967
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,300
I'll look for a cleaner.

968
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,940
You cook for me when you're pregnant.

969
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,380
I'm so sorry already.

970
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,380
If your baby is hurt,

971
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,020
I'll feel deeply guilty.

972
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,140
I...

973
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,340
I'll check on the soup.

974
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,820
Xiyi,

975
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,180
you reacted so quickly.

976
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,700
It was really dangerous.

977
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,900
She's so hard-working.

978
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,260
She works even though she's pregnant.

979
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,380
Anna,

980
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,140
tonight...

981
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,340
I know.

982
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,980
I know you can't eat with me.

983
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,100
Go to do your work, then.

984
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:30,860
Mm.

985
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:31,820
I...

986
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,500
It's okay.

987
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,660
I can be alone.

988
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,420
Besides,

989
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,260
when the dietitian finishes cooking dinner,

990
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,820
I'll ask her to stay and eat with me.

991
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,020
You eat with her?

992
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,020
Yes.

993
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,980
I can't let a pregnant lady
miss her meal, can I?

994
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:49,980
Alright, alright,

995
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,900
go to work. Go to work.

996
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,740
I can be alone.

997
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,300
