25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,940
(Episode 24)

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,280
You signed a divorce agreement, didn't you?

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,960
Even if she's pregnant with Ximi

28
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,400
and you've registered a marriage,

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,840
this agreement

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,560
will still make her feel uneasy.

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,720
She's also worried.

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,800
She's afraid you'll divorce her

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,600
once she gives birth to Ximi.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,120
I think you'd better deal with this matter

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,040
before the year-end party.

36
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,960
Sounds reasonable.

37
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:17,880
Hmm.

38
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,880
Give me a second.

39
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
One more bottle of red wine.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,800
Hello, Mr. Yi.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,000
Hello? Mr. Shen.

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,760
There is something urgent

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,480
I hope you can deal with.

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,080
What is it?

45
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
I want to nullify

46
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,240
that divorce agreement.

47
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,200
What?

48
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
Are you determined?

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,600
Yes, I am.

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,280
I shouldn't

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,880
have signed the divorce agreement.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm very sure

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,360
what I want is a complete family.

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,560
Mr. Yi, I see what you mean.

55
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,040
But if what you want is a family,

56
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,000
I suggest

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,800
you ask for Chen Jiaxin's opinions.

58
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,040
After all,

59
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,200
she's an indispensable member of your family.

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,160
What do you mean?

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,560
When you had that agreement drafted,

62
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,680
everything was up to you.

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,080
Now you're going to nullify it, right?

64
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,360
In this case, I really suggest

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
you ask for Chen Jiaxin's opinions.

66
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:25,920
After all,

67
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
many clauses are related to her.

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,120
I think

69
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,280
it'll be more suitable

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,760
to sign a supplementary agreement.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,400
And her interests will be better guaranteed.

72
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,680
Well.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
If I don't nullify the divorce agreement,

74
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,000
it means we still have to divorce, right?

75
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,240
No, it doesn't.

76
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,400
The date of divorce can be altered

77
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,880
in the supplemental agreement.

78
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,360
At the same time, Chen Jiaxin's interests

79
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,320
can be better protected from all sides.

80
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,160
Actually, my suggestion is

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,840
to change the divorce agreement
into a premarital agreement.

82
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh.

83
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,200
I see.

84
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,600
Change it like this.

85
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,840
Delete the clause

86
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,560
about Jiaxin leaving after giving birth.

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,840
Change it to "The date of divorce
will be negotiated by the Parties".

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,400
As for distribution of property,

89
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,200
I'll send you the details on WeChat.

90
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,000
As for the child custody...

91
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,600
Let Jiaxin have it.

92
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,320
She can't live without her child.

93
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,080
But I must have visitation rights

94
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,640
although we won't get a divorce.

95
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,880
Get it prepared before the year-end party...

96
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,400
Oh, no.

97
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,560
I mean before my grandma's birthday party.

98
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
Send it to the hotel around 11:00 a.m.

99
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,120
Okay.

100
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,600
Mr. Yi, why are you in a hurry
to have it changed?

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
Did Jiaxin fight with you about it?

102
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,920
No. It has nothing to do with her.

103
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,400
I'm the one

104
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,800
that is eager to get it done.

105
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,360
Okay. Thank you.

106
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,160
How is it going?

107
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:49,960
Done?

108
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,680
Hmm.

109
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,760
It's all done.

110
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,840
Great.

111
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,720
Come on.

112
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,200
Wish you and Jiaxin happiness.

113
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,160
Thank you.

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,680
A little more.

115
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,440
Sorry.

116
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,840
I fell asleep.

117
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,400
You've had a long day.

118
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,360
Have an early night.

119
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,440
Thank you for driving me home.

120
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,640
Be careful.

121
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,840
We're arriving home.

122
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,760
Be careful.

123
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,200
Here we are.

124
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,880
Why am I here?

125
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,160
I want to go home.

126
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,640

You're drunk.

Get cleaned up at my place to sober up, okay?

132
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,560
Jiaxin and your grandma will be worried

133
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,440
if they see you're like this.

134
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,000

We trust him,

174
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,440
right?

175
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,320
Now that he said we're a family,

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,080
he'll fulfill his promise.

he always showed up in time

Hello?

Xiyi is at my place.

190
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,680
Come and pick him up.

191

I'm waiting for you.

192
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,480
Come in.

193
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,120
Take a seat.

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,880
I'll get you a cup of water.

I'm sorry.

197
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,040
Xiyi and I drank too much last night,

198
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,880
so he missed your calls.

199
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,480
You...

200
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,880
...drank too much?

201
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,320
You know,

202
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
we chatted casually

203
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,200
and recalled

204
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
those happy memories between us.

205
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,520
Don't get it wrong.

206
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,280
Nothing happened between us last night.

207
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,800
I told him

208
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,160
it's hard for me to get pregnant.

209
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,680
He told me

210
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,320
how it felt to be a dad for the first time.

211
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,640
He said he was not a good dad

212
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,160
and he would amplify his effort.

213
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,760
I said

214
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,080
I'd also try my best to be a good mom.

215
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,760
Even if it's my adopted child,

216
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,600
I'll give him all my love.

217
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,880
You...

218
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,840
...won't continue dancing?

219
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:53,880
Well.

220
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,560
I'm tired.

221
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,640
What I'm longing for is not a stage,

222
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,080
but a loving family.

223
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,520
Today is his grandma's birthday.

224
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,000
I need to prepare a gift for her.

225
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,240
So,

226
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,960
I'll leave Xiyi to you.

227
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,480
Bye.

228
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,520
Last night,

229
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,320
I drank too much.

230
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,080
I know.

231
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,680
Anna has already told me.

232
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,160
I'll get you a cup of tea.

233
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,360
Um.

234
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,440
I made everything clear

235
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,920
to Anna last night.

236
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,360
I know.

237
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,240
Anna has told me about it.

238
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,360
It's over between Anna and me.

239
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,200
Chen Jiaxin,

240
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,960
don't be mad at me, okay?

241
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,000
Chen Jiaxin,

242
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,040
don't you believe me?

243
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,120
As for what happened last night, I can...

244
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,280
I don't believe myself.

245
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,920
It hasn't been long

246
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,440
since we got to know each other.

247
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm not sure

248
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,440
that you're really into me

249
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,040
during such a short period.

250
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,480
I'm even less sure

251
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,240
that you're serious

252
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,880
about spending the rest of your life with me.

253
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,440
I'm serious.

254
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,800
As I said,

255
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,000
you and I

256
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,000
and Ximi are a family.

257
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,840
Maybe

258
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,280
you should think about it again

259
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,560
and find out what you really want.

260
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,120
If it weren't for Ximi,

261
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,880
would you make the same choice?

262
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,040
Don't force yourself.

264
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,920
Do you still not understand

265
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,680
what I want?

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,280
Hmm?

267
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,880
Grandma's birthday party is going to start.

268
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,560
Get prepared.

269
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,040
She asked me to go there early.

270
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,960
See you in the hotel.

272
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,200
Chen Jiaxin,

273
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,160
cheer up.

274
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,880
Let bygones

275
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,640
be bygones.

276
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,240
Jiaxin.

277
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,200
You're here.

278
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,440
Last night, Xiyi told me you would dance
with him at the year-end party.

279
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,800
You must be nervous.

280
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,920
I was also nervous

281
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
the first time I performed on the stage.

282
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
So I think I can give you some advice.

283
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,120
Have a sip.

284
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,800
I know women shouldn't drink alcohol
during pregnancy,

285
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,120
so I changed it to grape juice.

286
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,360
Come on.

287
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,920
Cheers.

288
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,440
To what?

289
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,960
To your happiness.

290
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,680
Your relationship with Xiyi
will be on the right track

291
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,760
after the year-end party.

292
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,200
And I'll have

293
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,480
two more good friends.

294
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,560
Thank you.

295
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,600
Alas.

296
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,680
Sorry. I'm sorry.

297
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,440
It's hard to remove the grape juice stain.

298

-Go get your dress cleaned now.
-It doesn't matter.

299
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,200
I'll do it myself.

300
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,400
Excuse me.

301
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,160
Are you Miss Chen Jiaxin?

302
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,120
Yes, I am.

303
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,600
You've got a file from Shen Dao Law Firm.

304

It's quite on time.

no matter how much
you mind my past with Anna,

Oh.

323
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,040
You got a file from a law firm.

324
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,880
Jiaxin,

325
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,520
what's wrong?

326
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,880
You look pale. What happened?

327
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,640
Can I have a look at this?

328
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,960
After divorcing,

329
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,240
the Husband shall pay alimony
to the Wife every month.

330
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,280
Considering the Wife's financial capacity

331
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,440
and level of education,

332
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,920
the Husband has custody of the Child

333
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,360
and the Wife gives up visitation rights
of her free will.

334
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,320
If the Parties lose the Child
because of something inevitable,

335
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,800
the Wife shall agree to divorce at once?

336
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,000
Xiyi insisted on calling Mr. Shen last night.

337
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,080
Is this what he told him to draft?

338
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,240
Last night?

339
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,840
Yeah.

340
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,560
Last night, Xiyi and I
talked about your future.

341
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,120
He said

342
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,240
he'd let you know his standpoint

343
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,520
before the year-end party.

344
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,080
Then he called Mr. Shen

345
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,200
and asked him
to modify the divorce agreement.

346
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,040
I didn't expect

347
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,360
he'd made such decisions.

348
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,080
He even thought about the occasion

349
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,800
when I lose my baby.

350
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,640
Why did he curse my baby?

351
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,320
Jiaxin, don't be like this.

352
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,840
I don't mind divorcing.

353
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,120
I can do without Wang Xiyi.

354
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,800
But no one can take away my baby.

355
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,240
Chen Jiaxin,

356
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,560
I'm sorry.

357
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,240
Only if you leave

358
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,080
can Xiyi come back to me.

359
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,440
Sorry.

360
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,880
Ms. Wang.

361
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,320
Alas, Mrs. Chen.

362
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,280
Happy birthday!

363
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,200
Thank you.

364
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,800
You've been in Shanghai for some time.

365
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,720
Are you used to the life here?

366
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,320
Yes, we are.

367
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,240
Xiyi has been taking care of us.

368
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,520
Zhengren is also thoughtful.

369
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,160
He went specially to pick us up.

370
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,200
That's what we should do.

371
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,160
Grandma Zhenzhu,

372
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,360
thanks to you,

373
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,320
it's our first time
to sit in such a comfortable car.

374
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,080
Exactly.

375
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,960
I'm glad to hear that.

376
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,520
Jiaxin must be prepared.

377
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,920
Let's go to see her in the lounge.

378
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,800
Okay.

379
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,160
Come on.

380
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,680
Let's go.

381
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,520
Xiyi.

382
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,120
Anna?

383
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,800
Why are you here?

384
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,600
Where is Jiaxin?

385
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,920
Jiaxin...

386
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,600
She said she wouldn't
join the year-end party.

387
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,120
Why is the ring here?

388
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,800
Where has she gone?

389
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,400
Xiyi,

390
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,360
if...

391
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,800
If Jiaxin...

392
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,560
Jiaxin,

393
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,640
look who is here.

394
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:06,960
Grandma.

395
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,920
Anna.

396
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,040
Why is she here?

397
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:10,800
Ms. Wang,

398
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
I'm here to celebrate your birthday.

399
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,920
Here is a special gift for you.

400
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,000
I hope you like it.

401
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,880
Shut up.

402
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,680
Xiyi,

403
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,520
what's going on?

404
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,760
Isn't it Jiaxin's wedding ring?

405
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,360
Where is she?

406
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,040
-Auntie...
-You...

407
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,400
You're the ballet dancer
in the picture, right?

408
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:28,960
Hmm.

409
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,080
Why are you here?

410
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,520
Isn't it obvious?

411
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,320
To make them divorce.

412
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,400
You want to divorce Jiaxin?

413
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,080
Grandma,

414
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:46,840
I don't. I...

415
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,640
Wang Xiyi,

416
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,560
how can you do this?

417
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,280
I shouldn't have believed you.

418
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,520
You said you wanted to stay with Jiaxin

419
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,320
and asked me to trust you.

420
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,540
-What's going on with the divorce agreement?
-Mom...

421
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:57,920
You've been lying...

422
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,360
You got me wrong.

423
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,080
...all the time!

424
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,480
Alas. I'll explain to you later.

425
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,560
I have to find Jiaxin first.

426
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,320
Xiyi.

427
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,360
Xiyi.

428
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,000
Ximi,

429
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,760
sorry.

430
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,880
I don't want to leave you.

431
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,120
But I promise

432
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,320
I'll give you more love

433
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,160
and always stay with you till you grow up.

434
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,880
Where has she gone?

435
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,560
Chen Jiaxin!

436
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,360
Chen Jiaxin!

437
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,520
Chen Jiaxin.

438
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,400
Let's go back and have a talk.

439
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,840
Okay?

440
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,800
It's unnecessary.

441
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,960
It's all my fault.

442
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,280
I shouldn't have fallen in love with you

443
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,720
and shouldn't have believed that's love.

444
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,400
Chen Jiaxin,

445
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,080
is it because of the divorce agreement?

446
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:20,800
If yes,

447
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,640
we can talk about it.

448
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,120
That's enough.

449
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,280
I want to ensure you
and Ximi will live a good life.

450
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,160
Don't bother.

451
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,640
It's all my fault!

452
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,880
Our marriage was a mistake from the start.

453
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,800
I shouldn't have tried to grab happiness
that doesn't belong to me.

454
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,480
I shouldn't have fallen in love with you.

455
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,080
Chen Jiaxin, calm down.

456
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,840
I'm calm.

457
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,360
Let me go.

458
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,520
I just want my baby.

459
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,440
-Let me go.
-Jiaxin.

460
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,560
Please!

461
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,000
Let me go!

462
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,560
Call an ambulance!

463
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,040
Jiaxin.

464
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:58,920
Jiaxin.

465
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,680
Jiaxin.

466
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,520
Jiaxin.

467
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,360
How are you feeling?

468
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,960
Call an ambulance!

469
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:03,920
Jiaxin.

470
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,240
Call an ambulance!

471
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,800
Jiaxin, don't be afraid.
I'll take you to the hospital.

472
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,880
Jiaxin.

473
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,000
Jiaxin.

474
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,720
Jiaxin.

475
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,080
You have to be alright.

476
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,520
I promise

477
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,800
the three of us

478
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,040
will always stay together.

479
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:28,960
Jiaxin.

480
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,280
It'll be alright, Jiaxin.

481
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,440
Jiaxin.

482
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
Doctor, please save her.

483
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,120
Save her.

484
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,600
Save her.

485
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,720
Save her.

486
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,920
Owing to the impact of external forces,

487
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,560
placental abruption

488
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,560
and excessive bleeding have happened.

489
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,160
To save her,

490
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,640
we have to perform
an induced abortion as soon as possible.

491
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,000
But in this case, you'll lose the baby.

492
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,200
What did you say?

493
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,480
We'll lose Ximi?

494
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,480
This is Informed Consent for Surgery.

495
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,200
Please have a look.

496
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,800
Sign it if you agree.

497
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
We're pressed for time.

498
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,160
Doctor.

499
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,240
Please, there must be
something else we can do.

500
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,080
I know you can save her.

501
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,440
I'm sure you can save her, Doctor.

502
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,200
There is really no other choice.

503
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,600
This is the only way.

504
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,360
Don't be hesitant. Sign it.

505
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,240
She'll be in more danger
if it goes on like this.

506
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,320
Ximi.

507
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,400
Ximi.

508
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,040
Sign.

509
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,360
What is it?

510
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,400
Huh?

511
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,160
What is it?

512
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,200
Huh?

513
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,360
Informed Consent for Induced Abortion.

514
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,200
What? You can't sign.

515
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Don't sign.

516
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,240
Xiyi, please.

517
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,800
You can't do that.

518
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,880
I give up.

519
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,120
I don't want it.

520
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,880
Ximi is yours.

521
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,080
You can have everything you want.

522
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,640
I...I don't need custody.

523
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,040
Please. Don't sign it.

524
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,000
It's also your baby.

525
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,680
Don't sign.

526
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,880
Jiaxin.

527
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,520
You can't do that.

528
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,680
I'm sorry.

529
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,240
You can't do that.

530
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,640
Don't sign it.

531
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,760
Don't sign it.

532
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,780
(Signature of patient's relative)

533
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,720
Don't.

534
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,380
(Signature of patient's relative: Wang Xiyi)

535
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,800
You can't do that.

536
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,120
Get prepared for the operation now.

537
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,480
You liar.

538
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,160
No!

539
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,680
You liar!

540
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,120
You liar!

541
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,040
No!

542
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
No!

543
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,560
Let me go.

544
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,840
I want to go out.

545
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
Let me go.

546
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,640
I can't have the operation.

547
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,520
Please let me go.

548
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,560
I can't do that.

549
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,120
I really can't do that.

550
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,240
Please.

551
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,040
Ximi.

552
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,400
Ximi.

553
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,240
Ximi.

554
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,440
You're playing here alone.

555
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,680
Hmm?

556
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,360
Where is your dad?

557
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
I'll play with you, okay?

558
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,880
Ximi.

559
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,560
Ximi.

560
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,320
Ximi!

561
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,400
Jiaxin.

562
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,640
Jiaxin, you're awake.

563
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,560
You're awake.

564
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,560
How are you feeling?

565
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,280
Are you feeling alright?
Do you have abdominal pain?

566
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,160
Mom.

567
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,600
How about my baby?

568
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,320
Ximi is still there,

569
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:34,960
right?

570
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,120
Sis,

571
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,640
answer me.

572
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,760
I still have my baby, right?

573
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,960
It's not a dream.

574
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,200
My baby.

575
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,040
It even didn't have a chance

576
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,560
to have a look at the world.

577
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,880
Mom, my baby.

578
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,600
Jiaxin, don't be like this.

579
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,080
I'm so useless.

580
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,120
Alright. Don't be like this. Jiaxin.

581
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,160
It's not your fault. It's not.

582
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,080
Mom, it is.

583
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,600
It even didn't have a chance
to look at this world.

584
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,800
I should've protected it better.

585
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,400
It's my fault.

586
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,120
Give my baby back to me.

587
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,000
Mom.

588
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,240
Sis,

589
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,280
how is Jiaxin doing?

590
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,160
How dare you come here?

591
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,120
If it weren't for the divorce agreement,

592
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,480
Jiaxin couldn't have suffered this.

593
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,240
You still want to irritate her?

594
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,120
Sis,

595
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,680
I just want to see her.

596
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm worried about her.

597
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,280
Jiaxin doesn't want to see you.

598
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,160
Go back.

599
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,640
I'm sorry, Sis.

600
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,160
Don't bother her.

601
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,520
Go away.

602
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,920
Mr. Yi.

603
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:22,840
Mr. Yi.

604
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,000
Something happened to the company.

605
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,000
What's wrong?

606
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,760
A fire happened in the southwestern plant.

607
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,500
All the reserves of materials for shipment
have been burned down.

608
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,060
And the greater part of the production line
has been destroyed.

609
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,680
How about my grandma?

610
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,360
She fainted on the spot

611
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,200
after knowing Jiaxin has a miscarriage.

612
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,440
She hasn't come to reason yet.

613
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,940
Everything is in a mess in the company.

614
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,140
Go back and take charge.

615
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,940
You can deal with this matter

616
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,420
after that.

617
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,240
Sis,

618
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,000
please tell Jiaxin

619
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,160
to take good care of herself

620
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,880
and not to be mad at me.

621
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,720
Hold on.

622
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,960
There is one more thing.

623
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:08,960
Anna

624
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,360
is also hospitalized.

625
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,280
Shall we...

626
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,160
She has no relative.

627
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:14,880
You can take care of her.

628
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,640
I'm going back to the company.

629
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,000
What?

630
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,160
Chen Jiaxin has a miscarriage?

631
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,880
Yes.

632
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,200
Why is it so serious?

633
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,320
All I want is that she leaves Xiyi.

634
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,480
Ms. Shi, your test results have come out.

635
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,520
According to the report,

636
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,160
the impact has caused a little dislocation

637
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,680
between your pelvis and pubis.

638
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,160
It may influence

639
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,960
your pregnancy and childbirth.

640
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,200
Even if you're pregnant,

641
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,720
you'll be liable

642
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,240
to have a miscarriage.

643
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
Uh, Doctor, what do you mean?

644
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,720
Do you mean

645
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,280
she's

646
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,400
sterile?

647
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,420
