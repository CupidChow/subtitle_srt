27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,940
(Episode 15)

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,480
Everything I own now

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,800
belongs to Anna.

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
When I was a kid,

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
I had a baby sister.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,720
I remember

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,280
she had a round face

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,960
and a small body.

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,200
She always had a lollipop in her mouth.

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,320
She'd follow me around,

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,440
calling me brother

38
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,040
and asking me to play with her.

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,680
I thought she was a trouble maker,

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,600
hoping that one day

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,040
she'd stop following me around.

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,200
Brother!

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,000
Qing! Qing! Qing!

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Perhaps

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,480
God heard me

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
and took her away from us.

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,880
From that day on,

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,760
things have changed in my family.

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm full.

50
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,480
You didn't eat any of the dishes.

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,320
I want Qing to have it.

52
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,480
It would

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,600
be hard

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,880
to find my baby sister.

55
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,320
But I wouldn't accept the reality back then.

56
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,880
I'd wait at the entrance
to our residential community,

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,920
hoping that I could see my baby sister

58
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,600
come back to me.

59
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,480
All these years,

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,600
I've tried many ways to find her.

61
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,920
I had 32 DNA tests.

62
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,120
32 times of hope

63
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,840
turned into 32 times of disappointment.

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,560
But I won't give up.

65
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,840
I want to find her and tell her

66
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,360
that I'm sorry.

67
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,440
I hope life hasn't been hard
for her these years.

68
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,280
Otherwise,

69
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,360
I'll never forgive myself.

70
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,880
I'm sorry. I'm here to comfort you.

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,040
Now, you're listening to me

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,400
talking about the sad memories.

73
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,880
You will find her.

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,200
My biggest regret is losing my baby sister.

75
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,600
Because of the regret,

76
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,860
(Shang'an Pier)

77
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,280
I could take

78
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,360
everything happens to me well.

79
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,640
Jiaxin,

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
once you figure out

81
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,560
what is the most important to you,

82
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,680
you won't feel lost again.

83
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
What is

84
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,480
most important to me?

85
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,280
He's here.

86
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,440
Chen Jiaxin,

87
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,920
it's late in the night.
What are you doing here?

88
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,520
I...

89
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,320
Thanks for your coat.

90
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,840
Let's go home.

91
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,480
Thank you, Dylan.

92
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,920
Jiaxin,

93
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,560
remember our talk tonight.

94
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,640
I'll invite you to dinner
when I come back again.

95
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:21,920
Let's go.

96
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,040
Here is your dish. Please enjoy it.

97
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,520
Thanks.

98
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,400
Why did you avoid my calls?

99
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,480
I didn't hear it.

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,160
That's a lie.

101
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,640
Hey,

102
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,120
it looks delicious.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,720
Have a taste.

104
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,920
Don't lie to me again.

105
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,360
Don't leave me alone again.

106
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,520
If you are unhappy,

107
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,320
Ximi will be unhappy.

108
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,360
Besides, it was my fault.

109
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,320
I should explain right there.

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,320
After all, we made the mistake together.

111
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,800
I shouldn't let you take the fall.

112
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,280
I should face the problem with you.

113
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,120
Why are you staring at me?

114
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,360
Have some food.

115
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,240
Ximi is hungry.

116
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,360
Finish the dish,

117
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,840
or don't bother going home.

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,200
Ah?

119
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
I was kidding.

120
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,560
Come on, you haven't had any food today.

121
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,480
Here.

122
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,360
Have it.

123
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,800
Thanks.

124
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,760
And the sausage.

125
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,680
It's really delicious.

126
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,920
It's my favorite. Have some.

127
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,800
Have some more.

128
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,240
You've been starving yourself all day.

129
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm surprised by what happened
between you two.

130
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,400
Signing the divorce treaty right
after the wedding ceremony?

131
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,960
That was incredible.

132
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,200
It's hard for Xiyi, too.

133
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
So I told myself

134
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,440
not to put him on the spot.

135
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,040
No, no, no.

136
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
For his ex-girlfriend,

137
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,880
he might be a nice guy.

138
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,840
For you, absolutely no.

139
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,880
At the very beginning,

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
he used the contract to draw a line,

141
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,560
telling you what to do and what not to do.

142
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
He never thought of treating you

143
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,920
with equality and respect.

144
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,320
Even if you fell in love with each other,

145
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,760
you're a pushover,

146
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,680
you'd be manipulated by him.

147
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,320
Mom.

148
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,080
Jiaxin,

149
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,880
how is it going?

150
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,360
Is your belly growing?

151
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,560
When will you come to see Jia Fang

152
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,560
with your grandma-in-law and husband?

153
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,720
The baby is really cute.

154
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,400
Grandma is going to Europe tomorrow.

155
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,280
Xiyi has been busy these days.

156
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,200
What?

157
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,720
Is there anyone taking care of you?

158
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,640
Come on, how can they do this to you?

159
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,440
Fine, don't count on them.

160
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,000
Xishi,

161
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,680
here is the money.

162
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,080
Oh.

163
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
Come back home. I'll cook for you.

164
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Hey,

165
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,240
come back to see your sister.

166
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,840
How is she?

167
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,400
She is not seeing people these days.

168
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
And she is not doing business.

169
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,000
They say she's been strange lately,
crying all day.

170
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,640
I offered to visit her,

171
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,520
but she wouldn't let me.

172
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,520
I'm so worried about her.

173
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,160
Do you have a copy of the medical record?

174
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,560
Plastic surgery hospital

175
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,280
is different from normal hospitals.

176
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
We don't have a copy

177
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,960
because we need to protect patient's privacy.

178
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,640
I'd like to know

179
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
if Xiling's mother

180
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
is one of your...

181
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,040
Read it and sign it.

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,560
The Agreement on Fake Relationship.

183
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,880
What's that supposed to mean?

184
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,360
I think it's necessary that we make it clear

185
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,640
how it plays out.

186
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,480
It will save us from unnecessary friction.

187
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,720
You have 10 minutes to read it and sign it.

188
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,880
You...

189
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,400
Hey, I have my own ways of dealing with it.

190
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,840
I'll say that we had a fight and broke up.

191
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,520
Come on.

192
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
When we play it, we play it to the full.

193
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,320
If we don't get our story straight,

194
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,200
they're gonna

195
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,480
chew us up.

196
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,240
Try this one.

197
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,640
Son,

198
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,280
I saw a beautiful dress when I was shopping.

199
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,200
I want to buy it for your girlfriend.

200
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,480
Do you know her size?

201
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,000
Son...

202
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,120
Alright, alright.

203
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,840
I'll read it.

204
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,760
It's in duplicate.

205
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,800
The appendix is a brief introduction

206
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,920
to my birthday, blood type, family background

207
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,880
and dress size.

208
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,120
You need to fill in the blanks.

209
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,600
The other appendix
is an introduction to our relationship.

210
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,360
You might want to have it memorized
in case our parents ask about it.

211
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:16,960
Hey,

212
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,600
it's okay that you say I pursue you.

213
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,320
But why did you say that
I tried so hard to get you?

214
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,320
Do I look like a cheap girl to you?

215
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,480
Fine.

216
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,520
If you're okay with it, please sign it.

217
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,000
Alright, alright, whatever you want.

218
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,200
Anson? Your name is An Dazhu.

219
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,280
Don't call me that.

220
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,040
Mom, you just pick up and travel.

221
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,400
How long will you be gone?

222
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,360
Take a guess.

223
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,960
Is it a secret or something？

224
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,640
Why wouldn't you take me with you?

225
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,640
I could be there for you,

226
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,040
swiping the card,

227
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,760
carrying the things,
and going shopping with you.

228
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,720
Do you think I'm going there for fun?

229
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,840
At my age,

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,960
flying is a torture.

231
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm going to Europe to meet the distributors

232
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,320
in order to further expand
the European market.

233
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,760
You just stay at home
and take care of Jiaxin.

234
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,760
Yes, Ma'am.

235
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,920
Grandma,

236
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,360
the weather in Europe is changeable.

237
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
Take good care of yourself.

238
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,360
The same to you.

239
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,320
Mind you,

240
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,720
if Xiyi doesn't treat you well,
don't let him off the hook.

241
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,440
Let me know how it goes.

242
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,040
I'm leaving.

243
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,440
Take medicines on time.

244
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,360
Okay.

245
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,680
Okay. Watch your step. Okay.

246
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

247
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,320
I think it's postpartum depression.

248
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,960
Postpartum depression?

249
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Many people think that women
will have that natural glow

250
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,040
once they give birth to their child.

251
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,560
In fact,

252
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,000
it's not true that women
become perfect mothers

253
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,760
after childbirth.

254
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,760
About 15% to 30%

255
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,320
of brand-new mothers

256
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,120
suffer from postpartum depression

257
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,160
due to the change
in hormones and their roles,

258
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,280
as well as excessive labor.

259
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,040
It's a big challenge for many women.

260
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,200
Then what can we do?

261
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,920
Psychologically,

262
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,240
women are most vulnerable

263
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,840
after the childbirth.

264
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,040
On this occasion,

265
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,520
understanding and support
from the family is very important.

266
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,280
Family members are expected
to be there for her.

267
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,360
Otherwise in some severe cases,

268
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,680
some women would commit suicide.

269
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,720
It's hard to imagine

270
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,840
the child whose birth is anticipated

271
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,320
could become

272
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,680
the last straw

273
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,160
for the mother.

274
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,640
However,

275
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,240
once you're born,

276
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,160
you'll be taken away from me.

277
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,680
I won't get the chance

278
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
to listen to your cry

279
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,280
or change your diaper.

280
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,680
So I will cherish every single day

281
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,520
that I get to spend with you.

282
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,140

283

284
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,360
Yesterday,

285
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,040
your dad took me to buy many clothes.

286
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,840
We even bought toys for you.

287
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,520
Thank you for coming into my life.

288
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,840
Ever since I was a kid,
I've never dreamed big.

289
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,840
All I want is a happy family.

290
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,960
When asked about

291
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,720
my dream,

292
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,800
I'd feel embarrassed to tell them the answer.

293
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,120
Thank you

294
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,280
for making my dream come true.

295
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,520
I'm so happy.

296
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,640
Though

297
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,120
I can't be there watching you grow up,

298
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,200
I still want you to know

299
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,600
that I love you very much,

300
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,360

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,080
Since I can't change the fate

311
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,960
that I'm gonna leave one day,

312
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,440
I want to make myself happy

313
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,040
during this time.

314
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,280
I'll treat grandma, auntie,

315
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,240
Xiyi and Zhengren

316
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,720
as my family,

317
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,200
so that my baby could be born
into a happy family.

318
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,240
Then,

319
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,960
I'll have no regret when I leave.

320
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,920
Find the key points for me.

321
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,960
Highlight the details in red.

322
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,040
Understood, Mr. Yi.

323
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,840
Since you've been sending me yellow roses,

324
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,120
I forgive you.

325
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,520
Hey,

326
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,240
Lin Zimo told me

327
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,960
that she ran into you in a baby goods store.

328
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,640
I thought you hate shopping.

329
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,880
Are you producing baby goods now?

330
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,720
Do you like kids?

331
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,080
I don't hate them.

332
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,800
But I'd like to enjoy just the two of us

333
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,000
for a while.

334
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
What if,

335
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm desperate to have a baby?

336
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,040
Xiyi, we made a deal before.

337
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,720
I like kids.

338
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,040
But I'm not prepared to be a mother yet.

339
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,720
Getting married and having a baby
are two different things.

340
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,920
I want to enjoy romance and stage
at the same time.

341
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,120
I don't want to

342
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,560
be attached to kids yet.

343
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,000
We're not even married
and you're talking about the baby thing.

344
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,840
Don't get disappointed.

345
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,560
I might get pregnant right after our wedding.

346
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,520
You know, life is unpredictable.

347
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,600
Actually,

348
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,680
it would be nice to be a cool mom,

349
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,360
looking hot and teaching ballet.

350
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,880
Mr. Yi, bad news.

351
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,440
Something happened to snail.

352
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,040
What?

353
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,960
I'll talk to you later.

354
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,400
Hey, Xiyi!

355
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,600
It's the first time that he hung up on me.

356
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,420
(Snail Shower Gel
Fresh and fragrant in summer)

357
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,900
(Differences between genuine and pirated products:
Logo colors, name, abbreviation)

358
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,480
Some online stores are selling fake products,

359
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,600
which are mistaken by the consumers

360
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,160
as produced

361
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,480
by Cheng Jie Group.

362
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,320
The Marketing Department
has received many complaints.

363
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,320
It means,

364
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,200
the snail shower gel is being replicated?

365
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,200
We're gonna work late today.

366
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,120
The Legal Department
shall draft a lawyer's letter.

367
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,200
The PR Department shall draft a statement.

368
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,720
The Marketing Department shall make a plan.
I want them before daybreak.

369
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,240
We must tell the customers

370
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,200
how to identify the genuine products
and the pirated ones.

371
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,120
Anson,

372
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
is this the snail crisis you talk about?

373
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,320
Isn't it about snail?

374
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,680
Go, go, go.

375
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,480
I can't believe I hung up on Anna
because of this.

376
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,880
Great. It's the first time I feel at home.

377
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,840
I can eat and talk at my will.

378
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,400
I don't need to read people's faces anymore.

379
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,120
Do you like the meal?

380
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,760
I never lie.

381
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,480
You cook way better than my mom.

382
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,800
You're so sweet.

383
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,240
Are you trying to brown nose
after the dinner?

384
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,680
Well, I must say that you cook really well.

385
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,720
Thanks, auntie.

386
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,000
Hey,

387
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,200
these two cups

388
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
are for you.

389
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,760
I like blue. It's so beautiful.

390
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,360
It seems Zhengren's cup is different.

391
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,320
That's right.

392
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,840
You're an ice beauty,

393
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,920
so I made this ice mountain for you.

394
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,560
Zhengren enjoys cold drinks.

395
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,480
His cup is thicker

396
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,520
which can keep cool drinks cool.

397
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,600
You're very considerate.

398
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,440
Jiaxin,

399
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,560
it's been a long time
since we've come back home.

400
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,520
We never feel at home here.

401
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
In the end,

402
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,960
it turns out you're the person

403
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,680
who really cares about me and my son.

404
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,760
Thank you so much.

405
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,000
Thank you.

406
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,160
I'm just doing the right thing.

407
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,320
Xiyi is working late.
I'll deliver the meal to him.

408
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,760
We've chosen three colors for the baseboard.

409
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,880
Mr. Yi, which color is deemed proper to you?

410
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,640
The one on the left.
The other two colors are too dark.

411
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,400
Mr. Yi, I got an idea.

412
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,160
Since we're revising the product,

413
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,040
perhaps we could also change the package

414
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,400
and the price.

415
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,760
Do you have any suggestions?

416
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,840
Have a thirty-minute rest.
We'll continue later.

417
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,080
Go and buy some sandwiches.

418
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,560

452
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,840
You forget your phone here.

453
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,400
Thanks.

454
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,200
Give it to me.

455
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
Why did you search Dylan?

456
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,240
Nothing. I was fishing around.

457
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,520
I'm going to work.

458
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,480
Our baby will look cute sitting on it.

459
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,440
What do you think?

460
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,600
It's suitable both for boys and girls.

461
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
It's so cute.

462
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Dylan believes

463
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,800
you take care of the doll

464
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,680
the way

465
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,040
you'd take care of our baby.

466
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,400
He respects you for that.

467
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,280
Morning, auntie.

468
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,840
Morning.

469
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,760
Where is Jiaxin?

470
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,920
She is visiting her mother.

471
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,560
It's out of the blue.
She hasn't talked about it before.

472
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,240
How would I know?

473
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,360
She made the breakfast in advance

474
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
and left the house early.

475
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,040
Morning.

476
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,560
Morning.

477
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,600
Where did you get the cup?

478
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,560
You mean this one?

479
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,040
Jiaxin made it for me.

480
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,960
That's nice.

481
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,840
That's yours?

482
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,800
Yep.

483
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,920
Jiaxin is so sweet.

484
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,680
She didn't forget me.

485
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,560
If what I think is correct,

486
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,600
that one belongs to grandma.

487
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,160
This one is mine.

488
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,280
Nope. This one belongs to Jiaxin.

489
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,640
Are you leaving now?

490
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,920
Wait a minute.

491
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,600
Well,

492
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,760
Jiaxin made it for you.

493
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,680
She cooked so many dishes for you.

494
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,280
Thanks, auntie.

495
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,120
Jiaxin, you're back.

496
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:53,960
Uncle Lin.

497
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
You look great.

498
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,000
Xishi, where are you going?

499
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,880
Grocery shopping.

500
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,760
Oh, grocery shopping.

501
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,640
It seems something is wrong
with your mother lately.

502
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,720
She has been worried about something.

503
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,560
The other day,

504
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,520
I ordered beef noodles,

505
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,880
but she served me rice puddings.

506
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,640
You might want to talk
and spend some time with her.

507
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,280
I see.

508
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,160
Alright, see you.

509
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,120
See you.

510
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,680
Morning, Xishi.

511
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,320
I'm going to Shanghai to visit Jiaxin.

512
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,520
I want to cook for her.

513
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,080
I'd have two bunches.

514
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,560
No problem.

515
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,200
I'll give two more bunches for free.

516
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,600
That's so nice of you.

517
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,320
You're welcome.

518
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,080
That's enough.

519
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,160
Thanks.

520
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,240
Xishi, want some fish?

521
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,200
Is the cuttlefish fresh?

522
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,040
Definitely.

523
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,640
I got the cuttlefish and hairtail

524
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,280
at five o'clock this morning.

525
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,240
The yellow croakers are especially fresh.

526
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,800
Are they wild fish?

527
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,640
One hundred percent wild fish.

528
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,200
They're sort of expensive.

529
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,080
Expensive?

530
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,440
They're wild fish, after all.

531
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,400
I'd take two.

532
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,560
No problem.

533
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,200
How about this one.

534
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,680
Okay.

535
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,280
Would you please stop crying?

536
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,320
Just stop crying.

537
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,720
I haven't had food all day long.

538
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,520
Sis?

539
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,080
Sis?

540
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,440
Sis?

541
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,520
Do I owe you money?

542
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,400
Do you want me dead?

543
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,200
Please stop crying.

544
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:53,960
Sis.

545
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,880
Jiaxin.

546
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,720
It's alright.

547
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,640
I didn't know you'd come today.

548
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,200
I told you a few times before.

549
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,640
You just wouldn't let me.

550
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,760
Hello there.

551
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,440
You haven't had food yet, have you?

552
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,800
I guess I'll leave you alone.

553
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,280
I'm okay.

554
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
I'm here to help you.

555
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,000
Look, the baby got red butt cheeks.

556
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,480
The red bumps.
I think the baby has diaper rash.

557
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,680
Let's put oil on it.

558
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,280
Stay still.

559
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,240
A little bit.

560
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,120
Alright, alright.

561
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,440
That's alright.

562
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,200
Come on, lift your butt.

563
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,400
Let's change the diaper.

564
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,400
Okay, there you go.

565
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,600
You're not crying. There you go.

566
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,560
He is smiling.

567
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,040
So, you're not crying, huh?

568
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,520
Jiaxin, I'm so glad

569
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,960
that you're here.

570
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,440
I'll put him to bed.

571
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,840
You take a shower.

572
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,920
Go ahead.

573
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,200
I'm going upstairs.

574
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,080
She is leaving. She is leaving.

575
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,520
My sweetie.

576
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,680
I'll stay with you.

577
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,920
You worked late at night.

578
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,360
Vitamins are good for your recovery.

579
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,680
For today's lunch: rice with roasted eel,

580
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,640
scrambled eggs with spinach and agaric,
fried mushrooms and rape plants,

581
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,040
pork ribs and kelp soup, bananas.

582
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,960
For snacks in the afternoon:
selection of nuts.

583
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,000
They contain all kinds of nutrition.

584
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,680
Please finish them all.

585
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,480
We finally had

586
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,560
chairwoman's agenda in Europe.

587
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,600
It says...

588
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,240
Snail is incredible.

589
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,680
What a hearty lunch.

590
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,560
So?

591
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,640
Do you envy me?

592
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,480
No, no, no.

593
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,000
Do you know what I saw

594
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,440
Snail's best girlfriend doing?

595
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,120
She was searching Dylan.

596
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,840
She was trying to fix Jiaxin up with him.

597
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,200
It seems she really cares about her.

598
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
The point is,

599
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,280
she asked Jiaxin to keep a distance from you.

600
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,200
She wants to make a match
between Dylan and Snail.

601
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,000
No wonder

602
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,040
Jiaxin returned to Huaniao Island.

603
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,840
See, right after Chairwoman left,

604
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,240
she hurried back to her mother.

605
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,520
Think about it. It's kind of interesting.

606
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,800
What do you mean by that?

607
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,280
Go.

608
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,960
Hello? Hello?

609
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,200
Who are you?

610
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,640
I'm Chen Jiaxin's mother.
I'm here to see her.

611
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,720
I'm Chen Jiaxin's mother.
I'm here to see her.

612
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,400
Ah, you're her mother.

613
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:33,880
That's right.

614
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Come on in. Come on in.

615
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,520
You are...

616
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,440
I'm the auntie.

617
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,160
I'm Xiyi's auntie.

618
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,360
Ah, I see.

619
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,240
That's right.

620
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,000
Hello?

621
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,520
Mom.

622
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,480
Why didn't you tell me that
you're coming back home?

623
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,840
I'm at your house,
only to find you're not here.

624
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Mom, I'm visiting my sister.

625
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,480
Why are you speaking in such a low voice?

626
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,200
Jia Fang just fell asleep.

627
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,280
Mom,

628
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,480
the doctor told me

629
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,320
that she might have postpartum depression.

630
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,560
What depression? It can't be that bad.

631
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,880
Alright, stay there and accompany her.

632
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,000
Okay, I got to go.

633
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,360
Have some water.

634
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,040
You must be thirsty.

635
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,880
Thanks a lot.

636
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,040
Okay, enough, enough.

637
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,560
Enough.

638
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,840
You don't have to bring food

639
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,400
when you visit us.

640
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,080
You can find everything in the supermarket.

641
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,440
I'm afraid the refrigerator is not big enough

642
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,000
for all of this.

643
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,880
The farmers' market
on the island is way better

644
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,080
than the supermarket in the city.

645
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,840
Look at the vegetables.

646
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,240
They are grown by the farmers.

647
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,680
This is fat wild fish.

648
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,000
The eggs

649
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,280
are from free-range chicken.

650
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,440
How about

651
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,040
I cook dinner for you.

652
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,560
I'll cook a few dishes and make soup.

653
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,560
You and my son-in-law could taste my cooking.

654
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,880
You're cooking for us?

655
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,080
That would make me feel guilty.

656
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,520
The kitchen is over there.

657
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,640
Make yourself at home. You're most welcome.

658
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,240
Okay.

659
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,920
Hey,

660
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,080
how is it going?

661
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,760
I smell something good.

662
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,760
So awesome!

663
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,800
You're a fantastic cook.

664
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,080
Does it smell good?

665
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,280
This is modified version
of ginseng chicken soup.

666
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,720
I used red ginseng produced in Korea,

667
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,680
which is mild.

668
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,200
But still, pregnant women
should avoid having too much of it.

669
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,720
Okay.

670
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,800
It's okay for you
and my son-in-law to enjoy it.

671
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,360
The soup is nutritious
and doesn't make you fat.

672
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,120
It's still hot and undercooked.

673
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,600
I just can't wait to taste it.

674
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
You see,

675
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,960
both of us are mothers.

676
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,080
I want to speak from my heart to you.

677
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,280
Well.

678
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,480
Jiaxin is a young girl

679
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,080
who is married to your family

680
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,440
before she knows much about the world.

681
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,360
She wouldn't listen to me
even I tried to stop her.

682
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,480
If she does anything wrong,

683
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,760
you can tell her

684
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,920
and correct her.

685
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,440
Please forgive her.

686
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,080
Don't worry. My mom and I like her very much.

687
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,240
I mean it.

688
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,560
She is a really nice girl.

689
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,000
It's the first time that you visit here.

690
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,040
Let me show you their room.

691
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
It's big and beautiful.

692
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,200
Let's go.

693
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,640
Okay.

694
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,400
Let's take a break.

695
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,680
I really admire people who know how to cook.

696
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,680
I do admire them.

697
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,960
I hate cooking.

698
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,920
It's so tiring.

699
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,280
I'll get all sweaty and smelly.

700
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
Watch out for the step here.

701
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,560
Let me give you a room tour.

702
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,920
This is the cloakroom.

703
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,160
It's full of their clothes.

704
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,880
Young people just have a lot of stuff.

705
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,760
This is Jiaxin's dresser.

706
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,640
Let's go inside.

707
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,760
This is the bedroom.

708
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,600
It's really big, isn't it?

709
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,120
There is a large bathroom.

710
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,560
It's so large.

711
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,520
The ballerina looks really beautiful.

712
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,120
My son-in-law is fond of her?

713
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,480
It seems he has really good taste.

714
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,120
You bet. Xiyi has really good taste.

715
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,440
It's only natural that
his girlfriend looks stunning.

716
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,520
Girlfriend?

717
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,520
Well.

718
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,160
No, no, no.

719
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,200
It was a slip of the tongue.

720
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,240
Technically, his ex-girlfriend.

721
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,760
The past is the past.

722
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,760
The soup is being heated downstairs.

723
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,920
I'm gonna turn the heat off.

724
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,400
Just make yourself at home.

725
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,600
Enjoy it.

726
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,920
Chen Jiaxin, how careless can you be?

727
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,600
How can you fall asleep in this room?

728
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,360
There must be something belongs to
that woman in this room.

729
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,340
(Divorce Agreement of Mr. Wang Xiyi
and Ms. Chen Jiaxin)

730
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,640
This is...

731
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,000
This is "the Wang family is nice to me"

732
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,640
and "Xiyi is nice to me".

733
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,760
Hey,

734
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,560
what's up?

735
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Are you alright?

736
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,960
Did you fall down?

737
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,120
No.

738
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,880
Alas.

739
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,760
This is...

740
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,600
What happened?

741
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:47,960
It's...

742
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,680
Well,

743
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,080
a mosquito landed on the photo.

744
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,840
I tried to hit it

745
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,360
and the photo just fell down to the ground.

746
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,920
Oh, my God.

747
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,120
Oh, my God.

748
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,840
There is nothing wrong with the photo.

749
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,120
If you are not okay with it,
you can just tell me.

750
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,280
But if you ruined it,

751
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,400
how am I supposed to tell Xiyi about it?

752
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,560
I'm totally okay with it.

753
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,840
I'm so sorry.

754
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,560
You see, I have a noodle stand.

755
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,400
I knead the dough every day.

756
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,400
I got strong hands from doing it
for several decades.

757
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,800
I can see that.

758
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,160
Don't worry. I'll put it back.

759
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,080
The fish is being cooked, right?

760
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,080
Listen...

761
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,000
Come on, you got to turn the fire off, or...

762
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,000
Listen...

763
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,240
Or the fish will be overcooked, which is bad.

764
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,240
Thanks a lot.

765
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,120
Go downstairs when you put it back.

766
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,600
Okay.

767
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,680
I can't believe it.

768
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,440
Chen Jiaxin,

769
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,080
how can you be so stupid?

770
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,680
Before your wedding,

771
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,960
I told you to take good care of yourself

772
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,160
before you become a mother.

773
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,160
Why are you silly enough to believe
whatever they told you?

774
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,240
Do you want to piss me off?

775
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,840
Did you get married to him

776
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,640
in order to get back at me

777
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,760
for saying

778
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,960
that you'll never get married?

779
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,120
Mom, Xiyi is really busy.

780
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,760
It's 11 p.m.
and he is still reading the contract.

781
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,360
I see. I'll wait a few more minutes.

782
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,120
Mom, what if

783
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,720
I'll have to leave my baby one day?

784
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,040
Are you serious?

785
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,000
Not at all.

786
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,440
I'm thinking nonsense.

787
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,120
Why?

788
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,760
Why would you suffer from all this?

789
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,400
I won't allow it.

790
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,160
Like every pregnant woman in the world,

791
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,640
you are going through all the hardships
of becoming a mother.

792
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,720
Why can't my daughter

793
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,280
be well treated?

794
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,400
Ever since we entered European market,

795
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,480
local consumers have been paying
high attention to our products.

796
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,120
So far, the sales volume is remarkable.
