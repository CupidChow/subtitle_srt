27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,940
(Episode 16)

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,160
You're gonna be an elder brother soon.

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,960
When you play with each other in the future,

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,960
you must take care of your brother.

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,880
Is that okay?

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,160
What are you doing here?

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,320
Chen Jiaxin,

34
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,520
even if we're not really a couple,

35
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,400
you don't need to treat
me as a stranger, do you?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,920
What I mean is

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,640
that if you're in a bad mood,

38
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,720
I should be the first person who knows.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,640
What are you trying to say?

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,760
Read it yourself.

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,240
Wang,

42
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,880
that day you turned up,

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,720
took Jiaxin away

44
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,480
and made her your wife.

45
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,720
Jiaxin's life has changed ever since.

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,600
There's a good old saying.

47
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,080
Marriage means a second
reincarnation for a woman.

48
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,480
Chooses the right man and she'll have a
happy life. Otherwise she'll have rocky times.

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,440
To be honest,

50
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,880
I don't know you well

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,280
and I haven't spent much time with you.

52
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,200
Jiaxin will be in labor

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,120
several months later.

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,520
There are some things I still want to say.

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,640
The only thing about Jiaxin

56
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,680
I'm proud of is that she's kind and honest.

57
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,400
I thought kind kids would be rewarded.

58
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,720
She met you, married you and conceived.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,240
Everything seemed so good.

60
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,480
But at this moment,

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,640
I'm standing in your room

62
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,960
and I realized that my
daughter had lied to me.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,560
But

64
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,720
I don't want to scold her

65
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,000
or tell her I found out about it.

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,440
I know she told those lies because she cares

67
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,960
about you and wants to protect you very much.

68
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,440
I really don't understand

69
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
affection of you young people.

70
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,640
But can you do me a favor?

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,440
For the fact that Jiaxin
cheated me for your sake,

72
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,680
be nice to her.

73
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,200
When you find that she
keeps you at a distance,

74
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,840
she's being sad because
of you but she can't say it.

75
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,800
At such a moment...

76
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,280
at such a moment, hug her for me

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,480
and make her feel warm,

78
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,480

102
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,120
Jiaxin doesn't like food that's too oily.

103
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,560
So the greens just need to be blanched.

104
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,960
And the noodles are

105
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
too thin.

106
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,280
They'll be done too much once you boil them.

107
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,960
The meat.

108
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,840
She prefers it in big pieces.

109
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,800
These pieces are too small.

110
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,520
She doesn't like it.

111
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,300
Mrs. Chen,

112
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,120
Jiaxin is a good granddaughter-in-law.

113
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,840
She always cooks things soft

114
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,560
so that my mom can bite them.

115
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,120
I didn't see that she wasn't enjoying them.

116
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,560
She's just too good.

117
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,880
She always considers other people's feelings.

118
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,560
She'll be happy when others are.

119
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,640
If she doesn't like something,

120
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,920
she won't say it.

121
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,440
She won't say anything if no one asks

122
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,440
and just bears with it.

123
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Mrs. Chen, what's the matter?

124
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,920
Why are you crying?

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,520
Nothing's the matter.

126
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,120
Nothing. It's just the smell of these onions.

127
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,760
Do you need my help?

128
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,560
No, thanks.

129
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,840
Your cup looks nice.

130
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,880
You mean this one?

131
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
Jiaxin specially made it for me.

132
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,840
Its colors are so pretty.

133
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
She's really talented.

134
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,960
It's much better than one you buy.

135
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,840
Jiaxin made this?

136
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,280
Yes.

137
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,280
She always said

138
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,520
she made things in a pottery store

139
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,320
with Ms. Wang.

140
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,880
I didn't expect her to be so ingenious.

141
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,480
That's not all.

142
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,880
My mom loves going

143
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,840
to a pottery store with Jiaxin

144
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,520
and they can stay there all afternoon.

145
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,600
She said

146
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,400
when Jiaxin makes enough

147
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,400
little things like this,

148
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,760
she'd hold a personal art exhibition for her.

149
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
Did Ms. Wang really say so?

150
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,640
She really said so.

151
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
But then again,

152
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,200
all things are good to Jiaxin.

153
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,640
So we don't know

154
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,560
whether she really likes pottery or not.

155
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,600
Yes, she really likes it.

156
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,320
When she was little, she often drew things

157
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,000
on walls with mud.

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,120
She really likes it.

159
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,040
That's great, then.

160
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,840
You didn't know.

161
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,320
My mom and her grandma have

162
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,120
simply doted on her.

163
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,720
If I ask my mom for something,

164
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,600
she'll just ignore me. So pitiful.

165
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,760
But the...

166
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,680
the exhibition... the art exhibition.

167
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,840
My mom has always remembered it.

168
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
What's wrong?

169
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,960
Why are you crying again?

170
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,360
-Don't cry.
-I'm okay.

171
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm okay.

172
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,200
They're tears of joy.

173
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,960
That's a little frightening.

174
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,000
Jiaxin...

175
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,320
Jiaxin was alone in Shanghai.

176
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,760
I always thought she'd be treated badly.

177
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,360
You think of her as family.

178
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,160
I...

179
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,120
I...

180
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,440
I'm really grateful to you.

181
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,800
What for?

182
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,960
Stop crying.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,440
I feel so bad when you cry.

184
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,680
We're a family.

185
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,800
You don't need to thank us.

186
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,440
We're a family.

187
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,800
Now that you consider me as family,

188
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
I want to ask... ask a favor.

189
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,680
Speak slowly. Speak slowly.

190
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,840
There's something in Xiyi's room.

191
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,800
I...

192
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,880
I really can't stand it.

193
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,800
What is it?

194
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,680
You're quite handsome.

195
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,520
Though I'm handsomer,

196
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,800
would you like to work for Cheng Jie Group?

197
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:44,920
Jiaxin.

198
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,000
Why's his bottom so warm?

199
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
He may have peed.

200
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,000
Change his diaper.

201
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,800
Can you do it?

202
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,760
Don't worry. I've learned it in class.

203
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,240
Let me tell you.

204
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,400
Our teacher has talked about it in detail.

205
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,560
First of all,

206
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,920
get a new diaper.

207
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,640
And then take the old one off.

208
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
Don't worry. I'm an expert at it.

209
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,280
Good boy. Good boy.

210
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,240
The teacher also said

211
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,760
if it was Number 1, we'd
just change the diaper

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,680
and if it was Number 2, we'd
also wipe the butt clean.

213
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,040
These buttons are

214
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,120
just the same as ones we undid in class.

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,720
So simple.

216
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,480
And then lift the baby's legs.

217
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,240
Why are his legs soft?

218
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
Kids' legs are of course soft.

219
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,160
Not the ones in class.

220
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,080
It's Number 2.

221
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,800
Can you do it?

222
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Do you need my help?

223
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,120
No, no. I'll do it myself.

224
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,320
Why did you go Number 2?

225
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,560
Can't you go Number 1?

226
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,520
Be good.

227
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,600
Now I'll wipe it and wipe it clean.

228
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,960
Then I'll wrap it up.

229
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,840
He's peeing. He's peeing on my hand!

230
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,400
Let me handle it.

231
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,040
Smelly baby, did you pee?

232
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,880
You peed, didn't you?

233
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,240
You peed.

234
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,840
There, there, it'll be done soon.

235
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,920
Let's put your pants on.

236
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
So comfortable.

237
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Okay, okay.

238
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,400
Aunt's hugging you.

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,520
Hug, hug. You're so heavy.

240
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,760
Jiaxin,

241
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,680
I can't judge whether your marriage is

242
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,280
the right or a good one.

243
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,800
You have grown up.

244
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,920
Perhaps

245
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,040
this time I should trust your decision,

246
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,760
trust your choice

247
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,920
and believe that you can be happy.

248
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,120
Don't let me down, will you?

249
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,640
Come on, let's ask Aunt
when we can have dinner.

250
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,760
It'll be ready soon.

251
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,320
The dishes there are enough already.

252
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,240
Just a minute. One more thing to fry.

253
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,000
Does it smell good?

254
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,320
You're hungry, aren't you?

255
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,360
What do you think?

256
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Does the food Aunt's cooking smell good?

257
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,800
Okay, let's take this to the table for Aunt.

258
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,360
Let's go.

259
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,600
Go on.

260
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,440
Here's the soup.

261
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,360
Has he finished?

262
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,520
Give him to me.

263
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,520
It's time to pat Jia Fang to sleep.

264
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
You eat first.

265
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,760
What about you?

266
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,240
I'll eat later.

267
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,640
Eat now. Don't wait until the food gets cold.

268
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
Goodness, Xiyi,

269
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,240
haven't we agreed before?

270
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,200
I like kids

271
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,480
but I'm not ready to be a mom yet.

272
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,160
Chen Jiaxin.

273
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,840
Open your mouth.

274
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,080
Listen,

275
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
don't just look after other people's kid.

276
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,080
If you don't eat now, the food will get cold

277
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,600
and Ximi will protest about it.

278
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,160
What are you doing?

279
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,280
Are you crazy?

280
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,440
We don't have a clue what's going on

281
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,560
between my cousin and Jiaxin.

282
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Did you dig Jiaxin into a hole or yourself?

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,640
If my brother knows,
we'll both be in trouble.

284
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,560
You didn't know.

285
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,720
Her mom was so sad then.

286
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,040
I'm a mom, too.

287
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,480
So I just...

288
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,040
Do you mean

289
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,320
your brother will lose temper with me?

290
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,080
Whatever.

291
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,520
It's so annoying. So what if I changed it?

292
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,240
I'm his aunt.

293
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,720
Will he dare to kick me out?

294
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,520
Of course he will.

295
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,400
Is Jia Fang asleep?

296
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,200
Yes, he is.

297
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,120
What's that sigh about?

298
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,800
I just think happiness came so suddenly.

299
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,560
I don't want to let it go.

300
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,840
Why did you say so?

301
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,560
I'm looking forward to Ximi's arrival

302
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,040
and also afraid.

303
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,840
On the day he actually comes,

304
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,560
we'll be getting divorced.

305
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,400
When shall we finish the divorce process?

306
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,840
After the child is born

307
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,400
or Anna is back?

308
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,400
When will Anna come back?

309
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,480
Can I still

310
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,480
spend time with Ximi in the future?

311
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,120
What if suddenly I want to see him?

312
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,000
Come right away.

313
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,720
What if I want to see him every week?

314
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,480
Come.

315
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,160
What if I want to see him every day?

316
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,800
Come.

317
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,960
What if I want to see him when
I just saw him in the morning?

00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,120
You're awake, too.

375
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,880
Breakfast.

376
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,680
Jiaxin, your mom came back last night.

377
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,960
You were sound asleep so
she didn't wake you up.

378
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,880
I'll go to see her.

379
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,760
No.

380
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,680
She said she was tired and needed to sleep.

381
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,240
She wants you two to return
to Shanghai after breakfast.

382
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,480
Brush your teeth first. Quick.

383
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,600
What?

384
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,120
They're back?

385
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,880
Yes.

386
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,600
Xiyi, why didn't you stay longer?

387
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,960
You came back so early.

388
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,480
I need to do something so we came back today.

389
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,480
Let me handle your suitcase.

390
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,720
Oh, Xiyi,

391
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,600
my mom will take care of your luggage.

392
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,840
Let's go to the company together. Come on.

393
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,360
I'll change first. I haven't
changed for two days.

394
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,040
Xiyi, Xiyi, what do you want to wear?

395
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,880
I'll get them for you.

396
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,680
White ones or black ones?

397
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,440
Xiyi, you have many things
to deal with in the company.

398
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,520
Let's go right now.

399
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
What's wrong with you two today?

400
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,200
I'll go and change myself.

401
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
You silly boy, how did
you put on your clothes?

402
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,200
Mom, it's dirty here.

403
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,080
Aunt,

404
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
where's the original photo?

405
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,840
The original photo...

406
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,600
I watched a TV program

407
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
and I learned that photos

408
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,440
of babies were good for pregnant people.

409
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,240
So Mrs. Chen, your mom, and I...

410
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
we found a photo.

411
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,840
Look at that chubby boy. He's just perfect.

412
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,280
It's a nice sight, isn't it?

413
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,720
Pregnant people must be in a good mood

414
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,080
to be in good health, right?

415
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,280
So this is good for your health, isn't it?

416
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,120
Yes, Mom, yes.

417
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,240
But at this moment,

418
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,400
I'm standing in your room

419
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,720
and I realized that my
daughter had lied to me.

420
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,760
I don't want to scold her

421
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,120
or tell her I found out about it.

422
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,560
I know she told those lies because she cares

423
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,080
about you and wants to protect you very much.

424
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,120
Is the original photo still here?

425
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,280
Why don't we put it back there?

426
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,720
That's not necessary.

427
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,040
It's good for pregnant people.
We can keep it here.

428
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,360
Mom, let's go.

429
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,680
Zhengren,

430
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,040
just now your cousin's...

431
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,240
smile.

432
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,160
What did it mean?

433
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,160
He's... he's...

434
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,120
he's not... No.

435
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,200
"That's not necessary".
What did he mean by that?

436
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,720
Does he want to get even with us later

437
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,480
or look down on us?

438
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,720
What did he mean?

439
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,800
Mom, he wasn't sneering.

440
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,480
But I think

441
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,800
he'll get even with us later.

442
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,120
Grandma.

443
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,600
Grandma.

444
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,320
I'm back.

445
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,440
Grandma.

446
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,400
Grandma, why didn't you
tell me you were coming back?

447
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,240
I could have picked you up.

448
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Then I wouldn't have had
the fun of surprising you.

449
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,000
I'll handle your luggage.

450
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,800
Okay, okay.

451
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,720
We'll talk later. Go on with your breakfast.

452
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,160
Okay.

453
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,560
Come.

454
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,320
What do you think of the noodles?

455
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,920
Pretty nice. They're
thick noodles that I like.

456
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,640
Aunt, you're simply an awesome cook.

457
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,360
What about your room?

458
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,880
Isn't it particularly comfortable now?

459
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,520
Yes.

460
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,800
The photo, photo.

461
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,200
My mom risked her life
to take it down for you.

462
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,080
To be honest,

463
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,440
if my girlfriend makes me

464
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,720
see her ex-boyfriend's photo every day,

465
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
I definitely won't be able to stand it.

466
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,080
Me, neither.

467
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,960
Aunt, thank you.

468
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,080
I'll be lying if I say I wasn't stressed.

469
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,480
Anyway,

470
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,280
thank you.

471
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,320
Alright, don't thank me.

472
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,720
Thank your mom if you want to.

473
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,160
Come on, have a seat.

474
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,040
I really can't stand

475
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
the thing in Jiaxin's room.

476
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
What is it?

477
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,240
The photo.

478
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,240
What's wrong with the photo?

479
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,120
Isn't it good there?

480
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,560
His ex's photo is hung in their bedroom.

481
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,960
It's so inauspicious.

482
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,560
Let's change it.

483
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,400
Change that photo? No, no, no.

484
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,320
That's... that's especially precious to Xiyi.

485
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,480
You want me to change it?
I dare not. I dare not.

486
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,080
I've ruined that photo.

487
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,240
It's not the same even if we hang it up again.

488
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,720
Besides, Jiaxin is pregnant now.

489
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,120
She's pregnant with Xiyi's child,

490
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,120
but she has to see a photo

491
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,000
of her husband's ex every day.

492
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,680
You're also a mom.

493
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,040
Help Jiaxin, will you?

494
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,560
I...

495
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,280
Don't cry. Fine, fine, fine.

496
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,440
I'll do it. I'll do it.

497
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,320
Jiaxin is a nice person

498
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,040
and I also feel sorry for her.

499
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,680
All right, stop crying.

500
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,400
Hello.

501
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,640
Mom.

502
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,720
Jiaxin.

503
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,720
That day

504
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,600
Zishan said

505
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,160
you were resting and didn't
want us to disturb you.

506
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,480
How was it? Did you have a good one?

507
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,720
Did you open the noodle stand today?

508
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,760
Of course.

509
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,520
I need to earn my living.

510
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,960
I should have gone to help
you before I came back

511
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,760
and eaten a bowl of noodles.

512
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,440
Alright, alright,

513
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,720
you just need to take care of yourself.

514
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,600
Mom,

515
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,760
thank you.

516
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,080
What?

517
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,120
I like

518
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,840
that photo very much.

519
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,680
That's great, then.

520
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,640
Jiaxin,

521
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,160
you're far away in Shanghai.

522
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,880
That's all I can do for you.

523
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,520
Listen, if anyone's hurting you,

524
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,680
you must tell me. Don't endure it yourself.

525
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,280
Understood?

526
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm okay.

527
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,360
Everything's fine.

528
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,400
Don't lie to me!

529
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,160
What's the matter, Mom?

530
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,880
Did you cry?

531
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,640
I'm okay.

532
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,560
I'm just afraid you won't
tell me when you suffer.

533
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,640
Anyway, you must let Wang Xiyi know

534
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,600
that my daughter is not to be trifled with.

535
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,280
Got it?

536
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,480
Yes.

537
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,200
Xishi, you just went to Shanghai once.

538
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,440
But why has the taste changed already?

539
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,640
Quickly, taste the noodles.

540
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Something's missing.

541
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,760
Mom, get back to work.

542
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,400
I'll go to see you later.

543
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,160
Mm,

544
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,680
bye.

545
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,840
Taste them. Taste them.

546
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,600
Hey,

547
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,320
Xishi,

548
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,120
are you out of your senses?

549
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,360
Jiaxin married such a rich man.

550
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,440
You can just close your noodle stand,

551
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,680
go home and retire.

552
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,720
Really, how am I supposed to eat the noodles?

553
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,200
I'm closing.

554
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,720
The noodles

555
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,040
are on the house.

556
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,040
You don't have to pay.
Off you go. Go, all of you.

557
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,600
Go. I'm closing.

558
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,200
Stop eating. I'm closing.

559
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,200
What's wrong with her? So mysterious.

560
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,320
Crazy woman.

561
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,880
How ridiculous.

562
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,920
Chen Jiaxin,

563
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,040
you always stay silent.

564
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,000
How can I stop worrying?

565
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,360
After careful selection,

566
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,640
photos on the screen were chosen.

567
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,560
What do you think? Is this cute?

568
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,160
Not good.

569
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,240
This has a bright smile.

570
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,720
No.

571
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,160
This baby's eyes are big as mine.

572
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,880
My eyes are small. Next.

573
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,640
Blue eyes.

574
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,240
Next.

575
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,200
This has got hair. This is good.

576
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,280
This one?

577
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,040
How about this, Mr. Yi?

578
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,640
Tell me what kind of baby you want.

579
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,960
I do know an ideal one here.

580
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,520
What?

581
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,400
Let me show you.

582
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,360
A chubby boy on Huaniao Island.

583
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,200
I think he's good.

584
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,280
I can ask Zhengren to contact his parents.

585
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,640
But the Marketing Dept. said

586
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,800
a mixed-race baby would
help to give a foreign flavor.

587
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,400
Why a foreign flavor? We need a Chinese one.

588
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,840
We're a Chinese brand.

589
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,600
Of course we should have a Chinese baby.

590
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,800
Right. You're the boss. You decide.

591
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,640
Okay, I'll go to see Mr. Wang now.

592
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,280
Many foreigners don't know Chinese characters

593
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,880
and have funny tattoos on their bodies.

594
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,520
I once met a foreigner

595
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,560
and he had the word "poor"
tattooed on his arm.

596
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,600
Is it true?

597
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,200
-Yes.
-I read it on Weibo

598
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,480
that a foreigner had the word

599
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,320
"idiot" tattooed on his chest.

600
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,440
He was basking by the sea and photographed.

601
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,080
It's completely different than I imagined.

602
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,960
Jiaxin,

603
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,920
if you get a chance, you must go to Europe.

604
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,680
It's really beautiful.

605
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,160
Mm.

606
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,000
Why are you here again?

607
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,200
Charity auction.

608
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
So good at finding things to do.

609
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,920
You interrupted us again.

610
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,640
What's the theme of the
auction you just talked about?

611
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,000
As I told Jiaxin before,
I was looking for my sister.

612
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,080
Because of that,

613
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,880
I met many charities.

614
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,720
So from time to time, I'll help

615
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,040
welfare services to hold charity auctions

616
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,040
and I hope

617
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,240
it'll help people like my sister.

618
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,160
Can I be of help, too?

619
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,000
Of course you can help.

620
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,720
Take things I want to auction

621
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,800
and attend the auction with Xiyi.

622
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,880
Me?

623
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,600
-Why?
-Why?

624
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,280
Why don't you go

625
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,360
with Xiyi, Grandma?

626
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,080
I just came back from Europe

627
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,680
and I'm still suffering from jet leg.

628
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,080
You asked me to go there.

629
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,640
Do you still care

630
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,480
about this old lady or not?

631
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,320
My bad. My bad.

632
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,320
Well,

633
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,200
how about

634
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,240
Anson goes with Xiyi?

635
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,680
Anson disguises himself as a woman?

636
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,000
How about Xiyi going alone?

637
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,360
Chen Jiaxin,

638
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,880
why don't you want to go with me?

639
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,280
Shouldn't we keep quiet

640
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
about the relationship between us?

641
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,040
I...

642
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:04,880
Jiaxin,

643
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,000
aren't you interested in art?

644
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,680
It's a good chance for you to learn about it.

645
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,120
You reminded me of something.

646
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,440
I've got something for you.

647
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,480
For me?

648
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,520
This is for you.

649
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,840
The sun.

650
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,560
Yes.

651
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,360
You're like the sun

652
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,160
and warm everyone,

653
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,680
such as Grandma, me

654
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,520
and kids from the welfare services.

655
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,760
I like this gift.

656
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,000
Looks like

657
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,320
only I can take you.

658
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,760
I must be worthy of your gift.

659
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,720
I will take you.

660
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,440
Grandma asked me to.

661
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,600
Of course I need to take you there.

662
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,240
You seem to be a bit reluctant.

663
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,400
I am not.

664
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,920
Are you thinking about the auction?

665
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,000
Yes, Aunt.

666
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,480
I have only seen

667
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,160
other people attending auctions

668
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,840
on TV and in magazines.

669
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,720
Now it's my turn to prepare for one

670
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,400
but I completely don't know what to do.

671
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,080
Mm.

672
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,920
I knew you'd be at a loss.

673
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,880
Come. Come with me.

674
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,880
This box is the heirloom of the Wang family.

675
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,720
Things in it are your grandma's
and Xiyi's treasures.

676
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,240
This shows she really
considers you as a relation

677
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,200
and one that's very cherished.

678
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,880
I'm a Wang

679
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,320
but I'm no different than an outsider.

680
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,480
Alright,

681
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,840
choose one.

682
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,000
None of them will fail you.

683
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,920
But these are so valuable.

684
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,200
Can I really auction them?

685
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,200
They're not as valuable as you think

686
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,760
but these things are quite significant.

687
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,920
Look at this.

688
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,520
This brooch is

689
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,520
your grandma's wedding gift for Xiyi's mom

690
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,120
when she married his dad.

691
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,760
Is it pretty?

692
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,920
Yes.

693
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,360
Oh, this.

694
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,880
This is the wordless tally I gave Xiyi

695
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,120
when he was born.

696
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,880
He has been a man now.

697
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,240
This one.

698
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,880
This is the first necklace

699
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,560
Xiyi saved up to buy for his mom.

700
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,240
Is it pretty?

701
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,520
Yes.

702
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,040
This pen is still here.

703
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,760
My brother gave it to Xiyi when he went

704
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,880
to elementary school.

705
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,280
I remember it was with this pen

706
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,520
that my brother held Xiyi's hand

707
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,600
and taught him to write

708
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,320
one stroke after another.

709
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,560
So Xiyi had always treasured it.

710
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,120
He even signed his first contract

711
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,600
with it after he started to
work for the company.

712
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,840
Later it was broken and couldn't
be repaired anywhere.

713
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,600
I thought he had thrown it away.

714
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,560
I didn't expect he'd still be keeping it.

715
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,240
Aunt, can I have a look at it?

716
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,120
My brother didn't waste his love on Xiyi.

717
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,160
He's a capable, aspiring and grateful man.

718
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,440
