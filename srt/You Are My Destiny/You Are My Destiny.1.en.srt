=You Are My Destiny=

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,940
(Episode 1)

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,760
This is a modern first-tier city
with a population of 24 million.

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,600
This is an era when you
can order takeout food,

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,480
book a taxi,

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,320
pay a bill,

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,960
and report work with your mobile phone.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,160
It takes only a few seconds to send messages.

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,120
But the more convenient our communication is,

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,960
the more distanced we are from others

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
because of mobile phones.

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,840
So, some people

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,800
insist on living a slow-paced life

39
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,120
and refuse to evolve.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,920
Sorry.

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,280
Excuse me.

42
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,020
Sorry.

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
Could you please push the button
for the 18th floor?

44
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,200
Alas. You scraped your bag on my face.

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,480
Sorry.

46
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,360
Here is the 18th floor.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,880
Excuse me.

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,160
Chen Jiaxin.

49
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,080
Oh. Yuwei.

50
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,600
Pan-Fried Pork Buns for you.

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
It's cold. It must taste bad.

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,480
I don't need it. Keep it for yourself.

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
To eat or not to eat, it's up to you,

54
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,360
but please pay for it.

55
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
You asked Jiaxin to get it for you.

56
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
You must pay for it even if you don't eat.

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,440
Stop taking advantage of her.

58
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,040
If you don't pay,

59
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,400
I'll post it in the company's WeChat group

60
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
and ask others to be judges.

61
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,000
Anyway, it's full of

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,440
skilled debaters.

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,960
Let's go.

64
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,600
You need to stop being a people pleaser,

65
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,760
or you'll get yourself into big trouble.

66
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,440
Chen Jiaxin,

67
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,400
where is my spaghetti?

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,440
Sorry. Sorry.

69
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,440
I'll give it to her first.

70
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,360
Hurry. I'm starving.

71
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,560
Take it to the Finance Office.

72
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,240
Okay. Got it.

73
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,280
This is your spaghetti.

74
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,760
-Copy it right now.
-Chen Jiaxin.

75
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,080
Sorry.

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,640
Mr. Shen will appear in court
this Friday in this suit.

77
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,520
Take it to the dry cleaners.

78
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,080
(Keep Fighting)

79
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm Chen Jiaxin, an administrative assistant.

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,720
The HR specialist told me

81
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
the most important thing for
an administrative assistant

82
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,520
was to complete every assigned task.

83
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,560
I need to do all kinds of things:

84
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,560
what others don't want to do,

85
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,760
what they can't finish in time,

86
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,840
what they can't be bothered to do,

87
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,120
and what they have no time to do.

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,120
All that is my job.

89
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,280
Every day, I'm as busy as a bee,

90
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,280
but when I complete

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,200
one thing after another
written on sticky notes

92
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,360
to help my colleagues out,

93
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,480
it gives me a sense of achievement,

94
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,200
like defeating enemies and coming
to a higher level in a video game.

95
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,440
Besides,

96
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,440
I have to say I do get something.

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,560
Chen Jiaxin.

98
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,640
I've told you numerous times.

99
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,080
I don't have time to look
at these sticky notes.

100
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,920
Make sure you send me

101
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,240
an electronic form of the contract
before you get off work.

102
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,640
But sometimes,

103
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,560
I also think I'm like a sticky note,

104
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,240
which is helpful, but unnecessary
and therefore easy to throw away.

105
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,120
No matter how important I was,

106
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,240
once I'm of no help anymore,

107
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,840
I'll end up in here.

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,720
What's going on?

109
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,680
Uncomfortable? Try to
make yourself comfortable.

110
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,920
Look. Fellow villagers.

111
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,280
This is our headquarters.

112
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,760
Feel free to do anything.

113
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,240
Make yourself at home.

114
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,400
Give him money.

115
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,280
Everybody.

116
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,360
Everybody.

117
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,160
We're working.

118
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,480
Can you please turn down your voice?

119
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,560
Pay a visit in order. Okay?

120
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,360
Stop it.

121
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,680
Well.

122
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,120
We're senior employees of Cheng Jie Group.

123
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,720
(Heritage Tour Group of Huaniao Island)
This is our home.

124
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
You've taken rice and noodles here.
And you're playing cards.

125
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,840
I can't believe you've taken quilts.

126
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
How could we be efficient at work

127
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,200
with you here?

128
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,920
It's more like home in this way.

129
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,280
You're bothering us.

130
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,200
You can't do this in an office.

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,640
Oh no.

132
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,240
Damn.

133
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,880
Can you be more reasonable?

134
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,720
Hello?

135
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,640
Mr. Yi,

136
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,840
factory workers on Huaniao Island
are making trouble here.

137
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,760
They wouldn't go.

138
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,240
It seems they want to push
you to talk with them.

139
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:01,840
I think

140
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
you'd better avoid meeting them.
I'll take care of this.

141
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,400
Got it.

142
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,400
Leave it to me.

143
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,140
What?

144
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,600
Why isn't that appropriate?

145
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay.

146
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,960
I'll leave it to you. Please hurry up.

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,560
We can't hold on anymore.

148
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,640
Where do you most want to visit?

149
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,200
Mr. Yi's office.

150
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,880
Show us the way.

151
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,520
Yeah. We've told you.

152
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,240
Stop it.

153
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,720
I can't hear anything once you speak.

154
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,520
Where is Mr. Yi's office?

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,880
Okay.

171
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,440
You've replaced us with robots

172
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320
and you're cutting our salaries.

173
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,240
What do you want to do?

174
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,400
Besides,

175
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,160
we're diligent and responsible.

176
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,000
It's not easy to get employees like us.

177
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,520
-Am I right?
-Exactly.

178
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,280
It's not easy.

179
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,200
A mechanical arm

180
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,920
can make 30 soaps in a minute.

181
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,800
Which of you can do that?

(Heritage Tour Group of Huaniao Island)

183
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,840
It's unconvincing.

184
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,000
Mr. Jia,

185
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,560
once I mention where robots
do better than you,

186
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,280
you'll remain silent.

187
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,000
Your self-confidence

188
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
is just like a share price,

189
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,740
which keeps changing.

190
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,160
Stop pretending to be reasonable.

191
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,440
In your mind,

192
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
compared with robots,

193
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,280
factory workers who can be tired and hungry

194
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,640
have long been worthless.

195
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,160
Right?

196
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,200
The headquarters

197
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,280
had suggested

198
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,280
the factory on Huaniao Island

199
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
should be transformed long before.

200
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,320
Have any of you

201
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,120
proposed any plans?

202
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
It's not proposed by us.

203
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,480
If it's transformed into a tourism project,

204
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,280
do you think

205
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,640
tourists prefer

206
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,720
to listen to stories told by senior employees

207
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,360
or by robots?

208
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,680
Besides, if we offer courses

209
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
on how to make handmade soap,

210
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,040
do you think tourists prefer

211
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,480
to learn from humans or robots?

212
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,240
That's all your advantages,

213
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,520
but all you know

214
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,640
is to complain that I made you jobless.

215
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,120
Did any of you submit any proposal?

216
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,840
Even robots

217
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,240
will be replaced or upgraded,

218
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,600
but you want to make money with
something you learned at 17

219
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,400
when you're 70.

220
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
If I were you,

221
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,920
I wouldn't be in a hurry

222
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,800
to negotiate with my boss.

223
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,720
Instead, I'd show him

224
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,880
my value at work

225
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,600
and stop being angry without reason.

226
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,160
Alright.

227
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,880
Time is up.

228
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,960
If you keep staying here,

229
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
I'll let security guards come here.

Mr. Jia,

232
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,040
shall we

233
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,720
go back and think about those two plans?

234
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,920
If we go back late,

235
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,760
we may miss the last boat.

236
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,840
I must go.

237
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,080
Mr. Jia,

238
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,440
my wife just called

239
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
and said she had a stomachache.

240
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm leaving.

241

Hey. Are you all leaving?

a further thought.

Fine.

You're really a negotiation expert.

253
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,480
I've heard what you said.

254
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
But there is something I don't understand.

255
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,480
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

256

We had decided to make
the factory fully automated.

257

hadn't overridden all objections

and fought for an opportunity for them.

259

All of them must have been
laid off without you.

Your grandpa

286
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,520
had two siblings.

287

Your dad

288
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,080
still had one younger sister.

Once I mention your marriage,

298
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,920
you'll turn aside from the topic.

299
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,320
Tell me the truth.

300
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,560

Now that you're tired of watching it,

319
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,840
of course I've been tired of playing it.

320
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,320
If you listen to me and get married,

321
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,760
I won't need to do this again.

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,360
Waiting for his girlfriend is
what a good man should do.

342
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,360
So,

343
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,840
what can I do to make it up for you?

344
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,960
How about

345
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,640
like this?

346
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,120
Let's go to my home

347
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
and I'll cook for you.

348
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,440
I still have

349
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,280
a bottle of good wine.

350
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,760
We can have a drink.

351
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,560
Then you can

352
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,520
stay at my home tonight.

353
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,200
Okay?

354
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,040
But...

355
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,920
But my mom warned me again and again

356
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,880
that before getting married,

357
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,760
a girl should be self-possessed and never...

358
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,080
... never stay overnight at a man's home.

359
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,240
If you're reluctant, I won't push you.

360
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,360
Do you want to embrace happiness?

361
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,720
(Aurora)

362
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,680
Costa Cruises

363
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,760
will help you end your days
as a single person.

364
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,320
Give yourself some courage

365
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,360
to pursue your dream vacation
you've been longing for.

366
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,000
Don't be afraid.

367
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,120
Imagine you and the right one for you

368
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,840
have a wonderful romantic journey at sea.

369
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Be impulsive

370
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,400
and all this will be at your fingertips.

371
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,760
Costa Cruises will take you
to the fantastic city of Venice.

372
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,280
Welcome aboard!

373
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,280
Courage

374
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,560
and impulse?

375
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,600
Jiaxin,

376
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,880
I think we'd better...

377
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
We'd better

378
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,280
go on a journey on a cruise ship.

379
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,040
No work. No others.

380
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,640
Just

381
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,160
you and me.

382
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,880
A cruise ship?

383
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,120
Jiaxin, you know,

384
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,480
I've put all my money

385
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,200
in the stock market.

386
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,920
I really have no...

387
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,080
It doesn't matter.

388
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,280
Some bank clerk came to our office

389
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,880
and promoted their credit cards last week.

390
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,840
I've got a new one.

391
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,160
This time,

392
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,640
it's on me.

393
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,640
Really?

394
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,680
That'd be great.

395
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,360
I can imagine that

396
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,040
we stay in a VIP suite

397
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,120
on the cruise ship,

398
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,040
drinking champagne while watching sunrise.

399
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,720
V...

400
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,240
V...

401
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,320
VIP Suite?

402
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,360
It must be expensive.

403
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,240
Alas.

404
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,600
You silly girl.

405
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,800
Be nice to yourself

406
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,840
now that you're there for fun.

407
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,560
I can imagine

408
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,720
this will be

409
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,640
a romantic

410
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
and perfect journey.

411
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Cruise ship.

412
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,480
V... I... P...

413
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,440
So beautiful. So sweet.

414
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,520
The flowers are for you.

415
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,960
Best wishes for a successful
performance tomorrow,

416
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,800
my most beautiful white swan.

417
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,560
Anson.

418
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,200
Preside over the meeting for me.

419
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,400
Me?

420
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,500
Yes. You.

421
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,360
Hello?

422
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,000
Are you busy?

423
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,040
No.

424
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,000
Xiyi, you're so resourceful.

425
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,800
No matter where I give a performance,

426
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,080
I can receive flowers from you in time.

427
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,020
Are they beautiful?

428
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,220
Do you like them?

429
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,060
Yes,

430
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,760
I do.

431
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,880
But the premiere is tomorrow.

432
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,280
You sent me flowers when it was in rehearsal.

433
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,920
Don't you think it's a waste?

434
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
I can't go to watch

435
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,200
each of your performances at the scene,

436
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,600
but you must remember

437
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,160
I'm your No. 1 fan

438
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,840
and your supporter.

439
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,880
When will you come back?

440
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,880
At the end of this month.

441
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,720
I'll stay for about half a month.

442
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,160
It happens that I'll have an audition.

443
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,280
How about spending some time

444
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,360
with my grandma by then?

445
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,040
Okay.

446
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,480
No problem.

447
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,720
How is she doing?

448
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,760
She's great,

449
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,560
except that

450
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,920
she pushes me to go on blind dates every day.

451
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,800
Xiyi,

452
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,960
as you know,

453
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,480
I can't do that for now.

454
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,880
I know.

455
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,080
I'll wait for you

456
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,800
till the day you fulfill your dream.

457
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:31,880
Hmm.

458
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,200
Okay.

459
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,640
Then,

460
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,380
good night.

461
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,220
(Bank of China)

462
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,720
I've never seen anyone

463
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,840
who's more hypocritical than you.

464
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,720
Me? Hypocritical?

465
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,320
Exactly.

466
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,280
Obviously, you don't want Anna

467
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,600
to give performances around the world,

468
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,680
but you send her flowers
no matter where she is

469
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,760
as her No. 1 fan.

470
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,600
You want her to marry you as soon as possible,
but you said you'd wait for her.

471
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,840
Mr. Yi,

472
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,800
you can determine products
for the next quarter

473
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,960
in three minutes,

474
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,480
persuade factory workers in five minutes,

475
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,360
and destroy blind dates arranged
by your grandma in 10 minutes.

476
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,480
Why can't you find a way out

477
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,680
to persuade Anna to marry you?

478
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,680
You just need to get a diamond ring.

479
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,160
What if she refuses me?

480
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,080
It's not humiliating to be refused.

481
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,040
Besides,

482
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,720
we can try to improve the success rate.

483
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,640
How?

484
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,680
(Good Time at Sea)

485
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,320
You need some impulse to obtain happiness.

486
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,040
Anna is coming back, right?

487
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,480
So, all you need

488
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,320
is a romantic journey on a cruise ship.

489
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:43,760
Cruise ship?

490
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,360
Exactly.

491
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,440
Just imagine.

492
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,760
You and Anna

493
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,040
have a romantic dinner on the cruise ship,

494
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,600
tell your feelings for each other
in the moonlight,

495
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,000
dance in a happy mood on the deck,

496
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,840
and exchange your vows
with the blessing of others.

497
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,640
And the grand climax arrives

498
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,880
when Anna says "I do".

499
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,120
The captain will be your wedding witness

500
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,800
and you'll get married there.

501
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,200
Then Anna won't be a white swan.

502
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,000
She'll be your wife and never leave you.

503
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,000
Wine.

504
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,200
Flowers.

505
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,640
Her beloved.

506
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,720
And a little bit courage and impulse.

507
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,640
I'm sure the success rate is 100%.

508
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,080
One of my friends made
his girlfriend say yes like that.

My happiness

514
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,240
depends on you.

515
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,780
(The fantasy voyage of Venice is for you.)

516
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,060
(Welcome on board. You'll enjoy a dreamy trip
in the Italian style cruise ship.)

517
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,040
Anna,

518
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,360
I'm sure to make you say yes
and stay forever this time.

519
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,920
Hello?

520
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,040
Don't be late.

521
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,120
I'm looking forward to meeting you.

522
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,560
I'm ready.

523
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,920
Great. Perfect.

524
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,360
Your performance is impeccable. Amazing.

525
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,120
Thank you.

526
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,260
Miss Anna,

527
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,280
there is a ticket for
today's training in Paris

528
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,460
and this is a contract
for our troop in Paris.

529
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,540
We're very honored to welcome you to join us

530
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,520
as our black swan.

531
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,560
I'm very sorry. As I said,

532
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,920
I hope to be the Odette.

533
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,240
As I said,

534
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,720
no one from the East has ever played Odette

535
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,280
in the Paris Opera.

536
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,280
Miss Anna, there is no one from the East

537
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,000
has ever played Odette

538
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,560
in the Paris Opera before.

539
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,120
Maybe we'll let you play Odile.

540
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,400
Xiyi, why are you here?

541
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,360
I think she's right.

542
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,360
Do you want to think about it?

543
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,480
After all,

544
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,440
performing in the Paris Opera
has been your dream.

545
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:03,960
No.

546
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,240
I won't go without being Odette.

547
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,520
Compared with playing
a supporting role in Paris,

548
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,840
I'd rather be the permanent
white swan in your mind.

549
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,720
Sorry.

550
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,840
It seems I'm going to take away your Odile.

551
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,040
Thank you.

552
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,820
(We will embrace new opportunities in Shanghai
to stimulate new drivers of vision.)

553
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,080
Can we still catch the cruise ship?

554
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,000
Sure.

555
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,920
But

556
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,480
you've given up the chance of going to Paris.

557
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,400
Will you...

558
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,080
Alas. I'm just thinking about
taking a holiday with you.

559
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,480
As for other matters,

560
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,480
I'll put them aside.

561
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,760
Stop showing off your love, okay?

562
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,280
I'm still single.

563
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,800
Get on, or we'll be late.

564

(No. 3 Gate)

566
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,840
Wow. This is gorgeous.

567
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,280
Wow. Look at the sea over there.

(The Fantasy Voyage of Venice)

569
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
A ship like this.

570
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,480
The ship is so big.

571
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,440
Wow.

572
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,680
The ship is so big. Unbelievable.

573
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,080
What are you looking at?

574
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,080
Beautiful.

575
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,200
What's beautiful?

576
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,440
The ship is over there.

577
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,200

578

Alright.

Take it and let's go.

580
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,080
Hurry up.

581
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,120
Wait for me.

582
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
This is amazing. Terrific.

583

584
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,440
put our luggage in the room.

585

Oh. Okay.

586
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,680
Me alone?

587
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,240
I'll go look around

588
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,320
and see where we can get
delicious food and have fun.

589
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,360
I'll take you there after I get it arranged.

590
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,120
I'm leaving.

591
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,440

Stop chatting.

What did he say to you?

He asked us

to have a good time.

Okay.

615

You...

616
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,480
Sorry.

617

Where do you serve as a waitress?

618
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,880
Watch where you're walking.

619
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,120
I'm sorry.

621

I'm not...

622
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,920
Cut the crap.

623
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,560

Okay.

627
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,920
Instead of saying sorry
after soiling a guest's shirt,

628
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,920
you let her clean it up.

-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

639

Come on.

-I'm sorry.
-Don't run.

641

I'm sorry.

642

It's fine.

00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,480
Thank you.

644
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,000
No problem.

Thank you.

646

Go change your clothes.

647
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,720
It's stained with sauce.

648
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,960
It's hard to remove it.

649
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,520
Yeah.

650
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,600
I should have been more careful.

651
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,840
My mom just got it for me.

652
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,800
I hope it can be removed.

653
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,840
It's invisible now.

654
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,800
Thank you.

655
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,600
No problem.

Thank you.

657
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,240
It's okay.

658
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,640
Bye.

659
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,360
Bye.

660
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,440
What are you looking at?

661
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,200
It's all set.

662
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,720
Let's go.

663
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,240
This way.

664
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,880
Come in.

665
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,320
Wow.

666
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,480
What a big room.

667
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,120
Wow.

668
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,280
It's great!

669
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,600
Wow.

670
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,240
Wow.

671
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,160
The sea is so blue.

672
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,960
Wow. Amazing!

673
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,880
Xiyi, come have a look.

674
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,200
Do you like it?

675
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,520
Yes.

676
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,560
I wish I could hold you like this forever.

677
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,400
You're holding me.

678
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,960
At London Heathrow,

679
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,280
you stood me up five times.

680
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,120
At Heroes' Square, it was three times.

681
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,040
In Moscow...

682
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Now can we call it even?

683
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,800
You want to call it even with one kiss?

684
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,280
You stood me up 11 times.

685
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,920
I'm not a guy

686
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,600
who can be pleased easily.

687
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,480
Alright.

688
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,840
I'll make it up for you during the journey.

689
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,760
But before that,

690
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,760
can I have something to eat?

691
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,960
After auditioning this morning,

692
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
I'm so hungry.

693
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,000
Wait for me.

694
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,440
Wait here. It'll be ready soon.

695
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,760
Xiyi.

696
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,120
Thank you.

697
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,360
Wait for me.

698
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,160
Hello?

699
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,160
My graceful lady,

700
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,720
I've changed my mind.

701
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,000
Come over.

702
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,880
You've got the role of the white swan.

703
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,360
What?

704
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,320
I've changed my mind.

705
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,320
Your charming dance skills
and the confident face

706
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,920
completely convinced me.

707
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,520
You're definitely the best choice.

708
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,240
If you can fly to Paris
right now for training,

709
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,720
the role of the white swan is yours.

710
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,480
This is your only chance.

711
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,640
And it depends on whether you can catch it.

712
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,120
Luckily, it's removed.

713
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,200
It's my first time to wear it.

714
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,160
It'd be a waste to throw it away.

715
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,800
Good luck, Chen Jiaxin.

716
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,280
As long as you're a little bit braver,

717
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,120
you'll embrace happiness.

718
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,640
Where is Gu Chi?

719
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,120
I need to find him right now.

720
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,440
It turns out

721
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,480
she stays in the opposite.

722
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,320
So I'm happy to prove your marriage.

723
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,400
And this will be also my honor

724
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,840
and also a good thing for the ship.

725
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,720
Captain, thanks for your support.

726
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,040
The lady wearing this ring

727
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,320
is my marriage partner.

728
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,080
Wow.

729
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,360
So, is your wedding vow ready?

730
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,820
I believe you will bring guys

731
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,200
a very sincere romantic night.

732
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
I'll let everyone hear my heart.

733
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,320
Good luck to you two.

734
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,040
Thanks.

735
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,120
Hi, Anna.

736
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,440
In the future,

737
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,720
I won't stop you dancing again,

738
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,280
or push you to give birth to a baby,

739
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,640
or allow my grandma
to interfere in your life.

740
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,960
If you feel the same way as me,

741
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,080
let's...

742
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,360
No.

743
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,880
Anna.

744
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,920
Since the first time I met you,

745
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,880
I've wanted to marry you.

746
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,400
I won't stop you dancing again,

747
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,000
or interfere in your life,

748
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,600
or push you to give birth to a baby.

749
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,520
If you feel the same way,

750
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,200
let's...

751
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,000
Let's...

752
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
You have nowhere to go.

753
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,320
My ring.

754
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,120
Pick it up for me.

755
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,440
Pick it up.

756
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,520
Sorry.

757
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,560
Kids, be careful.

758
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,760
Why did you kick it?

759
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,200
Here.

760
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,680
Hurry.

761
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,520
Here.

762
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,560
Hey.

763
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,360
Hey.

764
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,920
Be careful not to fall down.

765
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,680
Pull me.

766
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,480
Hey.

767
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,240
Stop trying. Leave it to me.

768
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,640
Pull me. I'll reach it.

769
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,240
Let me do it.

770
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,240
It's almost there. Hurry.

771
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,400
Hurry.

772
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,400
That is your wedding ring.

773
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,520
Are you always a busybody?

774
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,880
Leave it to me.

775
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,760
I'll do it.

776
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
Loosen a little more.

777
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,120
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

778
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,160
Weird.

779
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Why can't I get through?

780
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,160
Wake up.

781
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,040
Hey.

782
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,400
Wake up.

783
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,520
Sorry.

784
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,200
Do you really think

785
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,440
you can get the ring out of the pool

786
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,640
if you jump in?

787
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Lost and found.

788
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,480
It's a good omen.

789
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:41,840
Here you are.

790
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,360
I hope it's a successful proposal

791
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,000
and she'll marry you.

792
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,200
Thank you.

793
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,760
Why are you following me?

794
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,120
(Please do not cross the line)

795
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,400
I...

796
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,640
My room is over there.

797
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,120
Why are you following me?

798
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,240
My room is also over there.

799
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,380
You stay in that room?

800
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,880
It turns out that beautiful girl

801
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,840
is the one he'll propose to.

802
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,920
Great taste.

803
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,920
A leggy beauty.

804
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,440
Anna.

805
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,200
Anna.

806
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,400
Forget about it.

807
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,120
We're both women.

808
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,760
She has a pretty face and a great figure,

809
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,120
but I...

810
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,040
Forget about it.

811
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,320
Stop troubling myself.

812
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,680
It was bought just half a year ago.

813
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,240
