25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,940
(Episode 23)

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,800
Did she really stay and eat with her?

27
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,240
Jiaxin, is that your phone?

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,280
You've got a message.

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,120
Oh.

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,440
I'm waiting for you downstairs.

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,040
Don't wait for me.

32
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
Go home first.

33
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,720
Finished.

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,880
I'm so full.

35
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,160
Jiaxin,

36
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,560
the soup you made was so nice.

37
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,000
I drank all of it.

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,000
I've been filled with happiness.

39
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,840
Actually

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,760
it's nothing.

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,800
I just use

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,320
better ingredients for the health

43
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,880
of people who'll eat things I make.

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,680
You're really amazing.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,400
You work even though you're pregnant.

46
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,360
By the way,

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,600
how long have you been pregnant?

48
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,320
More than four months.

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,560
I'm so envious of you.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,400
Did you see my poster?

51
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,840
Mm.

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,080
You look beautiful.

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,800
People can always

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,320
see that I'm beautiful.

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,880
Actually in order to dance,

56
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,160
I have to stand on my toes for a long time

57
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,560
and my feet in the dance shoes
can't be seen at all.

58
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,960
Also, I have to be on a long-term diet

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,520
and my period is especially irregular.

60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,880
It'll be hard for me
to get pregnant in the future.

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,760
We all need to sacrifice

62
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,280
many things to realize our dreams.

63
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,480
So even though

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,880
I knew what my boyfriend's dream was,

65
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,280
over the years,

66
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,560
if he didn't say it,

67
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,200
I'd pretend not to know.

68
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,080
But actually

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,960
I'm also feeling bad.

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,280
Why?

71
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,080
Do you think only I am pretending?

72
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,840
My boyfriend is also pretending.

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,800
All these years,

74
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,920
he has allowed me maximum freedom.

75
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,120
He always waits for me

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,640
and lets me do anything I want.

77
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,000
He's really nice to you.

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,960
So

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm afraid I'll let him down.

80
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm afraid

81
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,120
I won't be able to have a child.

82
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,600
But

83
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,880
I don't mind adopting one.

84
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,320
What's the matter?

85
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,920
Nothing.

86
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,200
I just think

87
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,040
it's really hard

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,200
to be nice to other people's

89
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,360
child selflessly.

90
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,040
I understand your doubt

91
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,120
because

92
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,640
I was also adopted.

93
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,040
Let's talk about you.

94
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,280
You're so cute.

95
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,040
Why did your husband let you work

96
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
when you're pregnant?

97
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,600
Mm,

98
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,560
he's

99
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,720
very nice to me.

100
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,600
He's so nice to me

101
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,480
that I felt guilty

102
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,400
and decided to work.

103
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,760
And how did you meet your husband?

104
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,160
I

105
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,360
got pregnant

106
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,600
accidentally.

107
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,680
So

108
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,520
actually,

109
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,040
it's nothing special.

110
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,400
You got married because of pregnancy?

111
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,480
Did you?

112
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,160
Don't be so shy.

113
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,960
You've got married

114
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,000
and

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,520
you cook so well.

116
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,280
Your husband was fortunate in marrying you.

117
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,840
Be confident.

118
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,160
How about you two?

119
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,000
How did you meet

120
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,360
your boyfriend?

121
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,040
Us?

122
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,520
Rock, scissors,

123
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,320
paper.

124
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,560
I won.

125
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,240
I'll eat first.

126
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
You take your time.

127
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,000
I wanna eat, too.

128
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,600
I wanna eat, too.

129
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Go on, then.

130
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,680
Okay, go on.

131
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
Let's do...

132
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,600
"Black and white match".

133
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,880
Miss Shi Anna.

134
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,680
What?

135
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,560
What a shame.

136
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,200
You're going on a diet soon.

137
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,640
These

138
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
can only be enjoyed after your tour.

139
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,840
What do you mean?

140
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Listen to me, everyone.

141
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,560
Dear Miss Shi Anna,

142
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,560
congratulations.

143
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,040
You won the part

144
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,360
of Giselle in this show.

145
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,880
The rehearsal time
has been sent to your e-mail.

146
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,560
Was I really chosen?

147
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,520
Guys,

148
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,200
I can finally tour abroad!

149
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,080
You're really a good dancer.

150
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,880
Jiaxin,

151
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
thanks for staying and having dinner with me.

152
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,120
Although

153
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
I just lost a little piece of my memory,

154
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,960
I've always felt unsettled

155
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,520
and thought that something's wrong.

156
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm a little afraid of being alone.

157
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,560
You can have this.

158
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,680
What's it?

159
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,640
It's not a common chip.

160
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,240
It'll bring you luck.

161
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,240
Luck.

162
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,960
You may think

163
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,280
I'm superstitious

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,040
but this chip

165
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,040
has helped me through a lot of difficulties.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,720
With its company,

167
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,240
I would feel secured.

168
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,320
Now I want to give it to you.

169
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,120
I hope this luck

170
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,560
can be shared with you.

171
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,400
May you

172
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,080
get well soon.

173
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,040
Okay,

174
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,920
thanks, then.

175
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,240
See you.

176
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,520
See you.

177
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,400
What are you thinking about?

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,320
Why are you still here?

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,760
I was worried.

180
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,680
Anna is so nice.

181
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,400
What should you worry about?

182
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Where's your car?

183
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,480
I had it driven home.

184
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,640
Let's

185
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,800
have a walk, then?

186
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,040
Mm.

187
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,040
Doctor Hao said

188
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,280
pregnant people needed to walk often.

189
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,320
Why were you at Anna's house?

190
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,120
Anna asked Anson

191
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,320
to tell me to cook.

192
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,560
I thought you knew.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,560
Me?

194
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,800
Didn't you know?

195
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,880
What has Anson done?

196
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't go there again.

197
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,640
I'll hire a cook for her.

198
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,880
It's okay.

199
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,360
It's no bother to prepare a few meals.

200
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,560
I don't want you to be exhausted.

201
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,080
Besides,

202
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,360
you're pregnant with Ximi.

203
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,960
I've never got a chance

204
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,840
to say sorry to Anna.

205
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,200
I know

206
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,320
this is ridiculous.

207
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,800
But I just can't pretend

208
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
that nothing has happened.

209
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Let me cook for her.

210
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,320
Then I'll feel better.

211
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,520
It's for my own sake.

212
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,280
Jiaxin,

213
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,000
you mustn't think like that.

214
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,600
Nothing

215
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,320
is your fault.

216
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,120
Anyway,

217
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
don't hire someone else

218
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,600
to cook for her.

219
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,760
So

220
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,080
what did you talk about with Anna?

221
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,400
Anna told me

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,080
how you met.

223
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,360
There are things

224
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,920
we both know we can't talk about

225
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,600
and avoided subconsciously,

226
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,240
as if by doing this,

227
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,200
we'll always be good

228
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,280
and we'll never fight.

229
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,000
I have been over you.

230
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,760
I didn't choose to bear with you

231
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,920
when you disappointed me again and again.

232
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,000
How I wish you didn't
get off the ship that day

233
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,400
but it has happened.

234
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,560
Let's stop hurting each other.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,560
I want to love someone
with an easy conscience.

236
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,400
I don't want my hesitation

237
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,560
to hurt

238
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,680
both of you and Jiaxin.

239
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,520
I'm sorry,

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,480
Anna.

241
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,440
The last item.

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,880
Thanks, Auntie.

243
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,120
Were these all bought by you?

244
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,360
It seems I've bought too many.

245
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,760
After your child is born,

246
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,840
he'll be like a banknote shredder.

247
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,680
You still have a lot to spend on.

248
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,640
By the way,

249
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,160
why did Xiyi let you organize these alone?

250
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,120
Doesn't he know
pregnant people can't be tired?

251
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,080
Really...

252
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,760
What are you doing?

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,400
Grandma.

254
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,520
Mom,

255
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,280
you've got to tell Xiyi off.

256
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,040
He let Jiaxin organize and move

257
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,000
these things alone.

258
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,080
No, Auntie.

259
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,040
Xiyi is busy.

260
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Don't always defend him.

261
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,320
I know

262
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,960
things in the company all need

263
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,880
to be decided by him

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,880
and he's indeed busy.

265
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,280
But this family and the child in your belly

266
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,280
are not just yours.

267
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,040
How could he let you organize these alone?

268
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,520
It's really shameful.

269
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,760
Let's help her out with this.

270
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,760
Your auntie will do the heavy work,

271
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,240
okay?

272
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,280
I'll handle it.

273
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,600
Let's do it together.

274
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,160
Come on.

275
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,080
The year-end party will be given tomorrow.

276
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,760
Remember to ask your son

277
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,480
to take Mrs. Chen here on time.

278
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,280
Oh, Mom,

279
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,520
don't worry about such a little thing.

280
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,680
I have told him a hundred times.

281
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,360
Ah,

282
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,720
this family photo was well taken.

283
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,720
Mom,

284
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,000
it's just the two of them.

285
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,840
Why can't I see it's a family photo?

286
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,840
Who says that?

287
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,080
This is a family photo.

288
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,760
The baby in Jiaxin's belly
was also photographed.

289
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,200
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

290
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,360
You're right.

291
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,880
It was really well taken.

292
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,880
Don't do this now.

293
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,160
Put up the fence first.

294
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,880
You're indeed my mom.

295
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm full of strength.

296
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
What shall we do, then?

297
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm old and she's pregnant.

298
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,000
Who can do it except you?

299
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,520
Oh... oh dear.

300
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,720
Baby sleep,

301
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,280
gently sleep.

302
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,480
Daddy...

303
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,040
This...

304
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,120
this is good.

305
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,920
My cold nephew

306
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,680
sings to quiet his child.

307
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,280
That time we went to
buy clothes for the baby.

308
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,440
He wanted to buy this once he saw it

309
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,320
and said he'd record a lullaby for Ximi.

310
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,640
Well,

311
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,440
it's really easy for him to be a dad.

312
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,160
Does he think

313
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,040
he can quiet his child by talking?

314
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,840
Of course not, Grandma.

315
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,280
This rocking horse

316
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,720
was prepared by him.

317
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,680
He said he'd assemble it

318
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,680
himself for our baby.

319
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,480
Oh,

320
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,000
there's one more thing.

321
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,000
It has been in my room for a long time.

322
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:11,920
Go.

323
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,040
Get it for me.

324
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,760
Two boxes that are this big.

325
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,240
Yes.

326
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,200
Aren't these

327
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,480
the dolls on the ship?

328
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,400
Mm.

329
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,760
Why are you having them?

330
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,920
When the cruise ship sent them here,

331
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,240
they said they were a wedding gift.

332
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,320
I thought they were sent to the wrong person.

333
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,960
It turned out that I was wrong.

334
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,600
Think about this.

335
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,960
These two dolls

336
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,160
and Ximi

337
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,720
are all souvenirs of your cruise.

338
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,840
So isn't it perfect when they're together?

339
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,920
Thanks, Grandma.

340
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,560
So these are

341
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,280
our presents for both of you.

342
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,640
And...

343
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,080
Thank you.

344
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
We wish you all the best.

345
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,760
Two accidents have happened

346
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,120
in the south-west factory within a month.

347
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,760
Tell its director.
I need to talk face to face with him.

348
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,120
And

349
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,320
I'm having a class with Jiaxin later.

350
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,440
Have the minutes taken

351
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,600
and send them to me.

352
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,840
Drive safely.

353
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,000
Jiaxin said she had
a mother-child class today

354
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,760
and didn't prepare lunch.

355
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,400
Let's eat out at noon together.

356
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,160
I'm in a meeting.

357
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,200
You go ahead.

358
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,680
Okay,

359
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,320
call me when you're finished.

360
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,640
Sir, follow the car in front of us.

361
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,980
(Delta Health)

362
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,840
Why did he come to the hospital?

363
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay,

364
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,840
and now stretch a bit.

365
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,720
Stand in front of the mat.

366
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,320
Okay, the baby's dad came to help.

367
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,760
Hold your left foot with your left hand.

368
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,120
Pull it backwards

369
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,080
and lean forward.

370
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,640
Isn't that Jiaxin?

371
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,800
And then use your left hand...

372
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,840
Why is she here?

373
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,560
My phone is ringing.

374
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,720
Hey, Mom.

375
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,400
Jiaxin,

376
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,720
where are you?

377
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,240
I'm having a yoga class.

378
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,400
Let me ask you a question.

379
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,520
How are you dancing now?

380
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,480
I've remembered the movements

381
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
but when it comes to me that I need to dance

382
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,120
with Xiyi in front of so many people
at the year-end party,

383
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,600
I'll get terribly nervous.

384
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,720
Oh dear,

385
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,400
the movements don't matter.

386
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,080
It's okay if you make mistakes.

387
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,920
What's the most important

388
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,920
is to show your belly.

389
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,480
You know what I mean?

390
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,040
Hold your head up and belly out.

391
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,320
You need to be proud

392
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,440
and let people see your grandeur.

393
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:34,960
Understood?

394
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,560
But my teacher said

395
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,640
I needed to breathe deeply
and keep my stomach in.

396
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,920
Don't listen to your teacher.

397
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,000
She doesn't know these things.

398
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,440
Think about it.

399
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,360
You're pregnant

400
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,720
with the future successor to Cheng Jie Group,

401
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,320
right?

402
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,560
If you show your belly,

403
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,280
everyone will see it and think,

404
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,200
"Goodness,

405
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,400
is her belly round or pointed?

406
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,160
Is she pregnant with a boy or a girl?"

407
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,680
People will all think about these

408
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,840
and won't care how many times
you step on Wang's foot.

409
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,480
No one will be like that.

410
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh dear, let me tell you.

411
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,840
What I said is definitely right.

412
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,320
Remember.

413
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,200
When you have breakfast,

414
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,760
you must eat your fill

415
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,960
and drink some soup.

416
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,080
Show your belly.

417
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,040
Only then can our Ximi

418
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,360
meet everyone.

419
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,280
Don't laugh.

420
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,800
I'm serious.

421
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,440
Yes, got it.

422
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,960
I'll go back to the classroom.

423
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,800
Okay,

424
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,360
bye.

425
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,520
Bye-bye.

426
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,560
Okay,

427
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,000
shall we start?

428
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,680
Yes.

429
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,200
Okay,

430
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,760
lie flat on the mat.

431
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:43,880
Good.

432
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,360
The baby's dad can...

433
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,640
Do you know pregnant people
can't climb so high?

434
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,960
You don't need to do these things.

435
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,200
If anything happens to you,

436
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,960
how shall I cope with it?

437
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,520
I'm

438
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,440
okay.

439
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,720
You're pregnant?

440
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,320
Who's she?

441
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,640
Anna.

442
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,400
Yes?

443
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,920
She's actually my w...

444
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,680
I'm your dietitian.

445
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,920
Haven't we agreed

446
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,600
we'll look after Anna together?

447
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,120
I'm willing to give the best to this child

448
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,200
in his mom's stead.

449
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,520
As for that woman...

450
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,920
That woman's name is Chen Jiaxin.

451
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
Our child's name is Ximi.

452
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,320
What happened between us

453
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,120
is never just one problem.

454
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,760
Let's get married.

455
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,800
I can't marry you.

456
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,560
Xiyi,

457
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,480
you still have feelings for me, don't you?

458
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,280
I want to love some with an easy conscience.

459
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,760
I don't want my hesitation

460
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,600
to hurt

461
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,600
both of you and Jiaxin.

462
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,480
I'm the person who should be smiling there.

463
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,240
She stole Xiyi when I was away.

464
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,560
She stole everything that belongs to me.

465
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,920
I'll drive you home first.

466
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,000
Mm.

467
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,560
Why are you looking at me like that?

468
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,280
Recently

469
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,480
time we spent together was much shorter.

470
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,040
Anna is getting well slowly.

471
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,680
Our lives will return to normal soon.

472
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,920
When tomorrow's year-end party is over,

473
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
let's go on a trip together.

474
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,800
For real?

475
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,240
Can I

476
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,760
go anywhere I want?

477
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,040
My wife

478
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,560
will decide where we go.

479
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,840
Well,

480
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,200
I want to see Siqi first.

481
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,800
Okay,

482
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,000
I'll take you.

483
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
You said time we spent together
was short recently.

484
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,640
Keep looking at me on our way there,

485
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,760
okay?

486
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,600
I'm your number-one fan

487
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,280
and your supporter.

488
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,360
I really hope I can keep enclosing you.

489
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,280
You have enclosed me.

490
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,880
Anna,

491
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,600
when things in hand are done,

492
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,080
I will definitely give you a perfect wedding.

493
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,920
But when it comes to me that I need to dance

494
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,240
with Xiyi in front of so many people
at the year-end party,

495
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,320
I'll get terribly nervous.

496
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,960
After tomorrow,

497
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,400
everyone will know

498
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
that Xiyi's other half is Chen Jiaxin.

499
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,000
What will I be?

500
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,600
What on earth am I?

501
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,720
What have I done wrong?

502
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,080
What exactly have I done wrong?

503
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,080
Why did you do this to me?

504
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,000
The year-end party
won't be given until tomorrow.

505
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,280
I still have a chance.

506
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
I will not give up.

507
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,720
There's no way I'll give up.

508
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,000
Here, darling,

509
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,760
specially bought for a pregnant lady.

510
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,840
Thanks.

511
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,800
How's it going?

512
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,800
Did Ximi behave recently?

513
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,720
I feel

514
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,560
he's more and more considerate of me.

515
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
People say

516
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,640
as a baby grows day by day,

517
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,200
its mom will suffer more and more.

518
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,160
But I don't have this kind of feeling at all.

519
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,480
Look at your radiance.

520
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,720
You must have been pregnant with an angel.

521
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,680
Then he won't mind his mom

522
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,400
spending a few hours with me, will he?

523
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,480
We haven't shopped
and eaten together for long.

524
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,240
But

525
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,880
I need to cook for Anna today.

526
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,960
Jiaxin,

527
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,120
I'm sorry.

528
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,880
It's because of me

529
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,400
that Anna raided your husband's company.

530
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,000
Oh dear,

531
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,280
how many times are you gonna apologize to me?

532
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,160
If you do it again,

533
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,800
I'll never forgive you.

534
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,960
But don't you think

535
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,520
it's weird looking after Anna?

536
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,520
At first

537
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
it was indeed awkward.

538
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,120
But after I spent time with her,

539
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,440
I found her to be easy to get along with.

540
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,160
She's confident

541
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,400
and outgoing.

542
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,480
She even helped me on the cruise ship.

543
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,360
If

544
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,920
I were a man,

545
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,800
I would also fall for her.

546
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Xiyi is indeed a man

547
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,720
of discernment.

548
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,000
Don't be silly.

549
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,360
Let me tell you.

550
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,000
However hard women
try to enrich their inner beauty,

551
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,680
men just can't see it.

552
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,960
What Wang Xiyi saw in Anna

553
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,920
are 100% her long legs.

554
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,520
Your legs aren't long

555
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,760
but you're pregnant with his child.

556
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,680
That's your advantage.

557
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,720
Wang Xiyi is not a lookist.

558
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,880
It's your boyfriend who likes your long legs.

559
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,640
But they are indeed long.

560
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,320
Let me see them.

561
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,640
What would you like to eat today?

562
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,040
I bought fresh carrots and tomatoes.

563
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,840
I want to cook beef

564
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,120
and fry some greens.

565
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,680
You seem to be in a good mood.

566
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,440
Actually,

567
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,480
you don't need to work so hard.

568
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,600
No one should feel like eating later.

569
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,400
Ah?

570
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
I'll just ask you one question.

571
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,520
Do you want me to call you Jiaxin

572
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,920
or Mrs. Wang?

573
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,440
You...

574
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,240
you remembered everything?

575
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,520
I'm sorry.

576
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,160
Is this apology

577
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,760
sincere?

578
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,000
You're not feeling sorry.

579
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,600
If you hadn't wished to have Wang Xiyi,

580
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,200
would you have agreed to keep the baby?

581
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,600
If you really felt sorry,

582
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
would you have treated me like a fool?

583
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,640
Dietitian?

584
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,440
Xiyi's assistant.

585
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,280
How did you find so many excuses?

586
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,200
It's not like that.

587
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,240
I was going to leave

588
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,120
once I had the child.

589
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,440
I even signed a divorce agreement.

590
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,880
Xiyi and I would get divorced

591
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,280
on the day our child was born.

592
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,400
That's not what Xiyi told me.

593
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,280
I...

594
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
When the child is born,

595
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,920
will you really leave Xiyi?

596
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,280
Yes.

597
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,440
I hope

598
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,960
I can give birth to my baby safely

599
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,920
and the three of us

600
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
can live together.

601
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,720
The person who Xiyi loves is me!

602
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,400
I have his heart.

603
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,440
What happened between you two is a mistake.

604
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,720
He just chose to be responsible for his child

605
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,440
and you

606
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,840
are dispensable.

607
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,400
You don't know Xiyi at all.

608
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,000
Do you know what kind of family he wants?

609
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,600
Do you think

610
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,160
three years of our relationship can't compare

611
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,840
with several months you spent together?

612
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,760
It's not like that.

613
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,040
Xiyi said...

614
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,480
I don't care what he said!

615
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,280
It's all because I was away from him.

616
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,400
But now

617
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,600
I'm back.

618
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,520
Everything will be what it once was.

619
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,080
The person Xiyi loves most is still me.

620
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,720
You're still no one important.

621
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,760
There's only responsibility between you.

622
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,400
There's no love at all. Do you understand?

623
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,600
I'm sorry, Anna.

624
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
I apologize to you

625
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,800
from the bottom of my heart.

626
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,640
All along

627
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,720
I've never thought about

628
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,440
replacing anyone

629
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,560
or stealing Xiyi's heart.

630
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,720
Because I have never

631
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,320
had the choice.

632
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,360
But now

633
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,360
I want to give myself and my child a chance,

634
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,960
a fair chance

635
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,240
to be chosen.

636
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,560
I'm sorry.

637
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,440
A fair chance to be chosen?

638
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,680
You're still not clear about it, are you?

639
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,360
I'm the only one who has a choice.

640
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,160
I will take care of you and Xiyi's child

641
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,840
and his relationship with me will go on.

642
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,520
If you don't believe me,

643
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,800
I'll prove it to you

644
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,160
who Wang Xiyi actually loves.

645
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,520
That's all for today's meeting.

646
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,000
I prepared a surprise for you.

647
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,200
Let's meet

648
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,560
in the old place at 7 tonight.

649
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,560
Do you think you can replace me

650
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,880
after being with him for a few months?

651
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,520
He's just lost for the moment.

652
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,080
If you don't believe me,

653
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
go to the restaurant tonight.

654
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,240
I'll prove it to you

655
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,480
that Xiyi only loves me.

656
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:33,920
Hello.

657
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,800
Hey, Jiaxin.

658
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,680
The clay doll Master Zhongshan Long
gave you has been repaired.

659
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,840
If you're free,

660
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,760
I'll take it to you.

661
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,560
Okay,

662
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,800
I'll go

663
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,520
to the gallery later.

664
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:46,920
Okay,

665
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,480
I'll wait for you.

666
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,080
Look.

667
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,160
The crack is completely gone.

668
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,080
But Master Zhongshan Long thinks

669
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,160
as a wedding gift for you,

670
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,240
this handiwork bears its special meaning.

671
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,080
He hopes after this repair,

672
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,200
you'll know

673
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,080
that you must hang in there no matter

674
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,920
how many difficulties you're faced with.

675
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,000
I see

676
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,080
what he means.

677
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,200
I think this clay doll is precious

678
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,240
because

679
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,440
it's different from ones that are perfect.

680
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,560
Just like

681
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,960
your marriage with Wang Xiyi,

682
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,800
even if there's a crack,

683
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,760
it can still be repaired

684
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,000
and you'll still grow old together happily.

685
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,560
Or

686
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,680
do you think

687
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,200
this crack

688
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,120
is unlucky?

689
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,360
I can talk with Master Zhongshan Long

690
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,800
and ask him to make a new one for you.

691
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,600
Anna

692
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
regained her memory.

693
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,800
She

694
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,240
refused to let go?

695
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,880
She said

696
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,920
she'd go to the restaurant

697
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,200
where they celebrated birthdays
before with Xiyi.

698
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,920
Don't you have

699
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,040
faith in Wang Xiyi?

700
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,600
I don't know.

701
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,600
If you're worried,

702
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,880
you can go as well.

703
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,320
It's okay.

704
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,000
I'm here.

705
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,280
I'll go with you.

706
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,200
Don't be afraid.

707
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,440
A beauty came back from across the sea

708
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,640
asked me to tell her love

709
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,360
to the man she loves most,

710
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,640
Mr. Wang Xiyi.

711
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,840
I'm back.

712
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,920
This time

713
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,320
you are the most

714
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,280
important one of my audience.

715
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,480
I'm the only one who Xiyi loves.

716
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,360
Chen Jiaxin,

717
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,360
he will choose me

718
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,120
but not you.

719
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,120
Thanks to Mr. Wang,

720
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,760
we saw such a perfect performance.

721
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,640
Aren't you touched?

722
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,440
Yes.

723
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,840
So at this moment,

724
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,120
shouldn't our hero make a confession

725
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,280
of love to his white swan?

726
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,520
Confess.

727
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,480
Confess.

728
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,480
Confess.

729
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,400
Confess.

730
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,240
Confess.

731
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,400
Confess.

732
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,480
Confess.

733
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
Confess.

734
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,480
Confess.

735
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,560
Confess.

736
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,480
Confess.

you'd attend tomorrow's

I'm going home.

786
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,120
Which home?

787
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,880
The Wang's.

788
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,800
Actually,

789
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,200
I've been thinking all day.

790
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,120
None of the three of us

791
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,560
is at fault.

792
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,400
If something's to blame,

793
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,240
it can only be the accident.

794
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,920
I've once backed off

795
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,120
and also striven for it.

796
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,760
Eventually,

797
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,880
I left Xiyi to make a decision.

798
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,280
Now that he chose Anna,

799
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,320
I'd just be back to
the beginning of the story.

800
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,440
At least...

801
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,880
At least two people

802
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,880
will have a happy ending.

803
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,600
There are not only

804
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
two people in this story.

805
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:00,960
You and Ximi

806
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,480
are also in it.

807
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,520
A happy family of three

808
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,160
is so close to you already.

809
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,680
Can you resign yourself to it?

810
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
Books you borrowed

811
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,120
and money you picked up

812
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,400
are not yours.

813
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,080
If their owners want them back,

814
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,120
you still need to return them.

815
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,160
If Ximi has to grow up

816
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,640
in a family that's formed by imposition

817
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
without any affection

818
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,000
and warmth

819
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,920
but only fake happiness,

820
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,000
I would rather give up now.

821
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,280
Chen Jiaxin,

822
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,400
can you let me do one thing for you?

823
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,320
What is it?

824
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,560
You fool.

825
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,400
Why did you flick me?

826
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,440
This is a promise for you.

827
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,000
At any time,

828
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,800
if Wang Xiyi abandons you

829
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,920
or you can't stay with
the Wang family any longer,

830
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,120
come to me with Ximi.

831
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,960
I will take care of you,

832
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,320
okay?

833
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,720
I...

834
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:31,720
Did you forget it?

835
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,800
You agreed to let me be your manager.

836
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,480
I'm destined

837
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,480
to protect you and Ximi.

838
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,760
Let's not talk about the other things.

839
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,800
You just need to remember

840
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,760
that I will be there for you.

841
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,440
Let's go.

842
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,520
Cheers.

843
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,160
This afternoon

844
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,000
we openly talked for a while.

845
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,720
She told me

846
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,400
she was very happy.

847
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,280
What?

848
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,400
Did you think I'd have a catfight with her?

849
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,200
I thought

850
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,480
you'd be quite angry.

851
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,960
At first I was.

852
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,120
But as I spent time with her,

853
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,920
I did find it hard to hate her.

854
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,560
She said

855
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,480
she was worried about the dance
at tomorrow's year-end party.

856
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,640
But compared with that,

857
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,440
your attitude

858
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
worries her more.

859
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,040
What do you mean?

860
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,320
You signed a divorce agreement, didn't you?

861
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,000
Even if she's pregnant with Ximi

862
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,560
