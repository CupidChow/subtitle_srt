25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,940
(Episode 28)

26
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:42,940
I want a salary raise
("salary raise" pronounces "Jia Xin" in Chinese)!

27
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,380
What did you say?

28
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,860
I want a salary raise!

29
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,700
You want Jiaxin?

30
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,820
Yes.

31
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,620
You want Chen Jiaxin?

32
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,100
What?

33
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,220
No!

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,180
I mean I want a salary raise!

35
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,420
I want to get more payment. Got it?

36
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,420
Why should I give you a raise?

37
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,460
Because I'm poor!

38
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,220
My girlfriend wouldn't marry me!

39
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,740
My family urges me to get married every day!

40
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,980
In their opinion, men should
put marriage above career.

41
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,740
See, I've worked for you for years.

42
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,780
The prime of my life is nearly over.

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,140
Do you really bear to see

44
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,900
I stay single forever
and lose my passion for work?

45
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,620
So,

46
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,660
you want to propose to Siqi?

47
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,900
To be exact,

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,220
she has already turned me down! My friend!

49
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,380
Why?

50
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,660
When you proposed,

51
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,980
you had fireworks and cruise ship.

52
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,660
Unlike you,

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,100
I had nothing

54
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,620
but my true heart!

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,540
But she thinks

56
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,460
true heart can't compare to money.

57
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,300
She said I was too petty
and didn't take her seriously.

58
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,420
Then how about this?

59
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,180
Let me...

60
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,860
Hold on.

61
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,100
Hello?

62
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,540
Brother,

63
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,740
I have a fever.

64
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,260
They won't let me get on the plane!

65
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,100
Okay, I see.

66
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,380
What do I do?

67
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,380
Wait! Wait!

68
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,380
What about my raise?

69
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:08,980
I...

70
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,340
Hey!

71
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,460
What about my raise?

72
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,900
I'm not talking about your Jiaxin.

73
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,780
I'm talking about my raise!

74
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,740
What about my raise?

75

(China-Hungary International
Art Exchange Seminar)

76
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,660
Hey!

77
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:29,860
Hello.

78
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,260
Why hasn't Master Zhongshan Long arrived yet?

79
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,340
The second part of the seminar would start.

80
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,020
His phone is off.

81
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,300
Could something be wrong?

82
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,780
Don't worry.

83
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,940
I've already contacted his assistant.

84
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,580
Master Zhongshan will soon be here.

85
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,260
Oh, that's fine.

You need to glue this wing again.

88
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,220
Master!

89
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,700
Hi.

90
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,860
Elaine is here to snatch teacher away again!

91
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,900
Shush!

92
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,940
Work hard!

93
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
You guys continue!

94
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,380
Master.

95
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,860
I've sent out the outline for the seminar,

96
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,580
and it has been confirmed.

97
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,180
The projector has no problem.

98
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,540
Okay.

99
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,500
There'll be another artist

100
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,300
named Anish Beuys.

101
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,780
You once said that he

102
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,300
had a unique perspective
about life and death,

103
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,220
in which you were quite interested.

104
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,020
So I borrowed your "Life" series

105
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,620
from the Museum of Contemporary Art,

106
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,900
so that you can have a discussion

107
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,140
with him regarding this theme.

108
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,340
I've translated the outline for the seminar,

109
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,260
and sent a copy to Anish.

110
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,260
You can take a look in the car.

111
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,940
I heard the sponsor

112
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,620
called Dylan to ask for my picture.

113
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,460
You didn't give him, did you?

114
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,380
Don't worry. I didn't.

115
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,940
I only gave them your self-portrait

116
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,540
to remain your sense of mystery as usual.

117
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,820
I really hate

118
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,180
to sit there and take a formal picture.

119
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,060
It's so ugly!

120
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,180
No worry! I've talked to them.

121
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,260
Let's go. I'll drive you there.

122
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,460
What about my lunch?

123
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,540
I've prepared sandwich.

124
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,060
You'll have 10 minutes

125
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,020
to eat it in the car.

126
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:02,860
Good!

127
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,780
I didn't eat any breakfast.

128
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,860
I feel hungry now.

129
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,380
Dylan.

130
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,780
Are we late?

131
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,980
You are right on time!

132
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,140
So,

133
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,900
I'm going in.

134
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,180
You can go back first.

135
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:32,900
Okay.

136
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,900
I'll have a meal

137
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,420
with Anish after the seminar.

138
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,620
Okay, master!

139
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,780
It only took you 10 minutes

140
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,260
to drive a 30-minute route.

141
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,220
You weren't afraid to be fined?

142
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,420
When you are running out of time,

143
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,820
time is money.

144
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,340
Master will pay anyway.

145
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Can you give me a ride?

146
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,340
Are you in a hurry?

147
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,860
If I speed, you have to

148
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,060
be responsible for the fine.

149
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,740
I'm not in a hurry.

150
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,460
Just take your time!

151
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,620
Alright.

152
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,260
Let's go!

153
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,900
Oh, by the way.

154
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,580
Ryann told me today

155
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,460
that there were already seven buyers

156
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,900
asking about the price of your "Memento".

157
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,660
Seven?

158
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,820
Is it good or bad?

159
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,580
Usually, it may take over a month

160
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,820
to promote the first piece
of the work of a new artist.

161
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,580
Yet your work has caught so much attention

162
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,060
as soon as it came out.

163
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,020
So, what do you think?

164
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,020
Sounds not bad.

165
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,700
Hey.

166
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,740
Seven is your lucky number.

167
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,300
Did you just make up this number

168
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,820
to comfort me?

169
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,580
Are you questioning

170
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,100
my professionalism as an agent?

171
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,540
Of course not!

172
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,060
But,

173
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,260
please do not

174
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,740
secretly ask some people to buy my work

175
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,860
just because I'm your friend.

176
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,220
If I really did so,

177
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,220
you think I'd do it

178
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,380
just for a friend?

179
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:02,820
I've told you

180
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,300
to be more careful.

181
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,300
Okay! That's right!

182
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,300
You are the most dangerous man

183
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,260
in the entire Hungary.

184
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,260
Don't worry about your "Memento".

185
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,700
As your agent,

186
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,780
I hope more than anybody

187
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,700
that your work can be bought by someone

188
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,060
who really understands and appreciates it.

189
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:21,900
Let's go.

190
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,420
Okay.

191
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,500
Mr. Yi. This way, please.

192
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,140
I'm Lu, from the
Department of European Affairs.

193
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,420
Is there any place you wanna go

194
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,580
after you unpacked?

195
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,380
I'm wondering if there's
any art gallery nearby.

196
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,700
My friend will open a dance studio.

197
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,620
I want to buy her a gift.

198
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,460
Art gallery?

199
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,580
The most popular art gallery
among young people

200
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,940
should be M Art Center.

201
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,900
Then please take me there.

202
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,620
Okay.

203
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,180
Hi.

204
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,500
How can I help you?

205
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,700
I'm Ryann.

206
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,700
Are you Chinese?

207
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,260
Yeah. I'm Chinese.

208
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:31,900
Nice to meet you.

209
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,420
You, too.

210
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,980
Allow me to introduce.

211
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,500
The uniqueness

212
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,580
of this china

213
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,020
is that it's made of shiny porcelain
which is as thin as eggshell

214
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,740
to feature a warm and comfy
feeling of the feathers.

215
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,700
The forging process is
exquisite and impeccable.

216
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,660
It's from one of the
three national brands of Hungary...

217
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,420
Please wrap it up for me.

218
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,100
I'll give it to my friend.

219
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,860
Okay! No problem.

220
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,500
Hey!

221
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,020
Look at this rocking horse.

222
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,660
Our Ximi will look so cute on it.

223
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,380
What do you think?

224
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,660
It suits

225
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,940
boys and girls alike.

226
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,580
It's so cute.

227
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,460
"You should be allowed to fly

228
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,660
up to the clouds in an airplane.

229
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,300
But too much yearning makes me choose

230
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,860
to commemorate you."

231
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,660
I've tidied up the baby's room.

232
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,940
It's a man's job to assemble
the little rocking horse.

233
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,580
You have a good eye for art!

234
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,620
This work is from
a new artist we just signed.

235
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,900
Her name is Elaine.

236
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,580
She finished her apprenticeship

237
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,740
only three years after she
came to Hungary to study,

238
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,140
which shocked the entire industry.

239
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,180
Many people have enquired about this work.

240
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,860
Her future is quite promising.

241
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:42,980
I can see

242
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,340
that the artist herself
is one who has stories.

243
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,580
How do you mean?

244
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
The work is named "Memento".

245
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,180
Yet it sends out a slight sadness.

246
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,060
As if

247
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,460
it was a gift that
could never be given away.

248
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,780
May I ask

249
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,060
what made you think

250
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,860
it was a gift that'd never be given away?

251
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,380
Have you ever had any regret?

252
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,580
A regret that was deep in your memory

253
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,780
yet you had to let it go.

254
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,220
If you have,

255
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,260
you would resonate with this work.

256
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,020
I want to collect it.

257
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,100
Please wrap it up for me.

258
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,340
I'm sorry,

259
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,060
but according to our policy,

260
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,140
any item sold must have an attached

261
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,180
certificate card that's signed by the artist.

262
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,340
But

263
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,700
this item was just put out
for exhibit yesterday,

264
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,740
so it doesn't have a
signed certificate card yet.

265
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,220
Therefore, we can't...

266
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,220
This work is unique to me.

267
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,540
And

268
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,900
I will not resell it.

269
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,260
I don't care if it has a certificate card.

270
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,300
I want to buy it now.

271
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,100
Then how about this?

272
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,340
Please give me a moment.

273
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,860
I'll give Elaine a call.

274
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,340
And this one is a Duan ink stone

275
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,380
that was made by Liu Zhao in Qing Dynasty.

276
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:28,740
Hello?

277
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,980
Hi, Elaine.

278
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,300
Good news!

279
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,580
Someone wants to buy your "Memento!"

280
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,980
So soon?

281
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,820
Is the buyer your boss?

282
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,820
I swear I know nothing about it!

283
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,780
I assure you that he is a stranger.

284
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,260
He wants to buy it right now.

285
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,260
And he said

286
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,460
one who had a deep regret
yet has to let it go

287
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,260
would resonate with your work.

288
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,260
I've told him

289
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,420
that it doesn't have a
signed certificate card yet.

290
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,420
But he doesn't care.

291
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,020
However, according to the policy,

292
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,780
I can't sell it to him
without a certificate card.

293
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,020
So I'm calling

294
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,060
to ask about your opinion.

295
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,300
Then...

296
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,060
Please put the buyer on the phone.

297
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:15,780
Okay.

298
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,620
Excuse me.

299
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,340
Elaine wants to talk to you.

300
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:22,820
Okay.

301
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:25,940
Hi!

302
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,060
Hi!

303
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,980
It's Elaine.

304
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,220
Thanks for your appreciation for "Memento!"

305
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,700
Your work is great!

306
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,620
I love it!

307
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,140
I have to rush to the hotel.

308
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,340
So, it's okay

309
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,500
if you don't have a certificate card.

310
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,780
It doesn't matter.

311
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,180
You can tell Ryann

312
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,100
the hotel you stay and your room number.

313
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,380
I will send you the card myself

314
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,340
after signing it.

315
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,220
It's okay.

316
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,500
Like I said, don't bother.

317
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,700
But, still,

318
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,500
please let me thank you.

319
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,780
Will you?

320
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,820
Alright.

321
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,660
I'll be in the hotel.

322
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,620
call me when you arrive.

323
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,780
Got it.

324
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,380
Thanks!

325
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,220
Thanks!

326
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,180
Okay. I see.

327
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,300
This way, please.

328
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:33,980
Hello?

329
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,500
Anson.

330
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,540
Hi, Mr. Yi.

331
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,180
The Special Assistant to the General Manager
of Xiazhilu has contacted me.

332
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,060
They can meet you this evening.

333
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,340
Will you be available?

334
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,220
If you are, I'll reply him now,

335
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,940
so that you can finish
your business trip soon

336
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,580
and hurry back for Anna's

337
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,900
opening party for her dance studio.

338
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:48,940
Okay.

339
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,180
Go ahead and reply them.

340
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,500
Send me the address later.

341
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,660
Alright!

342
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,220
Hello?

343
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,740
I'm looking for the tenant in 305.

344
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,700
-Just a moment, please.
-Okay.

345
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,060
Excuse me.

346
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Seems the tenant isn't in the room right now.

347
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,700
Would you like to leave a message?

348
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,420
That's okay.

349
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,780
I'll just wait here.

350
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,220
Okay.

351
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,660
Thank you!

352
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,540
You are welcome!

353
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,300
Nice to meet you!

354
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,580
I've heard so much about you!

355
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,340
Your Chinese is so good!

356
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,220
I've always admired Chinese culture.

357
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,780
So, you can see

358
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,100
how much I love the Heritage,

359
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,020
and how genuine I am
about cooperating with Cheng Jie.

360
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,740
Xiazhilu essential oil

361
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,300
is famous for being organic and natural.

362
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,620
Miss Xia, I'm looking forward to
cooperating with you

363
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,180
to produce Heritage essential oil soap.

364
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,260
Now,

365
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,220
take a seat.

366
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:50,540
Okay.

367
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,260
Let's have some coffee while talking.

368
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,300
Allow me to introduce. This is our

369
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,340
product designer Nico.

370
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,260
This is Aulia, who's in charge of marketing.

371
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,060
Nice to meet you.

372
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,780
And this is Mary, who's in charge

373
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,580
of product promotion.

374
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,260
We are all looking forward to
our collaboration.

375
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:09,940
Thanks!

376
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,740
Hello, Ryann.

377
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,140
The buyer is still not here yet.

378
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,860
Do you have his phone number?

379
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,020
I don't.

380
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,380
He left in a hurry

381
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,260
and didn't leave a phone number.

382
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,180
Then what does he look like?

383
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,220
He's tall and thin, quite a gentleman.

384
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,100
He is a Chinese.

385
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,580
A Chinese?

386
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,140
Yes, he speaks Chinese.

387
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:42,860
Elaine.

388
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,420
It's me, Dylan.

389
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,580
Let's have dinner together to celebrate

390
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,060
that you sold your first work.

391
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,700
Okay!

392
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:50,980
Then

393
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,260
I'll leave the card to the front desk.

394
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,220
Alright.

395
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,020
See you soon.

396
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,980
Wish you good luck!

397
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,780
It's just a dinner.

398
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,260
Why would you wish me good luck on that?

399
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,020
Get out!

400
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,060
If it's just a dinner,

401
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,140
why Master Zhongshan Long
and I aren't invited?

402
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,860
Besides,

403
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,820
you are

404
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,580
dressed up pretty nice today.

405
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,740
Who would believe it'll just be a dinner?

406
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,660
Alright.

407
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,820
I will support and encourage you spiritually.

408
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,860
When you get married,

409
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,420
I'll give you a big red envelope!

410
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,020
Excuse me.

411
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,460
Please hand this envelope

412
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,340
to the guy in room 305.

413
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,100
Okay. No problem.

414
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:27,740
Thanks.

415
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,020
Hello?

416
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,100
I had a successful meeting
with the General Manager of Xiazhilu.

417
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,060
Their legal counsel
will send us a contract later.

418
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,020
Okay!

419
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,580
Then I'll book you a return ticket now.

420
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,700
The sooner, the better,

421
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,860
I'll check out shortly.

422
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,780
Okay!

423
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,300
Bye!

424
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,300
Check out, please.

425
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,340
Okay.

426
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,900
Excuse me, sir. But a lady

427
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,260
left this envelope for you.

428
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,180
Okay, thanks!

429
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,780
"Dear stranger,

430
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,020
thank you for purchasing "Memento".

431
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,300
I've always believed that this little horse

432
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,980
would meet someone who really appreciates it.

433
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,460
You said,

434
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,820
one who had a deep regret
yet has to let it go

435
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,980
would resonate with "Memento".

436
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,580
I'm very touched by that.

437
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,620
Hope "Memento" will always be with you

438
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,820
and bring you the courage
and strength to move forward!

439
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,980
Elaine.

440
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,500
Chen Jiaxin."

441
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,540
(Chen Jiaxin)

442
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,220
Sorry

443
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,380
for letting you wait!

444
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,580
It's okay.

445
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,420
Just remember

446
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,460
that I'm the one who's waiting for you.

447
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,940
So you don't have to hurry
no matter how late it is.

448
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,900
Where's the guy you want me to meet?

449
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,340
Not just one guy,

450
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,900
but a bunch of interesting people.

451
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,340
Come with me.

452
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,900
Do you know where I can fine Elaine?

453
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,100
Elaine?

454
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,900
She is having dinner with my boss right now.

455
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,140
She went to find you in your hotel.

456
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,300
You didn't see her?

457
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,460
Then let me ask you.

458
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,820
Is she about this height?

459
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,060
She likes using sticky notes,

460
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,860
and

461
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,420
she is a yes-woman who always helps others?

462
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,260
That's right!

463
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,460
She does like using sticky notes,

464
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,220
and she is about this height.

465
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,540
But,

466
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,820
she is not a yes-woman,

467
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,460
instead, she is a capable

468
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,140
and decisive woman.

469
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,780
I think you've got the wrong person.

470
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,140
Where can I find her?

471
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,100
I want to see her.

472
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,940
You are always

473
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,260
fascinated by Mohács Mask Carnival.

474
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,860
So I took one step further

475
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,820
and set the whole scene here.

476
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,780
Why didn't you tell me you'd bring me

477
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,420
to an interesting activity like this?

478
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,700
I thought you'd

479
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,420
let me meet someone important,

480
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,340
so I've been nervous about that.

481
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,500
I have another surprise for you later.

482
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,420
Excuse me, sir.

483
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,020
Tonight is our masquerade.

484
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,220
So you have to wear a mask.

485
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:38,740
So,

486
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,300
I need a mask to get into, right?

487
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,180
Please give me a mask.

488
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Everything is fine.

489
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,780
Are you sure?

490
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,660
Yes. I'm sure.

491
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,940
Ladies and Gentlemen!

492
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,820
Today,

493
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,660
I'm going to confess my love to a girl!

494
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,140
So it was him that took Jiaxin abroad
three years ago.

495
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,820
And, would you please play some music?

496
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,580
My girl is really shy.

497
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,860
You know,

498
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,620
today I finally got a chance to do this,

499
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,700
I need to thank two people.

500
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,300
Who are they?

501
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,700
The first one is the idiot

502
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,500
who didn't cherish you.

503
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,020
Due to his stupidity,

504
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,820
I had an opportunity to have you notice me.

505
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,340
The second one is the guy

506
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,340
who bought your work.

507
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,580
Because of his acknowledgement,

508
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,980
you finally let the past go

509
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,780
and are ready to welcome a new life.

510
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,420
And I'll let you know

511
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,940
that the one who can give you happiness

512
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,980
and deserves your trust

513
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,740
is me.

514
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,380
Will you be my girlfriend

515
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,340
from now on?

516
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,580
Excuse me for a moment.

517
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,660
Hello?

518
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,580
It's me.

519
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,020
Pretty girl.

520
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,860
May I dance with you?

521
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,780
Let me go!

522
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,740
Let me go!

523
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,580
I'm really curious.

524
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,380
Do you like the way you've become?

525
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,460
Or it's just a disguise,

526
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,340
like this mask?

527
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,300
Who are you?

528
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
Who do you want me to be?

529
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,100
Or are you expecting someone?

530
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,180
No!

531
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,460
What a jerk!

532
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,940
Damn you.

533
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,140
Gross!

534
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,660
Oh my God!

535
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,260
Elaine? Is that you?

536
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,780
Oh my God!

537
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,580
I'm so happy to see you again!

538
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,580
Yes, me too!

539
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,460
How come you speak English?

540
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,460
I've learned some English a bit.

541
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,660
That's so nice!

542
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,500
You look so good!

543
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,380
Look at him!

544
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,060
Is that your dog?

545
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,580
Yes.

546
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:49,860
So cute.

547
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,020
Jonny!

548
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,780
Jonny!

549
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,140
Hello, Jonny!

550
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,380
He's a good boy!

551
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,020
Yeah!

552
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,340
How's it going?

553
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,940
Good, very good. And you?

554
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,340
How come

555
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,820
she has changed so much just in three years?

556
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:45,980
You again!

557
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,500
Why are you following me?

558
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,140
Let me warn you,

559
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,340
I'll call the police if you follow me again!

560
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,500
Jerk!

561
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,900
Stop following me!

562
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:54,780
Wait!

563
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,300
Come on! Pick up!

564
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,740
Pick up!

565
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,740
Pick up! Pick up!

566
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,420
Hello?

567
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,420
Listen carefully!

568
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,860
I have shocking news for you!

569
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,420
What shocking news?

570
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,540
Aside from giving me a salary raise,

571
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,540
can't you wait till I get up
to talk about other things?

572
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,340
No!

573
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,380
Listen to me!

574
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,620
I met Chen Jiaxin!

575
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,300
What?

576
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,780
Hey, why don't you just turn on a speaker

577
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,620
and post a moment?!

578
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:54,900
Sorry! Sorry!

579
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,140
I was too excited!

580
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,060
Sorry!

581
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,660
Keep talking! I won't scream anymore!

582
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,340
You know what?

583
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,180
She is like a totally different person now!

584
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,860
She is elegant and confident.

585
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,260
Most importantly, she...

586
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,020
she has become very charming,

587
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,340
nothing like a divorced woman!

588
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,020
And do you know what
the most irritating part is?

589
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,060
She is having a good time with Dylan

590
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,060
in Hungary.

591
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,060
And I bet

592
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,980
that Dylan has been with her
for the past three years!

593
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,460
What did you say?

594
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,140
Well,

595
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,020
I said I finally understand your feelings.

596
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,140
If I bumped into my ex and saw her

597
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,460
become happier

598
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,540
and more seductive,

599
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,100
I would be furious, too!

600
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,340
Let me tell you.

601
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,820
"Seductive" is not a word for Chen Jiaxin,

602
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,460
even though I couldn't

603
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,660
stop looking at her!

604
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,460
Sounds like you are

605
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,660
quite angry right now.

606
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,660
Why are you angry?

607
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,220
Because Dylan has been with her?

608
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,180
Or because Chen Jiaxin has lived

609
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,020
a happy life these years even without you?

610
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,420
Hey, I'm not angry!

611
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,500
Are you kidding?

612
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,460
Men are usually nicer
than wise and very petty

613
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,380
when bumping into ex.

614
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,820
What did you say?

615
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,620
Nothing! Nothing!

616
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,500
I was saying

617
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,260
that if you need more time to sort it out,

618
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,020
I can change your flight
and book a hotel for you.

619
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,020
No.

620
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,220
I've rearranged my work.

621
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,140
Push back all my schedules.

622
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,260
Then, mark all the meeting minutes

623
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,260
and send them to me.

624
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,380
I'll review them over here.

625
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,340
Alright.

626
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,820
Here's a kind reminder though.

627
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,820
Three years ago,

628
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,100
you, Jiaxin and Anna

629
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,580
had a painful experience.

630
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,900
If you still can't get over Jiaxin,

631
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,580
I hope you'd better figure out first

632
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,700
how you'll explain it to Anna.

633
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,820
After all, she was also hurt by you,

634
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,060
and she has been waiting for you these years,

635
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,420
hoping to get back together with you.

636
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,620
You don't want the tragedy three years ago

637
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,820
happen all over again,

638
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,420

But before I do,

722
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,340
I want to apologize to you.

723
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,580
Master,

724
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,700
where are you going?

725
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,740
The seminar will start in an hour!

726
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:07,980
Well...

727
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,180
I need to go back to Shanghai
for something urgent.

728
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,340
You can go ahead

729
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,220
and cancel

730
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,420

731
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,900

What's the emergency?

733
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,100
Grandma Zhenzhu just called me

734
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,060
and said she is

735
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,940
badly ill.

736
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,660
She might not

737
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,020
have much time left.

738
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,860
I'll go back to Shanghai

739
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,860
to visit a few friends.

740
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,020
I'm leaving.

741
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,940
Master,

742
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,500
when will you come back?

743
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,860
What if we need you here?

744
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,220
You'll be in charge!

745
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,380
Oh, by the way,

746
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,420
when I'm back to Shanghai, I will...

747
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,260
I don't have time.

748
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,380
I'll tell you later on the phone.

749

00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,580

Hi, Ryann.

755
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,100
I'm the one who bought "Memento" yesterday.

756
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,460
Hi.

757
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,860
Is there anything I can help you?

758
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,100
Here's the thing.

759
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,860
I didn't

760
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,780
meet Elaine yesterday.

761
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,820
If you could, please tell her

762
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,540
that I will wait for her

763
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,420
at the street corner of Matthias Church

764
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,860
at 12:00 p.m. today.

765
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,420
Okay, no problem.

766
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,300
Thank you!

767
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,100
Hello? Anna.

768
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,660
Is everything going well
with your dance studio?

769
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,340
How's the business?

770
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,540
Not bad.

771
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,460
Oh, tell me,

772
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,700
when will you come back?

773
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,020
How is it going with your work over there?

774
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,900
I miss you.

775
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,380
What's wrong?

776
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,220
Anything happened?

777
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,060
No.

778
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,860
I'm just thinking that I used to stand you up

779
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,540
all the time for pursuing my dream.

780
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,340
And now I feel like I'm paying
for what I did,

781
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,980
and I finally understand
how you felt back then.

782
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,540
Xiyi,

783
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:43,980
I'm sorry!

784
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,420
Let's cherish each other

785
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,060
and never leave each other again, okay?

786
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,100
Hello?

787
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,580
Xiyi,

788
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,060
what are you thinking?

789
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,460
Sorry.

790
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,820
I'll try to be back soon.

791
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:13,700
Okay.

792
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:14,900
I'll wait for you.

793
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
Come back soon.

794
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,380
Are you Elaine?

795
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,220
Yeah. I am.

796
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,620
I don't need.

797
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,340
This is what a young man
asked me to give you.

798
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,900
Open it up. Have a look.

799
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,700
This is what the young man left for you.

800
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,540
"Sorry,

801
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,300
something's up and I have to leave.

802
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,980
But I want you to know that I fell in love

803
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,180
with "Memento" at the first sight.

804
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,780
A seemingly childlike work

805
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,260
is filled with regret and sadness.

806
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,020
Thank you for creating this work.

807
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,740
Hope this borage

808
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,700
will bring you the courage for creation.

809
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,820
I look forward to seeing

810
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,220
more excellent works of yours.

Just right now.

815
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,660
What does he look like and wear?

816
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,220
Tall,

817
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,340
Chinese,

818
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,220

Mr. W.

821
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,020
Though I didn't get to meet you,

822
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,260
I still want to thank you.

823
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,340
If you hadn't met me

824
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,060
and experienced those things,

825
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,860
you might still have remained

826
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,020
your optimistic and warm personality.

827
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,700
A nice girl like you

828
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,460
deserves someone who truly

829
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,860
love and cherish you,

830
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,020
someone who can stay with you

831
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,540
and guard your kindness,

832
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,940
as well as give you a carefree

833
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,780
and happy life.

834
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,380
Unfortunately,

835
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,340
that someone is not me.

836
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,060
I already feel relieved

837
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,540
as long as I know you are
having a good life here.

838
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:55,980

You pervert!
