00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,080
I switched them back.

174
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,640
I prefer strong contrast.

175
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,080
It felt

176
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,240
a little bland before,

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,880
and there was no striking contrast.

178
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,640
It's alright.

179
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,040
Dylan.

180
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,920
Are you happy

181
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
these days?

182
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,600
Siqi got married today.

183
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,320
She said,

184
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,040
when two fall in love,

185
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,240
they should feel comfortable
being with each other.

186
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,680
But

187
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,680
our relationship right now

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,640
doesn't make us comfortable.

189
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,360
What do you think?

190
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Actually,

191
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000
we aren't right for each other.

192
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,160
Sorry.

193
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,240
Due to what I went through before,

194
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,360
I've been afraid of getting hurt again.

195
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,480
So,

196
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,920
I closed my heart for three years.

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,800
And then,

198
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,520
I had too much expectation and fantasy

199
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,520
towards Mr. W.

200
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,160
Mr. W

201
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,680
was just a person,

202
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,200
who couldn't solve my problems.

203
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,200
The one who can

204
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,840
is only me.

205
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,360
So,

206
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,840
I think...

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,280
we should break up peacefully.

208
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,560
Let's get back to our most comfortable state.

209
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,840
Okay?

210
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Of course.

211
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,080
Let's get back to
the most comfortable state for us.

212
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
Actually, we've always been friends.

213
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,520
I was just worried about you too much

214
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,560
and made the whole thing complicated.

215
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,280
It's not an ending, but a fresh start.

216
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,600
We'll always be the best partners!

217
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,840
Thank you!

218
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,520
My best partner.

219
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,520
Will you create a new work for me ASAP?

220
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,960
I need it to get my business going.

221
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,160
Would you please give me some time?

222
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,840
I've always wanted

223
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
to travel around the world,

224
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,640
but the plan was kept getting delayed.

225
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,480
And now,

226
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,480
I want to take the trip more than ever.

227
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,680
I want to challenge myself

228
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,560
and become braver!

229
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,680
I'll start packing

230
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,320
in the next couple of days.

231
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,040
So soon?

232
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,760
Sure.

233
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,080
It's not easy to make this decision.

234
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,920
I don't want to change my mind again.

235
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,960
Memento,

236
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,040
let me say goodbye to you.

237
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,920
When I think of you again,

238
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,000
it'll be a happy memory.

239
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,640
Ximi,

240
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,080
sorry.

241
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,720
When Anna

242
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,600
handed me the agreement,

243
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,960
I felt too sad.

244
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,000
I failed to protect you.

245
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,560
I was being too careless,

246
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,000
otherwise I wouldn't lose you.

247
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,160
But this time,

248
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,080
I'm really ready to let it go.

249
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,360
Anna gave you the agreement?

250
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,720
I should say

251
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,880
Anna helped to deliver it to me.

252
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,720
You mean

253
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,200
the divorce agreement
that Wang Xiyi gave you?

254
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:18,800
Yes.

255
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,280
Then why would Anna deliver it to you?

256
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,600
My dress was dirty

257
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,520
and I needed to change a new one.

258
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,400
The delivery guy happened to come,

259
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,800
so Anna helped me to receive it.

260
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,160
I've got to go now.

261
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,560
Jiaxin.

262
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,520
I have something to confess to you.

263
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,320
I'm not

264
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,840
Mr. W.

265
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,040
I know.

266
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,720
You are Dylan,

267
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,280
the guy who always supports me.

268
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,360
I won't see you as Mr. W anymore.

269
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,960
My fragility made his existence possible.

270
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,040
But I don't

271
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,360
need him anymore.

272
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:42,880
Yes.

273
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,960
I've almost finished packing.

274
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,760
Is the restaurant busy today?

275
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
I'm leaving for London tonight.

276
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Don't worry!

277
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,080
I will take good care of myself.

278
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,680
I'm no longer that weak girl three years ago.

279
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,160
I'll call you often.

280
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,480
Okay. Bye!

281
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,120
Grandma!

282
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,880
You didn't even come to visit me
after you were back.

283
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,200
And now you'll go travel around the world?

284
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,920
Grandma,

285
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,360
I...

286
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,760
Your master told me

287
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,440
that you've grown so much and become

288
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,760
very capable and mature over the three years.

289
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,280
Promise me.

290
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,160
Though it's a wonderful world out there,

291
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,040
don't forget to give me a call
once in a while

292
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
to let me know

293
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,080
you are well!

294
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,280
I will.

295
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,440
Thank you, grandma.

296
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,280
I promise.

297
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,000
Please take good care of yourself, too!

298
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,320
Okay!

299
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,320
Really don't want you to go!

300
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,400
Let me see you off at the airport.

301
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,760
Don't bother.

302
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,560
I can take a cab.

303
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,600
Grandma,

304
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,240
is Ximi's stuff

305
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,120
still there?

306
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,680
Can I take a look?

307
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,920

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,760
I hope

345
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,920
when mom comes home one day,

346
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,160
she can feel

347
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,840
that you've been waiting for her."

348
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,200
"It's been three years, one month
and 19 days since Ximi was gone.

349
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,760
Ximi, you really guided me to your mom!

350
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,280
We all think of you in our own ways!"

Say bye to the teacher!

Practice hard after you are home!

384
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,360
Bye!

385
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,360
Bye! Bye!

386
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,480
Let's go.

387
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,800
Bye! Practice hard!

388
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,320
Bye!

389
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,680
Hi, excuse me!

390
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,600
Is Mr. Yi here?

391
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,520
Xiyi isn't here right now.

392
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,640
What's up?

393
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,840
Strange.

394
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,760
Then why did his assistant Anson

395
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,200
tell me to find him here?

396
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,000
What's going on?

397
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,920
Oh, here's the thing.

398
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,040
The database of our firm got attacked

399
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,280
by virus some time ago.

400
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,240
So we'll use Cloud to share

401
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,720
the contracts with our important clients.

402
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
To be safe though,

403
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,040
we still need the customers
to sign for it in person.

404
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,520
I'm here to deliver
the Cloud link and password.

405
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,280
Shouldn't you deliver the contracts

406
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,800
of Cheng Jie to its head office?

407
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,120
I've already done that.

408
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,720
And now I'm delivering

409
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,120
Mr. Yi's personal contracts.

410
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,200
Though I don't know what's in it,

411
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
it may just be something
like division of property

412
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,840
or divorce agreement.

413
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,960
I've been running around
everywhere these days!

414
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,120
I still have eight clients to go today!

415
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,280
Oh.

416
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,360
I'm sorry.

417
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,280
Since Mr. Yi isn't here,

418
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,320
I'll just deliver it to Anson.

419
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,560
Excuse me! Wait!

420
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
You can leave it to me.

421
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,760
Mr. Yi will be here shortly.

422
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,600
I can give it to him.

423
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,440
Oh! Okay!

424
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,480
Please sign here.

425
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,880
Thank you!

426
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,080
The information is in here.

427
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,800
Thank you!

428
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,200
Sorry!

429
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,200
I can't let you keep making mistakes

430
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,800
just for your own happiness.

431
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,240
Miss Shi has signed for the file.

432
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,460
(Our law firm's databases got infected by virus,
your files will be shared to you by Cloud.)

433
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,240
Hello, brother.

434
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,600
The guy just now wasn't from the law firm.

435
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,760
He's just a friend of mine.

436
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
That Cloud website was fake,

437
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,320
so was the file.

438
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,280
You deleted it so fast.

439
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,880
Does it mean that you are afraid

440
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,240
that the real file from three years ago
will be exposed?

441
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,200
I don't know what you are talking about.

442
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,240
I've asked Wang Xiyi

443
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,800
about the contents of the agreement.

444
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
It was the same as you told.

445
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,320
But the one Jiaxin received
was totally different.

446
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,320
So what happened to the agreement?

447
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,440
I don't know.

448
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,080
You do know!

449
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,000
And you are the only one
who knows about the truth!

450
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,440
Jiaxin told me

451
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,280
that you handed the agreement to her.

452
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,280
Do I need to continue?

453
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,040
Anna.

454
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,760
I'm your brother.

455
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,040
No matter what happens,

456
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,160
we can face and solve it together.

457
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,320
Why do you lie to me?

458
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,760
Don't make mistakes again, okay?

459
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,520
Alright.

460
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,320
I did change the agreement.

461
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,400
But it was three years ago.

462
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,520
Can we just forget about it?

463
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,000
Don't you understand?

464
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,520
From the moment you decided to do it,

465
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,960
there was already no turning back!

466
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,240
After you signed for the file,

467
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,280
I called Wang Xiyi for a meeting.

468
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,760
I'll go

469
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,640
tell him the truth.

470
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,720
No!

471
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,680
Brother!

472
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,320
Please let me explain!

473
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,960
Brother!

474
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,520
I'm begging you! Please don't tell Xiyi!

475
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,760
Brother!

476
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,960
Say something! Brother!

477
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,240
Brother!

478
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,840
Say something!

479
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,640
Hello?

480
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,880
Brother!

481
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,680
What's going on with you two?

482
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,200
I changed the supplemental agreement

483
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,840
you gave to Jiaxin three years ago!

484
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,480
What did you say?

485
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,880
The agreement said you'd give Chen Jiaxin

486
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,720
half of your property

487
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,760
and the custody of Ximi,

488
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,600
so that she'd feel secure.

489
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,640
So I changed it to you'd divorce Jiaxin

490
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,680
and take away the custody of Ximi,

491
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,200
as well as deprive her of visitation right.

492
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
If I didn't care about you,

493
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,200
why would I alter that agreement
as a guarantee?

494
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,040
Guarantee?

495
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,440
Sure!

496
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,560
The agreement is always
in the best interest of Party A.

497
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,880
As one who's used to being Party A,

498
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,800
you've always made deal with me

499
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,240
from a businessman's point of view!

500
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,960
I was the one ended up getting hurt!

501
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,080
The only one!

502
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,080
Jiaxin misunderstood you.

503
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,880
Why did you do that?

504
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,440
Because I was in love with Jiaxin.

505
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,880
And now I'm Anna's brother,

506
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,040
I hope Anna can have you.

507
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,160
Then why did you come here

508
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,560
to tell me this all of a sudden?

509
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,240
Jiaxin will leave Shanghai today.

510
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,080
And I don't know when she'll be back.

511
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,080
It's not over yet!

512
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,400
I know you didn't do it!

513
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,640
He could see through my lie so easily.

514
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,840
I really lost, completely.

515
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,800
Why didn't you tell him the truth?

516
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,520
Why?

517
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,440
I promised you

518
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,560
that I'd face it with you together.

519
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,040
Brother!

520
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,880
Sorry!

521
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,360
I'm so sorry!

522
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,880
I won't be stubborn anymore!

523
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,560
I promise I won't!

524
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,160
Brother, thank you!

525
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,760
Thank you, brother!

526
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
With your love,

527
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,880
I don't have to

528
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,600
force myself,

529
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,960
or force others anymore!

530
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,200
Hello, Anson.

531
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,280
Have you delivered the stuff

532
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,280
to the check-in counter?

533
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,280
Yes, I have.

534
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,680
Okay!

535
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,680
You are Chen Jiaxin, right?

536
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,120
Yes.

537
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,720
Please hold on.

538
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,560
Mr. Wang Xiyi asked us to give this to you.

539
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,360
Thank you!

540
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Here's your ticket.

541
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,520
Thanks!

542
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,840
Chen Jiaxin!

543
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,080
Xiyi!

544
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,880
Open the envelope and take a look!

545
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,440
No.

546
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,640
I know you are Mr. W.

547
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,480
What if I opened it up

548
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,080
and didn't

549
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,720
want to leave anymore?

550
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,440
We have

551
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,040
a barrier because of Ximi.

552
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,280
Why are you so nice to me

553
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,240
that I can't hate you?

554
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,680
And why do you always hurt me

555
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,160
and make it impossible for me to love you?

556
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,280
Please stop fooling me around!

557
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,240
Just open the envelope!

558
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,480
You'll see the truth!

559
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,480
Come on!

560
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,720
Take a look!

561
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:58,800
That's right!

562
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,600
Have a look!

563
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,960
Chen Jiaxin!

564
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,720
Please step back.

565
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,520
Next.

566
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,280
But...

567
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,040
"Jiaxin,

568
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,720
I've heard what happened
between you and my brother.

569
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,200
And I also thought it through.

570
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,400
Love is not something I can force to happen.

571
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,680
It doesn't matter how hard I work on it,

572
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,560
if it's not meant to be,

573
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,760
then it's not.

574
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,040
I heard you'd leave Shanghai.

575
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,640
Maybe we won't see
each other again in the future.

576
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,000
I want to sincerely apologize to you!

577
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,720
I was too jealous to think straight.

578
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
I used your trust

579
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,960
and changed the agreement secretly.

580
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,080
Because of my selfishness and pride,

581
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,160
I caused a lot of trouble

582
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,680
for you

583
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,760
and Xiyi,

584
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,480
and also hurt you a lot.

585
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,120
I'm so sorry!

586
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,720
I hope you can forgive me!

587
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,920
You are a very nice girl.

588
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,800
Hope wherever you are

589
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
or whomever you are with,

590
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,400
you'll have a happy life!

591
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,120
If you can forgive me,

592
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,240
when you come back to Shanghai,

593
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,800
I hope we can have a meal together,

594
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,440
so that I can apologize to you in person."

595
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,160
Wang Xiyi!

596
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,200
What's inside?

597
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,680
This is

598
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,560
the divorce agreement,

599
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,840
a supplemental agreement
to replace the premarital agreement.

600
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,200
The one from three years ago

601
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,680
was changed.

602
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,080
We were both cheated.

603
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,400
So you didn't abandon me?

604
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,520
You are all I want!

605
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,520
You are my destiny!

606
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,520
Inglemirepharm's! My best skin-care friend!

607
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,640
It's my most important day!
I'll count on you!

608
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,080
Calm down!

609
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,640
What if she runs away again?

610
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,200
No way! I'll get her back if she does.

611
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,400
I,

612
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,120
Wang Xiyi.

613
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,400
I,

614
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,240
Chen Jiaxin.

615
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,080
Take you to be

616
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,680
-my Husband.
-my Wife.

617
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,720
To have and to hold from this day forward,

618
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,480
for better, for worse,

619
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,360
for richer, for poorer,

620
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,240
in sickness and in health

621
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,240
to love and cherish,

622
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,960
till death

623
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,360
do us part.

624
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,280
Even death

625
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,600
can't do us part!

I've always wanted to ask you a question.

663
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,360
You must answer it honestly.

664
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,200
Then go ahead

665
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,200
and ask.

666
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,840
When did you exactly

667
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,200
fall in love with me?

668
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,680
We've been through a lot.

669
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,520
Is that important?

670
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,760
Of course, it is.

671
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,360
I was just nobody back then.

672
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,080
But Anna was so beautiful and outstanding.

673
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,920
I just can't figure out

674
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,480
why you'd

675
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,800
fall in love with me.

676
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,480
Silly!

677
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,280
You still don't get it?

678
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,000
When it comes to love,

679
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,000
when and why don't matter at all.

680
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,040
If you must know,

681
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,920
