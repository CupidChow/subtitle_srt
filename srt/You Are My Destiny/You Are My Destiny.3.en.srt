Well...

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,440
Hey.

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,240
Over there.

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:51,880
It seems...

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,040
So many people.

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,640
What is going on?

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,560
I have no idea.

35
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,280
Hey,

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,920
you said you wanted to have an early night.

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,440
Go back and have a good sleep.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,080
Oh.

39
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,560
Oh, one more thing.

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,120
Here.

41
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,960
Your ring.

42
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,760
Thanks.

43
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,240
Look.

44
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,680
It's so beautiful.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,000
I have planned a romantic proposal
for Anna on this cruise ship.

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,760
What a pity.

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,720
Shit!

48
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,840
I forgot to cancel it!

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

50
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,960
good evening.

51
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,680
Welcome aboard Costa Venezia,

52
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,760
our beautiful new cruise ship.

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,120
I'm your captain Mario.

54
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,320
And tonight, I'm commissioned by Mr. Wang Xiyi
to witness his wedding ceremony.

55
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,480
No, no, no, no.

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,600
No, no, no, no, no.

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
What is he talking about?

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,840
The proposal I planned for Anna.

59
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,320
He...

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,240
He is taking you for Anna.

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,880
As you can see, the newlyweds
are waving to us

62
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,360
enthusiastically.

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,000
So,

64
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,960
now it's our time to let them
give back our enthusiasm.

65
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,720
Congratulations on getting married!

66
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,280
This way, please.

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,520
Come over here.

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,520
Let's go downstairs first.

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,920
Come on.

70
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,560
You have helped me a lot.

71
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,280
This time, let me help you through this.

72
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:30,120
Marry him!

73
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, I do.

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,560
Mr. Wang,

75
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,920
would you like to marry
the lady in front of you?

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,840
Mr. Wang, would you like to marry

77
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,200
the lady in front of you?

78
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
To love her, be loyal to her,

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,040
whether she is poor, sick,
disabled, until she dies?

80
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,920
Yes, I do.

81
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,680
Miss Anna,

82
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,160
would you like to marry
the gentleman in front of you?

83
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,960
To love him, and be loyal to him,

84
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,640
whether he is poor, sick,
disabled, until he dies?

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,560
Yes, I do.

86
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,040
Is anyone against this marriage?

87
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,400
No.

88
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,960
Mr. Wang, now it's time you can offer
your wedding ring to your spouse.

89
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,160
And now, you can sign
your wedding certificate.

90
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,020
(Wang Xiyi)

91
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,600
His name is Xiyi. What a weird name.

92
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
Shall I sign it?

93
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,160
When you play the role,
you play it to the full.

94
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:49,300
(Wang Xiyi)

95
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,380
(Wang Xiyi & Chen Jiaxin)

96
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,240
Wow, that's her name.

97
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,920
It seems her parents did wish
for a raise for her.

98
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
(Jiaxin is pronounced
as "salary raise" in Chinese.)

99
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,680
Congratulations! Now, you're married!

100
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,360
Have a kiss.

101
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,600
You may kiss your bride.

102
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,320
Have a kiss.

103
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,360
And now, it's time for you to dance for us.

104
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,480
Please.

105
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,480
Do we have to dance?

106
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,520
I don't know how to dance.

107
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,040
I don't even know how to do
the radio calisthenics.

108
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,320
Believe in yourself.

109
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,480
You can do it.

110
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,720
In my heart

111
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,640
I know this night and his embrace

112
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,040
belong to

113
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,680
another woman.

114
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,560
But

115
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,160
I still feel happy.

116
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,720
I wish that time

117
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,160
could slow down for tonight.

118
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,560

are you even listening to what you're saying?

157
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,120
Yesterday...

158
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,960
How can you say it so lightly?

159
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,520
You embarked on this journey

160
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,280
with your plan to propose to her.

161
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,880
You must feel frustrated

162
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,800
about the way things turned out.

163
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,240
Did you think for yourself?

164
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,160
Yes, I did.

165
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
If

166
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,640
someone really likes me,

167
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,840
he would accept my past.

168
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,120
But you're different.

169
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,240
I know

170
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,320
you're a good person.

171
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,960
Because of me,

172
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,920
you hurt the girl you want
to spend the rest of your life with.

173
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,040
I hate myself for it.

174
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,240
I wish you the very best.

175
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,120
I know

176
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,680
that I'm plain

177
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,560
and ordinary.

178
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,400
You are the one

179
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
who always encourages me

180
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,080
to be a better version of myself.

181
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,120
You don't have to apologize

182
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,720
for what happened last night.

183
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,360
Think of it as a dream.

184
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,440
Now that we've wakened up from it,

185
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,320
we should forget about it.

186
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,320
We should move on.

187
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,240
That's all I want to say.

00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,120
why are you crying?

198
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,240

You should be grateful that

216
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,080
Alright?

217
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,720
Alas.

218
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,120
Hey, did you have a wonderful night?

219
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,880
Come on.

220
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,520
Anna got off the ship.

221
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,800
She didn't stay aboard?!

222
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,200
Well,

223
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
did last night's light show

224
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,400
go to waste?

225
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,560
Not really.

226
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,720
At least,

227
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,880
someone appreciated it.

228
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:48,840
Excuse me.

229
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,400
Wait a moment.

230
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,640
Oh,

231
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,440
shit!

232
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,280
Mr. Yi, I've got bad news for you.

233
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,360
Someone stole and used your credit card.

234
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,440
The bank just sent me

235
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,520
last night's bill,

236
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,120
covering the consumption
of high heels, fancy dress,

237
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,360
overall skincare, make-up...

238
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,360
It is not credit card fraud.

239
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,480
What?

240
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,400
If Anna didn't get on board,

241
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
then what are these things for?

242
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,760
Hello?

243
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,800
He hung up the phone.

244
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,520
It's weird.

245
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
Does the one-woman man

246
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,040
have a secret lover?

247
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,600
That's unbelievable.

248
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,960
Room service.

249
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:44,880
Hello.

250
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,720
This is the gift

251
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,480
from Wang Xiyi.

252
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,360

254

Chen Jiaxin,

255
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,160
I'm sorry.

256
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,960
Don't forget

257
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,760
to be a better version of yourself.

258
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,800
Try to

259
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,840
make every day count.

260
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,520
Be that quiet, plain girl

261
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,400
you have always been.

262
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,520
Resign yourself to mediocrity, Chen Jiaxin.

263
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,520
Because that's the way you are.

264
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:35,060
(No. 3 Gate)

265
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,760
Chen Jiaxin!

266
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,360
Take good care of yourself.

267
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,480
See...

268
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,600
Never see you again.

269
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,560
I hope that she can finally meet someone

270
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,120
who cherishes her.

271
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,080
Hello.

272
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,600
Hi, Dylan.

273
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,200
-Hi.
-Hi.

274
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,800
Hi, Dylan.

275
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,080
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

276
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,560
Remember?

277
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,360
You've lost to me thirteen times.

278
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,960
Do you wanna play again?

279
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,760
Yes, of course.

280
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,840
Just because you got lucky
from the lucky chip.

281
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,760
Okay.

282
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,920
Hey, kid.

283
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,320
Come on. Deal.

284
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,360
Wait a minute.

285
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,360
Show hand.

286
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,440
Dylan,

287
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
not all the cards are on the table.

288
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,280
Are you trying to lose? So before my call,

289
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,240
I can give you a chance to repent.

290
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,120
No, Tom.

291
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,520
Thanks for your kindness.

292
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,720
But,

293
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,960
if I win you this time,

294
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,560
I don't want your money.

295
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,360
I just want your lucky chip.

296
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
Why do you want my lucky chip?

297
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,760
Give me a reason.

298
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,640
I'm looking for something
which is hard to find.

299
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,320
That's why I need a little luck.

300
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,320
Okay.

301
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,640
I call.

302
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,640
Hope you can bring me good luck

303
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,360
to find my sister.

304
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,080
Is this yours, sir?

305
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:21,920
Thank you.

306
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,720
You're welcome.

307
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,600
You both pick the same thing
at the same time.

308
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,040
That means you're a good match.

309
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,120
Gentleman does not take advantage
of a beautiful lady.

310
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,000
Lady first.

311
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,360
Thank you.

312
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,560
How much?

313
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,640
Ten euros.

314
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,240
Okay.

315
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,760
Sir, could I look at that one, please?

316
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,600
Hi, Tom.

317
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,800
Hi, Dylan. How are you?

318
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,160
Sure. Wait a second.

319
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,840
Have a close look of it.

320
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,560
It's a nice bracelet of oblate figures.

321
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,560
Could I buy this

322
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
for my mother's birthday?

323
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,920
Oh, wait and see how much it is in euro.

324
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,800
Okay, it's one hundred and ten thousand.

325
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,520
How much you got there?

326
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,320
Looks like, well, that you don't have enough, mate.

327
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,320
That's seventy thousand here looks to me.

328
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,560
That's not gonna be enough for this piece.
It's jewelry-quality.

329
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,160
But

330
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,400
could I please buy it for my mother?

331
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,560
I'm so sorry. I cannot. I cannot.

332
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,720
May I have a look?

333
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,720
Hi, Dylan.

334
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,800
Sure, you can have it.

335
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,600
I'll pay for the difference.

336
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,000
It's your lucky day.

337
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,800
That's I get.

338
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,120
And I will lace it up for you, alright?

339
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,880
Thank you so much.

340
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,720
You have really good taste.

341
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,760
This is from Victorian Age's jewelry.

342
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,600
It costs very much.

343
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
Congratulations!

344
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,680
Good luck.

345
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,080
So many years have passed.

346
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
Would that be you?

347
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,520
Hello.

348
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,480
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

349
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,360
It's okay.

350
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,800
Well, let's go.

351
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,480
Hope we can find the answer
which we've been wishing for.

352
00:26:59,560 --> 00:26:59,960
Let's go.

353
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,320
Okay.

354
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,160
These years,

355
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,360
I've lost count of the number of girls I met

356
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
in the hope of finding my sister.

357
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,240
If this time I still fail,

358
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,880
I'll doubt

359
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,480
if she has been kidnapped by the aliens.

360
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,640
I'm sorry.

361
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,680
I found similarities between my adoption

362
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,160
and that of your sister.

363
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,880
That's why you traveled all the way to Paris

364
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,240
to have the DNA test,

365
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,320
only to find that I'm not the person
you are looking for.

366
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,800
You are doing everything you can to find her.

367
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,440
I believe you will.

368
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,560
I wish you the very best.

369
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,640
Thank you.

370
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,920
Hope you can find your families soon.

371
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,880
Perhaps we'll meet again.

372
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,600
Perhaps.

373
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,120
Goodbye.

374
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,240
Goodbye.

375
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,760
A cup of coffee, thank you.

376
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,360
Okay.

377
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,020
(Anna invites you to a voice call...)

378
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,880
(Speaker. Hang Up. Mute)

379
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,560
Do you think it looks like you?

380
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,240
(Speaker. Hang Up. Mute)
They look so cute.

381
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,240
So I bought them.

382
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,640
I envy them.

383
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,400
For what?

384
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,280
See,

385
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,160
the girl

386
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,520
has this boy by her side.

387
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,920
Unlike me,

388
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,240
who is all alone and lonely.

389
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,720
Alright, alright.

390
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,800
The training will be over in a few days.

391
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,160
By then, I'll give the gift to you

392
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
in person.

393
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,360
One for you and one for me, okay?

394
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,120
Okay.

395
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,040
I'll be waiting for you.

396
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:09,800
Alright.

397
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,600
Bye-bye.

398
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,680
Bye-bye.

399
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,440
At that time,

400
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,240
both Chen Jiaxin and I thought

401
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,560
we could move on with our lives

402
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,280
and never meet each other again.

403
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,440
Jiaxin,

404
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,760
hand it in by 1 p.m.

405
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,480
Understood.

406
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,040
And, Mr. Yi?

407
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,760
The start-up capital is mainly
for prophase expenditure of the company.

408
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,740
(Consulate General of the Bahamas:
Dear Mr. Wang Xiyi / Mrs. Chen Jiaxin,)

409
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,300
(Please get your wedding certificate back
which you lost on Venezia at our consulate.)

410
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,800
Jiaxin, what's got into you?

411
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,120
-You just freaked us out.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

412
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,680
Why do things turn out this way?

413
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,480
Chen Jiaxin,

414
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,720
I'll meet you at the consulate.

415
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,320
Chen Jiaxin!

416
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,160
What's the situation here?

417
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,040
I thought it was a play.

418
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,120
It seems it has become reality.

419
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,160
What should we do now?

420
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,480
Are we gonna get the wedding certificate?

421
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,160
No way.

422
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,060
Let's solve the problem.

423
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,100
(Consulate General of the
Bahamas in Shanghai)

424
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,580
(Passport: Wang Xiyi)

425
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,860
(Passport: Chen Jiaxin)

426
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,000
Congratulations!

427
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,800
You have become a registered couple
in the Bahamas.

428
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,200
This is the wedding certificate

429
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,040
you left on the cruise ship.

430
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,760
Congratulations

431
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,760
on getting married!

432
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,160
Is there a mistake?

433
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,600
I don't think the certificate is valid.

434
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,960
A mistake?

435
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,280
I don't think so.

436
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,680
My apologies, sir.

437
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,880
It was a mistake.

438
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
We're not supposed to marry each other.

439
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,680
That's right.

440
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,840
We're not registered yet, right?

441
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,800
We're not supposed to marry each other.

442
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,680
We're here to make it clear.

443
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,360
A mistake?

444
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,840
Your wedding certificate
has come into effect.

445
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Can we have it annulled?

446
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,120
You want to have it annulled?

447
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,880
I don't care if it was a mistake

448
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,400
or a joke.

449
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,040
Marriage registration is a big deal.

450
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,080
It's not something
to be annulled at your will.

451
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,840
Understand?

452
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,920
You're at the consulate,

453
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,320
not the civil affairs bureau.

454
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,800
Our job is to notarize
and issue the certificate.

455
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,920
We cannot annul it for you anytime you want.

456
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,360
What?

457
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,560
(Costa Cruises)
You want a divorce?

458
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,560
We've been to the consulate

459
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,440
where we were told that our
marriage registration cannot be annulled.

460
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,440
What should we do?

461
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,320
Please wait here. I'll check it out for you.

462
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,040
Hello?

463
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,920
I've printed the meeting documents

464
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,600
and marked them with sticky notes.

465
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,680
You can find them

466
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,840
on my desk.

467
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,320
You didn't?

468
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,360
I'm sure you can find them on my desk.

469
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,240
Bye-bye.

470
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,000
You really are a sticky note girl.

471
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,880
You're needed everywhere.

472
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,160
What did you just say?

473
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,280
I didn't catch it.

474
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,280
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

475
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,680
We checked it.

476
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,640
The cruise ship is registered in the Bahamas.

477
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
So, your marriage is
registered in the Bahamas.

478
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,120
If you want to get divorced,

479
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,960
you need to handle it in the Bahamas.

480
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,960
The Bahamas?

481
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,920
It takes no less than 40 hours to get there.

482
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,040
That's right.

483
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,720
Don't tell me that I have a busy schedule.

484
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,680
Cancel them all.

485
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,680
I'm going to the Bahamas.

486
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,200
Now, I need you to book an airline ticket

487
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,880
to the Bahamas for me.

488
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,960
No, two tickets.

489
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,160
I'll send you the passport.

490
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,840
I'm sorry.

491
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,520
I shouldn't have written down my name

492
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,680
on that certificate.

493
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,240
Come on.

494
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,000
Don't say that.

495
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,800
People might think of me as...

496
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,440
A bad guy.

497
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,520
Totally a bad guy.

498
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,440
Hush, lower your voice down.

499
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,880
My apologies

500
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,960
for my attitude.

501
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,760
I was anxious.

502
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,760
It's okay.

503
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,600
I know...

504
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,120
That girl is really silly.

505
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,640
She hasn't seen much of the world.

506
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,600
She is such an easy target.

507
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,080
How could he do this?

508
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,960
Give me your passport.

509
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,120
I'll book the airline ticket.

510
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,000
Oh.

511
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,360
So,

512
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,920
do we really need to go to the Bahamas?

513
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,640
Of course.

514
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,520
If it's possible,

515
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,680
I'd like someone to handle it for me.

516
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,080
One more thing.

517
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,960
Now that we decide to get a divorce,

518
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,000
I want to ask you a favor.

519
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,960
What favor?

520
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,800
Please keep the whole thing

521
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,640
a secret.

522
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,800
Don't tell anyone about it.

523
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,840
Impossible.

524
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,520
If I were you,

525
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,320
I won't let him off the hook so easy.

526
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,640
How can you get divorced

527
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,720
without getting the house
as the compensation.

528
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,760
House prices are skyrocketing in Shanghai.

529
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,040
You should negotiate.

530
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,000
Exactly.

531
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,480
Well,

532
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,440
maybe we should pick a new place
to have the conversation.

533
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,200
You have my word.

534
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,680
You can rest assured.

535
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,720
I'll never tell anyone about it.

536
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,560
I'll keep you out of this.

537
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,200
No more bid?

538
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,160
Now,

539
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,000
one million and six hundred
thousand yuan, first.

540
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,520
One million and six hundred
thousand yuan, second.

541
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,400
One million and six hundred
thousand yuan, third.

542
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,000
Sold.

543
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,280
The Lantian jade artworks by Zhongshan Long
goes to Mr. Dylan

544
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,320
who offers one million
and six hundred thousand yuan.

545
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,160
Let's congratulate him.

546
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,560
The next item.

547
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,720
This item is not included

548
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,640
in the auction list.

549
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,560
It's a random piece.

550
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,840
The auction number

551
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,240
is A0936.

552
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,800
It's created by Mr. Chang Fengge,
the late painter.

553
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,200
Okay.

554
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,720
We start

555
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,840
at twenty thousand yuan.

556
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,200
Any bid?

557
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,880
It must be created by Chang Fengge

558
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,320
before he became famous.

559
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,840
It is worth no more than fifty thousand yuan.

560
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,480
No one would bid for it.

561
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,360
I heard his son is autistic.

562
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,440
The treatment costs a lot of money.

563
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,160
It seems

564
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,440
everything valuable has been sold,

565
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,880
otherwise this lame piece of work
won't be put up for sale.

566
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,120
That makes sense.

567
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,440
Sixty thousand yuan.

568
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,120
Wow.

569
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,280
Mr. Dylan offers sixty thousand yuan.

570
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,280
I believe it will be worth the trip.

571
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,760
You got the Lantian jade artworks
by Master Zhongshan Long.

572
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,440
Now you're bidding for the painting.

573
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,080
Any more bid?

574
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,200
Is there a seventy thousand yuan?

575
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,520
Seventy thousand yuan.

576
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,560
Okay, this gentleman offers
seventy thousand yuan.

577
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,720
No more bid?

578
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,760
Is there an eighty thousand yuan?

579
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,880
Okay, this gentleman offers
eighty thousand yuan.

580
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,840
Ninety thousand yuan.

581
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,160
This gentleman offers ninety thousand yuan.

582
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,800
One hundred thousand yuan.

583
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,320
Okay, this gentleman offers
one hundred thousand yuan.

584
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,840
Any more bid?

585
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,840
If so,

586
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,680
one hundred thousand yuan,

587
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,720
first.

588
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,680
One hundred thousand yuan,

589
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,960
twice.

590
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,040
One hundred and fifty thousand yuan.

591
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,320
This gentleman offers
one hundred and fifty thousand yuan.

592
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,720
Any more bid?

593
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,080
Any more?

594
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Any other bid?

595
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,920
If so,

596
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,520
one hundred and fifty thousand yuan, first.

597
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,520
One hundred and fifty thousand yuan, second.

598
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,560
One hundred and fifty thousand yuan, third.

599
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,160
Sold.

600
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,360
Congratulations to this gentleman

601
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,200
who gets the item with
one hundred and fifty thousand yuan.

602
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,160
Congratulations!

603
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,560
Sir, please sign in here.

604
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,240
Okay.

605
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,720
Please put it in a box for delivery.

606
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,520
It's a gift for someone.

607
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,360
No problem, sir.

608
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,360
Dylan.

609
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,480
Hi, Mrs. Chang.

610
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,120
Thank you for what you've done for us.

611
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,840
You're welcome.

612
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,160
I didn't buy the painting.

613
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,360
I feel I'm not being very helpful.

614
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,800
Without your help,

615
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,920
the auction wouldn't be held in advance.

616
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
You helped us to get high-price offers.

617
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,560
That's because Mr. Chang
is an excellent painter.

618
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,640
It's very nice of you to say so.

619
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,320
Are you learning painting?

620
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,440
Mr. Chang is a prestigious painter.

621
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,480
Keep working on it.

622
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,800
You could be an even more brilliant artist.

623
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,280
The Autism Association

624
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,120
is holding a charity exhibition
for the children.

625
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,200
His works are to be displayed.

626
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,560
I'll be there.

627
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,800
Chen Jiaxin?

628
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,280
Siqi.

629
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,480
Hello, handsome.

630
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,040
Would you give me a 20% discount?

631
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,960
Nice car.

632
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,480
May I have your WeChat number?

633
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,960
I'll call you when I need a ride.

634
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:40,920
Hey.

635
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,040
Hey.

636
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,240
What's the problem with you?

637
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,680
It's a pity for that handsome guy

638
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,240
to have such bad temper.

639
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,200
You should make a complaint.

640
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,520
Alright,

641
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,160
alright.

642
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,320
You got off early?

643
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,440
Got off?

644
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,160
I wish.

645
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,280
I'm back home to pack up some clothes.

646
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,000
I'll be sleeping in the office these days.

647
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,160
Why?

648
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,280
Don't get me started.

649
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,040
It's all because of a client named Wang Xiyi.

650
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,120
Wang Xiyi?

651
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,160
He is our client?

652
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,040
It sounds like you know him.

653
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,480
Do you know him?

654
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,360
No, no, no.

655
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,480
Is he your client?

656
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,800
Do you know him well?

657
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,280
He is one of our big customers.

658
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,840
Our boss is taking care of him.

659
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,440
Who am I to contact him?

660
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,360
Employees like me

661
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,840
are in the logistic support team.

662
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,400
Perhaps you don't know

663
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,680
that he is thinking
of dismissing all his employees

664
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,240
for the automatic production.

665
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,000
Anything wrong?

666
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:53,840
Ah.

667
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,640
Nope.

668
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,040
I'm thinking perhaps
I'll deliver the meals for you.

669
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,360
Are you nuts?

670
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,200
In this case, we should order food in

671
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,080
and get reimbursed,

672
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,040
otherwise we'll never get the chance again.

673
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,760
Okay.

674
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,560
Let's go.

675
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,920
Hey,

676
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,200
what do you want to have for dinner?

677
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm thinking of

678
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
hotpot.

679
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,200
Okay, we're gonna have

680
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
hotpot.

681
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,000
It would be your treat.

682
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,160
No problem.

683
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,760
What's the situation here?

684
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,680
Where does it stop?

685
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,680
Mr. Yi.

686
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,560
Mr. Yi,

687
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,640
here are the airline tickets to the Bahamas.

688
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,640
This one is for you.

689
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,760
This one is for...

690
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,040
For Miss Chen Jiaxin.

691
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,480
Do you want me to deliver it to her

692
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,960
or will you give it to her in person?

693
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,360
Give it to me.

694
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,040
Bro,

695
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,120
what's got into you?

696
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,640
I've known you for so many years.

697
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,360
I've never seen you

698
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,800
care so much about a girl except Anna.

699
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,360
Do you have too much time on your hands?

700
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,760
Do you want something to do?

701
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,640
No, no, no.

702
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,040
Mr. Yi,

703
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,200
it's time we left

704
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,720
for the meeting with Mr. Shen.

705
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:07,880
Mr. Yi.

706
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,760
We have an appointment
with Mr. Shen, the lawyer.

707
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,520
He is in a meeting.

708
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,520
It would be nice

709
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,680
if you could wait a moment.

710
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,520
I'll show you to the rest area.

711
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,800
Hi, this is for Mr. Wang.

712
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,600
No problem.

713
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,160
Thank you.

714
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,760
You're welcome.

715
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,320
My period is late

716
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,320
for three days.

717
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,200
It is always punctual.

718
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,240
Please wait for a moment.

719
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:08,640
Okay.

720
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,360
Jiaxin?

721
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,840
Chen Jiaxin?

722
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,800
It's so weird.

723
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,680
Chen Jiaxin?

724
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,520
Have you seen Chen Jiaxin?

725
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,400
Jiaxin? I didn't see her.

726
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,920
Chen Jiaxin?

727
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,040
It's weird.
