Well.

Have you finished reading it?

33
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,600
If you've done,
remember to take it back to the company.

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,640
I have talked with your cousin.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,800
He will ask Anson

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
to acquaint you with the company.

37
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm still reading.

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,520
Once I read it through,
I will take it back to the company.

to work at the company.

He's coming again?

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,200
Three years ago,

44
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,880
his mother left the company

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
after getting it into such a big mess.

46
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,000
It took all the staff fully three months

47
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,080
to clean things up.

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,880
The whole company was a mess then.
Now he is coming again?

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,560
Gosh.

50
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,160
Does she really think that
we are problem-solving experts?

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,720
Anson, my grandma is
the chairwoman of the company.

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Since she has made the decision,

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,520
now what you're gonna do

54
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,640
is to make things go

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,160
in the right direction as she wants.

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,920
Furthermore, I have seen
his transcript in college.

57
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,080
His GPA was not bad, so he is smart.

58
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,640
I'm going to the airport in a minute.

59
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,760
So you should help him
go through all the entry formalities.

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,120
Okay. When he arrives,

61
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,240
I will perform my duty
according to the company's regulations.

It's so strange.

74
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,200
During the past two months,

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,600
I lost a relationship

76
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,080
but got married with another man

77
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,600

Something big happened.

81
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,880
Look at what you did.
You didn't even tell me.

82
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,400
What's wrong?

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
You became the top trending topic on Weibo.

84
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,840
You are known as "Sister Morning Sickness".

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,120
It's about you.

87
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,720
It was made into stickers.
Let me send them to you.

88
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,120
But how did you get pregnant?

89
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,680
Who did it? Gu Chi the jerk?

90

(Disgusting. Facepalm. Pregnancy is so hard.)

92

As the old saying goes,

93
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,520
if the baby is healthy,
the mother will throw up a lot.

94
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,240
I don't know who will be so lucky.

95

If my granddaughter-in-law
threw up like this,

96
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,920

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,400
What is it for?

170
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,440
I know that no matter
how much money I give you,

171
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,520
it cannot make up for your loss.

172
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,000
But please at least write down a number.

173
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,080
Then I can feel at ease.

174
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,400
(Guangda Bank Check)
I really don't need it.

175
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,400
But I must.

176
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,840
Last night,

177
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,160
Anna accepted my proposal of marriage.

178
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,120
So

179
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,960
you are afraid that I might hang up on you.

180
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,880
You want to feel at ease by giving me money.

181
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,160
Can't you see things

182
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,000
from a positive perspective?

183
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,280
I just feel that

184
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,040
this is what I can do for you now.

185
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay.

186
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,400
If my accepting the money
can make you feel at ease,

187
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,760
I will accept it.

188
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,040
But it will always be a blank check.

189
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,200
By the way,

190
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,600
you said you had something to tell me.

191
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,360
No, nothing.

192
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,060
(Mom)

193
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,240
Does mom also know I am pregnant?

194
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,340
(Mom)

195
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,000
Baby, he is your father.

196
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,640
He is a capable and righteous person.

197
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,720
I'm sorry. Mom cannot protect you.

198
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,280
The three of us can only
be together for a short time.

199
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,400
Only if you disappear,

200
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,600
will he be happy,

201
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,880
and thus he won't be hindered by me.

202
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,680
What do you mean by
"we didn't pay the money"?

203
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,680
It was agreed that the money
should be paid today.

204
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,400
But I didn't receive

205
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,960
the approval document signed by the Chairwoman.

206
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,560
What?

207
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,000
It's impossible.

208
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,120
Wang Zhengren should
have brought it here, hasn't he?

209
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,560
Where is he?

210
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,320
Have you called him?

211
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,680
Yes. But no one answered the phone.

212
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,440
Could you wrap these up for me please?

213
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,280
Do you have any discount at present?

214
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,800
Yes.

215
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,440
Mom.

216
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,320
What do you think of it?

217
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,960
Wow, son.

218
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,040
The color suits you well.

219
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,040
You look great in it.

220
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,200
And I have just picked these two for you,

221
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,560
which, I think, will suit you well.

222
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,400
Try them on.

223
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,000
What?

224
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,240
Again?

225
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,440
It's the third store we stepped in this morning.

226
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,080
Mom, I have a contract to send.

227
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,960
This is the first time Grandma
asks me to handle things for her.

228
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,880
I can't mess it up.

229
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,360
Right.

230
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,160
Since it is your first day at work,

231
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,040
you should make a good impression.

232
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,160
You are the grandson of the Chairwoman.

233
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,920
You are not an ordinary intern.
You should be careful of your wearing.

234
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Do as I told you. Try them on.

235
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,280
Later,

236
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,360
I will pick a name card holder
and a computer for you.

237
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,920
Be quick.

238
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,020
(Anson: 13 Missed Calls)

239
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,320
Hey!

240
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,200
Be careful.

241
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,480
Mind your step.

242
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,760
Okay.

243
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,080
This is the shortest distance
among the three of us.

244
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,480
However,

245
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,200
everything is starting to go to an end.

246
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,280
The relationship will end.
The happiness will end.

247
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,480
Why

248
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,840
am I so reluctant?

249
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:43,880
Hello.

250
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,560
Mr. Yi, we got a problem.

251
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,680
The company didn't receive

252
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,640
the document of remittance
to Huaniao Island in time.

253
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,040
So the Finance Dept.
hasn't paid the money until now.

254
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,200
The islanders has got enraged.

255
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,960
They said they would sue our company.

256
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,920
The Chairwoman asked you
to come back quickly and take care of it.

257
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,640
Hasn't Zhengren sent the document?

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,120
Yes, but we couldn't find him.

259
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,880
He didn't answer the phone.

260
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,240
And the Chairwoman doesn't know where he is.

261
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,760
Okay. I'll take care of it.

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,360
Jiaxin.

263
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,120
It seems that I can't go to the Bahamas.

264
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,960
We've got a problem in the company.
I must take care of it.

265
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,160
What about the divorce?

266
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's do it later.

267
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,680
Let me call a taxi for you.

268
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,480
Don't bother.

269
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,200
I'll get one by myself.

270
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,760
Okay. I'm sorry for that.

271
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
I don't know why.

272
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,760
But I feel relieved

273
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,280
when I fail to go to the Bahamas.

274
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,280
Hello.

275
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,200
Now you answer the phone.

276
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,040
Why didn't you answer the call

277
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,160
when I called you with my phone?

278
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,120
If I were not calling you

279
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
with the phone I borrowed
from your uncle's neighbor's son's teacher,

280
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,840
would you answer it?

281
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,440
Huh?

282
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,200
You've met such a big problem.
But you still don't let me know.

283
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,120
Take a boat and come back. Now!

284
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,960
Now?

285
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,560
Do as I told you.

286
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,400
Don't complain to me.

287
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,160
Okay. I'm coming back right away.

288
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,040
Bye.

289
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,240
It's no good.

290
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,120
Mom must have known that I got pregnant.

291
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,560
What can I do?

292
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,520
How can I explain it to her?

293
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,120
I asked you to take the document from home
to the company and give it to the Finance Dept.

294
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,680
It's an easy job.

295
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,600
But you still messed it up.

296
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,680
Wang Zhengren, I really don't know
what you were doing.

297
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,160
Oh.

298
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,200
Mom. Here is the thing.

299
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,120
It's my fault.

300
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,280
I didn't know it was so urgent.

301
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,320
And I got stuck in a traffic jam.
So it was delayed.

302
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,280
Grandma, it would be of no use
even if I made it on time.

303
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,440
Because when I arrived at the company,

304
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,240
I found the document
of Huaniao Island didn't even exist.

305
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,800
Shut up. Stop arguing.

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,520
Grandma wants to...

307
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,480
Everyone shut up.

308
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,680
Each of you is making excuses.

309
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,640
Is there anyone who can solve the problem?

310
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,360
Anson.

311
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,800
Grandma.

312
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,240
How are things going on Huaniao Island?

313
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,000
Here is the thing.

314
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,400
The moment the Chairwoman knew it,

315
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,800
she called the Finance Dept.

316
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,600
and gave a special approval to this payment.
But you should know that

317
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,840
it would take some time for the system
to pay the money.

318
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,560
Our man on Huaniao Island
said the workers had got enraged.

319
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,800
They thought we were dishonest.

320
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,560
If you don't go to the island
and make an apology today,

321
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,520
they will smash the factory at any time.

322
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,720
Furthermore,

323
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,840
they must receive the severance pay
tomorrow morning.

324
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,760
Otherwise, they will
still smash the factory.

325
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,360
Smash the factory?

326
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,200
They are angry, but I'm even angrier!

327
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,200
They will receive the money sooner or later.

328
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
Why did they ask Xiyi to go there?

329
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,080
Damn, I'll go.

330
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,480
Grandma, I mean I'll go.

331
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,120
I will go to the island.

332
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,280
What people on Huaniao Island value the most

333
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,800
are trust and character.

334
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,840
If they don't trust us anymore,

335
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,960
I think we won't win their trust back

336
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,160
no matter how hard we try.

337
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,240
So let me handle this.

338
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,720
What are you looking at? Let's go.

339
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,920
But you said you would go there alone.

340
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,880
I'm your boss.

341
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,880
I'm leaving.

342
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,160
Mom. Have a seat please. Don't be angry.

343
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,080
(Heritage Soap Factory)
So, at last,

344
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,840
if you have any idea, just speak it out.

345
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
You can just say it.

346
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,080
This is a serious and important meeting.

347
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,520
It means life or death to us.

348
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,640
We must press on with it.

349
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,760
Whoever he is,

350
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,240
we should not let him deceive us twice.

351
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,880
Yes. You're right.

352
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,360
After we catch the manager,
we will beat him up.

353
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,200
We will hit him and beat him up.

354
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
After that, we'll see
if he dares to do it again.

355
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,320
Yes.

356
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,560
But isn't it kidnapping?

357
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,200
It's illegal.

358
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,720
In a law-based society,
we need to be reasonable.

359
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,360
Then let's

360
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,880
take a civilized approach.

Hurry up. Or we'll miss the boat.

364
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,600
We'd be in trouble if we miss the boat.

365
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,000
Okay. You can go back.

366
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,280
No. Look at my big muscles.

367
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,040
I'm good at fighting.

368
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,040
I can help you if there's something wrong.

369
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,840
Alright. Suit yourself.

Sir.

372
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,960
Two tickets to Huaniao Island please.

373
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,160
It's closing time.

374
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,720
I'm off duty now. No tickets to sell.

375
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,000
No, sir. Here is the thing.

376
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,640
We have a very important thing
to deal with on Huaniao Island.

377
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,440
If we can't get there,
we'd be in big trouble.

378
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,640
You must sell the tickets to us.

379
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,680
Are you kidding? If it is really important,

380
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,440
you should have come earlier.

381
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,640
No, sir. It's a special situation.

382
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,200
Please sell

383
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,360
two tickets to us. Sir.

384
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,200
Just two tickets.

385
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,080
Please come early tomorrow.

386
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,960
No, sir. Bro.

387
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,320
Sir, don't!

Hello.

Hello, Mr. Yang, this is Tiancai.

396
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,960
Jia Tiancai. What's up?

397
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,520
If you see a guy who looks decent

398

and wears a suit,

399
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,200
be sure to get him on board.

Okay. Mr. Yang.

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah, it's you.

405
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,560
You are lucky today.

406

There you go.

408
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,160
Thank you, sir. Here is the money.

409
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,000
It's just enough, sir.

Thank you.

412
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,680
See, it's my ability.

413
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
It's my power.

414

Alright. Don't sit here. Let's go.

415
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,520
We must hurry. Or we'll miss the boat.

416
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,720
My dear Chen Jiaxin.

417
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,720
She can really freak me out.

418
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,360
She is so stupid though,
how can she cause such a big trouble?

419
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,400
If people on the island

420
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
all know this,

421
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,320
how could I show up in public?

422
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,760
Luckily, the bank clerk called me

423
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,640
and said that Jiaxin spent tens of
thousands of money with the credit card.

424
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,560
It's all past the due date.

425
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,080
She spent so much money.

426
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,760
Why didn't she tell you?

427
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,720
I'm worried now.

428
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,920
Will Jiaxin

429
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,400
borrow money from online loaning company

430
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,480
to pay off the debt?

431
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,440
I saw these online loaning companies on TV.

432
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,880
They are terrible.

433
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,840
Have those lenders noticed her?

434
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,560
That's terrible then.

435
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,920
Aunt, you don't know

436
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,160
how terrible those debt-collectors are.

437
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,360
They will splash red paint on your door

438
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,560
or call all your relatives.

439
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,000
They will even ask a large group of people

440
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,720
to smoke cigarettes outside your home
and block your way out.

441
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
I can't imagine

442
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,400
what neighbors will say when they see this.

443
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,720
She hasn't paid off the debt until now.

444
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,520
Have the debt-collectors

445
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,320
already known where we live?

446
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,720
Aunt, I don't want to scare you.

447
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,080
But they might have figured out
all the members in our family.

448
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,320
When Jiaxin comes back,

449
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,880
we should take her home quickly.

450
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,800
We can

451
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
pay back the money secretly.

452
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,880
Don't let anyone know it.

453
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,160
Yes.

454
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,720
Especially my husband and my father-in-law.

455
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,280
There are so many people in the factory.

456
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,160
If they two know it,

457
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,800
all the people on the island will know it.

458
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,920
Stop talking!

459
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,960
Stop taking photos.

460
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,460
Look at this. So funny.

461
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,300
The stickers of "Sister Morning Sickness"
are so interesting.

462
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,400
Look at them.

463
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,040
What a funny girl!

464
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,440
She is a talent, an absolute talent.

465
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,440
Look at this one.

466
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,520
Wow.

467
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,360
How terribly she is throwing up!

468
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,080
Oh my gosh.

469
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,680
Oh my gosh. The wind is strong.

470
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,920
I can't stand firmly.

471
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,640
Oh.

472
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,800
What are we doing here?

473
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,120
It's cold.

474
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,000
My hair got messy in the wind.

475
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,320
They are not working.
What are they doing on the pier here?

476
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,560
Oh.

477
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,240
Bad news always travels fast.

478
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,720
Have they all

479
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,240
already known it?

480
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,640
I don't think so.

481
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,040
You should be more energetic after a while.

482
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,800
Okay.

483
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,480
Aunt Xishi is there.

484
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,320
Let's go.

485
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,440
Are they coming near?

486
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,560
What?

487
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,800
Are they coming near?

488
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,720
Aunt Xishi.

489
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,840
Hello.

490
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Why are you standing here?

491
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,600
What are you doing here?

492
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,400
Oh.

493
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,080
The leaders are coming
from Shanghai to inspect our work.

494
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,200
We are here to welcome them.

495
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,320
Yes. We want to welcome them.

496
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,440
I see.

497
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,280
But

498
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,440
where is Tiancai?

499
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,080
Why isn't he coming with you?

500
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,840
Is he fooling around somewhere?

501
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,160
No. He is making the site ready
for the guests with the Factory Director.

502
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,720
Yes, make the site ready.

503
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,040
What are you doing here?

504
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,640
Nothing.

505
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,320
Jiaxin is coming back today.

506
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
We are here to pick her up.

507
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,880
Is that right, Aunt?

508
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,400
Yes.

509
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,680
Is Jiaxin also coming back from Shanghai?

510
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,080
Yes.

511
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,800
It's been a while since we met.

512
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,560
Here comes the boat.

513
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,840
Let's go.

514
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,760
Be prepared.

515
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,040
Be prepared to welcome them.

516
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,300
(Welcome Mr. Yi from Jie Cheng Group
to inspect and guide our work)

517
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,000
Look.

518
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,000
What?

519
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,480
Look.

520
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,240
Welcome Mr. Yi from Jie Cheng Group
to inspect and guide our work.

521
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,840
What's wrong?

522
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,640
Do they have an ulterior motive?

523
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,360
How about this?

524
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,040
Let me check it out first.
You'd better not show up.

525
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,240
Keep in touch.

526
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,520
Am I looking good?

527
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,320
Off I go.

528
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,800
Which one is Mr. Yi?

529
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,760
Do you know him?

530
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,120
Mr. Yi?

531
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,440
I haven't seen him.

532
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,120
But obviously,

533
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,440
Mr. Yi is the leader.

534
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,920
So he must be decently dressed.

535
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,320
We can recognize him easily.

536
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,880
Is Mr. Yi the man in suit?

537
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,320
Probably.

538
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,880
Yes, he is.

539
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,920
We'd better

540
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,520
act according to the situation.

541
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,380
(Shengxiang 11)

542
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,920
Are you Mr. Yi?

543
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,240
What are you doing?

544
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:11,960
What are you doing?

545
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,900
What are you doing?

546
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,540
(Shengxiang 11)

547
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,000
Mom.

548
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,080
Shame on you.

549
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,440
Let's go.

550
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,660
(Shengxiang 11)

551
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,080
Chen Jiaxin.

552
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:51,140
(No hazardous articles are permitted
to brought aboard. No climbing.)

553
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,680
What are these all about?

554
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,840
I'm telling you...

555
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,800
In broad daylight...

556
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,640
What are you doing?

557
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,720
Shut up.

558
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,000
There're so many people here.
If you don't want to humiliate your mom,

559
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,240
you'd better behave naturally.

560
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,040
Don't reveal anything yourself.

561
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,000
Keep smiling.

562
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,160
Yes.

563
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,440
Don't say anything about it here.

564
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,980
(Life First. Safe Development.)

565
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,650
(Crackdown and root out local crimes
and remove hidden danger)

566
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,320
(to improve people's sense of safety)

567
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,960
Sir.

568
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,400
We haven't got the money the Group owed us.

569
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,480
You've spent so much money.

570
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,760
What if we can't get it back?

571
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,200
Can you tell me what to do?

572
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,720
Can we hold him hostage?

573
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,920
Can we confine him?

574
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,880
We can only

575
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,760
treat Mr. Yi as the guest of honor.

576
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,280
It would be okay
if we attend to him friendly.

577
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,800
As long as Mr. Yi is here,

578
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,120
they will surely give us the money.

579
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,640
Sir. Your solution is...

580
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,160
Haha, so silly.

581
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,720
Oops.

582
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,200
Oh.

583
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,080
I mean "Sister Morning Sickness".

584
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,320
I am gonna share it to the group.
You can see her.

585
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,760
She is the daughter of Xishi, isn't she?

586
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,880
Yes, she is Jiaxin.

587
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,720
She is not married.

588
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
But how did she get pregnant?

589
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,720
This is the hometown of Chen Jiaxin.

590
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,160
After you went to Shanghai,

591
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,400
you thought you were successful?

592
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,360
I am wrong, mom.

593
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Jiaxin, tell me the truth.

594
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,320
Don't lie.

595
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,920
Your mom is good at punishment.

596
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,400
Mom. I am wrong.

597
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,960
Do whatever you can to punish me.

598
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,920
Jiaxin.

599
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,520
It is a big mistake to spend
lots of money with credit card.

600
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
But you don't need to kneel down.

601
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,040
It's good that you admit the mistake.

602
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,000
You just owed some debts.

603
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,320
We can come up with solutions together.

604
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,040
Right?

605
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,960
Debts?

606
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,600
Yes. We can come up with solutions together.

607
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,200
Aunt, Jiaxin has admitted her mistake.

608
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,120
Come. Have a seat.

609
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,000
Is it necessary to beat and scold her

610
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,800
just because of some money?

611
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,720
I am your mom.

612
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,440
Huh?

613
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,240
I put aside some money,

614
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,600
which you can use to pay off the debts.

615
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,320
But you must tell me

616
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,920
where you spent the money.

617
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,400
Turns out that mom doesn't know
that I am pregnant.

618
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,680
Why are you still waiting?

619
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,840
Thank your mom.

620
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,200
Be quick.

621
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,520
Thank you, mom.

622
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,560
I will surely be careful next time.

623
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,040
I won't squander money
with credit card anymore.

624
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,720
Well. Your mom forgives you.

625
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,040
Aunt Xishi.

626
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,040
Aunt Xishi.

627
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,600
Aunt Xishi.

628
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,880
Something happens. Something big happens.

629
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
What's wrong?

630
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,720
Jiaxin has morning sickness.

631
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,600
What do you mean?

632
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,200
I mean she throws up because of pregnancy.

633
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,080
Someone took photos of her
and posted them on the Internet.

634
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,600
Now everyone on the island has known it.

635
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,040
I didn't notice you were here.

636
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,760
Stop.

637
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:50,600
You...

638
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,520
You are pregnant?

639
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,800
Mom.

640
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,880
I'm sorry, mom.

641
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,880
Chen Jiaxin.

642
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,440
You've grown up.

643
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,280
You didn't tell me you were seeing someone.

644
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,120
How dare you got pregnant
without my knowledge!

645
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,280
What a daughter I have!

646
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,440
She is pregnant.

647
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,200
Don't beat her.

648
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,400
Get out of my way.

649
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,480
Why can't you deal with love, marriage,
and child in a proper way?

650
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,000
Why are you always being taken advantage of?

651
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,800
Mom, I'm sorry.

652
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
Mom, I was wrong.

653
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,440
Jiaxin. Where is the baby's father?

654
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,840
He knocked you up.

655
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,560
He should be responsible for this.

656
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
Actually it's not his fault.

657
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,520
I really don't want to disturb his life.

658
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,520
Mom, I will take care of it myself.

659
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,920
Take care of it yourself?
What are you gonna do?

660
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,040
Chen Jiaxin, even now

661
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,320
you are still covering up for him.

662
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,160
How can you let others bully you so easily?

663
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,240
Can you just act like me?

664
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,160
You should protect yourself.

665
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,400
Now tell me. Who is the father?

666
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,360
Are you gonna tell me or not?

667
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,200
Are you gonna tell me or not?

668
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,880
Stop! Stop beating her!

669
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,360
Get out of my way.

670
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,200
Tell me!

671
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,760
Tell me!

672
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,760
I'm the father.

673
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,240
It's none of your business. Get out of here.

674
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
How can I leave now? I...

675
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,760
Lad, since you are here, you can't go back.

676
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,520
I've been worrying that I couldn't find you.

677
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,600
Now you come to my place.

678
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,320
I'm telling you, Chen Jiaxin is a pushover.

679
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,600
Her mom is not.

680
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,280
Now you tell me

681
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,320
how you will assume responsibility for this!

682
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,800
Tell me!

683
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,160
Tell me!

684
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,280
As the CEO of a listed company,

685
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,680
and the most influential entrepreneur in Asia,

686
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,800
in the face of commercial crisis,

687
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,720
I can manage to be cool-headed

688
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,880
and come up with at least
three perfect solutions.

689
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,920
However, at this moment,
no matter how calm I am,

690
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,360
I can only answer that...

691
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,120
I don't know.

692
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,320
You don't know?

693
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,480
How dare you speak to me like that!

694
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,960
Come here!

695
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,800
Come here!

696
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,800
Mom.

697
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,880
Don't worry about him.
Your mom is backing you up.

698
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,800
Although I hope they can

699
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,360
take care of the baby together.

700
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,560
you can't let a girl
take all the responsibilities.

701
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,320
But Grandma Zhenzhu,

702
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,120
how severely you punished your grandson!

703
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,120
He who makes a mistake shall be punished.

704
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,360
If you hadn't reminded me,

705
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,400
that jerk would have boarded the plane

706
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,240
and gone to the Bahamas for a divorce
with my granddaughter-in-law.

707
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,960
I've been wondering

708
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,480
how could you be so sure that

709
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,360
Zhengren wouldn't send the document
to the company on time?

710
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,400
If Zhengren did it himself,

711
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,640
he would surely make it.

712
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,600
But he had Xiuling beside him.

713
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,240
Xiuling has been calling me mom for decades.

714
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,280
So I know well that she likes showing off.

715
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,320
She will surely mess up anything
she is dealing with.

716
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,600
Well.

717
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,880
Now

718
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,080
Xiyi should be at the factory.

719
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,400
Let him handle everything there.

720
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,360
Don't try to get divorced
once you are married.

721
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,300
(Life First. Safe Development.)

722
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,800
Mr. Yi is coming.

723
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
What is he looking for?

724
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,320
Who is he looking for?

725
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,160
Who are you?

726
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,960
Isn't he Mr. Yi?

727
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,520
He is not Mr. Yi?

728
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,760
I didn't have time
to introduce myself just now.

729
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,480
Let me introduce myself now.
I'm Anson, Mr. Yi's Special Assistant.

730
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,160
Nice to meet you.

731
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,880
Special Assistant? What is that?

732
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,440
You said you were Mr. Yi.

733
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,400
Yes. You are a liar.

734
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,920
You said you were Mr. Yi.

735
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,080
Everyone, please calm down.

736
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,560
Listen to me.

737
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,320
Mr. Yi did come to the island with me.

738
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,080
But when we reached the island,

739
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,280
I found

740
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,040
everyone was passionate,

741
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,840
exceptionally passionate.

742
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,120
So Mr. Yi decided
to keep a low profile at that time.

743
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,280
So he...

744
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,400
Where is he?

745
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,800
He is on the island.

746
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,520
Where is he?

747
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,240
He said that

748
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,320
he would

749
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,240
go and look around

750
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,960
the whole island first.

751
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,600
I'm Anson,

752
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,080
the Chief Special Assistant to General Manager

753
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,880
of Cheng Jie Group.

754
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,320
He sent me to meet you
and listen to what you would say.

755
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Is there anything you want to say or ask?

756
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,960
Or is there any suggestion you
want to make? Please tell me.

757
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,040
Say whatever you want to.

758
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,800
Don't be shy. We all belong to one team.

759
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,520
It's not proper for me to wear this.

760
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,440
Look at what you've done to me.

761
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,440
This is all that happened.

762
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,040
Really?

763
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,000
Did he tell me all the truth?

764
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,440
Actually

765
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,600
he

766
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,800
missed something.

767
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
No, I didn't hide anything...

768
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,560
What? You didn't tell me everything.

769
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,440
Mom, Mom. Actually he has been helping me.

770
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,880
He helped me to deal with that jerk.

771
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,440
My ex-boyfriend.

772
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,480
He backed me up in front of the coworkers.

773
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,280
He's been helping me.

774
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,440
Yes, Ma'am.

775
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,040
I really didn't want
to take advantage of Jiaxin.

776
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,240
I want to have a talk with you.

777
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,800
Step aside.

778
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,520
Have a talk?

779
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,240
Is this what you came here for?

780
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,120
Yes.

781
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,160
Zishan.

782
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,680
Yes.

783
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,880
Aunt.

784
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,880
Search him.

785
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,320
Okay.

786
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,900
Don't...

787
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,640
Mind your own business.

788
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:14,940
Mom.

789
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,840
Get out of my way.

790
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,160
This guy seems to be good at talking.

791
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,920
He wants to talk with me?

792
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,520
He must have figured out a way to deceive me.

793
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,080
I'm telling you, I won't be deceived.

794
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,160
I'm gonna talk with your parents.

795
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,120
Aunt, I found his cell phone.

796
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Make him open his eyes.

797
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,240
Make him open his eyes.

798
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,160
His eyes are open.

799
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:56,920
No.

800
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,880
Important contact.

801
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,480
Grandma.

802
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,920
Don't call my grandma.

803
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,920
That is not my grandma. He is my assistant.

804
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,840
I call him grandma

805
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,960
because he looks like my grandma.

806
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,840
Don't do this.

807
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,560
No. My grandma is swimming.

808
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,920
She won't answer the phone.

809
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,440
Okay.

810
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,160
Don't do this. It has nothing
to do with my grandma.

811
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,760
You won't solve the problem
even if you call my grandma.

812
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
You should talk with me!

813
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,720
The phone is ringing.

814
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,960
Hello, Xiyi.

815
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:32,800
Hello.

816
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,640
Your grandson has taken
advantage of my daughter

817
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,120
and knocked her up.
How are you going to handle this?

818
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
Are you Mrs. Chen,
my grandson's mother-in-law?

819
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,280
Finally I can talk with you on the phone.

820
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,080
Is Xiyi at your place now?

821
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,440
Whether I'm your grandson's
mother-in-law or not,

822
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,600
it all depends on
how you'll take the responsibility.

823
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,480
She's on the top trending topic on Weibo.
We will surely take the responsibility.

824
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,680
We will do what we should do.

825
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,720
Please send me your address.

826
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,960
I'm going to meet you
on the island tomorrow morning.

827
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,680
See you tomorrow.
My grandson's future mother-in-law.

828
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,040
Turns out my granddaughter-in-law
is also from Huaniao Island.

829
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,800
I had planned to prevent them
from getting divorced.

830
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,040
But...

831
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,160
Why don't we hold
a wedding ceremony tomorrow?

832
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,120
That's great.

833
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,920
But if Xiyi is at their place now,

834
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,480
what about the situation at the factory?

835
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,160
Well.

836
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,880
Folks, to tell you the truth.

837
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,200
To our company,

838
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,080
several millions of money
is just a small amount.

839
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,600
So there is no need to worry
about this small amount of money.

840
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,000
Right?

841
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,880
Since it's a small amount,
why does it take so long?

842
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,440
Because they wanted to...

843
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,160
Oh my.

844
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,120
You don't know it.

845
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,840
You don't know it. Here is the thing.

846
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,120
How did a rich person make so much money?

847
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,920
He pinched pennies.

848
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,360
If he had been extravagant with the money,

849
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,280
our company would have gone bankrupt, right?

850
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,120
So everyone, don't worry about money anymore.

851
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,280
Today our Chairwoman has made
a special approval to transfer the money.

852
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,880
It won't take long to get
into your bank accounts.

853
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,640
Everybody relax. Please relax. Okay?

854
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,440
The money has come to my account.

855
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,040
Everybody, remember what I said?

856
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,440
Don't worry about the money anymore.

857
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,760
Hey guys. Please take my advice.

858
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,320
If the first payment comes,
will the remaining be far behind?

859
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,560
Look, it's from the Chairwoman.

860
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,440
She is calling me to ask
about the money herself.

861
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:01,960
Do you see it?

862
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,800
Excuse me, I'll answer the phone.

863
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:07,960
Hello.

864
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,440
You are at the factory, aren't you?

865
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,720
My dear Chairwoman, if you hadn't
transferred the money,

866
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,080
I might have died here.

867
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,800
I transferred the money
from my personal account.

868
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,360
Tell Mr. Jia that tomorrow

869
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,440
I will meet everyone on the island.

870
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,560
You are coming here yourself? What happened?

871
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,480
It's a good thing. Since we will
be of the same family soon,

872
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,800
it's necessary for me to visit the island.

873
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,720
You've done a good job today.

874
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:36,840
Done!

875
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:37,920
Hello?

876
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,320
A good thing?

877
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,240
