25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,940
(Episode 34)

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,840
Unlike you,

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,600
he understands me

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,760
and my feelings.

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,480
He won't give me the cold shoulder at first,

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,280
then turn around and say he loves me,

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,920
but finally dump me.

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,080
He won't make a promise at first

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,760
and then break it immediately.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,760
Most importantly,

35
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,000
he won't

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,400
force me to give up my child!

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,640
He's not as cold-blooded as you are

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,120
and not as relentless as you are.

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,080
Chen Jiaxin.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,320
I could be calmer and tougher

41
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,480
than anyone,

42
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,120
but I wished I could have been treated

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,880
as a normal person

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,520
when I lost my beloved child.

45
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,440
I was distressed,

46
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
heart-broken,

47
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,680
frightened and afraid.

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,240
Cold-blooded.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a good word

50
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,320
to describe me.

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,880
Xiyi.

52
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,840
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,880
I didn't consider your pain.

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,920
Because at that time,

56
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,560
it was a big blow to me.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,320
I only felt my own pain

58
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,160
but didn't consider your love for Ximi.

59
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,640
I felt that

60
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
I was the saddest mother

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,280
in the world.

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,640
I just wanted to find a person to

63
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,720
take the responsibility and shoulder
the painful burden of losing Ximi.

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,520
So when all people came to comfort me,

65
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
you became the only person to blame for.

66
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,040
I was too selfish.

67
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,800
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,040
If you really want to say sorry,

69
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,760

Hello.

140
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,280
She never learned to dance.

141
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,960
I bring her here to know
something about children's ballet.

It doesn't matter
if she never learned to dance.

143
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,760
We have body-shaping class for children.

144
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,560
You can bring her here tomorrow
to have a go at our class.

145
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
Really? That's great.

146
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,160
By the way,

147
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,720
some parents in our kindergarten

148
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,280
also want to bring their kids here.

149
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,600
There're four kids in all.

150
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,240
I wonder if you have a discount.

151
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,320
Of course we have.

152
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,640
Looks like

153
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,160
you really care about your kids.

154
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,360

155
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000

156

158
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,480
Could you tell me

159
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,280
where you learned

160
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,680
the information about our dancing class?

161
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,520
Oh.

162
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,400
I learned it from

163
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,200
the WeChat official account of a dancer
named Hua Yuanyuan.

164

165

Thank you.

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,520
I'll bring the kids here
with the other parents tomorrow

168
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,120

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,880
Good bye.

171
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,320
Bye-bye.

172
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,080
Thank you.

173
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,400
She is lovely.

174
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,880
Take care.

175
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay.

176
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,080
Hua Yuanyuan.

177
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,800
Why did she send the information
of my class to others?

178
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,400
Hello.

179
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,320
Hello.

180
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
I got the leaflet about your dancing class.

181
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,640
I wonder...

182
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,840
Excuse me,

183
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,120
but where did you get the leaflet?

184
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,640
Mr. Fei.

185
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,800
Sorry to bother you again.

186
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,200
It doesn't matter.

187
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,280
I never thought that

188
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,840
the leaflets of your dancing class

189
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,280
are so popular.

190
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,280
See,

191
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,720
in just a few days

192
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,120
all the leaflets have been given out.

193
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,800
Thank you very much.

194
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,680
I'll invite you to dinner sometime.

195
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,240
It doesn't matter.

196
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,080
I gotta go.

197
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,840
Have some water please.

198
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,640
Thank you.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,480
You're welcome.

200
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,760
Except the leaflets,

201
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,760
are you also advertising my dancing class

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,120
on those WeChat official accounts?

203
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720
I happen to have some good friends.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,760
It's no big deal.

205
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,920
Why did you help me?

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,760
Did Wang Family ask you to do that?

207
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,040
Actually.

208
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,120
I have a sister as old as you are.

209
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,160
You share a lot in common.

210
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,760
For example,

211
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,600
you both like dancing.

212
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,240
-And you both have your own style.
-Brother, I'm coming.

213
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,120
You don't accept failure.

214
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,040
Just because I am very much like your sister?

215
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,320
It's a far-fetched reason.

216
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,120
Actually.

217
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,960
I'm a big fan of you.

218
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,880
Three years ago I went to Paris Opera House

219
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,760
especially for your performance.

220
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,440
But I never thought that
the performance was cancelled.

221
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Really?

222
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
Do you want to see my passport?

223
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,760
Are you really my fan?

224
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,920
I really hope that
you can walk onto the stage

225
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,760
and give your best performance again.

226
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,800
I am your biggest fan

227
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,880
except your foster mother.

228
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,360
How could she be my fan?

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,480
She can't wait to see my death.

230
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,400
Everybody thinks that

231
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,160
without her help,

232
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,840
I couldn't have achieved
so much success today.

233
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,760
But that's not the case.

234
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,120
My foster mother really
regretted adopting me.

235
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
She has a daughter a little older than me.

236
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,920
Her name is Shi Anfei.

237
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,400
She adopted me just for the purpose of

238
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,040
letting me be her daughter's company.

239
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,520
One, two, three, four.

240
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,680
At that time,

241
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,000
I could only peep into the classroom

242
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,640
at my sister.

243
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,720
I never thought

244
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,920
I would become a professional ballerina.

245
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,560
Seven, eight.

246
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,920
Three, two, three, four.

247
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,720
Five, six, seven, eight.

248
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,960
Four, two, three, four.

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,720
Five, six, seven, eight.

250
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Until one day,

251
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,840
the teacher discovered my talent for dancing

252
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,600
and chose me to be the leading dancer.

253
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,960
That was a real blow
to my foster mother's pride.

254
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,560
She couldn't stand me
outperforming her daughter.

255
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,840
So she was hard on me in every aspect.

256
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,440
She asked me to give up ballet.

257
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
But I really love the feeling

258
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,480
of being on the stage.

259
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,840
They didn't allow me to dance.

260
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,720
I had to work part-time
to earn the tuition for dancing class.

261
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,920
They threw away my dancing clothes.

262
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,440
I hid the clothes in the supermarket locker

263
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,240
and didn't take them home.

264
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
They didn't allow me to buy dancing shoes.

265
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,200
I asked the members of the dancing class

266
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,360
to give me all the old dancing shoes
that they had grown out of.

267
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,520
The more they made me suffer,

268
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,120
the more I want to succeed

269
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,600
and thus prove myself.

270
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
Among all the activities
that Anfei wanted to attend,

271
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,760
you cannot find one in which

272
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,440
I didn't become the focus
of everyone's attention.

273
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,000
Later,

274
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,200
in order to get the chance
to walk onto the stage,

275
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,440
she went all out to prevent me
from taking the stage.

276
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,880
Did you

277
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,520
tamper with my dancing shoes?

278
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,080
Anfei couldn't have done that.

279
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,520
Don't just blabber on.
Do you have any evidence?

280
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,240
Mom.

281
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Yesterday after class, I saw Anfei

282
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,680
sneak out of the classroom.

283
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
I called her name but she didn't answer.

284
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,760
No one could do that except her.

285
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,640
No, not me.

286
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,640
I didn't do that.

287
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,040
Obviously you did that.

288
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,600
But she has said that she didn't do that.

289
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,520
My foster mother really hated me.

290
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,880
Then I left the family
and worked hard doing part-time.

291
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,480
But when I became famous
through arduous dancing training,

292
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,920
she kept granting interviews everywhere

293
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,240
and went so far as to say that
without her teaching and training

294
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,600
I couldn't have walked
onto the international stage.

295
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,520
That's so absurd.

296
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,880
I was forgotten by the family
I was originally born into

297
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
and abandoned by the adoptive family.

298
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,120
I achieved success in my life all by myself

299
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,400
with hard work and great efforts

300
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,080
until I met Xiyi,

301
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,520
who was the only one that

302
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,200
encouraged me to pursue my dreams

303
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,320
and thought of me
as the most important person all the time.

304
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,440
At that time,

305
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,160
I finally felt the beauty of life.

306
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,720
It turns out that I can act cute

307
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,920
and willful

308
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,160
while there's a man
who loves me and cherishes me.

309
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,920
But it never occurred to me that

310
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,440
I was so unfortunate

311
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,960
that even Xiyi has left me now.

312
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,960
Never have I

313
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,680
told anything about that to anyone before.

314
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,400
Even Xiyi didn't know that.

315
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,680
Perhaps you have touched my hearts.

316
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,000
I take it as the secret
kept by both my fan and me.

317
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,560
Don't worry.

318
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,200
I'll keep the secret for you.

319
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,440
Thank you for the leaflets
and the official accounts.

320
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,320
I need to clean up the classroom.

321
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,240
Many children are coming
for the class in a while.

322
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,520
Anna.

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,400
Yes?

324
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,360
Do you still love Wang Xiyi?

325
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:15,720
Yes.

326
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,560
Then let's become allies.

327
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,520
Hello.

328
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,280
Jiaxin.

329
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Are you free tomorrow morning?

330
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,720
I want to meet you.

331
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,520
Sorry. I missed the appointment.

332
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,000
I got some trouble and couldn't leave.

333
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,520
That's all right.

334
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,560
Did you get things done?

335
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,880
Yes.

336
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,080
It seems

337
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,000
there's no chance for us to meet today.

338
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,000
Looks like we tend to run into each other.

339
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,320
I have an appointment
with my art broker tomorrow.

340
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,480
It is probably the first time

341
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,920
I get to talk with him about business
after I got back to Shanghai.

342
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,280
I'm looking forward to it.

343
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,680
Why did this guy get back
to Shanghai with her?

344
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,720
Are you sure he will only talk
about business with you?

345
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,160
If not, what'd he talk with me?

346
00:19:54,020 --> 00:20:01,060
(A man who only pays in silence
definitely has his intentions.)

347
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,480
Hello.

348
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,080
Hello.

349
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,120
I have sent you

350
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,120
the summary of yesterday's meeting by Email.

351
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:47,960
Okay.

352
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,800
And I've asked Mr. Wang to preside
over the regular meeting in a while.

353
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,000
I talked with my wife three minutes ago.

354
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,640
She said Jiaxin would soon come downstairs.

355
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,000
Finally!

356
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,960
You told me yesterday that

357
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,320
you would get along well with her

358
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,680
as Mr. W, didn't you?

359
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,160
Why are you waiting outside
her house in the early morning?

360
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,000
What's wrong with you?

361
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,520
Dylan

362
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,920
has spent three years
with Jiaxin in Hungary.

363
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,000
I managed to get her back to Shanghai.

364
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,040
But guess what?

365
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,600
He came back to Shanghai after her.

366
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,880
This guy is more difficult to deal with

367
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,480
than we've expected.

368
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,000
I have to watch out for him.

369
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,200
She's coming.

370
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,240
Why is Chen Jiaxin wearing a pink coat

371
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,040
and high heels at the same time?

372
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,160
Why wasn't she wearing them
when hanging out with me?

373
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,080
She is so attractive.

374
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
Because she was pregnant before.

375
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,240
That's different.

376
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,520
What on earth is that guy doing?

377
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,480
He shouldn't have kept
her waiting for so long.

378
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,800
Jiaxin.

379
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,520
Have you been waiting for long?

380
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,440
No.

381
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,000
What's wrong?

382
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,680
Are we going to the exhibition?

383
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,480
Today I'd like to take you to

384
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,760
meet a very important person.

385
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,040
Who is it?

386
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,280
My sister.

387
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,520
Did you find her?

388
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,840
Really?

389
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,840
What's wrong?

390
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,680
Do you think I'm kidding you about that?

391
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,560
No. No.

392
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,960
Where is she now?

393
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,080
How is she?

394
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,160
Is she blaming you?

395
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:53,960
Well.

396
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,800
Don't ask me so many questions.

397
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,960
When you meet her in a minute,

398
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,960
you'll see.

399
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:57,800
Okay.

400
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:00,960
But

401
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,360
before that,

402
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,120
we have to deal with another issue.

403
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,040
What's that?

404
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,120
Isn't it obvious?

405
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,680
It's my ex-husband who I can't get rid of.

406
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,920
Who are you?

407
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,840
Why are you sneaking around here?

408
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,160
Madam, keep quiet.

409
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm not a bad guy.

410
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,960
Stop him!

411
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,680
Don't go.

412
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,520
What's your name?

413
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,520
Where do you live?

414
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,560
Where do you work?

415
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,400
Tell us clearly.

416
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
If not, don't even think of leaving here.

417
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,360
Yes. Yes.

418
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,560
I've been watching him for long.

419
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,120
Yes.

420
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,680
He's been sneaking around.

421
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,600
This is a safe neighborhood.

422
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,360
We're gonna call the police.

423
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,320
Hey.

424
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Young man, we are talking to you.

425
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,240
We'll call the police
if you don't tell the truth.

426
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm telling you,

427
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,760
you can't go if you don't tell the truth.

428
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,800
Tell us the truth clearly.

429
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,680
Do you hear me?

430
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,440
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

431
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,920
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

432
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,200
Your sister is...

433
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,560
Who do you think is my sister in the room?

434
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,320
Anna.

435
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,400
How come?

436
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,280
Are you sure?

437
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,720
Actually, I didn't tell Anna

438
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
that I am her brother.

439
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,760
Why?

440
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
You've been looking for her for so long.

441
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,720
Why not tell her immediately?

442
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,240
She thought we abandoned her.

443
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,480
She had big misunderstanding
with the family she was born into.

444
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,000
I can clear it up if luck is with me.

445
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,600
Besides, she has high self-esteem.

446
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,560
Yesterday after she learned
that I handed out leaflets

447
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,920
and introduced students to her class,

448
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,200
she felt so ashamed of that.

449
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,120
She doesn't want anybody
to sympathize with her.

450
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,600
So

451
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,400
I could just tell her

452
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,640
that I am a fan of her.

453
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,320
I could only help her out first.

454
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,320
Jiaxin.

455
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,200
I know that

456
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,680
your relationship with Anna
is hard to handle.

457
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,840
But I don't want to lose
the most important person in my life

458
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,800
after finding my lost sister.

459
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,200
So before I tell the truth to her,

460
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,040
I want to tell that to you.

461
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,960
Considering the relationship
between Anna and me,

462
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,320
do you accept her as my sister?

463
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,320
Of course.

464
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,400
Three years ago,

465
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,520
it was I who hurt her.

466
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,120
In the end,

467
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,840
it was also I who chose to back out.

468
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,680
She didn't do anything wrong.

469
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,400
The reason why we are at odds
with each other is that

470
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,200
we both loved Xiyi at that time.

471
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,600
Bye-bye.

472
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,600
Goodbye teacher.

473
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,760
Bye-bye.

474
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,280
Bye-bye.

475
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,320
Bye-bye.

476
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,680
Qing got lost because of me.

477
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,960
I'm also responsible

478
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,280
for the great pain she has suffered.

479
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,440
So I have to go all out to make it up to her.

480
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,480
I'll give her

481
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,640
whatever she wants.

482
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,360
So Jiaxin,

483
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,160
can you be honest with me?

484
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,440
Is it possible for you
and Wang Xiyi to be reconciled?

485
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,280
It's impossible.

486
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,360
Then

487
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,040
I'd like to ask you a favor.

488
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,960
On account of me,

489
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,320
could you not contact Wang Xiyi anymore

490
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,840
and let him be with my sister again?

491
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,520
Jiaxin, I know this request is selfish.

492
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,240
But if we have

493
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,320
never broken up with each other...

494
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,240
Stop!

495
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,360
Stop talking anymore.

496
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,160
Jiaxin.

497
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,400
Don't get me wrong.

498
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,920
I'm blaming myself.

499
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,640
I don't want to put pressure on you.

500
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,560
I know.

501
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,040
I know all of it.

502
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,840
The most painful thing is that

503
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,880
you missed something

504
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,240
but you can't make up for that.

505
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,840
Besides,

506
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,400
Wang Xiyi and I...

507
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,640
Give me a hug.

508
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,520
I'll help you be the brother of Anna.

509
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,760
In return, you should help me
live an undisturbed life.

510
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,000
Wang Xiyi is right over there behind you.

511
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,040
What are you doing?

512
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,000
What are you doing in broad daylight?

513
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,040
I wanna ask you the same question.

514
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,160
I'm hanging out with my girlfriend.

515
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,120
Does that have anything to do with you?

516
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,560
What are you saying?

517
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,520
Chen Jiaxin.

518
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,360
We have broken up.

519
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,280
Don't repeat the old story.

520
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,920
Let me go.

521
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:38,960
Jiaxin.

522
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,120
Did you hear what Jiaxin said?

523
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,800
Don't disturb her anymore.

524
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,160
This is what I want to tell you.

525
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,960
You're not sure who you really love.

526
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,520
Do you think that is good for Anna?

527
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,560
As to the relationship between me and Anna,

528
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,480
it doesn't have anything to do with you.

529
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,520
Why not?

530
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,440
You kept switching back
and forth between Anna

531
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,040
and Chen Jiaxin.

532
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,360
Have you ever

533
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,440
considered their feelings?

534
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,280
Not everyone in the world

535
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,280
centers around you.

536
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,520
Nor do all women in the world

537
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,200
need you protection.

538
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,520
Stop pretending!

539
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,840
I'm gonna repeat myself.

540
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,200
Stay away from Chen Jiaxin and Anna!

541
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,760
You stay away from Chen Jiaxin and Anna!

542
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,160
Stop! Have you finished?

543
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,800
Wang Xiyi.

544
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,800
I'm with Dylan now.

545
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,040
I don't believe that.

546
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,520
I don't care if you don't believe that.

547
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,800
I have made it clear that

548
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,960
I am not alone now.

549
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,480
Dylan will always be there for me.

550
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,040
Don't disturb me anymore.

551
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,320
Don't follow me anymore.

552
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,280
Chen Jiaxin.

553
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,520
Let's go.

554
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,400
Jiaxin.

555
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,920
Thank you.

556
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,600
There's no need

557
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,040
to say that to me.

558
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,360
Had it not been for you,

559
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,160
I wouldn't have gotten the chance to be

560
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,480
what I am now.

561
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,160
If this can make Wang Xiyi

562
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,600
completely let go of me,

563
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,840
then it is a good thing

564
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,960
for me.

565
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,400
By the time

566
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,680
you're all ready to separate
from your ex-husband,

567
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,960
I'm willing to be your real boyfriend.

568
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,800
You're...

569
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,080
The greatest strength of mine

570
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,240
is that I never give up easily.

571
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,080
Like I didn't give up

572
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,160
looking for my sister.

573
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:48,960
Surprises always come to those

574
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,120
who don't give up.

575
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,480
I'm coming.

576
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,120
It's you!

577
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,840
How did you know I'm living here?

578
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,920
Jiaxin told me.

579
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,280
I have something very important to tell you.

580
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,320
May I come in and have a talk?

581
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,840
Come in please.

582
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,880
Take your seat.

583
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,720
I'll get you a glass of water.

584
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,280
Do you still remember

585
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,200
this photo?

586
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,720
Qing.

587
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,440
Brother.

588
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,320
Qing.

589
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,200
Brother.

590
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,440
Brother.

591
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,520
Qing.

592
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,440
How come you have this photo?

593
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Who the heck are you?

594
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,960
I'm Dylan.

595
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,360
I am your brother.

596
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,240
Qing.

597
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,960
I don't want to conceal the truth anymore.

598
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,760
I'm so stupid that

599
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,200
it took me more than
twenty years to find you.

600
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,680
I'm sorry.

601
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,440
Since the day you were missing,

602
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,360
I,

603
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,760
together with dad and mom,

604
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,440
have been trying to find you all the time.

605
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,800
All the time.

606
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,680
Your place setting

607
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,640
is always put on the table.

608
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,640
Your favorite food

609
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,720
is always kept in the fridge.

610
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,720
When our parents were dying,

611
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,080
they held my hands and

612
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,400
asked me to find you no matter what.

613
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,720
If I hadn't harbored a grudge or

614
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,040
if I had been willing to find the truth,

615
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,680
perhaps my life would be different.

616
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,800
Qing.

617
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,120
It's never too late to know it.

618
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,040
From now on,

619
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
I'll protect you.

620
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,320
Let your brother protect you forever.

621
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,080
Brother.

622
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,080
Okay.

623
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:30,920
As a bride-to-be,

624
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,720
you should stay calm like this

625
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,680
and lie down for ten minutes.

626
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,200
I

627
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,800
have agreed to be with Dylan.

628
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,600
What?

629
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,480
Since when?

630
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,320
Yesterday.

631
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,200
That doesn't make sense.

632
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,040
Why do you suddenly start seeing him?

633
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,800
Because...

634
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,040
On account of me,

635
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,280
could you not contact Wang Xiyi anymore

636
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,400
and let him be with my sister again?

637
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,120
Because

638
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,640
I don't think it's appropriate for me

639
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,960
to be with Wang Xiyi anymore.

640
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,960
I want to give him a reason to give up.

641
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,360
Fortunately,

642
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Dylan is willing to help me.

643
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,040
So

644
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,480
you two are pretending to go out, aren't you?

645
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,280
Yes.

646
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,640
Chen Jiaxin.

647
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,720
I don't want to blame you.

648
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,600
But when I was happy about
your marrying the domineering boss,

649
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,560
you told me that you were just pretending,

650
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
with no love for each other.

651
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,400
Okay.

652
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,120
Then I tried to bring you and Dylan together,

653
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,480
but you went to Hungary without telling me.

654
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,040
Siqi.

655
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,840
I haven't finished.

656
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Now you are back.

657
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,080
I let you know better of your inner self

658
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,800
and reconcile with Wang Xiyi.

659
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,800
But out of nowhere

660
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,320
came someone called Mr. W.

661
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,080
By a strange twist of fate,

662
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,280
you're finally with Dylan.

663
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,640
But now you're telling me that
you two are just pretending.

664
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,920
My lady.

665
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,880
I got confused.

666
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,160
Could you just give me a definite message?

667
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,280
Okay?

668
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,080
I mean it.

669
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,360
If you decide to be with Dylan,

670
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,520
I'll also be supportive of you.

671
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,920
I beg you not to be supportive of me.

672
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,680
There's not any chance of us being together.

673
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,400
Chen Jiaxin.

674
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,440
You just have too many choices
to make a right decision.

675
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,680
Dylan enjoys financial well-being

676
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,760
with a car to drive and a place to live.

677
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,720
As to his character,

678
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,960
he is open-minded and passionate.

679
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,320
Besides, he doesn't have his parents around

680
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,280
and he treats you extremely well.

681
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,320
Why don't you have feelings for him?

682
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,120
He is a really nice man.

683
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
I feel at ease when being with him.

684
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,760
I don't know why.

685
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,520
But we just don't hit it off.

686
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,400
You just look tender and gentle

687
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,000
with many ideas in your mind.

688
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,840
As your intimate friend,
I'm not able to talk you round.

689
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,480
Have you decided to

690
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,600
remain single like this forever?

691
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,440
I think being single is good.

692
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,800
With no one caring about

693
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,880
and disturbing me,

694
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,120
I can eat and sleep whenever I want to.

695
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,800
I can go shopping
and take a business trip at any time.

696
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,160
I'll put away all the money I've made.

697
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,640
I may spend the money paying my mom back
for her care and love.

698
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,760
I feel a lot better than I did

699
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,800
when I didn't have freedom

700
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
after getting married.

701
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,160
I'll go answer the door.

702
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,600
Cousin Zishan.

703
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,840
Siqi, where is Jiaxin?

704
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,880
Sister.

705
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,760
Jiaxin.

706
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,440
Have you offended someone?

707
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,480
Or have you done anything illegal?

708
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,760
No, I haven't.

709
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,680
No?

710
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,040
The lawyer's letter has been sent
to your home. Look.

711
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
I didn't tell your mom about it for fear
of getting her upset after she reads it.

712
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,840
I bring it to you immediately.

713
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,080
What does it say?

714
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,740
(Shen Dao Law Firm
Lawyer's Letter)

715
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,080
What's wrong?

716
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,400
Wang Xiyi sued me.

717
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,840
Although Wang Xiyi

718
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,160
is my sponsor,

719
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,360
he shouldn't have taken
advantage of you like this.

720
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,800
Don't be afraid.

721
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,640
I'm with you.

722
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,360
Take your seats.

723
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,000
Today the two parties meet each other.

724
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,040
Hopefully,

725
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,680
after the two parties sit down,

726
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,480
they can have a good talk

727
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,560
and minimize the problems.

728
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,600
Absolutely.

729
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,080
Mr. Shen.

730
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,640
My client signed the divorce agreement

731
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,040
three years ago.

732
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,640
After that, Mr. Wang told Mrs. Lin Xishi that

733
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,440
he had signed his name
on the divorce agreement.

734
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,200
The two parties
agreed to divorce voluntarily.

735
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,760
Is that true, Mr. Yi?

736
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,200
Since they have already divorced,

737
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,640
why do you engage us in the divorce lawsuit?

738
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,000
Siqi.

739
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,120
Is today the first day you work as a lawyer?

740
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,200
I have told you that

741
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,240
everything depends on evidence.

742
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,440
Can you tell

743
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,440
where the divorce certificate is?

744
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,840
You have divorced.

745
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,360
Take out the divorce certificate.

746
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,000
I went to Hungary at that time.

747
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
So I didn't get the certificate.

748
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,000
According to The Marriage Law,

749
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,200
uncontested divorce is a way of divorce

750
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,560
which both parties agree to.

751
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,400
Since both parties had signed the divorce
agreement after they agreed to divorce,

752
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,560
now what we have to do
is to complete the divorce procedure.

753
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,160
Besides,

754
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,920
both parties have been living apart
for more than two years.

755
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,360
Even if we take this case to court,

756
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
the result will not change.

757
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,920
She is right.

758
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,600
It is of no use

759
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,920
investigating what happened three years ago.

760
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,840
Since we have spare time, I think
we'd better go to Bureau of Civil Affairs

761
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,840
and put an end to this marriage
which exists in name only.

762
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:03,920
I don't think so.

763
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,400
On the first night
I married into Wang family,

764
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,400
you made me sign the divorce agreement.

765
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,960
You have agreed to divorce
from the very beginning.

766
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,560
You and I were both clear about

767
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,880
the reason and purpose of our marriage.

768
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,420
(Divorce Agreement of Mr. Wang Xiyi
and Ms. Chen Jiaxin)

769
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,760
You're not included in my future life.

770
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,760
Although you may find it hard to accept,

771
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,280
that is what we have to face in the future.

772
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,120
Besides,

773
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,440
we got married,

774
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,160
but we didn't love each other.

775
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,200
We went to Bureau of Civil Affairs
for the marriage certificate

776
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,920
just in order to register
permanent residence for Ximi.

777
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,240
Since Ximi was gone,

778
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,120
we've been living apart
for more than two years.

779
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,360
You don't have the right to disagree.

780
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,440
My client has physical evidence to prove that

781
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,120
your client had feelings
for my client at that time.

782
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,240
What was written on this wish card

783
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,440
shows the determination of both parties

784
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,800
to build a family.

785
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,080
What was written
on the scraps of paper in the box

786
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,040
shows your client's concerns and care

787
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
about my client.

788
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,560
As to this doll...

789
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,360
When he is sleeping beside me,

790
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,000
I feel that

791
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,760
I am so happy.

792
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,560
According to The Marriage Law,

793
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,120
divorce is based on

794
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,320
the rupture in a couple's relationship.

795
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,120
All the evidence can prove that

796
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,360
there's no rupture

797
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,520
in their relationship at all.

798
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,440
Mr. Shen, don't forget that

799
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
all the evidence was
collected three years ago.

800
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,440
After that, my client

801
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,880
signed the divorce agreement.

802
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,760
According to
Marriage Registration Regulations,

803
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,680
if a couple want to divorce,

804
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,200
they must go through divorce procedures
at the marriage registration office.

805
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,000
Since they failed to do that,

806
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:47,840
then

807
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,920
this divorce agreement isn't effective.

808
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,720
Since my client

809
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,440
doesn't consider
this divorce agreement legal,

810
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,480
we have to

811
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,000
discuss it from scratch.

812
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
It really pissed me off.

813
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,200
They have obviously made good preparations.

814
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,120
They even collected those things
as physical evidence.

815
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,960
I'm gonna come up with some solutions tonight

816
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,480
to challenge them again.

817
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,000
Okay?

818
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,200
I wanna go to the restroom.

819
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:18,960
Wait a minute.

820
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,200
I know that the relationship
between us is hard to handle.

821
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,720
I don't want to say anything about the past.

822
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,640
Let's meet this afternoon.

823
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,000
Okay.

824
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,840
Send me the time and the place.

825
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,480
Judging from your manner now,

826
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,120
you are not passionately in love.

827
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
It's none of your business.

828
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,000
These days I feel that

829
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,560
you have changed your mind.

830
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,040
Tell me

831
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,480
why you're hiding from me.

832
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,160
I'm not hiding from you.

833
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,560
You spent three years in Hungary with Dylan

834
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,200
without falling in love with him.

835
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,160
But

836
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,240
it's been just a few days
since you came back.

837
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,240
You decide to be with him.

838
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,680
We have been living apart for three years

839
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,120
and you also signed the divorce agreement.

840
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,000
Why do you suddenly disagree to divorce?

841
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,560
Because from the very beginning,

842
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,680
I didn't plan to divorce you.

843
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,000
But why did you sign the paper?

844
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Because I felt that

845
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:25,960
if I couldn't see you

846
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,480
and explain it to you in person,

847
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,000
the only thing I could do
is to sign the paper.

848
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,840
Then why did you
have a relationship with Anna?

849
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,080
Let me set the record straight.

850
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,680
I didn't do that.

851
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,600
Nothing happened between me and Anna.

852
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
It's all other people's fault.

853
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,120
You're always right.

854
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
Your biggest problem

855
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,040
is that you don't reflect on your mistakes.

856
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,800
I'm telling you,

857
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,200
whatever happens, I'm gonna divorce.

858
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,400
What's wrong, Jiaxin?

859
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,400
I'm fine.

860
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,120
