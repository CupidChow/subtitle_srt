(Episode 4)

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,480
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,600
It doesn't matter.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,800
What's wrong with you?

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,680
You look kind of nervous.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,960
There is nothing to be nervous about.

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,960
Mr. Yi, Mr. Shen is waiting for you now.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,760
Please follow me.

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,960
Look,

36
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,960
they can't find you now.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,960
His behavior is strange.

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,480
His behavior is so strange.

39
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,840
Come in.

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,000
Mr. Shen, Mr. Yi is here.

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,360
Come on in.

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,920
Come in, please.

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,160
Mr. Shen.

44
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,640
Mr. Yi, please sit down.

45
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,360
Please check this agreement.

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,920
Have you revised the contents
I mentioned last time?

47
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,600
Absolutely. I've revised those as you demanded.

48
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,280
Well, I don't have any other problem.

49
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,560
We can send it to them as soon as possible.

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,280
Mr. Yi,

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,960
have you been bothered
by the salary raise recently?

52
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,480
(Jiaxin is pronounced
as "salary raise" in Chinese.)

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,280
What happened to Jiaxin?

54
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,840
Didn't you receive the notification
from the Labor Union?

55
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,880
You should have received it yesterday.

56
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,360
You're saying salary raise?

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,920
I've already handled that.

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,080
Anson,

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,880
just send it to the Chairwoman right now.

60
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,880
It's urgent.

61
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:19,920
Got it.

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,720
Mr. Shen,

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,840
I need your advice about something else.

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,640
I have a friend,

65
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,040
and he wants to divorce.

66
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,640
Now there are more divorce cases
than marriage.

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,560
It's a divorce by agreement or by lawsuit?

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,440
By agreement.

69
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,720
He just needs me to ask you

70
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,520
what he needs to pay attention to.

71
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,200
Do they have any child?

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,680
No.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It will be easier.

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,440
If they don't have any child,

75
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,320
they only need to solve the issue
of property division.

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,920
What?

77
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,040
As a couple, how's their
properties distributed?

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,640
Do they have a premarital agreement?

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,640
It's an agreement or a legal property system?

80
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,120
Who wants to divorce first?

81
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,480
The man or the woman?

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,920
How about reasons for divorce?
For the marital infidelity?

83
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,640
You can tell me the whole story
about your friend.

84
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,520
Okay.

85
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,240
Here's the thing.

86
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,640
My friend, he...

87
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,440
He went on a cruise trip.

88
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,440
Oh, God.

89
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,000
Jiaxin,

90
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,680
are you okay?

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,560
Why do you keep vomiting?

92
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,080
It's probably because of drinking cold milk.

93
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,480
How come?

94
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,520
You also felt sick this morning.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,240
I know it.

96
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,880
Probably you have stomach problems?

97
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,680
You think too much.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,080
Nothing wrong with my stomach.

99
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,160
The woman doesn't know how rich the man is?

100
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:20,920
She knows.

101
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,200
In that case, if she still
doesn't take this chance

102
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,440
to claim for any compensation,

103
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,760
in my opinion,

104
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,720
she is either really simple

105
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,320
or too sophisticated.

106
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,880
What she wants is not just money.

107
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,480
But it seems her character is good.

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,680
I think she is not a shrewd woman.

109
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,760
Mr. Yi,

110
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,640
it's not that simple.

111
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,160
Speaking of women nowadays,

112
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,000
the more innocent they look like,
the more sophisticated they are.

113
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,200
They got married and divorced
in a short time.

114
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,720
Better to draft an agreement before marriage,

115
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,920
in case that this woman gets some news

116
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,000
and goes back on her words.

117
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,960
Otherwise your friend
is likely to get nothing

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
from this divorce.

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,560
Get nothing?

120
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,080
But your friend is really bad.

121
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,800
He has a girlfriend,

122
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
but he still hooks up with other woman.

123
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,600
As a lawyer,

124
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,160
I'm very sympathetic to this woman.

125
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,840
What?

126
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,920
Both of them drank too much that night.

127
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
They didn't know what exactly happened.

128
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,320
Although I'm not a divorce lawyer,

129
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,920
I've heard of so many divorce cases.

130
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,960
Someone like your friend

131
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,960
is so irresponsible.

132
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,200
He can be in the top three

133
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,040
in my ranking list of bad men.

134
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
He is not that bad.

135
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,200
Well,

136
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,760
it was a misunderstanding.

137
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,320
Forget it. You don't know
what exactly happened.

138
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,680
Mr. Yi,

139
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
listen to me,

140
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,600
you can know about a man

141
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,200
through his manners to women.

142
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,120
You'd better stay away from him.

143
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,480
It seems that your friend even
has no courage

144
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,560
to admit his mistakes.

145
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,160
He is irresponsible for his girlfriend

146
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,280
and the other woman

147
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,640
he hooked up with.

148
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,880
You shouldn't make friends with him.

149
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,200
Jiaxin, the boxed meal again?

150
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,800
I cooked it myself.

151
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:28,760
Hello?

152
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,040
Did you see Chen Jiaxin?

153
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,840
She is in the office now.

154
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,960
Chen Jiaxin.

155
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,440
The lunch break was up.

156
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,600
Why are you still having lunch?

157
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,000
That's an urgent job.

158
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,280
I was too busy

159
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,560
to have lunch before.

160
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,080
I'm on it now.

161
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,840
Hurry up.

162
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,040
Haven't I told you to raise up your head?

163
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,320
Chen Jiaxin,

164
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,440
I've told you we'd have
team activity that day, right?

165
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,720
But why do you want to ask for leave?

166
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,680
And who'll stay at company
to receive calls or deliveries?

167
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,040
It's disapproved.

168
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,800
But I really need

169
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,920
to handle a very, very important thing.

170
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,600
How selfish you are.

171
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
You want us to change our activity time

172
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,520
just because of you?

173
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,400
No, no. I didn't mean that.

174
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,080
Chen Jiaxin.

175
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:23,960
Excuse me.

176
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,280
Why did you cancel my gym membership?

177
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
You wanna turn against me after breakup?

178
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,320
Think about it.

179
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,600
Who bought you this laptop?

180
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,920
Who gave you this mobile phone?

181
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,200
Your member fee was automatically
deducted from my account.

182
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
You selected this laptop,

183
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,760
but I paid for it in installments.

184
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,400
I got this mobile phone
because of recharging activity.

185
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,760
You've never spent money on me.

186
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,520
You know how to talk back now?

187
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,360
When we were in a love relationship,

188
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
you didn't dare to take to me like that.

189
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,880
Let go of me.

190
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,480
Who are you?

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,560
Who?

192
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,600
I've told you not to show up

193
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,920
in front of me, right?

194
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
What are you doing here?

195
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,120
It's you. Let go of me.

196
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,080
Let go.

197
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,120
Apologize to Chen Jiaxin.

198
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,000
Let go.

199
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,440
Apologize now.

200
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,160
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,240
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Gu Chi?

203
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,040
Listen up.

204
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,200
If you keep bothering Chen Jiaxin,

205
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,840
I won't let you go easily.

206
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,200
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

207
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,840
I'll leave now.

208
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,360
Move away.

209
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,240
Chen Jiaxin, look what you've done.

210
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,800
Our company is messed up by you.

211
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,000
Jesus.

212
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440
Mr. Yi, are you okay?

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,160
Do you think I'm okay?

214
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,680
It's obviously the fault of troublemakers,

215
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
but you're blaming on the innocent one.

216
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,120
She asked for leave for a justified reason,

217
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,760
but you're just making trouble on her.

218
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,280
All the employees here would behave

219
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
just like you?

220
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,200
Or this company takes
bullying honest employees

221
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
as its company culture?

222
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,360
It seems that I need to talk to Mr. Shen about it.

223
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,760
Mr. Yi,

224
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,520
it's not like that.

225
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,480
We actually do everything

226
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,200
according to...

227
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,680
Her note for leave.

228
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,680
I approve of it.

229
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,600
Chen Jiaxin,

230
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,360
come with me.

231
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,320
The air ticket to Bahamas.

232
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,040
Thank you.

233
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,760
We set out the day after tomorrow.

234
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,520
Great.

235
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,480
I hope when we come back from Bahamas,

236
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,720
there won't be any other problems.

237
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,080
They got married and divorced
in a short time.

238
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,600
Better to draft an agreement before marriage,

239
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,000
in case that this woman gets some news
and goes back on her words.

240
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,960
Otherwise your friend
is likely to get nothing

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
from this divorce.

242
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,480
In regard to this divorce,

243
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,040
if you have any idea or condition,

244
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,800
just let me know and we can discuss it.

245
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,280
Okay.

246
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,560
Well,

247
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,400
I have one condition.

248
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,040
We need to make it clear now.

249
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,320
Shen Dao is really good at this.

250
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,640
He is right.

251
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,560
I shouldn't have taken Chen Jiaxin

252
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,080
as a simple girl.

253
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,480
I'm listening.

254
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,880
After we get divorced,

255
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,800
I want

256
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,640
to treat you a dinner.

257
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,160
But you can't help me pay the bill then.

258
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,920
Pardon?

259
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,560
I think you've agreed to my condition.

260
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,640
That's your condition?

261
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,160
Yes.

262
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,000
You always help me out of troubles.

263
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,520
But I always bother you.

264
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
So I treat you a dinner

265
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,400
as a way

266
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,960
to express my thanks to you.

267
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,360
I hope you accept this condition.

268
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,560
Nothing else?

269
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
What else?

270
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,160
She is really a simple girl.

271
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,120
I shouldn't have misunderstood her.

272
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,920
Hello, excuse me.

273
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,760
Thank you.

274
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,640
Help yourself.

275
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,720
Excuse me,

276
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,600
I haven't eaten anything since this morning.

277
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,760
I'm starving now.

278
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
So I'll eat first.

279
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,760
Are you okay?

280
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,000
I've finally collected the whole series
of Lantian jade artworks

281
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,480
by Zhongshan Long.

282
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,760
It's a priceless treasure to me.

283
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,640
Let's make it clear.

284
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,480
You're my private art broker.

285
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,200
So you can only work for me.

286
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,480
You wanna make an exclusive deal?

287
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,880
In that case, I'll see

288
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,200
if you're a good client.

289
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,800
You become self-satisfied in front of me.

290
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Okay, you tell me

291
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,760
what kind of clients

292
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,440
can be regarded as good clients.

293
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,960
Good clients in my eyes?

294
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,680
They will not only pay for famous artworks,

295
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
but also get touched by the unknown jade.

296
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,840
They have their own perspectives

297
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,760
and judgement,

298
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,680
instead of only listening to others.

299
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,920
Where can I see that jade as you said?

300
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,040
I'll be there to have a look.

301
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,400
Well, this is the exhibition
I mentioned to you before.

302
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,240
Chang Fengge's son also puts his works

303
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,240
on display there.

304
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,200
I promised him

305
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,880
to take a friend to his exhibition.

306
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,840
Fine.

307
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,720
Given you put it that way,

308
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,280
I'll go with you.

309
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,360
Wait a second.

310
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,320
I'll get changed.

311
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,040
Okay.

312
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,400
Oh, God.

313
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,240
It's so great.

314
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,240
Hello?

315
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,120
Is the Chairwoman home?

316
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,000
She is getting changed upstairs.

317
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,800
She'll be right back.

318
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,280
Okay. I'll wait here.

319
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,680
Okay.

320
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,200
Wow.

321
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:03,920
Oh,

322
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:04,960
thank you.

323
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
What's this?

324
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,560
What?

325
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,640
Mr. Yi's wedding certificate.

326
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,400
(Wedding Certificate: Wang Xiyi; Chen Jiaxin)
He's got married with Chen Jiaxin.

327
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,960
Chen Jiaxin?

328
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,320
Who's Chen Jiaxin?

329
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,120
She is the one who went
to Bahamas with Mr. Yi?

330
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,160
He is too careless.

331
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,440
What if the Chairwoman sees this?

332
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,320
Please help me hand this to the Chairwoman.

333
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,040
I have an upset stomach.

334
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,040
So I need to go to the hospital now.

335
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,760
I need fluids.

336
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,560
Thanks for your help.

337
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,180
(Keep Fighting)

338
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,480
Sister Jiaxin,

339
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,640
you wanna copy documents?

340
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,600
Leave it to me.

341
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,280
You have a rest.

342
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,600
I...

343
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,160
Mr. Zheng,

344
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
you're older than me.

345
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,760
How could you call me sister?

346
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,560
It's just an attendance record.

347
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,920
I can do it. No need to bother you.

348
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,960
In the workplace,

349
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,480
calling someone sister is just
a way to show respect.

350
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,640
It has nothing to do with age.

351
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,120
I've been sitting all day long.

352
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,120
I wanna walk around now.

353
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,720
We're workmates. It's no trouble at all.

354
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
You have a break.

355
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,440
Okay.

356
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,480
Thanks. Thanks.

357
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,440
Sister Jiaxin,

358
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,480
keep staring at computer
isn't good for your eyes.

359
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,000
Here you are.

360
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
I bought this eye drops from Japan last week.

361
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,080
It's useful.

362
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,760
Have a try.

363
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,200
Try this.

364
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Thanks. Thanks.

365
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,800
Jiaxin,

366
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,760
I always bother you for something.

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,320
So I got you black tea.

368
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,400
By the way,

369
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,520
what's your relationship with Mr. Yi?

370
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,880
Sister Jiaxin,

371
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,120
I'm done with it.

372
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,560
If there's anything I can do,
just let me know.

373
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,400
Anything.

374
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,720
Thanks, Mr. Zheng.

375
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,800
So many kiss-ass people around here.

376
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,520
Some people think

377
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,600
if they treat Jiaxin like a Queen now,

378
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,680
nobody will remember

379
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,240
how badly they treated her before.

380
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,840
Save your kiss-ass.

381
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,960
I hate to see this kind of people.

382
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,360
Oh, my God. What's wrong with these people?

383
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,680
They all call me sister

384
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,840
and give me gifts.

385
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,880
It's kind of torment to me.

386
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,240
Hey, Sister Jiaxin.

387
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,120
I heard Mr. Yi sent you home.

388
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,040
What's your relationship with him?

389
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,600
What are you saying here?

390
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,000
He just did me a favor before.

391
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,400
Really?

392
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,960
But I can tell from your eyes.

393
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,760
You're lying.

394
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,800
Is there something you didn't tell me?

395
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,880
Who's lying?

396
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,720
How can you tell from my eyes?

397
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,680
It's okay if you don't wanna say.

398
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,600
Look how scared you are.

399
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,960
Nobody has no secrets.

400
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,360
I know you like drawing.

401
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,880
I think you're interested in this exhibition.

402
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,320
Today is the last day of it.

403
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
You can go there after work.

404
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,640
I should get back to work.

405
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,120
(The sails of our dreams set sail today.)

406
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,560
Thank you.

407
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,060
(My Colorful World)

408
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,000
Grandma, look at this painting, Blue.

409
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,920
It looks simple in color.

410
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,600
But look at its flowing lines.

411
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,000
It's like those ideas in your mind.

412
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,320
Your soul is led to a cherry tree.

413
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,080
Look up and you can see a blue sky.

414
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,880
And then your soul keeps
flying towards the sky

415
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,400
until you see the vast universe.

416
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,440
It's right here.

417
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,560
Loneliness and freedom coexist.

418
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,280
I recommend this painting

419
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,240
not because it's an artwork
by Chang Fengge's son,

420
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,600
but the painter conveys
such a unique theme

421
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,840
through his work.

422
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,960
Okay.

423
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,840
Since you have talked a lot,

424
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,800
I believe you.

425
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,120
And then I...

426
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,920
Grandma,

427
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,760
don't get me wrong.

428
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,200
I take you here not for buying paintings,

429
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,200
but for appreciating them.

430

431

Who has already bought it?

432
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,920
You can guess.

433
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,880
You take me here not
for appreciating paintings,

434
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,360
but for making me jealous of you.

435
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,900
(Blue; Painter: Chang Jieshu;
Sold)

436
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,400
No surprises.

437
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,520
This painting has just been sold.

438
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,080
Here's your painting, please.

439
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,640
Thank you.

440
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,480
Luckily I got the last one.

441
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,840
(Blue; Painter: Chang Jieshu; Sold)
Well, it's sold out?

442
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,080
I'm sorry.

443
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,960
The last frame-painting
of Blue has been sold.

444
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,160
How about

445
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,800
you pick one from other paintings?

446
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,160
That's okay.

447
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,960
It seems that girl really
likes this painting.

448
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,000
I can't take it away from her.

449
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,360
When you give it back to her,

450
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,840
you give her this painting for me.

451
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,680
But Grandma,

452
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,640
you also like it, right?

453
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,400
You really wanna give it to her?

454
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,920
My eyesight is poor,

455
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,160
so this frame-painting is too small for me.

456
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,040
I think its original painting is better.

457
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,360
Alright, the painting Blue

458
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,640
is yours now.

459
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,120
You're so good.

460
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,760
I don't wanna be mean to you,

461
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,160
so I'll give you ten more percent
as commission.

462
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,680
You're brilliant.

463
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,880
Actually I'm not.

464
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,960
In my eyes,

465
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,160
you're just always so nice to everyone.

466
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,920
I'm gonna have afternoon tea with my friends.

467
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,880
I gotta go.

468
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,400
Okay.

469
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,240
Thanks, anyway.

470
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,640
What's wrong with me?

471
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,680

Hello?

483
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,080
I finally contact you.

What?

Hi.

487
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,920
Sorry to bother you.

488
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,040
Here you are.

489

Thank you.

And it's for you.

491
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,040
I should give it to you at the souvenir shop.

Thank you.

493
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,240
You like this painting?

494
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,040
Yes, I do.

495
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,840
Because this painting

496
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,040
gives me the courage to be alone.

497
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,880
It takes courage to be alone?

498
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,880
When I was a child,

499
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,840
my teacher asked

500
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,920
about our dreams.

501
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,920

502
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
to be a doctor,

503
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,880
and some wanted to be a scientist.

504
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,000
But,

505
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,520
I just wanted to be an owner
of a grocery store.

506
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,080
As a result,

507
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
everyone was laughing at me.

508
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,480
By the way,

509
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,880
how much is it?

510
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,160
I'll give you the money.

00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,760
It's a gift.

512
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,760
If you want,

513
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,440
you can buy me dessert.

514
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,960
But,

515
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,280
I have to do something else later.

516
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,120
It won't take so long

517
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,120
to have dessert.

518
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,480
Someone once said

519
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,920
enjoying good dessert

520
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,800
could make you a perfect day.

521
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,480
Really?

522
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,120
Who said that?

523
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,000
I said it. Let's go.

524
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Yes, it's true.

525
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,040
We're committed

526
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,680
to developing natural

527
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,160
and non-simulating products.

528
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,760
And our brand has been
established for decades.

529
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,200
Hold on a second.

530
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,000
Mr. Wang.

531
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,080
Yes, our brand has been built up for decades,

532
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,120
enjoying a solid foundation at home.

533
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,280
Yes.

534
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,480
I'm looking forward to our cooperation.

535
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,440
Mr. Yi,

536
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,040
what's this?

537
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,300
(Wedding Certificate
Wang Xiyi; Chen Jiaxin)

538
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,400
That's all.

539
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,320
Okay, wait a moment.

540
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,560
Let me introduce myself.

541
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,360
I'm Dylan.

542
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,120
Hi, Dylan.

543
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,160
I'm Chen Jiaxin.

544
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,680
Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.

545
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,240
What?

546
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,160
How come you got seasick
on such a large ship?

547
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,240
I'm telling you. Speaking of this issue,

548
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,360
I've already asked for advice from Mr. Shen.

549
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,680
Of course, he doesn't know it's my issue.

550
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,480
In his opinion,

551
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,080
if I take Chen Jiaxin to fix it in Bahamas,

552
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,160
it will be easier to solve.

553
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,280
As if nothing had happened.

554
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,600
We don't have any child,

555
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,720
so it's not that complicated.

556
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,800
Oh, God.

557
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,440
I screwed it up.

558
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,360
What's going on here?

559
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,040
I need to tell you something.

560
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,480
But you promise me you won't kill me

561
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,080
when you know it.

562
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,080
Tell me now.

563
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,520
I...

564
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,560
I hope the Chairwoman

565
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,640
can realize her dream of
having a great grandchild.

566
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,680
Believe me, my motive is good.

567
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:43,920
So,

568
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,040
what I got you was not that good

569
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,680
for protection.

570
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,440
It had lots of holes on it.

571
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,400
But you don't need to worry
too much about it.

572
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,880
Because according to scientific statistics,

573
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,200
the odds of a successful pregnancy
are less than 15 percent.

574
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,000
That means only one out

575
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,240
of seven times will probably be successful.

576
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:28,880
Right?

577
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,040
It's a slim chance.

578
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,480
That couldn't happen, right?

579
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,440
Don't worry about it.

580
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,880
It's impossible.

581
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,080
It's impossible.

582
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,000
It's impossible.

583
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,040
How dare you.

584
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,800
It's impossible.

585
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
Hello, my dear friends.

586
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,120
Welcome to watch my live steam.

587
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,280
Today I'm going to show you

588
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,800
a very popular durian pizza restaurant.

589
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,320
Wow.

590
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,400
It's said that

591
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,000
people had to queue up
for three hours to eat pizza here.

592
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
There's a girl.

593
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,600
Hello, are you okay?

594
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,760
Did you eat

595
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,040
their durian cheese pizza?

596
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,200
It's so smelly that you feel nauseous now?

597
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
Oh, God. I'm scared.

598
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,480
It's hard to see someone
who gets sick because of it.

599
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,200
Miss, are you okay?

600
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,240
You have food poisoning?

601
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,920
I've heard if we eat stale durian,

602
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,200
we'll get sick.

603
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,720
Miss, do you need to go to the hospital?

604
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,640
Are you okay?

605
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,840
Stop talking nonsense.

606
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,800
There isn't any problem with our durian.

607
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,160
But this girl feels sick now.

608
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,640
You still deny your problems?

609
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,480
Guys, this is not a good restaurant.

610
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,640
Stop talking nonsense here.

611
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,720
Give me your phone. No filming.

612
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,480
What are you doing?

613
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:32,960
No filming here.

614
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,640
What are you doing?

615
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:33,960
Give it to me.

616
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,240
What are you doing?

617
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,960
Give it to me.

618
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,680
Stop it. Stop it.

619
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,440
What's wrong with you?

620
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,240
It turns out she is pregnant.

621
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,160
Look.

622
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,920
She feels sick not
because of durian in my restaurant.

623
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,520
Here. Look.

624
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,320
She is pregnant.

625
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,400
We have a mother-to-be here.

626
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
Everyone, look at this.

627
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,800
Here is a mother-to-be.

628
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,360
Let's take a photo.

629
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,080
Excuse me, please.

630
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,720
A mother-to-be.

631
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,280
Jiaxin,

632
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,200
let's go.

633
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,120
Here is the father-to-be.

634
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,760
He is also here.

635
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,680
It's beyond expectation.

636
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,840
Come on, everybody.

637
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,760
Post it on your WeChat or Microblog.

638
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,360
Got it?

639
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,360
There wouldn't be many people
to watch her live stream.

640
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,760
Don't worry about that.

641
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,600
How about this child's father?

642
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,440
Child's father.

643
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Child's father.

644
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
He even doesn't know

645
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,440
I'm pregnant.

646
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,400
Well,

647
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,960
how come I suddenly get pregnant?

648
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,560
How can I tell him?

649
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,760
Oh, God.

650
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,960
We're gonna divorce.

651
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,960
Well,

652
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,400
what's going on here?

653
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,400
I...

654
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,400
I'm gonna be a mother.

655
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,440
Speaking of this child,

656
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,000
did you get pregnant as you wished?

657
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,240
What?

658
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,800
Child's father is a good man.

659
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,800
Well,

660
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,720
he is a good man.

661
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,080
It was an accident.

662
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,360
It was an accident in Bahamas.

663
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,200
Well,

664
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,480
an accident on a cruise ship.

665
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,200
We're gonna divorce.

666
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,840
We have good reason to divorce.

667
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,000
The Chairwoman said

668
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
Wang Xiyi had been to a cruise trip.

669
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,080
The child's father is a young

670
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,040
and successful entrepreneur, right?

671
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,920
How did you know?

672
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,040
It's my intuition.

673
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,320
You're gonna divorce with him?

674
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,400
Do you have to?

675
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,080
I'm not the one he should marry.

676
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,480
Well, I'm a nuisance.

677
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,240
I'm a nuisance.

678
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,960
Wait.

679
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,160
You're not a nuisance.

680
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,640
There are lots of beauties around you,

681
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,880
but you haven't realized yet.

682
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,800
This is a lucky chip.

683
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,560
Why do you give it to me?

684
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,520
If anyone wants a good life,

685
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,200
they need courage and confidence.

686
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,800
They have no fear
but confidence in themselves.

687
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,440
Only in that way can anyone
gain their happiness.

688
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,560
I hope when I see you next time,

689
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,160
you've already got your happiness.

690
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,080
Until then,

691
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,560
you'll get what this lucky chip means.

692
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,760
Fighting.

693
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,680
It's humid in Shanghai.

694
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,200
And it's sticky here.

695
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,000
I don't wanna come back.

696
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,200
Stop complaining.

697
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,040
Here is an international metropolis.

698
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,840
It's better than most of places abroad.

699
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,920
But I don't like this place at all.

700
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,400
My schoolmates

701
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,360
and friends are all live abroad.

702
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,480
You must let me come back.

703
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,760
Look at you.

704
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,160
What kind of success can you achieve?

705
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,080
I could be a trainee at the stock exchange.

706
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,960
A few years later,

707
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,880
I could start up business like Zuckerberg.

708
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,360
Are you out of your mind?

709
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,360
Look at your cousin,

710
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,720
as the grandson of the Chairwoman,

711
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,880
he has already been the general manager.

712
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
You're also the Chairwoman's grandson.

713
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,640
Why do you have to start up business

714
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,760
instead of taking advantage of this identity?

715
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,960
You're just asking for trouble.

716
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,200
But it's easy to come back?

717
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,600
Don't forget you took kickbacks
with dad in company.

718
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,080
And granny was so mad at you.

719
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,560
That's why we got kicked out, right?

720
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,160
Shut up.

721
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,120
It's none of your business.

722
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,880
You have no right to judge.

723
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,760
You granny still loves me.

724
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,840
She should help me.

725
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,840
After all, I'm her daughter.

726
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,000
What's more,

727
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,440
nobody wouldn't care

728
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,880
about their children in this world.

729
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,120
But she said

730
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,960
you couldn't call her mom anymore.

731
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,320
Stop talking nonsense.

732
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,960
Listen,

733
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,360
I often scold you, right?

734
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,840
But when you get into trouble,

735
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,760
who is the one

736
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,520
to help you out of trouble first?

737
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,960
It's me. Your dear mother.

738
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And now,

739
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,680
I got a divorce,

740
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,040
and our Chinese restaurant was closed down.

741
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,320
You think about it.

742
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,880
In this case,

743
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,800
how come a mother doesn't
care about her daughter?

744
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,920
This is the family blood.

745
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,600
That means family ties are too strong

746
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,000
to get rid of.

747
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,360
But you still can't be so positive.

748
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,320
Once we come back home,

749
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,080
it's impossible to think nothing happened.

750
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,720
How are you gonna let granny forgive you?

751
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,680
That's the point.

752
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,040
Mom, I know you still can't forgive me now.

753
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,800
It's all my fault.

754
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,320
I was too greedy

755
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,720
three years ago.

756
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,880
I couldn't admit my mistakes before,

757
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
but now I know it's my fault.

758
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,720
Please let me stay here

759
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,320
and take good care of you.

760
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,680
I can make up for my mistakes.

761
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,400
Mom.

762
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,920
Frankly speaking,

763
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,840
you're back for your business failed.

764
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,080
You got divorced and helpless.

765
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,440
And then you think of me now.

766
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,520
Here is not your shelter.

767
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,920
You have no access to come back or leave.

768
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,920
Mom,

769
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,200
it seems you've already known all my news.

770
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,840
That means you still care about me,

771
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,480
right?

772
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,480
So let me stay and accompany you.

773
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,600
If you want,

774
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,880
I can do anything for you here.

775
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,440
Doing laundry, cooking, or cleansing.

776
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,560
I'm willing to do anything here,

777
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:13,960
mom.

778
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,280
I don't know if you did those things before,

779
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,280
but I know a lot about your bad deeds.

780
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,080
Granny,

781
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,760
don't be mad.

782
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,240
I also hate my mother.

783
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,000
She can't steal money even if she likes money.

784
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,480
Even for stealing money,

785
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,160
how could she steal from our own company?

786
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,200
And even if she stole money from the company,

787
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,400
how come she spent all the money
within three years?

788
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,600
She even talked big about
starting up business.

789
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,000
She can't even be a theft.

790
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,880
Granny,

791
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,720
even if you forgive my mother,

792
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,960
I can't forgive her.

793
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,000
Finally there's an objective judgement here.

794
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,360
It's not like those

795
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,440
who only pay lip service,

796
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,840
and in fact,

797
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,640
they just wanna take advantage of me.

798
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,120
Mom,

799
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,800
I know

800
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,720
I can't beg your pardon now.

801
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,160
But...

802
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,480
Since you know that,

803
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,800
you shouldn't behave like this.

804
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,760
But,

805
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,760
after all, Zhengren is your own grandson.

806
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,080
He knew nothing when he studied abroad

807
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,440
three years ago.

808
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,640
When he graduated from university,

809
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,520
he should do something.

810
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,520
Unluckily, we're in debt now

811
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,880
because of me.

812
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,000
Mom, please.

813
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,600
Please help him, alright?

814
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,720
Granny,

815
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,360
it's been three years.
You haven't changed at all.

816
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
It's been three years.

817
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,720
I didn't wanna see your mom,

818
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,680
but how come you didn't come back to see me?

819
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,080
Mom, it's my fault.

820
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,040
He had a quarrel with me over it.

821
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,080
But at that time,

822
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,720
I just focused on starting my business.

823
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,120
I was mad at him.

824
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,880
So I didn't let him have
his passport and tuition card.

825
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,560
And then he couldn't go back to see you.

826
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:09,880
She is right.

827
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,280
Back then, you were still a child.

828
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,920
What your parents did is
none of your business.

829
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,400
Granny, even so,

830
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,600
she is still my mother.

831
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,960
I hope my mother can get more tolerance

832
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and forgiveness from you,

833
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,600
because I hope you two can be good.

834
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,040
It's very thoughtful of you.

835
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:38,920
Mom,

836
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,600
I have to tell you.

837
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,840
Zhengren has changed his last name to Wang.

838
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,280
From now on,

839
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,280
he is the grandson of Wang's family.

840
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,680
It's okay you don't forgive me,

841
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,640
but you should get your grandson

842
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,280
a job for a living, right?

843
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,720
I can't get it.

844
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,200
How come I raised a daughter like you?

845
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,520
Stand up.

846
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,040
Mom, stand up.

847
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,000
Thank you, mom.

848
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,920
Zhengren, listen.

849
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,680
You should thank your grandma.

850
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,800
It's hard to get used to

851

What are you saying here?

852
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,400
Just do it.

853
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,200
Thank you, Grandma.

854
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,680
Don't mention it.

855
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,800
I give you one more chance,

856
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,360
because I don't want his life

857
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,720
to be ruined by you.

858
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,280
Anyway,

859
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,920
thank you, mom.

860
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,360
Zhengren,

861
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,080
I'll ask your cousin to get you a job.

862
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,600
Okay.

863
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,880
As for you,

864
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,000
from now on,

865
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,160
you'll be in charge of...

866
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
...of money, right?

867
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,680
Great. Thank you for trusting me.

868
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,960
No, I mean front yard and back yard.

869
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,000
The water in the pool should
be changed on time.

870
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,640
The fallen leaves should be cleaned.

871
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,320
That's it?

872
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
No problem. No problem.

873
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,640
Mom, I can do anything.

874
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,560
I'll live up to you.

875
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,320
Alright then.

876
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,440
I won't let you down.

877

in my belly now.

879
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,480
I've never expected
I'll be a mother so early.

880
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,280
Do I need to tell him?

881
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,440
I can't get you.

882
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,800
You'll go abroad again
after your breakup in a cruise trip.

883
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,840
Here are your clothes.

884

Thank you.

What are you doing?

887
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,680
Nothing.

888
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,480
Well,

889
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,680
I haven't finished packing yet.

890
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,280
I'm in a hurry.

891
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,880
I can help you.

892
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,440
No.

893
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,520
I still remember what you did last time.

894
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,280
I'll do it myself.

895

It's for you.

I got you during my cruise trip, right?

You'll go abroad tomorrow, right?

900
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,040
So you should look good tomorrow.

901
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,600
Maybe you'll meet your Mr. Right.

902
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,360
What will you use if you give it to me?

903
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,040
I've already bought it.

904

Here you are.

905
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,600
You look haggard.

You know what?

907
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,160
This base solution is really good.

908
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,400

Okay.

Hello.

916
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,680
What takes you so long to answer it?

917
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,040
Did you forget what day was yesterday?

918
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,760
Well.

919
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,480
It was my first day to perform
at the Paris Opera.

920
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,080
Right.

921
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,800
Your performance was going well?

922
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,440
Yes.

923
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,360
That was great.

924
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,800
We received a standing ovation
for over ten minutes.

925
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,520
But when I got back to the backstage,

926
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,000
I didn't receive your flowers.

927
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,440
I'm sorry.

928
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,920
I've been busy recently.

929
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,000
Something has been bothering me.

930
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,600
I promise

931
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,920
I'll give you the most special gift next time.

932
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:26,880
Xiyi,

933
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,520
I should feel sorry.

934
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,080
You always support me in every way.

935
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,440
But when you're in trouble,

936
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,880
I can't be there with you.

937
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,800
I feel so sorry.

938
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,080
You don't have to.

939
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,960
Now you're in a crucial stage of your life.

940
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,520
If you can pursue your dream,

941
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,720
I'll be relieved.

942
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,240
Okay.

943
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,560
If you didn't forget to send
me flowers this time,

944
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,360
I don't even know you mean a lot to me.

945
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,640
Xiyi,

946
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,720
I do.

947
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,320
What?

948
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,400
I've already known

949
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,200
you wanted to propose
to me during cruise trip.

950
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,480
When this performance is over,

951
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,960
let's get married then.

952
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,600
I've made up my mind.

953
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,480
I wanna be your bride
rather than a white swan.

954

Anna,

955
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,720
when I get my work done,

956
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,920
I promise I'll give you a perfect wedding.

957
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,040
Wait,

958
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,240
don't you think

959
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,560
you owe me a proposal before that?

960
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,280
No problem.

961
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,320
I should go back to sleep now.

962
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,760
I missed you so much that
I couldn't sleep last night.

963
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,760
If I can't get more sleep,
I'll be a white swan with black eyes.

964
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,120
Go ahead.

965
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,040

Bye bye.
