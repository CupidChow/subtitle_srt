(Episode 12)

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,720
Wang Zhengren,

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,920
what did you two talk about?

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,200
What's in that envelope?

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,040
I...

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,800
I...

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,240
Stop humming and hawing.

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,440
Just tell us.

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,800
It doesn't matter if you did something wrong.

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,720
I could intercede
with Grandma and Xiyi for you.

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,160
How could I help you if you don't tell us?

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,760
Zhengren,

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,560
I'll give you one more chance.

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,040
If you confess now,

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I could make some allowance.

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,520
I'll count to three.

43
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,240
One.

44
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,360
Two.

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,200
Zhengren.

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,240
Three.

47
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,800
Wang Zhengren, you're fired.

48
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,560
From now on,

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,480
Huaniao Island

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,520
and Cheng Jie

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,880
will be none of your concern.

52
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,720
You can go back to your Wall Street.

53
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,960
You can despise me.

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
You can disown me.

55
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,920
But I've never betrayed our company

56
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,120
or this family.

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,840
How could you fire me?

58
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,200
He's right.

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,440
Look, Xiyi. After all, he's your cousin.

60
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,600
Please don't fire him.

61
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,320
I gave him a chance,

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,760
but he wouldn't come clean.

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,520
It's settled.

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,040
I'm afraid

65
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,440
I can't agree with you.

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,000
What's your opinion, then,

67
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,160
Special Assistant to the Chairwoman?

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,760
Zhou Zhan

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,480
is our company's competitor.

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,200
Zhengren shouldn't have met with him

71
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,200
at a time like this.

72
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,400
But a download screenshot

73
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,120
doesn't prove that Zhengren has done

74
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,760
any damage to our company, does it?

75
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
This isn't a court,

76
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
and I'm not a judge.

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,240
Not every case requires ironclad proof.

78
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
Would you guys remain so calm

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,200
when he does compromise our company someday?

80
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,320
But how could we fire people

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,920
when we've got no evidence against them?

82
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,640
Then why did he keep quiet

83
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,120
when I asked him to speak up for himself?

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
He's got a guilty conscience.

85
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
I don't believe Zhengren would do anything

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,560
to put this family in harm's way.

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,280
OK.

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,920
Prove to me

89
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,120
Zhengren hasn't harmed this family.

90
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,720
Do we need to prove
our loyalty to our family?

91
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,080
Why are you asking me this question?

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,320
That's enough. Stop fighting.

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,480
Jiaxin,

94
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,280
do you really think

95
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,600
we should give Zhengren another chance?

96
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,040
Grandma,

97
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,760
I haven't known Zhengren long enough

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,880
compared with the rest of the family,

99
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,680
but I know he isn't a bad kid.

100
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,440
Chen Jiaxin!

101
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,040
Be quiet.

102
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,720
It's indisputable that Zhengren stole

103
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,320
the password.

104
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,880
Wang Zhengren,

105
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,640
you shall get a demerit for this

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,480
and there will be no bonus for you
at the end of this year.

107
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,880
As for our company's information leak,

108
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,400
we'll adopt Jiaxin's advice.

109
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,520
Zhengren shall not be punished

110
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,240
until we've got evidence.

111
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,600
Grandma,

112
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,280
this is absurd.

113
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,280
Jiaxin has turned our company...

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
Aren't I still the Chairwoman of Cheng Jie?

115
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,600
It's settled.

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,440
Yes, Grandma.

117
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,480
Sorry.

118
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,160
I was just

119
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,240
trying to express my own view.

120
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,120
You don't have to apologize to me.

121
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,640
You've managed to manipulate Grandma.

122
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,520
So you can do whatever you want

123
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,800
without caring about my feelings.

124
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,000
I...

125
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,040
It doesn't matter.

126
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,280
We're not

127
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,200
a devoted couple anyway.

128
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,360
Um,

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,640
can I

130
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,120
have a word with you

131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,440
about our company's logistics?

132
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,480
You can make your own decision.

133
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,960
You're capable of talking black into white.

134
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,160
It's your right to do so.

135
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,460
(Cheng Jie Group)

136
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,280
Mr. Yi,

137
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,720
things have been tougher for you.

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,960
Wang Zhengren keeps getting us into trouble.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And now Snail is on his side, too.

140
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,360
You know,

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,440
the files Zhengren showed Zhou Zhan

142
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,520
aren't top secret actually,

143
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
but he did give away

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,480
much info about our company.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,280
How do you suppose Zhou Zhan

146
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,880
is going to use this info against us?

147
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,600
I can't sit back
and let Zhou Zhan have his way.

148
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,520
I need to talk to him.

149
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Yeah. We need to talk to him

150
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,640
and tell him to forget about his dirty tricks

151
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,320
and be an honest businessman.

152
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,320
Or I'll report him.

153
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,520
I'm going to talk to him now.

154
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,360
Leave it to me.

155
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,200
Why?

156
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,800
Because it's a private matter
between him and me.

157
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,320
A private matter?

158
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,520
Huh? Why a private matter?

159
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,920
Mr. Yi, you're sure
you don't need my company?

160
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,040
I could protect you, Mr. Yi.

161
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,200
One more time.

162
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,600
One more time.

163
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,760
Mr. Yi.

164
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,840
So?

165
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,200
Care to play a game with me?

166
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,400
It's a pity that I'm out of your league.

167
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
I came here to talk with you.

168
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,360
This way, please.

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,880
You're too upset to mind your manners.

170
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I guess you're distressed about your cover

171
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,440
being blown.

172
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,920
Hold on. Let me have some water first.

173
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Mr. Zhou, be warned.

174
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
If your dirty tricks are aimed at me

175
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,880
or Cheng Jie,

176
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,720
go ahead and be my guest.

177
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,240
But Wang Zhengren

178
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,120
is just a kid.

179
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,760
I won't let you off

180
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,960
if you dare make use of him again

181
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,120
and turn him into a scoundrel like you.

182
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,680
Tsk.

183
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,280
I didn't know you're a man
of such noble characters.

184
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,160
I'm almost moved to tears

185
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,160
to see you caring so much

186
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,360
about your little brother

187
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,040
when you should be worried
about yourself instead,

188
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,480
since I know your dirty secret now.

189
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,960
My dirty secret?

190
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
I've learned that you'd spent time

191
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
cuddling and kissing another woman

192
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
before you got married.

193
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,960
Wang Xiyi,

194
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,520
I thought you cared about yourself most.

195
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,760
Who'd know you care about
your cousin so much?

196
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,240
I just called Huaniao Island.

197
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,720
They said Zhengren
was absent from work today.

198
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,160
He didn't answer my phone.

199
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,440
He did that on purpose, I guess.

200
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Can you call him for me?

201
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,320
OK.

202
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,000
Hello, Zhengren.

203
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,160
What is Zhengren doing here?

204
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,320
He always comes here when he's feeling down.

205
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,320
There he is.

206
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,680
Wait.

207
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,320
Did you tell him I'd be coming with you?

208
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,840
Huh?

209
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,960
Doesn't it feel awful to be misunderstood?

210
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,400
It sucks to have a bossy brother

211
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,120
like Wang Xiyi.

212
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,960
Yet you married him, poor thing.

213
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,480
Wouldn't you rather have a big brother

214
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,200
not as capable and outstanding

215
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,120
as he is?

216
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,000
I, too,

217
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,600
used to find him bossy

218
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,520
and unwilling to listen to anyone.

219
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,640
But later I found

220
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,520
that people like them

221
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,600
worry about a lot of things,

222
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,040
but they won't burden others with them.

223
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,120
He threw a tantrum over Zhou Zhan yesterday

224
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,560
not because he was worried for our company

225
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,560
but because he was worried for you.

226
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,360
Me?

227
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,480
Come on.

228
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,160
He's worried for himself.

229
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,720
Zhou Zhan is a narrow-minded man

230
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
of no scruples.

231
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,360
Your brother doesn't want him
to lead you astray.

232
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,400
He taught Zhou Zhan a lesson this morning,

233
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,680
telling him to stay away from you.

234
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,320
Take them out.

235
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,880
Show me.

236
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,760
The pictures with which
Zhou Zhan blackmailed you.

237
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,060
(Shanghai Wusongkou
International Cruise Terminal)

238
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,520
Zhou Zhan has been spying
on Cheng Jie for a long time.

239
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,960
He had pictures of you and Anna taken.

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,280
After the cooperation fizzled out,

241
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,360
he began to have Jiaxin investigated,

242
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,960
and then he learned you're a married couple.

243
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,480
It's been a long time.

244
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,120
What do you want?

245
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,080
I came here

246
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,200
to show you this.

247
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
Wang Xiyi appears

248
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,640
to be a decent man,

249
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,560
but he's kept his marriage a secret

250
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,320
and flirted with other woman
before getting married.

251
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,200
What a scoundrel!

252
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,760
You've long kept my brother under watch,

253
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,840
haven't you?

254
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,160
Wrong.

255
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,920
To be precise,

256
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
I've long kept Cheng Jie under watch.

257
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,280
Cheng Jie is a respectable competitor.

258
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,840
He who knows both the enemy
and himself is bound to win in all battles.

259
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,640
I dare not ask why Jiaxin could stand

260
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,520
your having Anna's picture in your room,

261
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,720
and I don't know what's going on
between the three of you,

262
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,360
but I know

263
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,440
Grandma has high hopes for your marriage.

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,680
And I know

265
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,640
you guys, especially Jiaxin,

266
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
will get hurt

267
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,040
if Zhou Zhan reveals the secret.

268
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,200
I didn't know what to do.

269
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,760
So...

270
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,720
So you bought the pictures

271
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,680
with your money.

272
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Zhengren, you got fooled by Zhou Zhan.

273
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,760
How could a few pictures

274
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,920
possibly compromise our company?

275
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,000
Tell me why

276
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,080
you used Grandma's password

277
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,640
to access our company's database.

278
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,280
After Zhou Zhan's company was found

279
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
to be using plasticizer,

280
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,160
I've been thinking

281
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,920
that we should spend more time

282
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,200
on figuring out

283
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,320
what our company needs most

284
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,520
instead of just working on public relations.

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,760
So

286
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,240
I just wanted to learn more

287
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,640
about our company.

288
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,280
Zhengren,

289
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,160
I can't explain to you

290
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,880
what's going on between Jiaxin,

291
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
me and Anna for the time being.

292
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,440
But trust me,

293
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,720
we've all got our own difficulties.

294
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,880
I've been trying

295
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,760
to protect everyone from getting hurt.

296
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,520
And...

297
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,960
Sorry.

298
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,280
I misunderstood you.

299
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,080
I find it weird to see you apologize to me.

300
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,440
I like it better when you're cool and tough.

301
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,000
I've decided to report Zhou Zhan's blackmail

302
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,760
to the police.

303
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,720
Why did you believe in Zhengren?

304
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,320
I mean,

305
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,360
why did you trust him

306
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,160
when you couldn't prove his innocence?

307
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,000
Because of you.

308
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,640
As an outsider,

309
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
I find your family odd.

310
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,240
You care about each other deeply,

311
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,800
but you always hide your soft side

312
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,360
and show each other your tough side.

313
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,040
That's how you treat Auntie and Zhengren.

314
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,480
You were so angry that day.

315
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,640
I was afraid that you'd feel more miserable

316
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,800
after firing him.

317
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,080
At last you did one thing right.

318
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,600
Perhaps I did.

319
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,040
At least you wouldn't regret your decision.

320
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,160
I...

321
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,120
Oh, right.

322
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,960
I've got many e-mails to check.

323
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,120
I must try to make fewer mistakes.

324
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:38,920
Bye.

325
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,520
Hey.

326
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,800
What?

327
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,760
You've agreed on Snail's decision

328
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,880
to get a new logistics company

329
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,560
and a new coffee equipment manufacturer?

330
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,520
Mr. Yi, I've got to remind you.

331
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,320
You've lost track of your pace.

332
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,200
What are you talking about?

333
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,280
About Snail, of course.

334
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,360
What about her?

335
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,120
Look, we agreed from the beginning that we'd

336
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,960
prevent Snail
from achieving a dominant position,

337
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,520
but I heard from Mr. Shen

338
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,520
that Snail was given a divorce agreement

339
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
and a new job through Mr. Shen's help.

340
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,840
Besides, we agreed that your marriage

341
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,160
wouldn't be made public.

342
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,480
You threw a tantrum when Snail

343
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,640
pretended to be a stranger to you.

344
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,880
You said the lunch
Snail made for you was horrible,

345
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,760
but you devoured it in a hurry.

346
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,280
When Snail had run away from home,

347
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,400
you had to send me to get her back.

348
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,520
And you said

349
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,840
we should let your cousin show off

350
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,600
without mocking him,

351
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,200
but you taught him a lesson

352
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,800
when you learned he'd bullied Snail.

353
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,320
I wouldn't have believed those things

354
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
if I hadn't seen them with my own eyes.

355
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,800
You've slacked off, haven't you?

356
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,200
No, I haven't.

357
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,920
Who said I've slacked off?

358
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,720
It's called being flexible.

359
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,720
Flexible.

360
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,720
What nonsense!

361
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,560
I think you're letting Snail

362
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,080
placing herself above you.

363
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,800
Bro, I know you're a good man

364
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,400
who's cold on the outside
but very kind on the inside,

365
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,680
but you need to know

366
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,520
that Anna is the woman

367
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,320
you'll spend the rest of your life with.

368
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,000
If you don't keep a distance from Snail now,

369
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,800
what on earth

370
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,280
are you going to do if you should

371
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,200
fall in love with her one day?

372
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,520
Stop being a gossip, will you?

373
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,400
Have you booked a flight to Paris for me?

374
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,360
A flight?

375
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,520
I don't want to have this idle talk with you.

376
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,600
Jiaxin and I have talked through our future.

377
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,280
That's all I can do for her now.

378
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,560
Because she's the mother of my child.

379
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,480
Don't get me wrong.

380
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,480
And

381
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,000
copy our financial statements

382
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,880
for the past three years for me.

383
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,240
For the past three years?

384
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,440
Are you serious?

385
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,040
You can't be serious, man.

386
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
You don't think you get to go first

387
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,000
just because you're a man, do you?

388
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,200
Are you as fond of cutting in line

389
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,640
as Snail is?

390
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,240
What do you mean?

391
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,080
Nothing.

392
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,080
Explain yourself.

393
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,380
(Siqi)

394
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,160
Pick up the phone, Chen Jiaxin.

395
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,420
(Siqi)

396
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,840
Chen Jiaxin,

397
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,160
so Wang Xiyi had a girlfriend

398
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,640
before marrying you.

399
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,100
(Siqi: Missed Call)

400
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,160
Chen Jiaxin,

401
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,480
so Wang Xiyi had a girlfriend

402
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,040
before marrying you.

403
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,360
There must be a hidden story
about that cruise trip.

404
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,720
Why didn't you tell me?

405
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,320
Do you know

406
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,080
Wang Xiyi is flying to Europe next week

407
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,480
for a date with his ex-girlfriend?

408
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,200
He's ignoring you, his wife.

409
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,920
You mustn't think other women are

410
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,040
as kind and harmless as you are.

411
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,160
You've got to take action.

412
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,040
Call me back immediately.

413
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,320
Hello.

414
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,720
I've booked a flight to Europe.

415
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,560
I'll be able to see you next week.

416
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,400
Of course.

417
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,920
This competition means a lot to you.

418
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,040
Of course I'll be there to support you.

419
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,840
Chen Jiaxin,

420
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,920
don't feel sad.

421
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,320
You've known how he feels about Anna

422
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,280
since the first day you met him.

423
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,080
Don't worry.

424
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,200
Take care of yourself in Europe.

425
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,760
What's the matter?

426
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,040
What was that noise?

427
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,480
Nothing.

428
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,280
I broke something.
I'll call you back in a minute.

429
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,360
Leave it to me.

430
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,160
You should have been more careful.

431
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,640
I'm sorry.

432
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,640
It was just a vase.
There's no need to apologize.

433
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,880
I meant

434
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,600
you and Anna.

435
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,840
Don't take it to heart.

436
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,160
There's no need to dwell on it

437
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,320
since we know

438
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,840
how each other feels.

439
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,400
Or you won't stop feeling sorry for me,

440
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,960
and I won't stop feeling bad for you.

441
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,920
Wang Xiyi,

442
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,640
my apology

443
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
isn't just verbal.

444
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,440
I'll try to persuade Grandma

445
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,640
to allow you

446
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
to go to Europe.

447
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,040
Are you kidding me, mother-to-be?

448
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,880
You spoke for him
when he wanted to visit your rival?

449
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,160
I wonder what that
head of yours is stuffed with,

450
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,000
paste?

451
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,520
But Wang Xiyi has been in love

452
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,200
with Anna the whole time.

453
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,600
I'm nothing to him.

454
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,000
So Anna and I aren't rivals.

455
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,120
If it hadn't been for me,

456
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,200
they'd have been a happy couple.

457
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,480
What are you talking about?

458
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,440
Are you out of your mind?

459
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,480
Listen to me.

460
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,480
Falling in love is like
getting a promotion and a pay raise

461
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,000
in that it doesn't matter
if you're a latecomer or not.

462
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,480
You can sue your husband and that woman

463
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,720
for having an affair.

464
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,760
Sue them?

465
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,680
Yes.

466
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,160
I'll be your lawyer

467
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,720
if they dare bully you again.

468
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,480
But...

469
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,800
If I hire you as my lawyer,

470
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,480
I bet Wang Xiyi will hire Mr. Shen.

471
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,640
So

472
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,480
are you sure you want to play against

473
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,440
your boss?

474
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,040
What are your chances of success?

475
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,080
Do you think you'll win the lawsuit?

476
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
Even if you win,

477
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,840
you're not afraid that he might fire you?

478
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,000
Forget it.

479
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,200
Not even good officials
can settle family troubles.

480
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,520
Lawsuits can be hurtful.

481
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,560
Therefore, Mrs. Wang,

482
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,720
watch your husband like a hawk

483
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,120
and beware of the other woman.

484
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,560
I get it.

485
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,160
I'll do as you say.

486
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,080
Now tell me something.

487
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
You've been married for some time

488
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,280
and you commute together every day.

489
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,960
You haven't got closer to each other at all?

490
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,520
There's a time difference
between here and Europe,

491
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,240
but we've got much urgent work to do.

492
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,360
So you'll often need
to make your own decision.

493
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,200
Now we shall begin the special training.

494
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,400
Sit down.

495
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,240
Let's get started.

496
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,600
As for payment process of our Finance Dept.,

497
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,120
you can take a look at this tree diagram.

498
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,040
Foreign payments are made
every Wednesday and Friday.

499
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,800
On those days you'll need
to check the balance sheet and sign.

500
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,600
OK.

501
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,820
♪If love is used to make sentences,♪

502
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,200
Since Soft Water
was removed from the shelves,

503
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,920
consumers have begun
to care more about the natural ingredients

504
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,920
and health benefits of hair care products.

505
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,000
(Launch Scheme)
We've successfully developed Seeyoung.

506
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,680
It's a good time to launch it.

507
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,680
So it's our marketing strategy to focus

508
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,560
on non-irritating natural scalp care
that is silicone-oil-free.

509
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,040
"You wash your hair regularly,

510
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,600
but have you ever washed your scalp?"

511
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,640
We'll use slogans like this
to raise awareness

512
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,240
among young consumers about scalp health.

513
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,440
Here's a report for Mr. Yi

514
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,840
and Special Assistant
to the Chairwoman to go over.

♪I-ya-ya, I am high-spirited...♪

516
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,480
Our Seeyoung has many merits,

517
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,520
but it's still a bit risky to put forth

518
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,600
new hair care concepts.

519
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,560
So we need to impress our target consumers

520
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,080
by using a young
and fashionable publicity approach.

521
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,880
We need to excite consumers' curiosity

522

523
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,920
instead of only advertising its effects.

524
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,680
Volume is a matter of concern

525
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,040
for young consumers these days.

526
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,680
So we'll set the tonic ginger series

as our featured products.

676
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,280
are so stubborn these days.

677
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,320
You won't really grow up

678
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,080
until you slip up a few times

679
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,840
without us there to protect you.

680
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,400
Thank you, Grandma.

681
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,560
What about that one?

682
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,240
Mission accomplished.

683
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,960
I'm so glad, Chen Jiaxin.

684
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,880
Put me down.

685
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,760
Be careful not to hurt little Ximi.

686
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,520
Chen Jiaxin.

687
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,240
Are you sure you don't need my company?

688
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,760
I mean,

689
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,440
are you sure you'll be alright on your own?

690
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,440
You told me

691
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,840
it's been Anna's greatest dream

692
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,720
to stand on the world's best stage.

693
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,120
I guess that's why

694
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,520
Anna

695
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,920
gave up that cruise trip.

696
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,120
You said

697
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,040
I made a mess

698
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,240
of your life.

699
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,640
So I tried my best

700
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,680
to make it up to you.

701
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,840
If I were Anna,

702
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,520
I'd also love to see my beloved

703
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,680
applauding me in the audience.

704
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,520
Chen Jiaxin,

705
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,960
I said those words

706
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,480
in a fit of anger.

707
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,000
No.

708
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,440
You were right.

709
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,400
I made a mess of your life.

710
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,320
So let me help

711
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,360
put your life back on track.

712
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,080
Ask the R&D to send me an email
before they leave work on Friday.

713
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,080
Ask Global Business to report to me

714
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,360
on the progress in Europe.

715
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,520
Is everything going well

716
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,720
with Jiaxin's work?

717
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,960
Don't worry. I've confirmed it.

718
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,320
OK.

719
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,160
I'm so relieved that Grandma

720
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,640
always follows Jiaxin's advice,

721
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,560
or she wouldn't have allowed me to go abroad.

722
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,120
Snail isn't an ungrateful wretch, after all.

723
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,040
Stop calling her Snail.

724
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,520
She's Special Assistant to the Chairwoman

725
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,160
and you're Special Assistant
to the General Manager.

726
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,160
So she's your superior.

728
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,700
(Cheng Jie Group)

729
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,800
What's the matter?

730
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,000
Nothing.

731
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,480
It's just...

732
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,880
I've got the schedule
for the prenatal program next week.

733
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,200
I don't know

734
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,360
if it would clash with the company meeting.

735
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:41,840
Yeah?

736
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,600
But you look a bit sad to me.

737
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,840
Doctor Hao will nag me again

738
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,280
if he sees me attending the class alone.

739
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,320
What should I say about that Doctor Hao?

740
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,160
He's got a sharp tongue for a medical worker.

741
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,640
But we dare not offend him.

742
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,520
So you'll have to be patient with him.

743
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,240
Oh, right.

744
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,240
I thought you had a luncheon to attend today.

745
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,600
What are you doing here?

746
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,280
It was canceled.

747
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,360
Grandma asked us to have lunch at home.

748
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,560
OK.

749
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,440
Is lunch ready yet?

750
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,200
It's ready. Or it'll get burnt.

751
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,440
Hurry.

752
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,960
Grandma.

753
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,400
You're home.

754
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:33,880
Grandma,

755
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,320
why did you ask us to have lunch at home?

756
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,040
Come with me.

757
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,000
We've got a guest today.

758
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,320
I'd like to introduce you over lunch.

759
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,720
Come on, Grandma.

760
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,280
You ask me to keep you company

761
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,160
every time you entertain your guests.

762
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,040
Who's your guest today?

763
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,080
Go get the door.

764
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,400
Dylan.

765
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,480
So you're Grandma's guest?

766
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,960
It's been a long time.

767
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,760
Hello, Jiaxin. Hello, Mrs. Wang.

768
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,360
Mrs. Wang has prepared a dinner to welcome me

769
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,360
after learning of my return.

770
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,160
Mrs. Wang, this is for you.

771
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,760
Thank you.

772
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,040
Just call me Grandma.

773
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,080
Isn't this our product?

774
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,960
You gave a Heritage product
to the Chairwoman of Heritage.

775
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,720
What a lousy gift.

776
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,240
Grandma, it's no ordinary Heritage product.

777
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,440
Please take a close look at the packaging.

778
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,840
It's a Heritage product newly released
to the European markets.

779
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,480
This Heritage product I'm giving you

780
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,480
is quite meaningful,
since it was first shipped abroad

781
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,520
and then brought back by plane.

782
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,480
It's precious indeed.

783
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Come on. Lunch is ready.

784
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Don't just stand there.

785
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,680
Mom. Have a seat.

786
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,160
Come on.

787
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,640
-Come on. -Come on.

788
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,640
Xiuling,

789
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,000
this is my honored guest.

790
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,680
He's also Jiaxin's friend.

791
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,000
Don't forget him.

792
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,280
Jiaxin, how have you been?

793
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,280
I'm doing fine.
I've gone through the first trimester,

794
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,600
so I'm feeling much better now.

795
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,120
I heard that a woman's pregnancy
will be obvious after the first trimester,

796
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,040
is it true?

797
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,920
Yeah, I guess so.

798
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,240
Some clothes that used to fit me well

799
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,920
feel a bit tight now.

800
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,440
Grandma, are we having this dinner today

801
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,920
to welcome Dylan home

802
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,720
or for Dylan to ask Jiaxin questions?

803
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,040
I want to take this opportunity
to thank Dylan.

804
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,520
But for his connections in Europe,

805
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,280
our Heritage products wouldn't have

806
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,920
been launched in Europe so smoothly.

807
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,840
You've got such connections?

808
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,200
Awesome.

809
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,640
No bother at all.

810
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,880
It was my pleasure.

811
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
You're awesome.

812
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,360
Why? You two can have

813
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,920
an agreeable chat on everything.

814
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,800
In fact, besides thanking you
and giving a dinner to welcome you,

815
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,880
most importantly,

816
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,960
I want you and Jiaxin
to discuss our business in Europe.

817
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,160
I've put Jiaxin in charge
of the company on my behalf.

818
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,200
Since Xiyi is going abroad

819
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,000
and that you're familiar with Europe,

820
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,320
I hope you can tutor Jiaxin

821
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,920
while Xiyi is away.

822
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,240
No problem.

823
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,040
I bet you'll hoodwink Chen Jiaxin again.

824
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,280
Come on. Let's eat.

825
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,280
Eat.

826
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,160
Help yourselves.

827
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,800
Grandma.

828
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
About my trip to Europe...

829
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,360
I know.

830
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
Don't worry. I'll take care of Jiaxin,

831
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,000
and so will Dylan.

832
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,440
He accompanied her
to a pregnancy check-up last time.

833
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,520
He'll take good care of her, I'm sure.

834
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,960
What? Come on, Grandma.

835
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:30,760
What's the matter?

836
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,480
We could leave the overseas business

837
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,840
to our Global Business Dept.

838
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,840
But Jiaxin doesn't know them very well.

839
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,000
Right now she needs someone patient

840
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,080
to tutor her little by little.

841
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,080
They really hit it off.

842
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,360
Dylan is the best person
for it aside from you.

843
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,320
