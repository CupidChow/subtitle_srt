27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,940
(Episode 17)

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,520
This pen is still here.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,240
My brother gave it to Xiyi when he went

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,360
to elementary school.

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,760
I remember it was with this pen

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,000
that my brother held Xiyi's hand

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,080
and taught him to write

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,800
one stroke after another.

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,040
So Xiyi had always treasured it.

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,600
He even signed his first contract

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,080
with it after he started to
work for the company.

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,320
Later it was broken
and couldn't be repaired anywhere.

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,080
I thought he had thrown it away.

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
I didn't expect he'd still be keeping it.

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,720
Auntie, can I have a look at it?

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,600
My brother didn't waste his love on Xiyi.

43
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,640
He's a capable, aspiring and grateful man.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:14,920
Okay.

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,440
Choose one from these things.

46
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,520
Auntie, let's keep them.

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,040
Their significance far outweighs their value.

48
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,120
I don't want to auction them.

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh dear, Mom,

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,080
are you going to make a master of yourself?

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,560
Aren't you tired sitting
for such a long time?

52
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,080
Come on, have a cup of tea.

53
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,480
Doesn't your waist ache?

54
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,240
Grandma.

55
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,760
Grandma, I've made up my mind.

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,600
I'm going to donate the wishing box I made.

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,400
That's not good, isn't it?

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,400
That's great.

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,600
Mom.

60
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,200
Yes, this box looks fine

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,600
and I know you love it.

62
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,080
But think about this.

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,360
Jiaxin is not a master.

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,040
It's not worth a red cent.

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,880
What if no one bids for it?

66
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,720
Won't our family lose face, then?

67
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,320
Auntie is right. I didn't think things over.

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
I'll put it back there.

69
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,840
Xiuling,

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,960
don't just measure an object with money.

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,200
You need to feel its real value
with your heart.

72
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,480
You just don't understand.

73
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,680
So I'm the chairwoman

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,000
and your mom. Got it?

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,840
Okay, I've got it. You're right.

76
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,400
I didn't think deeply.

77
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Okay, I have no objection now

78
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,600
and I hope Jiaxin will do a good job on it.

79
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,800
Don't let anyone say Grandma misjudges you.

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,400
Grandma, thank you for your support

81
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,480
but

82
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,800
I think Auntie was also right.

83
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,720
This is indeed not presentable.

84
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,240
You both know me so you'll be tolerant of me.

85
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,760
But people in the auction will be strangers,

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,160
they may not think the same.

87
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,440
What matters in a charity auction
is a kind heart

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,480
but not something to show off on purpose.

89
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,560
I believe someone will be able to feel

90
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,640
the emotions you endowed your work with.

91
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,040
Trust my judgement

92
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,640
and trust yourself,

93
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,560
okay?

94
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:16,840
Mm.

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,560
You got this.

96
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:19,920
I got this.

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
It's pretty good.

98
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,800
So that's settled
for the publicity of Heritage.

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,680
Mr. Yi, Mr. Yi, wait a minute.

100
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,720
This is a requisition for payment.

101
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,760
You need to sign it.

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,120
We'll go to the charity auction soon.

103
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,440
Shouldn't you pick up Jiaxin this morning?

104
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,120
What are you doing here?

105
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
She sent me a Wechat message.

106
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,840
She's afraid your acquaintances
will see you with her

107
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,920
so she has asked Dylan to take her.

108
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,120
I'm not afraid. What's she afraid for?

109
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,240
Hello.

110
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,240
Sign here, please.

111
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,400
Here you go.

112
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,720
While I was made to work overtime by my boss,

113
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,760
someone's making every effort to do the work.

114
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,320
Other people came to bid for things.

115
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,360
I'm afraid someone's here to fawn on them.

116
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,320
I don't care what you say.

117
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,280
When I get higher and higher in the company,

118
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,400
don't say hello to me when you see me.

119
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,160
Because you're too much below me.

120
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,400
Higher and higher?

121
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
Do you think you're a firework?

122
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,160
But I'd like to see where you end up.

123
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,320
Be careful not to explode

124
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,080
before you go up in the sky.

125
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
Do you mean your good friend, Chen Jiaxin?

126
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,720
She was poached by Cheng Jie Group

127
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,680
but replaced soon
after she became the Special Assistant

128
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,440
to the Chairwoman.

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,920
What a joke.

130
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,280
Is Chen Jiaxin someone you can joke about?

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Do you know Wang Xiyi...

132
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,240
I'll handle it.

133
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,320
I changed the tickets for tonight.
We'll still go on a date.

134
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,920
What's wrong?

135
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,800
Something's troubling you again?

136
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,720
Don't always think I'm depressed, okay?

137
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,200
You ask about my troubles every time we meet.

138
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,160
Are you really not troubled?

139
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,880
Why did you agree to let me take you, then?

140
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,880
Are you avoiding Wang Xiyi?

141
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,960
Usually couples who just get married

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,640
or whose child is just conceived

143
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,680
will be affectionate towards each other

144
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,520
and full to the brim with happiness.

145
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,200
But now you look

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,240
as if you've eaten a plate of bitter melon

147
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,960
and you're waiting for a divorce.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,920
You saw it?

149
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,120
Okay, let's be honest with each other.

150
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Actually I've known about it.

151
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,360
That time I saw your papers.

152
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,080
In order to find the owner,
I read them a bit.

153
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,840
So you've been sympathetic to me

154
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,680
and always helped me silently?

155
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,480
Have I?

156
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,000
I can't let my mom

157
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,360
know about the divorce agreement.

158
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,400
But

159
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,120
I can't tell my best friend either.

160
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,960
She's too emotional.

161
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
I'm so troubled

162
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,800
but I don't know who to talk to.

163
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,960
Now that I've known about it,

164
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,360
if you trust me, I'll be all ears.

165
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,320
Actually,

166
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,640
it was originally an accident.

167
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,560
I got pregnant accidentally
and wanted to have the baby.

168
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,160
I want this child.

169
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,160
Xiyi said

170
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,880
-I could have him.
-I want him.

171
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,240
You and I are both clear

172
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,320
the reason why we got married
and our purpose.

173
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,040
You're not included in my future.

174
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,760
He wanted a divorce.

175
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,960
Actually

176
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,520
I think he was right.

177
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,920
Two people who didn't love each other

178
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,400
were forced to live together.

179
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,240
It's unfair to both of them.

180
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,640
So

181
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,920
I signed the divorce agreement the next day.

182
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,960
I signed it

183
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,760
because I know letting Ximi stay with you

184
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,080
is my best choice.

185
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,600
But as Ximi

186
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,320
grows bigger day by day in my belly,

187
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,160
it seems

188
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,520
something is

189
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,560
also changing little by little.

190
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,840
It's fate that brought us together.

191
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,720
Grandma is nice to me

192
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,440
and Xiyi isn't as cold as he used to be.

193
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,400
When I'm afraid,

194
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,720
he'll encourage me.

195
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,400
He accompanies me when I go to have pregnancy

196
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,840
checkups and classes like a real husband.

197
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,800
Auntie and Zhengren said

198
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,320
things I cooked were delicious.

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,880
Auntie even

200
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
changed the photo

201
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,680
of Anna's

202
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,400
in Xiyi's room for me.

203
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,960
Anna's photo?

204
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,960
How did Wang Xiyi react to it?
Did he get cross?

205
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,680
No.

206
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,280
He just said...

207
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,440
There's no need to change it.

208
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,920
It's good for pregnant people.
We can keep it here.

209
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,960
That house is

210
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,680
increasingly like

211
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,080
a real home to me.

212
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,600
I am practicing

213
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,480
how to leave.

214
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,280
But

215
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,760
the more I practice, the more I suffer.

216
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,880
When I think of the fact

217
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,560
that I may never see Ximi,

218
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,400
Grandma

219
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,640
and Wang Xiyi again,

220
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,400
I'll feel a void in my heart.

221
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,680
Jiaxin, you're a kind-hearted person

222
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,000
and you treat everyone sincerely.

223
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,480
It's one of your strengths.

224
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,040
People who truly understand you
will cherish you.

225
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,800
Have you thought about it?

226
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,080
In addition to you,

227
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,000
maybe Wang Xiyi is also reconsidering

228
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,560
the relationship between you.

229
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,400
Now that the photo has been

230
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,040
changed for one you like,

231
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,800
perhaps in Wang Xiyi's mind,

232
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,480
that member of his family can be also you.

233
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,920
Well, where shall I sign?

234
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,120
Here.

235
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,000
Don't blush. Did you forget...

236
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,000
Stop talking.

237
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,760
Where's Chen Jiaxin?

238
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,800
I didn't see her. She hasn't signed in yet.

239
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,920
She's so slow.

240
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,400
I'm sorry. I'm late.

241
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,920
Chen Jiaxin, not bad.

242
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,400
Don't get it wrong.
The chairwoman asked me to come.

243
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,360
Stop guessing.

244
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,400
She came with me.

245
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,280
What do you think

246
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
Chen Jiaxin should attend the auction as?

247
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,320
So

248
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,880
she's not your partner

249
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,400
but mine.

250
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,040
Let's go, Jiaxin.

251
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,280
Chen Jiaxin is here as the female owner

252
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,680
of Cheng Jie Group.

253
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Of course she'll be with me.

254
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,040
Let's go, Jiaxin.

255
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,120
Chen Jiaxin and the female
owner of Cheng Jie Group.

256
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
What does that mean?

257
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,240
Think. Who'll be the female
owner of Cheng Jie Group?

258
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,400
The female owner of Cheng Jie Group is

259
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,960
certainly the chairwoman.

260
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,560
Chen Jiaxin was her special assistant before

261
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
so she's representing the chairwoman,

262
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,080
isn't she?

263
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,040
She's still...

264
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,200
One point five million.

265
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,480
One point five million.

266
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,560
The gentleman right
in front of me bid 1.5 million.

267
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,720
Is anyone bidding more than 1.5 million?

268
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,600
Two million.

269
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,800
Okay, two million.

270
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,960
That gentleman bid two million.

271
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,960
Two million, first.

272
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,640
Two million, second.

273
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,680
Two million, last chance.

274
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,880
Sold.

275
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,320
Work of famous artists are really different.

276
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,560
Everyone is so enthusiastic.

277
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,400
How about you?

278
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,600
What did you bring here?

279
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,640
I...

280
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,920
I didn't take it from your possession.

281
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,120
Okay,

282
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,640
the next lot is

283
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,400
a piece of pottery from Cheng Jie Group,

284
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,200
"Make a Wish".

285
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,240
The creator wants to tell us

286
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,800
that distance is a door
and a wish is the light.

287
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,600
You brought a thing that you made?

288
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,640
Mm.

289
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,720
Dylan has been looking for his sister.

290
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
I want to encourage him
through this handiwork.

291
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,800
The reserve price is ten thousand yuan.

292
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,200
If I take something from Grandma and you,

293
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,640
though it's valuable,

294
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,160
it's not from me, after all.

295
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,920
Besides,

296
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
I don't want anything from you anymore.

297
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,240
I didn't ask you to pay me for it.

298
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,480
And your thing is also mine.

299
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,800
You not only came here for yourself,

300
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,520
but also Cheng Jie and me.

301
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,920
Okay, is anyone interested

302
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,480
in such a rare piece of work?

303
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,520
100 thousand.

304
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,560
100 thousand yuan.

305
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,400
I know the creator of this work.

306
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,520
She wasn't influenced by any school

307
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,360
and freely shows
what she observes in the world.

308
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,080
This work is intricate

309
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,680
and conveys the creator's warm
and deep feelings,

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,280
which is very infectious.

311
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
You can calm yourselves down and feel it.

312
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,640
As a professional art broker,

313
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,160
I seldom see

314
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,400
such a diamond in the rough.

315
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,080
After being refined by time,

316
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,400
she can definitely shine in this field.

317
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:24,740
(Wishing Box)

318
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,560
Thanks for Dylan's brilliant explanation.

319
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,680
We can see that he has an eye for talents.

320
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,200
The price is 100 thousand yuan now.

321
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,200
Is anyone bidding more?

322
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,320
200 thousand.

323
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,760
Recommend the talented, even your relatives.

324
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,000
I know the creator, too.

325
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,040
This person does confusing things

326
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
but she has rich feelings

327
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,120
and a meticulous mind

328
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,920
when creating work of art.

329
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,000
There are many works
of this creator at my house.

330
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,800
And this will complete them.

331
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,640
Okay, Mr. Yi from Cheng Jie
bid 200 thousand yuan.

332
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,240
Is anyone bidding more?

333
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,240
850 thousand.

334
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,360
850 thousand.

335
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,120
Dylan bid 850 thousand yuan.

336
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,560
Looks like they both
want to do a good deed today.

337
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,120
So is anyone bidding more than 850 thousand?

338
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,320
That's enough. I just want to be of help.

339
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,000
It's not worth so much money.

340
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,240
I think it's worth it.

341
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,600
One million.

342
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,600
One million.

343
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,440
Mr. Yi bid one million.

344
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,240
What a generous benefactor.

345
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,560
One million, first.

346
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,280
One million, second.

347
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,520
One million, last chance.

348
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,280
Sold.

349
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,960
Congratulations, Mr. Yi.

350
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,200
Thank Mr. Yi from Cheng Jie
for being so generous.

351
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:00,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

352
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,160
let's invite him to say
something with warm applause.

353
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,720
Good.

354
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,640
Thanks for letting me have the lot

355
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,280
and Cheng Jie Group contribute a little bit

356
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,520
in this charity auction.

357
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,280
This auction has

358
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,520
unusual meaning to me.

359
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,040
It lets me get

360
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,240
a precious and significant treasure.

361
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,560
I hope

362
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,560
you'll keep doing things for charity

363
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,240
and help more people.

364
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,240
Thank you.

365
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,280
What's wrong?

366
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,520
It...

367
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,160
it seems...

368
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,120
I can't spend time with you anymore.

369
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,080
Is it because I was angry at you just now?

370
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,040
Actually

371
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,440
I've always enjoyed being a nobody.

372
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,320
I make efforts and I always fail.

373
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,920
But I'm thankful

374
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,040
that I'm a nobody.

375
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,120
No one will care

376
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,480
about my failure.

377
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,560
I care.

378
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,920
Dylan had a point there.

379
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,600
You're a diamond in the rough

380
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,280
and after being refined by time,

381
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,480
you'll shine at what you're doing.

382
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,600
You can see it

383
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,600
because you're a good person.

384
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
But you can't be like this anymore.

385
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,760
Like what?

386
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,800
You keep looking at me.

387
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,320
I got pregnant with Ximi accidentally.

388
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,280
You said you'd be responsible for us.

389
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,040
My colleagues bullied me.

390
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,240
You asked me to keep my chin up.

391
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,440
People misunderstood me.

392
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,680
You said you'd be my sheet anchor.

393
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,640
But you know something?

394
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,320
A nobody is

395
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,720
still going to be a nobody in the end.

396
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,600
If you keep being nice to me,

397
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,760
I'll take it for granted.

398
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
Haven't we agreed?

399
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,560
You set the boundary.

400
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,720
I signed the agreement.

401
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,360
After a few months

402
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,920
and I give birth to Ximi,

403
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
I'll leave without delay.

404
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,880
But you keep giving me things.

405
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
It's harder and harder for me to leave

406
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,160
and pretend that I don't care.

407
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,480
Because I have to look at you.

408
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,720
When I'm not looking at you,

409
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,920
I'll worry that something's happening to you.

410
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,280
What about you?

411
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,600
You endure it alone no matter what happens.

412
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,480
It's not all your fault
that you're pregnant with Ximi.

413
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,280
You kept apologizing to me.

414
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,160
I asked you to sign the agreement
and you signed it.

415
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,040
I asked you to move in and you moved in.

416
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,240
I asked you to move out and you moved out.

417
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,640
You blessed me and Anna
and then you cried alone.

418
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,440
Chen Jiaxin, how could you be so stupid?

419
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,720
If I don't look at you,

00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,280

I looked for ages.

479
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,320

Can't I take a photo here?

480
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,320
Yes, you can. Let's stop talking

481
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,320
and take a photo first, alright?

482
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,920
How can we do it like this? Turn around.

483
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,360
This is it. Quick.
We'll take a photo like this.

484
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,360

485
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,040

490
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,560

492
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,160

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,560
We're wearing lover's clothes.

505
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,000
What a good match.

506
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
You said I was pretty.

507
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,920
What's pretty about me?

508
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,080
Shameless. Shameless.

509
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,760
How could you ask me that question?

510
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,400
I mean our outfits match.

511
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,840
Your foul mouth
can never utter any nice things!

512
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,320
Okay, okay. You can say nice things.

513
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,000
You can say so many nice things.

514
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,320
So many for me to take in.

515
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,320
Hurry up or we'll miss the movie.

516
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,680
Goodness,

517
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,680
a lump of clay can be

518
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,520
sold for money after you squeeze and bake it.

519
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,200
Jiaxin,

520
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,920
can you teach me when you're free?

521
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,440
I'll sell it for money, too.

522
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,000
Actually I still regret buying this.

523
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,080
It's indeed a bit expensive.

524
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,640
What's going on? What's wrong?

525
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,040
Well,

526
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,880
this is a wishing box.

527
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,800
But my wish wasn't granted

528
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,520
after I bought it.

529
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,600
I'm suspecting that
its creator has deceived me.

530
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,400
What's your wish, then?

531
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,400
Have a look around.

532
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,840
They all have a cup that you made.

533
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,720
Where's mine?

534
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,960
If you like,

535
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,280
I'll make one for you, too.

536
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,400
Grandma, you want to see me?

537
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,200
Come, sit.

538
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,040
Do you understand

539
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,480
what happened today?

540
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,720
You need to be used to
the way Xiyi treats you.

541
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,040
Don't avoid him again.

542
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,880
Be natural when you're with him

543
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,080
and live your life as you wish.

544
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,800
Grandma.

545
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,920
Even Zhengren and Xiuling have seen it.

546
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,840
Your role in Xiyi's mind is

547
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,240
more and more different.

548
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,000
You're more and more important to him.

549
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,080
I want to cherish everything I have now.

550
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,800
But the happier I am,

551
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,280
the more I believe

552
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,040
that I took away things that belong to Anna.

553
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,480
That's a silly idea.

554
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,480
You won everything

555
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,960
you have yourself.

556
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Anna is an excellent person.

557
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,840
Outwardly she and Xiyi are very well matched

558
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,360
but they're too similar to each other.

559
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,520
They can only see their own goals

560
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,080
and they won't compromise
and change for each other.

561
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,160
But you're different.

562
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,920
You always see other people before yourself.

563
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,840
Because of you,

564
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,800
Xiyi is no longer a cold person.

565
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,680
Zhengren and Xiuling are

566
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,080
no longer selfish.

567
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,960
You didn't owe anyone anything.

568
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,760
And you know something?

569
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,400
The Wang family needs you.

570
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,240
You made it more complete.

571
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,200
There's something

572
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,280
I've always wanted to give you.

573
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,120
I was going to give you on your birthday.

574
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,320
But I had a good day today

575
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,120
and I'll give it to you now.

576
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,400
Grandma,

577
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,280
you know

578
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
my birthday?

579
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,880
Of course.

580
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,400
I'm so happy already

581
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,960
that you remember it

582
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,800
but I can't accept

583
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
this birthday gift.

584
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,080
Don't rush into turning me down.

585
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,760
Open the box and see

586
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,480
what it is.

587
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Isn't this...

588
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,240
my mom...

589
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,440
Your mom gave it

590
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
to me on the day

591
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,200
you and Xiyi got married.

592
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,680
She prepared a dowry for you

593
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,200
so that you'd have confidence to live here.

594
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,200
Your mom said

595
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,360
she didn't want you
to marry Xiyi empty-handed.

596
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,920
With these things,

597
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,680
to you,

598
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,000
at least

599
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,160
you'll feel being supported by your family.

600
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,880
These

601
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,440
are my mom's dowry.

602
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,040
My dad

603
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,480
had this customized for her.

604
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,840
He saved up

605
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,640
for a long time.

606
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,680
I know.

607
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,880
These things mean a great deal to you.

608
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,520
So I think

609
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,520
instead of giving you jewelry,

610
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,480
I should turn this into a birthday gift

611
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,960
and give it back to you.

612
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,120
It's not only from your mom

613
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,200
but also me.

614
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,040
Mm.

615
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,800
Come here.

616
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,720
Living in this world,

617
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,960
unavoidably you'll meet people and run

618
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,160
into things of various kinds.

619
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,200
But only particular people or things

620
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,120
can change your life completely.

621
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,680
Because of you,

622
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,760
I saw a new Xiyi.

623
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,320
Perhaps he hasn't realized it yet

624
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,680
but I know

625
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,640
meeting you is

626
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,000
the most wonderful thing

627
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,600
in his life.

628
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,680
I hope it's the same

629
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,120
to you.

630
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,760

It seems the meals are

691
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,920
particularly hearty today.

692
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,480
Yes.

693
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Breakfast and lunch.

694
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,400
Mm,

695
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,480

696
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,760
I have...

697
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,400
You have a class today, right?

698
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,160
I'll come back and take you.

699
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,560
Don't bother Dylan again,

700
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,280
okay?

701
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,240
Mm.

702
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,560
I'll be off, then?

703
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,920
Drive safely.

Oh!

708
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,920
There's another bag here.

709
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,040
How substantial.

710
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,480
A beverage.

711
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:52,920
What's this?

712
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,760
Actually I've made a cup for you,

713
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,360
a cricket cup.

714
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,680
It was so hard to make it

715
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,160
and I've messed up several ones.

716
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,040
This is the only one
that I made successfully.

717
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,040
I hope you'll like it.

718
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,160
Give it back. Did I let you read it?

719
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,840
I know what you're thinking.

720
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,640
You're thinking

721
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,040
that this cup is so ugly

722
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,800
and it'll embarrass you, right?

723
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,160
Besides, a cup means a lifetime.

724
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,000
Why would you accept it?

725
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,840
Shut up your mouth.

726
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,720
Enjoy your meal. I'll get back to work.

727
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,920
Remember to eat it all.

728
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,240
Why is it a cricket?

729
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,160
According to my name,

730
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,280
shouldn't it be a lizard?

731
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,520
Crickets are aggressive and proud.

732
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,120
It matches that conceited guy, Wang Xiyi.

733
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,760
At first

734
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,320
I thought Xiyi was like a lizard,

735
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,200
a cold-blooded animal.

736
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,200
But after I spent time with him, I found

737
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,280
that he just seemed to be cold

738
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,720
and was actually a warm man.

739
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,640
You invited me over to praise

740
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,800
him through my mouth.

741
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,840
This display of affection

742
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,200
is really cruel.

743
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,280
No, no.

744
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,800
I invited you over

745
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,280
because I want to show you this.

746
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,520
This pen is

747
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,600
a limited edition produced many years ago.

748
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,320
I've searched the Web

749
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,360
and gone to see its producers

750
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,280
but none of them have it.

751
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,920
Did you go to so much trouble

752
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,240
for him again?

753
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,440
This pen was

754
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,160
given to him

755
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,360
by his dad.

756
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,200
I want to find the same pen

757
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,320
and give it to him as a birthday gift.

758
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,800
Mm,

759
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,400
it's indeed an antique pen.

760
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,040
Some collectors I know may have it.

761
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,920
I'll ask them for you.

762
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,560
Thanks.

763
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,280
Mr. Yi.

764
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,200
Okay,

765
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,400
this is a contract

766
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,160
and this is tea.

767
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,600
To judge from your look,

768
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,880
it seems this afternoon's tea
is especially nice.

769
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,440
With this cup,

770
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
the black tea has become so fresh

771
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,240
and the world is so bright.

772
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,000
Good God,

773
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,600
I'm off.

774
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,360
Come back. Come back.

775
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,800
Come here. Come here.

776
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,400
Help me ask your roommate

777
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,160
what Jiaxin likes.

778
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,880
Why didn't you ask Snail?

779
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,960
It's her birthday.
I want to give her a surprise.

780
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,680
Okay.

781
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:03,920
I'm off.

782
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,840
Hello.

783
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,480
Hey, Xiyi.

784
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,680
I practiced all day again today.

785
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
Do you know what I'm
most looking forward to now?

786
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,320
Your performance.

787
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:21,960
Wrong.

788
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,000
After three days of performances,

789
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,280
I'll be able to go back to Shanghai.

790
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,840
This time

791
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,520
I will let you have the most

792
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,200
unforgettable birthday in your life.

793
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,640
Are you excited?

794
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,480
Anna,

795
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,720
when you're back,

796
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,000
I want to tell you

797
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,600
something face to face.

798
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,520
Mm.

799
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,280
We'll meet in the same place, then.

800
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,760
I promise I'll give you the biggest surprise.

801
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,480
What do you say?

802
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:49,920
Mm.

803
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,280
Bye-bye.

804
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,320
Okay, relax. You can do it.

805
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,360
Good. Hold on for five breaths.

806
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,080
Five,

807
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,160
four,

808
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,520
three,

809
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,680
two,

810
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,520
one.

811
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,120
Excellent.

812
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,720
Remember to hold one another's hand.

813
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,240
Only then can the baby feel

814
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,480
the communication between you.

815
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,800
Okay, close your eyes.

816
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,080
Meditate for ten minutes and relax.

817
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,320
Chen Jiaxin.

818
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,560
Mm?

819
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:48,800
Nothing.

820
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,680
Just wanted to call you.

821
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,520
Is your birthday coming soon?

822
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,240
You know it?

823
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,360
Is there anything

824
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,720
I don't know?

825
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,800
When I was little,

826
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,360
I wished someone could remember my birthday

827
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,360
and offer to celebrate it with me,

828
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,240
even just for once.

829
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,400
You don't have to worry about that, then.

830
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,400
I've remembered your birthday.

831
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,920
Because we were born on the same day.

832
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,840
I've remembered yours, too.

833
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,800
Mm,

834
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,640
how did you celebrate your birthday before?

835
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,840
On my birthday,

836
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,560
Anna would go to Riz Restaurant with me

837
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
and we'd celebrate it there.

838
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,520
That restaurant opens

839
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,120
every day

840
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,960
for people who want to celebrate their birthdays

841
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,160
or

842
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,360
let their friends perform on the stage.

843
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

844
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,440
it's our birthday showtime again.

845
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,400
Whose better half is going to give us

846
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,520
a performance tonight?

847
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
