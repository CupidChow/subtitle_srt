(Episode 11)

28
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,660
(Dylan: 2 Messages. [Picture])

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,040
It's early in the morning. Who is it?

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,000
Why are you smiling?

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,600
Look.

32
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,040
Our products are well received in Hungary.

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,360
Even foreigners are fond of Heritage soaps.

34
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,480
It's awesome.

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,760
You bet it.

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,480
Think about who I am.

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,440
You're the General Manager
of Cheng Jie Group.

38
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,040
Nope.

39
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,720
You should say that I'm your rock.

40
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,240
Understand?

41
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,240
Morning, guys.

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,960
Zhengren, have some breakfast.

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,760
I'm good. I'll have some milk.

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,480
Come on, your sister-in-law is asking you
to have breakfast with us.

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,040
Do you know that our products
are available in Europe now?

46
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,560
Your brother is awesome.

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,880
Like the name suggests,

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,960
the brand has been handed down.

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,760
I hope

50
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,800
that Grandma could wake up soon

51
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,280
and see all this.

52
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,000
Brother, you're really great.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,320
Do you really think so?

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,640
Do you still think so

55
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,400
when you're in the factory
and in the presence of Zhou Zhan?

56
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,320
It's breakfast time.
Let's not talk about business.

57
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,240
Enjoy your breakfast.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,520
Zhengren,

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,640
I'm not talking about business here.

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm giving you some advice

61
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,720
as your elder brother.

62
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,720
I know that you studied

63
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,200
business management abroad.

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,920
But I think you should

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,760
put aside all the theories

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,240
and learn about humanity
in order to survive in society.

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,040
Next time when you deal with
someone like Zhou Zhan,

68
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,000
I want you to be calm

69
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,360
and analyze the situation
in an objective manner.

70
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,760
I see. Thanks for your advice.

71
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,240
Have your breakfast.

72
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,280
That's all for today. Meeting adjourned.

73
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,080
Thank you, Mr. Yi.

74
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,600
Mr. Yi,

75
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,520
this is the latest sales report.

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,280
The stock price is climbing up

77
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,080
after the crisis of Haifei Group.

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,120
And some We-Media wants to interview you.

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,240
They admired you
for handling the whole situation

80
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,720
and turning the tables

81
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,840
while the Chairwoman is in a coma.

82
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,920
They want to depict you as Hamlet.

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,120
Come on.

84
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
Get out of the way.

85
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,640
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Yi is...

86
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,080
Don't you know who I am? Get out of the way.

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,840
How can you...

88
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Yi.

89
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,120
It's okay. You're excused.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Mr. Yi,

91
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,560
we just talked a few days ago.
Why do you act so indifferently?

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,880
I even need to make an appointment with you.

93
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,760
It's ridiculous.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,600
Mr. Zhou,

95
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,720
I thought we have made it clear between us.

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,880
I don't see why you show up here.

97
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,440
Business

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,520
is all about interests.

99
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,960
I'm here to discuss

100
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
the default penalty with you.

101
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,560
Just leave it to our legal counsels.

102
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,880
I don't see the point
of having this conversation.

103
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,160
Anson, see Mr. Zhou out.

104
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,040
Mr. Zhou.

105
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,680
Why bother our legal counsels?

106
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,920
I'm here to discuss the issue with you.

107
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,840
Mr. Zhou,

108
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,640
I understand that Haifei Group

109
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
is having a hard time.

110
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,960
But business is business.

111
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,840
We should uphold the contract.

112
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,720
The party which proposes to terminate
the contract shall pay the default penalty.

113
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,840
Good.

114
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,800
You made a good point.
Like you said, business is business.

115
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,280
Rest assured.
Don't expect me to be a nice guy

116
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,440
when it comes to default penalty.

117
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,640
What do you mean by that?

118
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,400
Mr. Yi, here is the contract.

119
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,720
Have you read it?

120
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,520
I know the terms and conditions well.

121
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,360
Great.

122
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,520
If I remember correctly,

123
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,640
according to the contract,

124
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,000
in case of the discontinuation
of the cooperation,

125
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,280
the default party shall pay
twice the contract amount

126
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,400
as the default penalty. Am I right?

127
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,440
Here is a video.

128
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,520
Check it out.

129
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,240
Now,

130
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,760
as the General Manager of Cheng Jie Group,

131
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,040
I announce that I'll end the contract with him!

132
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,760
Huaniao Island Factory
will stop all the production immediately.

133
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,000
That's why I always say

134
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,000
that business is all about the final results.

135
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,200
The factory at Huaniao Island

136
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,160
violates the contract,

137
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,000
making it a default de facto.

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Our party has collected evidence.

139
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,760
What do you say, Mr. Yi?

140
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,400
Now,

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,960
can we talk about

142
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,680
the price you're gonna pay
for your heroic act?

143
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,280
You made a big pronouncement
in order to act the hero,

144
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,480
making the entire Cheng Jie Group
to take the fall.

145
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,600
With the General Manager
being a loose cannon,

146
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,000
how could Heritage carry on

147
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,040
like its name suggests?

148
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,880
How can you...

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,080
Who is being so rude?

150
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,880
Ah, you're the son of the Zhou family.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,640
Grandma,

152
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,960
you finally wake up.

153
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,280
Madame Wang?

154
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,360
Even if I am rude,

155
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,120
I have got your grandson

156
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,880
sign the contract.

157
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,840
Speaking of the contract,

158
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,320
Mr. Zheng, it's your turn.

159
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,840
Understood.

160
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,000
Mr. Zhou,

161
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,080
I'm Zheng Yangsheng from Shen Dao Law Firm,

162
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,800
the attorney of Cheng Jie Group.

163
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:17,960
Mr. Zhou,

164
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
in the contract,

165
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,280
it is specified in paragraph 9 of article 8

166
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,640
that Party B, Cheng Jie Group,
shall be entitled

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,760
to unilaterally rescind the contract

168
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,240
without paying the default penalty

169
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,560
in case the products of Party A,
Haifei Group,

170
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,640
are harmful

171
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,680
to children and pregnant women.

172
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,520
This contract has come into effect
with the seals of both parties.

173
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,280
Haifei Group has been nationally criticized

174
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
for excessive plasticizer in its products.

175
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,280
Besides,

176
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,600
the test report on excessive plasticizer

177
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,920
has been notarized at the notary office.

178
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,240
Please feel free to contact me

179
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,640
for any further question.

180
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,400
You might want to keep my business card.

181
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,560
Is there such specification?

182
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,600
When did they add it?

183
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,520
You can ask your friend

184
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,320
Wang Zhengren.

185
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,640
Back then, all I thought about
was convincing the Chairwoman.

186
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Luckily, she approved of me using the seal,

187
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,160
asking me to get the contract by myself.

188
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,920
I will ask the financial personnel
to add one clause.

189
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,720
If the other party doesn't agree to it,

190
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,320
we will have to call off the cooperation.

191
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,800
-After that, I got the contract from the lawyer
-Thank you, Grandma.

192
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,240
and delivered it to you in a hurry.

193
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,600
I didn't notice

194
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,400
the contract has an added article.

195
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,960
I know my grandson well.

196
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,120
He always does things
in an anticlimactic manner.

197
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,320
There is no way he would
notice the added article.

198
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
But you're different.

199
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,360
Your father trusts you
with such a big business.

200
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,160
How can you be so careless?

201
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,640
You shouldn't.

202
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,280
You closed the deal

203
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,120
without reading the contract carefully

204
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,320
because you were blinded
by the immediate interests.

205
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,960
Wang Zhengren,

206
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,240
we'll wait and see.

207
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,680
Chairwoman, you are
so brilliant and insightful,

208
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,360
beating us all even while you were in a coma.

209
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Don't you think so?

210
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,400
Grandma!

211
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,480
When did you wake up?

212
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,960
It has been a while.

213
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,080
So you have been faking sleep all these days?

214
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,920
I wish I could stay asleep,

215
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,240
lying there and being
taken care of by Jiaxin.

216
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,200
I could hear you

217
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,840
speaking from your heart,

218
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,760
and witness the sweet moment
between you and Jiaxin.

219
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,840
I like that part.

220
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,760
What sweet moment?
I want to hear the details.

221
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,040
Grandma,

222
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,760
as the General Manager of Cheng Jie Group,

223
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,400
I made a big mistake this time.

224
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,360
I'd accept any punishments.

225
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,120
Honestly,

226
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,960
I did think of

227
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,680
dismissing you

228
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,240
or docking your salary for a year.

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Later, I got the idea

230
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,400
of having someone to watch over you.

231
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,960
I'll have a Special Assistant

232
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,880
who is superior to you.

233
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,280
Besides you,

234
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,520
she will also be informed

235
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,840
of the company's business.

236
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,440
What?

237
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,480
Chen Jiaxin?

238
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,880
Mom, are you sure it's okay?

239
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,400
Thanks to Jiaxin's pregnancy
which caused her to vomit

240
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,640
when she smelled the products,

241
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,800
I got the idea of testing the products.

242
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,240
General Manager, don't you think

243
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,360
we're lucky to have Jiaxin?

244
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,800
Yes.

245
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,520
I'm getting old.

246
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,000
She is your wife.

247
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,920
Don't you think you should give her a chance

248
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,800
to learn to help us?

249
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,080
Xiyi, you're such a good kid.

250
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,080
Come here.

251
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,760
I know everything

252
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,240
you did to Jiaxin.

253
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,400
Let me tell you,

254
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,760
I've asked our lawyer
Mr. Shen to alter my will.

255
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,600
If you ever betray Jiaxin,

256
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,120
I'll sign the will.

257
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,000
Jiaxin will inherit all my money

258
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,520
after my death.

259
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,520
Grandma.

260
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,080
Trust me. I'll keep my word.

261
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,960
Understand?

262
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,440
Understood.

263
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,640
You're the best. You're my favorite kid.

264
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,320
She must be kidding.

265
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,480
Ms. Chen, I hope we can work well together.

266
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,680
No, no, no.

267
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,520
Please don't say that.

268
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,240
It's up in the air yet.

269
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,200
You're freaking me out.

270
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
It's not up in the air.

271
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,880
The Chairwoman has signed
the document of appointment.

272
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,960
From now on,

273
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,200
you have a say

274
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,560
in all the decisions
and contracts of the company.

275
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,360
You can reject anything you don't like.

276
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,160
Please sign the employment contract.

277
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,640
(Employment Contract)

278
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,800
You don't need to work here anymore.

279
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,380
(Employment Contract
Party A: Cheng Jie Group, Party B: Chen Jiaxin)

280
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,960
I remember I put my drinks here.

281
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,040
It's here.

282
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,160
Let me tell you,

283
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,760
I hate it when the freezer is in a mess.

284
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,920
From now on,

285
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,760
I get the upper part
and you get the lower part of the freezer.

286
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,680
One more thing.

287
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,000
Follow me.

288
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,640
It's the same with the cabinet.

289
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,080
I get the upper part
and you get the lower part.

290
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,400
If someone made a mistake

291
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,040
and put the things at the wrong place,

292
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,560
it's only natural

293
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
that his stuff is confiscated.

294
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,280
I'm totally okay with the boundary thing.

295
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,080
I think it's a great idea.

296
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,600
My only question is:

297
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,840
why do you always get the upper part

298
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,120
while I get the lower part?

299
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,600
The upper and lower part

300
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,480
are two equal positions.

301
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
Do you think

302
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,840
men should always enjoy
higher position than women?

303
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,760
I feel sorry for myself

304
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,280
for having a male
chauvinist roommate like you.

305
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,160
Male and female

306
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,720
are two complementary genders
which are supposed to live in harmony.

307
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,480
And you decide that there is superiority
and inferiority in the genders.

308
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,400
I feel sorry for myself

309
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,360
for having a female
chauvinist roommate like you.

310
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
You're pathetic because you're so stuffy.

311
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,360
You're pathetic because you're so lonely.

312
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,640
Who says I'm lonely?

313
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,320
Are you not lonely?
When was your last relationship?

314
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,000
When I was a junior in college.

315
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,120
It's none of your business.

316
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,960
One, two, three, four...

317
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,800
Do you want a war?

318
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,080
Listen carefully,

319
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,920
from now on, my new goal

320
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,680
is to step on your head

321
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,040
and keep you stick to the ground.

322
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,200
Get out of the way.

323
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,760
She is definitely not most people.

324
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,400
One,

325
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,080
two,

326
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,720
three,

327
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,240
four,

328
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,800
five,

329
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,720
six,

330
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,320
seven.

331
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,840
Oh, my God.

332
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,040
That's unbelievable. That's incredible.

333
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,360
Grandma.

334
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,400
Grandma.

335
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,320
Grandma, are you really okay now?

336
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,040
I was so worried about you.

337
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,280
Kid, sorry to have you all worried.

338
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,640
I'm so glad

339
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,760
that you're healthy again.

340
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,880
Well,

341
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,280
I want to talk to you

342
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,160
about something.

343
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,280
You mean the Special Assistant
to the Chairwoman?

344
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,560
Grandma,

345
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,440
are you sure that you want me

346
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,400
to make decision for the company?

347
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,800
But I...

348
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm a layman when it comes to business.

349
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,520
Don't worry.

350
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,840
Xiyi knows business well.

351
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,560
If I screw it up,

352
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,880
Xiyi will get mad at me.

353
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
I know what' s going on between you two.

354
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,880
You're playing husband and wife
in front of me,

355
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,320
while in fact, you're taking orders

356
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,920
from Xiyi.

357
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,520
Grandma...

358
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,840
Kid,

359
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,440
that's not what a true marriage should be.

360
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,120
In a marriage,

361
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,520
the couple should have the same goal.

362
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,040
When faced with a difficult situation,

363
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,720
the husband and wife
should discuss the problem.

364
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,640
When the problem is solved,

365
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,000
they can share the joy of success.

366
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,440
You're too distant from Xiyi's life.

367
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,320
You don't know what he is thinking

368
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,320
and doing every day.

369
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,480
That's not gonna work.

370
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,240
For you,

371
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,960
this arrangement is a chance

372
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,280
to enter his life.

373
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,480
For him,

374
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
it's a chance to learn

375
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,680
to respect your opinions.

376
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,920
Don't let me down.

377
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,920
Jiaxin,

378
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,160
you're a diamond in the rough.

379
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,240
Once finely polished,

380
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,160
you'll become a treasure

381
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,680
in Xiyi's eyes.

382
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,720
Don't you ever think
that you don't deserve him.

383
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,760
In fact, he is the one
who doesn't deserve you.

384
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,080
I want you to show him

385
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,680
how brilliant

386
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,520
you can be.

387
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,160
Thank you, Grandma.

388
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Ever since I was a child,

389
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
people have been keeping telling me

390
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,280
that I could do better.

391
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,200
You're the only one

392
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,400
who thinks that I'm already good enough.

393
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,440
Thanks for keeping encouraging me

394
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,360
and helping me grow up.

395
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,520
I will

396
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,560
do my best.

397
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,120
If you have any questions, just ask me.

398
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
I want to have an early night.

399
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,960
Mr. Wang, I have problems with this part,

400
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,120
this part,

401
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,000
and this part.

402
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
It seems you're serious about it.
You even have it printed.

403
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,480
Have you finished reading it?

404
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,280
Well, I don't understand the term CS.

405
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,080
I searched the Internet,

406
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,800
only to find that it's a shooting game.

407
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,600
CS stands for

408
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,680
customer satisfaction,

409
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,200
a measure of how products and services
meet customer expectation.

410
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,360
It's a technical term.

411
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,840
What about TT, MT, OT?

412
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,000
What do they stand for?

413
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,480
Let's start with TT.

414
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,280
TT stands for traditional trade,

415
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,240
referring to traditional channel of sales.

416
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,000
For instance, shopping malls.

417
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,040
Xiyi, Jiaxin,

418
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,360
are you asleep?

419
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,560
We're in bed, grandma.

420
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,840
I need to talk to you.

421
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,400
What took you so long?

422
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
In a minute.

423
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,160
What's up?

424
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,960
Grandma is here.

425
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll let myself in.

426
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,440
Is she asleep?

427
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,520
Yes.

428
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,040
That's good.

429
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,640
I'm here to say,

430
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,800
Jiaxin is going to work tomorrow.

431
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,120
She is not having lunch at home.

432
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,560
So,

433
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,040
take her to have some healthy food for lunch.

434
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Don't let her have takeout food.

435
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,000
That's all.

436
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,600
Alright.

437
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,640
Goodnight.

438
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,480
Goodnight, grandma.

439
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,120
What a little thing.

440
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,840
You're pregnant.

441
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,360
You'll sleep in bed.

442
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,360
Ms. Chen,

443
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,680
you look different today.

444
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,800
It turns out you're not wearing your glasses.

445
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,720
Anson, be careful when you drive.

446
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,320
Chen Jiaxin?

447
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,040
Ah?

448
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,120
Maybe you should freshen up.

449
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
We're arriving at the law firm.

450
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,120
Okay.

451
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,720
Law...law firm?

452
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,120
Aren't we heading to the company?

453
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,520
It's your first day at work.

454
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,360
There should be handovers
at the former company.

455
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,920
Alright.

456
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,200
I was kidding.

457
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,200
I'm here to get a document from Mr. Shen.

458
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,760
Alright.

459
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,960
(Shen Dao Law Firm)

460
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

461
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,960
Fine. Have you prepared
the documents of Haifei Group?

462
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,400
I'm looking for it. It will be soon.

463
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,320
You're looking for it?

464
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,840
How many times have I told you

465
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
that all the documents concerning
the project should be well arranged

466
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,760
so that you can find them easily?

467
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,760
What have you been doing these days?

468
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,880
When Chen Jiaxin worked here,

469
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,160
she has never made such a mistake.

470
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,520
I'm sorry. Don't get angry.

471
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,600
Oh,

472
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,440
the receptionist reports that Mr. Yi

473
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,120
and the Special Assistant
to the Chairwoman are arriving.

474
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,800
Shall we receive them?

475
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,920
Special Assistant to the Chairwoman?
Who is that?

476
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,560
Chen Jiaxin.

477
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,880
Who?

478
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,520
Chen!

479
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,760
Jia!

480
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,320
Xin!

481
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,840
Wasn't her the assistant to Mr. Shen?

482
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,320
How come she became
the Special Assistant to the Chairwoman

483
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,320
of Cheng Jie Group?

484
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,640
How come?

485
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,520
Because she got an inside track.
Try to get one for yourself, if you're jealous.

486
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,960
Why are you still standing here?

487
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,800
Go and find the documents.

488
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,200
Okay.

489
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
Now she is Party A.

490
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,400
Will she make things hard for us?

491
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,040
I don't think so.

492
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,720
When she got married last month,
we chipped in.

493
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,360
I think she would be nice to us.

494
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
What about the documents of Haifei Group?

495
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,600
Mr. Yi.

496
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,640
I'll be welcoming them.

497
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,400
Hurry up.

498
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,880
Jiaxin.

499
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,000
Mr. Yi, you're here.

500
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,080
This way, please.

501
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,280
Ms. Chen, this way, please.

502
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,160
Ah, okay.

503
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,560
You can wait here. Let's go.

504
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,160
Mr. Yi, it's kind of on short notice,

505
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,520
we haven't prepared the documents yet.

506
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,920
I know where the documents are.

507
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,040
I'll get it for you.

508
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,120
That's great, Jiaxin. Please help me out.

509
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,800
Wait a minute.

510
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,580
(Cease to the struggle
and you cease to live.)

511
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,960
How can you ask the Special Assistant
to the Chairwoman of Cheng Jie Group

512
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,160
to help you find the documents?

513
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,920
It's alright.

514
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,720
It's not a big deal. I can find it myself.

515
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,200
I'm sorry.

516
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I'm sorry, Ms. Chen.

517
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,760
Please wait a moment.

518
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,800
I'll let you know once I find the documents.

519
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,240
Mr. Yi and Ms. Chen,

520
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,080
would you like to wait over there?

521
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,200
This way, please.

522
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,440
Mr. Yi and Ms. Chen,

523
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,400
please wait here for a moment.

524
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,160
The documents will be sent here soon.

525
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,840
Okay.

526
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,000
Xiyi,

527
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,400
I

528
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,760
was just trying to offer a little help.

529
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,800
Chen Jiaxin,

530
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,400
stand straight and hold your head high.

531
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,080
Do what you should do. Don't worry too much.

532
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,720
Now, you're the Special Assistant
to the Chairwoman.

533
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,440
You're representing Grandma.

534
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,280
If you don't trust yourself,

535
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,160
how can you convince others to trust you?

536
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,440
I'm sorry. I didn't realize that.

537
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,560
Be confident.

538
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,920
You're a manager now.

539
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,320
Me?

540
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,120
Take it easy.

541
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,520
Besides,

542
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,200
I'm your rock.

543
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,280
I see.

544
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,080
This is Mr. Wang from Financial Department.

545
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,760
Nice to meet you.

546
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,800
This is Mr. Zhan from Legal Department.

547
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,320
Nice to meet you.

548
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,640
This is Mr. Sun from Marketing Department.

549
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,320
Nice to meet you.

550
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,640
This is Weiwei from
Human Resources Department.

551
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,800
Nice to meet you.

552
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,800
It seems I don't need
to introduce him to you.

553
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,280
Anson.

554
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Relax, Little Snail.

555
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,200
Here is the thing.

556
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,720
I believe you've received the email

557
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,480
from the Human Resources Department.

558
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,720
From now on,

559
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,800
all the contracts approved by the supervisors

560
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,880
shall be submitted
to Ms. Chen for approval.

561
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,920
So, I'm gonna set an example.

562
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,040
Ms. Chen, please check these documents

563
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,400
which Mr. Yi and I have discussed.

564
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,120
Okay.

565
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,080
Mr. Yi, with the procedure changed,

566
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,360
I want to report yesterday's meeting

567
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
to Ms. Chen.

568
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,280
Go ahead.

569
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,480
Mr. Yi,

570
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,000
I'd...

571
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,280
Alright, let's postpone
the original schedule.

572
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,000
You should communicate first.

573
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,440
Okay.

574
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,640
Ms. Chen, there you go.

575
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,440
Guess who it is.

576
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
Come on, I can see the Caller ID.

577
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,400
It's just a game.

578
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,040
What are you doing?

579
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,760
I was ditched by my subordinates.

580
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,320
I'm

581
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,120
walking around.

582
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,680
I'm surprised that I am not the only person
who has the guts to ditch you.

583
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,160
Well.

584
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,920
All my subordinates

585
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,200
are reporting to someone.

586
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,600
Someone?

587
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,960
Is it your grandma?

588
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,320
Are you free these days?

589
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,800
Yes,

590
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,520
I suppose.

591
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,360
Do you want to come to Paris?

592
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,040
You said you missed me.

593
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,600
That's right.

594
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,720
So, what's holding you up?

595
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,600
Have you read comments
on my show on the Internet?

596
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,040
The show was well received.

597
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,120
It's a pity if you miss it.

598
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,760
I'll ask Anson to arrange the trip for me.

599
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,360
Why bother him?

600
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,560
I'll book the ticket for you.

601
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,840
I can't wait to see you.

602
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,840
I want to fly first class.

603
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,680
You're gonna fly cargo bay.

604
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,840
You're so callous.

605
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,480
Alright.

606
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,840
I'll ask Anson to arrange it for me.
I'll call you.

607
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,320
Okay.

608
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:35,880
Bye.

609
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,000
In the past, he'd travel all the way
to see me without hesitation.

610
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,040
Since when he starts to wait
for the arrangement?

611
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,860
(Heritage Soap Factory)

612
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,780
(Heritage Soap
100% Natural)

613
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,260
(Heritage Soap
100% Natural)

614
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,200
Okay, no problem.

615
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,720
You can rest assured.

616
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,360
(Ambitious and generous)

617
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,440
Just leave it to me.

618
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,680
No problem.

619
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,360
I'll be supervising
the production in the factory.

620
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,520
It seems the package producer

621
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,400
is trustworthy.

622
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,880
I think we can discuss the cooperation.

623
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,280
Just leave it to me.

624
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
Okay, okay, okay.

625
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,160
No problem. No problem.

626
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,760
Mr. Wang.

627
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,560
I'll have everything arranged.

628
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,720
Mr. Wang.

629
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,640
Listen...

630
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Hello?

631
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,200
What are you doing?

632
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
I'm unlocking the phone for you.

633
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,560
We're busy working downstairs.

634
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,360
We're understaffed.

635
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,280
If you have nothing to do,
you can help us downstairs.

636
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,560
How can you tell that I have nothing to do?

637
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,680
I have so many things to do.

638
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,520
I'm a returnee and
the Acting Director of the factory.

639
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,800
How can you ask me to do physical labor?

640
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,600
I have been making calls

641
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,200
all this morning.

642
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,560
Is returnee a rare creature
on the Huaniao Island?

643
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,640
I can find you so many of them if you want.

644
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,880
Besides,

645
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,080
even my old man, the Director of the factory,
is working downstairs.

646
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,160
You're just an Acting Director
and you're so young,

647
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,360
why can't you work with us?

648
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,100
(Ambitious and generous)

649
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,600
I'm neglected in the family

650
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,360
and in the factory.

651
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,240
No one has been nice to me.

652
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,140
(Ambitious and generous)

653
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,640
Hello?

654
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,640
Zhengren,

655
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,280
how is it going?

656
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,080
What do you want from me?

657
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,720
Come on, relax.

658
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,240
We're friends.

659
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,720
We're still friends

660
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,360
even the cooperation fails.

661
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,160
My plant is in trouble.

662
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,720
I believe you're having a hard time as well.

663
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,520
This is the marketing plan for this season.

664
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,120
We want your opinions.

665
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,240
Well,

666
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,080
I think the plan

667
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,200
should be reasonable.

668
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,440
Understood, Ms. Chen.

669
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,040
Thanks.

670
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,000
Ms. Chen,

671
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,760
Mr. Yi said the packaging cost
shall be lowered.

672
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,160
What percentage is deemed proper to you?

673
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
Reduce...

674
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,120
Reduce...

675
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,040
A proper percentage.

676
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,800
I'll give you the answer
after I discuss it with Mr. Yi.

677
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,680
Understood.

678
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,800
Ms. Chen,

679
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,480
here is the supply contract to be renewed.

680
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,960
How long should the contract term be?

681
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,440
Well,

682
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,680
I need to think about it.

683
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,400
Understood.

684
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,160
Thanks.

685
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,120
Hey, Xishi.

686
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,720
(Xishi Noodles)

687
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,080
Hey.

688
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,360
I'm leaving for work. See you.

689
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,120
See you.

690
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,440
Why women are not allowed
to wash their hair during confinement?

691
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,720
I'm itching all over the head.

692
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,880
You'd better go back home.

693
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,080
During confinement, you should avoid wind

694
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,200
and heavy labor.

695
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,080
You're supposed to stay at home

696
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,440
taking care of the baby and rental business.

697
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,960
Don't worry.

698
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,200
I hardly have any customers these days.

699
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,200
My neighbor Mrs. Zhou
is taking care of my baby.

700
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,560
Don't use my chopsticks.

701
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,400
Rest assured, Aunt.

702
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,760
I hardly have any customers these days.

703
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,160
Mrs. Zhou is taking care of my baby.

704
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,080
She really likes the baby.

705
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,640
Where is the tack cloth?

706
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,640
I just want to get some fresh air.

707
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,280
The baby is crying all day long.

708
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,600
It's killing me.

709
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
We're still thinking of a name

710
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,520
for the baby.

711
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,760
May I have the bill, please?

712
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,800
I got it.

713
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,880
Hi, Xishi.

714
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,640
You're here.

715
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,000
What do you want to have, Yueyue?

716
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,280
We'd like to have lucky noodles
and lucky sago zongzi.

717
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,800
We don't sell that here.

718
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,320
Lucky noodles are Jiaxin's favorite noodles.

719
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,960
Lucky sago zongzi
are Jiaxin's favorite sago zongzi.

720
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,160
Jiaxin is a lucky girl.

721
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,920
We give a nickname

722
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,000
to her favorite food.

723
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,320
It's a way to share her happiness.

724
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,000
I see.

725
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,120
Xishi, we'd like to have two bowls
of fish soup noodles.

726
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:31,720
No problem.

727
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,320
More seasoning, please.

728
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,680
Shit.

729
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,600
Shit, shit, shit.

730
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,040
Without you being here,
someone is out of bounds.

731
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,440
What's wrong with Wang Zhengren this time?

732
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,520
Not him. It's our Snail.

733
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,760
Snail?

734
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,480
Chen Jiaxin.

735
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,880
Xiyi,

736
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,240
is there anything wrong?

737
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,520
I thought you wanted to learn about business.

738
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,280
So I taught you.

739
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,760
But what are you doing now?

740
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,000
Why did you make decisions
without talking to me first?

741
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,160
This one.

742
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,160
Why did you refuse to
renew the contract with Suda Logistics?

743
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,440
The company is not trustworthy.

744
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,320
When I worked for Shen Dao Law Firm,

745
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,280
I saw files of lawsuit against the company,

746
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,680
several times.

747
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,600
The employees are harshly treated

748
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,320
and are forced to work overtime.

749
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,080
The company would often let the employees

750
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,200
take the fall for whatever accidents.

751
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,600
What should be taken into consideration

752
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,280
is the quality of their delivery service,

753
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,000
instead of internal affairs of the company.

754
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,520
Do you know how hard it is

755
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,200
to find a reliable logistics company?

756
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,240
Besides,

757
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,400
why do you make the third meeting room
into a mother-and-baby room?

758
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,000
Why do you put a coffee machine
for each floor

759
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,880
and change the coffee beans?

760
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,360
I see many lactating employees here.

761
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
During the worktime,

762
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,120
they have to pump their milk
in the bathroom stall.

763
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,080
This is unhygienic.

764
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,920
And,

765
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,320
the coffee here

766
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,400
is not tasteful at all.

767
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,280
This is the workplace.

768
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,480
It's not a coffee house
or a mother-and-baby room.

769
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,400
Snail,

770
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,760
I understand that you're pressured
to take the position.

771
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,760
It's hard for you especially
when you're pregnant.

772
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,400
Do you want to talk to the Chairwoman

773
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,840
and tell her that you are
not suitable for the job?

774
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,080
This is the document on annulment
of the termination of contract.

775
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,080
Give it to me after you sign it.

776
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,600
For him,

777
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,040
this arrangement

778
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,600
is a chance

779
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,320
to learn to respect your opinions.

780
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,800
I won't sign it.

781
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,280
If we renew the contract now,

782
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,200
given the fact that Heritage products
are well received,

783
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,360
it will increase the burden
on their employees

784
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,080
who are underpaid.

785
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,360
I changed the meeting room

786
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,200
because nearly all the facilities

787
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,320
in the company are for work.

788
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,520
Our employees

789
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,240
are not enjoying the least entertainment

790
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,520
or rest at all.

791
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,160
All my decisions

792
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,280
have been approved by the Chairwoman.

793
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,480
Chen Jiaxin,

794
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,480
how can you use Grandma to push me?

795
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,760
I didn't mean that.

796
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,720
I'm just...

797
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,120
Excuse me, I need to take this.

798
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,560
Hello?

799
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,000
Okay,

800
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,680
I'll meet you in the office.

801
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,880
According to our internal
information supervision system,

802
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,200
someone has downloaded documents

803
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,040
which are accessible
to the authorized person only.

804
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,400
These are the screenshots
of the downloaded documents.

805
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,560
(Confidential documents)

806
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,960
Product ingredients and formula.

807
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,400
List of suppliers.

808
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,680
It seems serious to us.

809
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,000
So, we traced the IP address.

810
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,160
It turns out

811
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,920
that it was the computer
in the office on Huaniao Island,

812
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
with the password of the Chairwoman.

813
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
That's impossible.

814
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,920
The Chairwoman hasn't been
to the Huaniao Island these days.

815
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,720
It can't be her.

816
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,200
Then who is it?

817
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,040
I think I know the answer.

818
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,840
The Chairwoman wrote the password

819
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,960
on a notebook.

820
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,120
I think Zhengren has read the notebook

821
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,440
and downloaded the documents
from the computer

822
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,200
in the factory on Huaniao Island.

823
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,880
But these products

824
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,600
are not to be produced on Huaniao Island.

825
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,120
Why would Zhengren download them?

826
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,200
That's right.

827
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,440
I don't understand
why Zhengren would do this.

828
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,400
It must have something to do with Zhou Zhan.

829
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,920
I'm back.

830
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,520
Is there anything wrong?

831
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,720
You all look so serious.

832
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,280
Where have you been?

833
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,120
Nowhere.

834
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,800
It's busy in the factory today.

835
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,840
Busy in the factory?

836
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,440
But why did I see you

837
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,240
secretly meeting Zhou Zhan this afternoon?

838
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,440
This is

839
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,560
the confidential document of the company.

840
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,600
You downloaded it using grandma's password,

841
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,160
didn't you?

842
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,080
Zhengren,

843
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,160
what on earth have you done?

844
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,200
Just tell us.

845
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,920
Zhou Zhan is trying to set us up.

846
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
He bought you

847
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,960
to download the confidential documents

848
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,360
with Grandma's password

849
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,800
and then you sold them to him.

850
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,840
If what I think is correct,

851
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,120
your remuneration

852
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,320
is in that envelop.

853
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,720
Wang Zhengren,

854
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,720
have you ever thought about

855
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,480
being there for the Company?

856
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,360
That's not true!

857
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,240
I've done nothing wrong

858
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,480
to Grandma and the company.

859
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:04,880
Then,

860
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
why did you meet him?

861
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,200
What did you talk about?

862
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,880
What was in that envelop?

863
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,560
