(Episode 35)

26
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,780
(Bay Park Cemetery)

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,080
Dad,

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,960
(Di Pengfei, Han Xiang)

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,440
mom,

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,280
look.

31
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,280
I brought Qing back.

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,280
Dad,

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,680
mom,

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,720
sorry

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,880
that I came back late!

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,000
Dad,

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,200
mom,

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,680
don't worry.

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Qing is my only family.

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,600
I will

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,480
take good care of her in the future.

42
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,400
Jiaxin told me

43
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,480
she was divorcing Xiyi.

44
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,240
When the procedures are finalized,

45
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,880
they'll have no relationship anymore.

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,960
You should

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,440
take good care of yourself.

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,480
You still

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,240
have many opportunities to be with Wang Xiyi.

50
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,720
Don't just talk me.

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,720
It's also a good opportunity
for you, isn't it?

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,840
Oh, by the way,

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,360
I will go out with Jiaxin
this afternoon for a cup of coffee.

54
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,520
You can go.

55
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,360
Sure, let's go together.

56
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,160
I mean you can go alone.

57
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
I won't be the third wheel.

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,800
You are here?

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,920
Where's Anna?

60
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,160
Don't you see it's my sister's trick?

61
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,360
Looks like

62
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,040
you and your sister are getting closer.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
How is it going with your divorce?

64
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,080
Here you go.

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,080
An art exhibit for new artists

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,880
will take place next year in Toronto.

67
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,040
It'll be a good opportunity for you
to make your name known internationally.

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,000
You only have a few pieces of work so far.

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,040
You should turn your grief into power

70
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,960
and create some new works.

71
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,440
But,

72
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,120
there's only half a year left

73
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,560
before the deadline.

74
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,520
That's why you should hurry up.

75
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,880
Or you can create more works
under the theme of "Memento."

76
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
You are right.

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,200
I really should take more time

78
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,760
to create new works.

79
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,120
Oh, by the way,

80
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,680
the hotel next door is holding
an art exhibit right now.

81
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,040
Would you like to go with me?

82
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,440
I may find some inspiration there.

83
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,800
I still have things to do this afternoon.

84
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,120
I have to go back to my company.

85
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,360
How about next time?

86
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,720
Okay.

87
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,560
Then I'm leaving.

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,000

about the problem between you and your ex.

121
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,680
How is it going?

122
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,560
He still won't let me go.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,680
Actually, I'm a little annoyed.

124
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
I won't let you go?

125
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,440
That's because I want to win you over again!

126
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,040
Maybe he's still in love with you.

127
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,120
No!

128
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,480
The love between us is history now.

129
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,440
Leaving each other alone
would be the best ending.

130
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Leaving each other alone?

131
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,320
Chen Jiaxin,

132
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,160
why are you always swayed by your emotions?

133
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,840
But I really

134
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,680
feel sorry for what I did to my art broker.

135
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,920
Why do you wanna apologize to Dylan?

136
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,920
Because

137
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,720
I pretend to be with him,

138
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,080
so that my ex would think
that I'm dating again.

139
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,440
I knew it!

140
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,520
I knew something was not right!

141
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,480
If you don't like him,

142
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,680
you shouldn't waste his time.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,240
Sounds like

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,680
you still have feelings for your ex.

145
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,880
Your ex must be very certain about...

146
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,280
I may think of myself too much
if putting it this way.

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,760
I can't do that.

148
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
Jiaxin doesn't like Dylan,

149
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
but it doesn't mean
Dylan doesn't like Jiaxin.

150
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,560
What if Jiaxin is ready

151
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,000
to start a new relationship one day

152
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,080
and accepts Dylan?

153
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,240
It could be my last chance.

154
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,120
Do you

155
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,520
think

156
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,520
I'm making

157
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,680
a mistake?

158
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,680
Let's meet.

159
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,080
And this time

160
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,560
I will show up.

161
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,520
Some words are easier

162
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,680
to say in person.

163
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,320
Okay.

164
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,720
I've always wanted to meet you.

165
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,200
It's a deal.

166
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,920
I will bring the borage tomorrow.

167
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,320
Hope we both

168
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,160
have the courage to get
to know each other again.

169
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,680
Morning, sweetie!

170
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,320
Wait!

171
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,600
Somebody just said yesterday
about keeping a distance,

172
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,520
yet this morning she styled her hair
and put on makeup!

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,360
You are so smitten by Mr. W!

174
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,880
He's a very

175
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,960
important person to me!

176
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,200
Then what about me?

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,960
No one

178
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,760
can compare to my best friend!

179
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,040
You've become a sweet-talker, Chen Jiaxin!

180
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,120
But, to be honest,

181
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
I've thought it through.

182
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,960
Whoever you chose,

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,160
either Mr. W, or Dylan,

184
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,040
or Wang Xiyi,

185
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,040
as your best friend, I'll 100% support you!

186
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,440
As long as you won't be hindered by the past

187
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,640
and turn into a nose of wax again.

188
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,600
Thank you, Siqi!

189
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,800
I'm going!

190
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,600
Have fun!

191
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,720
Remember to eat your breakfast.

192
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,640
Wait for me to be back!

193
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,640
Bye!

194
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,640
Bye!

195
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,080

been this happy for three years!

241
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,280
I've lived so carefully
for the past three years.

242
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,800
I never allowed myself to be happy.

243
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,280
When something pleasant happened,

244
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,800
I'd think of Ximi,

245
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,000
and my joy

246
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,280
would instantly turn into guilt.

247
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,040
I was once a mother.

248
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,320
How could I forget my own child?

249
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,000
But ever since you showed up,

250
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,320
I've realized that I wasn't alone,

251
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,800
and that there was someone who felt for me.

252
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,520
Since you could get over it,

253
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,800
why couldn't I do it?

254
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,360
You gave me the courage to get over the past

255
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,440
and the drive to start over.

256
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,880
I may not be able

257
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,200
to say these to you

258
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,680

259
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,080

260
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,120
You let me realize

261
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,960
that I can let the past go

Mr. W?

Jiaxin.

283
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,880
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,160
I couldn't

285
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,440
get into your heart

286
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,960
for these three years.

287
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,040
So,

288
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,360
I became Mr. W.

289
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,320
I...

290
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,960
Jiaxin,

291
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,480
I didn't mean to lie to you.

292
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,160
I just wanted you to be happy.

293
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,480
But there was nothing I could do.

294
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,840
I really care about you a lot.

295
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,680
I can't get you out of my mind

296
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,600
since I saw you the very first time.

297
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,280
I feel sorry that I met you

298
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,360
just a little bit later than Wang Xiyi did.

299
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,920
No!

300
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,760
You are Mr. W!

301
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,080
The past doesn't count! You are my new start!

302
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,200
Mr. W

303
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
is God's best gift for me!

304
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,640
Why did you let me replace you?

305
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,520
You aren't

306
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,720
a generous person in love.

307
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,720
Because I can't

308
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,600
be Mr. W.

309
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,280
Why not?

310
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,440
Mr. W is too important for Jiaxin.

311
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,080
He's the only one

312
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,440
who can help her get over the misery.

313
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,640
I wanted to play Mr. W

314
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,320
to help Jiaxin to heal,

315
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,760
then tell her I'm Mr. W.

316
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,840
I do understand

317
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,200
her feelings.

318
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,040
Then why didn't you do it?

319
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,320
Because I just found out today

320
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,120
that Wang Xiyi was her sole

321
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,600
source of pain.

322
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,840
Mr. W can be anybody,

323
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,960
but me.

324
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,640
If she knew

325
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,240
I was Mr. W,

326
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,160
all her fantasy about Mr. W would be gone.

327
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,920
She'd lose someone

328
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,520
whom she can trust

329
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,000
and talk about her feelings with.

330
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
All she wants is to start over.

331
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,680
Actually,

332
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,960
I've been wondering these years

333
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,560
about what I did wrong exactly

334
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,760
that Jiaxin just couldn't forgive me.

335
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,880
So, I created a lot of coincidences,

336
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,160
including helping
my mother-in-law in her restaurant,

337
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,400
and following Jiaxin around.

338
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,040
I did those things

339
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,960
because I wanted her to forgive me.

340
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,640
But I neglected one thing

341
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,000
that I didn't consider it
from her point of view.

342
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
What she wants the most
is to get rid of the past.

343
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,640
She spent three years

344
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,640
turning herself into who she is today.

345
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,920
Yet I've been reminding her

346
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,600
of the past.

347
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,480
I will get the divorce finalized ASAP,

348
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,640
so that nothing will get in the way

349
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,240
between you and Jiaxin.

350
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,640
I had no idea you loved Jiaxin

351
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,880
this much until now.

352
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,320
It's too late though.

353
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,440
Promise me,

354
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,000
take good care of Jiaxin.

355
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,600
Xiyi is drinking with me.

356
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,840
You can come to pick him up.

357
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,440
Alone?

358
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,160
Feel sad?

359
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,920
Let me buy you a drink.

360
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,840
You can talk to me.

361
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,800
Go away!

362
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,840
Don't touch me!

363
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,840
I didn't touch you!

364
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,400
Hello? Is this police station?

365
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,840
Oh, yes,

366
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,720
here's a drunk guy...

367
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,040
Stop it, bro.

368
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,640
Who are you kidding with?
You didn't even dial!

369
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,640
I'll leave, okay?

370
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,920
There are a bunch of girls waiting for me!

371
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,920
What are you doing here?

372
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,160
I happened to see you on my way home.

373
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,760
You looked kinda sad.

374
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,400
I didn't want to bother you,

375
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,120
but I was also worried about you,

376
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,600
so I couldn't help following you here.

377
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,080
I'm fine.

378
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,920
Don't worry.

379
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,320
Since you are fine,

380
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,040
then

381
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,720
I'll go.

382
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,900
(Beihong Road Tunnel)

383
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,280
Anna,

384
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,200
it's not safe here.

385
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,920
Let me call you a cab.

386
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,360
It's okay.

387
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,080
Don't bother.

388
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,400
If auntie Xiuling knew it,

389
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,400
she'd blame me for making trouble again.

390
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,080
Don't be so stubborn.

391
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,400
Xiyi,

392
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,760
does it mean

393
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,080
you still care about me?

394
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,600
I can't just leave you here alone.

395
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,680
So, have you got back

396
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,200
together with Jiaxin?

397
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,000
Jiaxin and I...

398
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,000
Jiaxin and I are over.

399
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,680
Would you please switch places for these two?

400
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
What do you think?

401
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,520
Very nice!

402
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,600
Hmmm!

403
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,240
How come this place is empty?

404
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,920
Are you waiting for some new work?

405
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,680
My "Memento!"

406
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,440
I asked you if you bought this.

407
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,960
You just wouldn't admit!

408
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,520
You are its owner.

409
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,360
You should put it there.

410
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,160
No, you go ahead.

411
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,760
I need to sort out some files in my office.

412
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,640
Let's have lunch together.

413
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,400
Okay.

414
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,400
I bought this under the name of Mr. W.

415
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,960
Why do you bring it over?

416
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,760
This is the most precious piece for Jiaxin.

417
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,360
Please take good care of it in my stead.

418
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,840
In your stead?

419
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,200
Go ask them to get ready for the meeting.

420
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,320
Okay, Mr. Yi.

421
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,040
Hello?

422
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,400
Are you free tonight?

423
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,880
What's up?

424
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,800
My dance studio has been open for a while.

425
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,760
I think it still needs some improvement.

426
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,960
So I wanna ask for your opinions.

427
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,760
I'll come by after work.

428
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,080
The training for basic skills is essential

429
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,400
to being a good ballerina.

430
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,160
I know classes like leg and foot stretching

431
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,480
are quite boring,

432
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,600
and the kids don't get why we do it,

433
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,920
so they tend to

434
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,000
complain a lot.

435
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,040
But as their teacher,

436
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,200
I have to help them

437
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,520
master the most basic skills.

438
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
As a result, many parents blame me
for not teaching ballet moves.

439
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,120
Anna,

440
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,920
not all ballet learners

441
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,320
want to become professional ballerinas,

442
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,760
or

443
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,840
to accomplish something big.

444
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
So, I think you can

445
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,400
ask the parents and the kids

446
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,560
what their purposes of learning ballet are

447
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,320
before they sign up,

448
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,240
that way, you can avoid the misunderstanding.

449
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,920
Hold that thought.

450
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,320
Coming.

451
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,160
Who's here?

452
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,200
My brother and Jiaxin.

453
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,760
Anna,

454
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,760
I've said what I wanted to say.

455
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,760
I'll leave now.

456
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,000
Why don't you stay for dinner?

457
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,520
I've cooked a whole table of dishes.

458
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,040
It's alright.

459
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,760
Jiaxin and I were just in the neighborhood.

460
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,720
You said you were home,
so we stopped by to see you.

461
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,760
We didn't know you had a guest.

462
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,560
Sorry to disturb.

463
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,960
We still have other things to do.

464
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,600
Why are you all going to leave?

465
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,760
What's going on?

466
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,400
We aren't strangers, are we?

467
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,120
Just let bygones be bygones.

468
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,200
No one is allowed to leave.

469
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,040
Let's have dinner together.

470
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,640
Let me get you some soup.

471
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,280
Thanks.

472
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,680
Xiyi, taste this meat. Very delicious.

473
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,440
Try the egg, too.

474
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,640
Have some more.

475
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,760
Thank you.

476
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:46,880
Xiyi,

477
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,840
have a taste of the fish.

478
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,640
I bought it this afternoon in the market.

479
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,720
It's very fresh.

480
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,960
I checked many recipes

481
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,800
and made some changes based on them.

482
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,400
Try it.

483
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,480
Here, Jiaxin, have a try.

484
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,840
You can give Anna some tips

485
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,520
if there's still room to improve.

486
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,920
That's right, Jiaxin!

487
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,280
Hope you won't make fun of me!

488
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,200
Okay, let me try.

489
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,480
Wow, very yummy!

490
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,560
I actually want your unique recipe.

491
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,440
Really? Great!

492
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,640
Such a good cook as Jiaxin even likes it!

493
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,600
I will send you

494
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,520
the recipe through WeChat later.

495
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,440
Okay.

496
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,440
Hey,

497
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,120
you'll cook it for my brother, right?

498
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,600
Fish is Dylan's favorite dish.

499
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,680
Brother,

500
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,760
how lucky you are!

501
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,080
You have such a sweet girlfriend!

502
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,760
Others will envy you!

503
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,200
Right, Xiyi?

504
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,520
Xiyi, you got some grease on your face.

505
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,320
Let me help you to wipe it off.

506
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,160
Done!

507
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,800
Thanks.

508
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,120
Anna,

509
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,480
would you please get me
another pair of chopsticks?

510
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,040
Sure!

511
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:01,960
Thank you!

512
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,900
Come!

513
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,000
Hey, you...

514
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,640
Anna,

515
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
give them some space.

516
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,800
I believe Wang Xiyi

517
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,600
will handle it right.

518
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,360
Why did you drag me in here?

519
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,760
What would they think?

520
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,440
I thought we've talked things out.

521
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,480
What you need to do right now
is to control yourself.

522
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,920
Are you happy with Dylan?

523
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,240
Why wouldn't I be?

524
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,400
He understands and tolerates me.

525
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,200
He's willing to accompany me all the time.

526
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,960
No one is better than him.

527
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,080
Yes.

528
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,720
No one is better than him!

529
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,680
So we should

530
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,040
keep a distance from each other!

531
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,240
Anna is the one

532
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,480
you should care about!

533
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,920
We can't

534
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,880
get back to where we were.

535
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,560
It's not your fault

536
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,920
that Ximi was gone.

537
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,040
Please don't blame yourself.

538
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,200
From now on,

539
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,880
whenever you think of Ximi,

540
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,320
you should feel happy.

541
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,360
We once had such a lovely baby,

542
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,600
who brought us so much joy

543
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,600
and happiness!

544
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,920
Chen Jiaxin.

545
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,960
I love you!

546
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,480
This is the last time.

547
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,480
Eight, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight!

548
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,520
Alright,

549
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,800
girls,

550
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,120
that's all for today's class.

551
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,240
Remember to practice after you are home.

552
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,120
Thank you, teacher!

553
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,000
Bye, teacher!

554
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,640
Bye!

555
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,600
Cheers!

556
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,600
It's tasty!

557
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,440
When I was in the dance group,

558
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,400
I could only drink a little bit.

559
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,160
Even so, I was afraid that
our head would find out.

560
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,920
Brother.

561
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,520
Yes?

562
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,520
Do you feel happy

563
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,040
being with Jiaxin?

564
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,160
Well,

565
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,520
it doesn't

566
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,320
feel much different

567
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,040
from before.

568
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,480
Except...

569
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,200
Except what?

570
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,120
Except that I feel like

571
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,040
I'm playing someone else.

572
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,640
Why?

573
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,840
Brother,

574
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,400
let me give you a piece of advice
from a woman's point of view.

575
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,040
You are too much of a gentleman.

576
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,760
That's why it's hard for you
to get closer to her.

577
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,960
Alright,

578
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,720
I know exactly what my problem is.

579
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,920
If someone doesn't like you,

580
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,480
your gentleness will be considered weakness,

581
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,760
your initiative

582
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,240
will be interpreted

583
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,600
as disturbance.

584
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,920
Your passion will drive her away,

585
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,560
and your care will become her burden.

586
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,120
Now,

587
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,800
enough about me. Let's talk about you.

588
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,360
If Wang Xiyi

589
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,160
can't fall in love with you again,

590
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,160
what are you gonna do?

591
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,160
I can wait.

592
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,480
It's not waiting,

593
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,320
but wasting your time!

594
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,400
No!

595
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,600
It's not!

596
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,600
We were so in love before.

597
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,600
Xiyi will change his mind.

598
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,000
You can't force him to love you again.

599
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,960
And you can't make him change

600
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,320
without considering the current situation!

601
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,600
Of course, I can!

602
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,960
Wang Xiyi said he wouldn't divorce Jiaxin,

603
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,560
even wrote it on the divorce agreement

604
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,200
that he'd give her
half of the property and custody.

605
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,840
But they still ended up
separating for three years.

606
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
Anything can be changed.

607
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,160
Gave Jiaxin half of the property and custody?

608
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,920
What does that mean?

609
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:49,880
Well...

610
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,240
Xiyi mentioned it to me.

611
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,920
Alright, let's drop it.

612
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,040
Now, have some wine.

613
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,000
What's wrong with holding
our wedding in my hometown?

614
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,240
It takes two for a marriage to happen.

615
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,120
Why do you get to decide everything?

616
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,360
How am I supposed to live with you then?

617
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,120
Then Let's break up!

618
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,360
No one asks you to spend your life with me!

619
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,960
You are...

620
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,920
Alright then! Don't think I'm afraid of you!

621
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,440
Get out!

622
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,440
I said, I want to break up!

623
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,000
Jiaxin!

624
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,360
Sorry.

625
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,120
It's okay.

626
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,560
Why did you fight again?

627
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,640
No wonder people say

628
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,640
marriage is an art of escaping.

629
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,600
I don't want to get married anymore!

630
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,400
You know,

631
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,640
we weren't even as fully prepared

632
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,960
when we took the university entrance exams.

633
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,920
Actually,

634
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,960
no matter how grand the wedding is,

635
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,840
it won't guarantee a lifetime of happiness.

636
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,680
As you know,

637
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,840
when I got married,

638
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,880
the entire island came to my wedding.

639
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,480
But what happened after?

640
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,400
At least you didn't have to go through
such a troubling process.

641
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,120
Come on!

642
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,240
Stop whining.

643
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,160
As someone who's done this before,

644
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,480
let me tell you, the most important part

645
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,440
about a wedding is whom you'll marry,

646
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,560
whom you'll

647
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,160
spend the rest of your life with.

648
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,720
The others

649
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,360
don't really matter.

650
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,960
It's been a week already?

651
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,920
Why I feel like I'm drifting apart

652
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,200
from Mr. W

653
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,480
even though I meet Dylan every day?

654
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,680
You are up!

655
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,680
Go freshen up.

656
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,960
I need you to go somewhere with me!
I'll wait for you!

657
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,440
Come on!

658
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,640
Where are we going this early?

659
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,120
It's very important!

660
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,000
Stop asking! Just go with me!

661
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,920
Hurry!

662
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,120
This is the first time
we adjust the formula of Heritage.

663
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,600
The market response
will be very important to us.

664
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,640
Go confirm with Xiazhilu again

665
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,480
about the shipment of the first batch
of Heritage essential oil .

666
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,200
Also, confirm the shipment
for the next month.

667
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,400
Make a horizontal analysis

668
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,600
on the shipment for the last three years.

669
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,280
The market response this time
is very important.

670
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:08,920
Anson.

671
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,800
Okay,

672
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,880
I got it.

673
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,200
Tell me,

674
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,080
is it about wedding budget

675
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,200
or any problem between
your mom and your wife?

676
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,440
Neither.

677
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,840
I think...

678
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,440
my wedding is off.

679
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,120
I broke up with Siqi!

680
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,760
Broke up?

681
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,280
Yes.

682
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,680
I've reimbursed your wedding

683
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,000
and honeymoon expenses,
and even the down payment for your house.

684
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,960
How come you still blew it?

685
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,520
Come on!

686
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,760
Jiaxin left you even after she was pregnant.

687
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,640
Siqi is just my fiancée.

688
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,720
Accident happens.

689
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,800
The wedding ring is too extravagant to me.

690
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,680
I'll give it back to you, Mr. Yi.

691
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,240
Are you sure you won't regret?

692
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,480
When I regret and want one again,

693
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,280
I'll let him make more money
and buy me a bigger one!

694
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,480
We've broken up.

695
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,720
Why would I buy you a ring?

696
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,400
You can still get back together.

697
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,520
How can we get back together?

698
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,000
What do you think?

699
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,720
Siqi!

700
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,000
Actually...

701
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,280
Siqi,

702
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,920
I've thought about it.

703
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,400
It's my fault! I know It's my fault.

704
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,320
I didn't consider your feelings.

705
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,760
No!

706
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,520
I've thought it through!

707
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,240
What's the point of those formalities?

708
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,880
It's just a glorious showoff
in front of family and friends.

709
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,800
Yet the whole process
is so tiring and troublesome!

710
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,880
This is not what a marriage is about.

711
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,880
Anson.

712
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,280
Huh?

713
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,920
We've been together for three years.

714
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,120
You kept me company every day,

715
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,320
made me happy,

716
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,720
made me laugh,

717
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,360
had delicious food with me,

718
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,760
and argued back and forth with me.

719
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,360
I even got rid of my bad temper
because of you!

720
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,680
Those moments weren't that romantic,

721
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,080
but they were warm

722
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,840
and sweet enough

723
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,440
to make us decide to get married!

724
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,360
Because we both believe

725
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,960
our lives can be better

726
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,280
having each other in it.

727
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,560
That's why we'll get married, right?

728
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,720
I feel lucky

729
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,800
that it's not too late to realize that.

730
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,280
So,

731
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,200
I don't want a splendid wedding anymore.

732
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,000
I just want you to return the knee

733
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:00,680
you owe me!

734
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,800
