Whoever treats you like this

is giving me a difficult time.

36
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,320
But if you don't even care

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,480
about those rumors,

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,400

You can do it!

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,800
Did she really cheat the Chairwoman?

54
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,120
Will we lose our job

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
because of her?

I hope not!

I really like grandma Zhenzhu.

She treats me

62

very well.

63
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,000
I'd never do anything to hurt her.

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,560
So, I would never fool around

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
with some man

66
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,600
to make her angry.

It's not true.

is not true.

70
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,080
So who should we trust?

71

Right! What is the truth?

-Who should we trust?

That's right. Who should we trust?

Who should we trust?

77
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,120
Yeah.

78
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,600

and let the one who wants it to have it?

88
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,560

of Cheng Jie Group.

everybody deserves to be respected.

If you are rude to my employee,

then it's my job to remind you

111

to apologize to her for your rude behavior.

112

Are you kidding?

113
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,320
You're asking me to apologize to her instead

114
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,680
of asking her to apologize to me?

115

It's a misunderstanding.

Mr. Zhou, don't be angry.

120

Let me apologize to you.
Just take it out on me.

After all, harmony brings wealth in business.

Enough.

Stop fighting.

133

Mr. Yi,

you still can't see right
and wrong clearly, right?

135
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,600
I'm good-tempered,

136
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
but I still have my bottom line.

137

Brother, it's not the time to
be partial to our people.

who gets insulted here.

140
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
So you are saying it's nonnegotiable?

141
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,280
Then the deal is off.

142

Let's just terminate the contract.

143
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,320
Terminate it.

Mr. Zhou. Sorry. Sorry.

145
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,320
It's my fault.

146
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,440
Please forgive me.

147

I'll tell you my real thoughts.

Unlike you,

I will never do the things

I don't like.

156

256
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,400
his son was unemployed,

257
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
so he wouldn't deliver the rice to us.

258
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,120
He is so heartless!

259
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,280
I always shop in his store.

260
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,240
Can't believe he would do this to me!

261

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,760
how about closing the noodle stall
for a couple of days?

263
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,440
Just take a few days off.

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,280
Whatever you wanna eat, I'll cook for you.

268
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,560
instead of working.

269
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,600
I need to talk to them.

270
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,080
Aunt. Aunt.

271
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,680
Calm down.

272
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,000
Jiaxin was worried that
you'd argue with people,

273
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,240
so she asked me

274
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,880
to keep you from leaving home.

275
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
You see. She's pregnant,

276
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,160
and I'm also going to give to birth.

277
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
So don't let her worry,

278
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
and don't make it difficult to me, okay?

279
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,800
Aunt, here's your rice!

280
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,600
Thank you!

281
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,400
Don't mention it. We are family.

282
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,720
Where's Jiaxin? She's back to Shanghai?

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,960
I just knew you wouldn't
help me for no reason.

284
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,240
Why are you looking for her?

285
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,880
It's about...

286
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,720
the factory.

287
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,560
The deal between Mr. Yi and Mr. Zhou is off.

288
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,800
We just hope that Jiaxin
can apologize to Mr. Zhou,

289
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,000
so that Mr. Wang may save the deal.

290
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,960
So, now that you need Jiaxin,

291
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,680
she becomes your only hope?

292
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,840
You've forgotten how you
gossiped about her before?

293
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,240
Aunt, I didn't lie though.

294
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,800
You could totally tell from
what Mr. Wang said

295
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
that Jiaxin was the one who
made the Chairwoman furious.

296
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
What's wrong with you?

297
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,520
I thought you were here to comfort my aunt,

298
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,640
but it turns out you came to piss her off.

299
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,080
Quiet down!

300
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,920
Quiet down?

301
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,600
Just get out of here!

302
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
Stop annoying us.

303
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,880
Aunt, how about...

304
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,440
Didn't you hear what your wife said?

305
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,440
Get out, now!

306
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,680
Go away. Leave here.

307
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,680
Leave. Get out.

308
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,280
Alright.

309
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,440
You are angry. I can't handle you guys.

310
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,320
I'll just leave.

311
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,800
He drove me crazy!

312
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,000
Aunt, don't mind his words.

313
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,920
Don't be angry with him.

314
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,720
Calm down.

315
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,200
It's just a pregnancy checkup.

316
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,680
You don't have to go with me.

317
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,880
I can go by myself.

318
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,600
I know you are busy.

319
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,640
Let me ask you.

320
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,520
That Doctor Hao won't be
Wang Xiyi's spokesman,

321
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,280
so he won't accompany you
to the checkup either?

322
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,960
I'm not that close to him.

323
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,240
I'd better keep a distance from him.

324
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,720
I don't want to rely on him too much.

325
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,440
Makes sense.

326
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,520
You know what?

327
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
Anson told me

328
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,360
that Wang Xiyi had a lot of trouble at work.

329
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
He's been trying so hard
to save the Heritage series,

330
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,200
but got no luck yet.

331
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,440
The Heritage series is the glory

332
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,840
and lifeblood of Wang Xiyi's family.

333
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,440
Though he never admits defeat,

334
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,320
I'm not surprised
that he's been terribly busy.

335
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,640
Come on, Jiaxin,

336
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,440
don't worry about him too much.

337
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
How about this?

338
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,840
You can come to my firm after checkup.

339
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,840
I have over 200 cases...

340
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,560
No.

341
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,120
I'll go home and be with my grandma.

342
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,000
What are you doing?

343
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,080
Chen Jiaxin!

344
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,280
You've finally made progress!

345
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,240
You always said "yes" before

346
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,840
no matter who asked you for help.

347
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,120
But now you've finally known
how to say "no" to people.

348
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,560
Sorry.

349
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,600
Then I...

350
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,600
It is a compliment, my dear!

351
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,920
Why are you apologizing again?

352
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,960
It's my great pleasure to be the first one

353
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,240
who's rejected by you on earth.

354
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,400
Are you crazy?

355
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,880
My phone.

356
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,560
It's my sister.

357
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,120
Hello? Sister.

358
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,280
Left home?

359
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,760
Arrived in Shanghai already?

360
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,920
Let's put it aside that
the ribbon-cutting thing

361
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,720
has become the butt of the joke
to the whole industry.

362
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,640
There's no way to hide the fact
that the Chairwoman is hospitalized.

363
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,680
And the most important thing is

364
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,760
that Haifei Group has sent
us a letter of demand.

365
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,880
Do you think we should call Mr. Shen over?

366
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,480
The shareholders are not happy about this.

367
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,880
How are things going in Europe?

368
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,240
The same as before.

369
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,040
But some told me

370
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,760
that there was a proposal about
changing the General Manager

371
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,760
would be reviewed on the
Interim Board Meeting in two days.

372
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,840
Just let it be. Are the guests here already?

373
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,120
Yes. They are waiting for you.

374
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,560
Okay.

375
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,940
(Chen Jiaxin's Pregnancy Checkup
Remind 10 minutes later)

376
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,120
What's wrong?

377
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,400
Let's go.

378
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,960
Brother, you are here!

379
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,320
I heard that Mr. Chen and Mr. Xie were here.

380
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,080
I haven't seen them for a long time.

381
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,200
So I came by to say hi.

382
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,080
Sit here, brother.

383
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,520
Zhengren is quite outstanding!

384
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,600
This is so-called "the new generation
will invariably surpass the old."

385
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,000
He's successfully

386
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,720
made a deal with Haifei after he came back.

387
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,120
He's capable, enthusiastic and resourceful.

388
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,440
Xiyi,

389
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,680
you should give him
more opportunities to grow

390
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
and trust his potential.

391
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,080
That's right.

392
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,480
Our company needs new talents like him.

393
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,240
Always sticking

394
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,040
to the old ways will only hold us back.

395
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,320
Thank you, I'm so flattered.

396
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,320
Brother,

397
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,160
since we have two Directors here,

398
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,360
I wanna say again

399
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,160
that I hope you can consider
about our cooperation with Haifei.

400
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Do you think you know Haifei better than me?

401
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,000
As far as I know,

402
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,680
Zhou Zhan is actively purchasing
our shares right now.

403
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I seriously suspect that he's going

404
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,480
to seize the decision-making power
of Cheng Jie

405
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,760
so that he can eventually
acquire our company.

406
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,920
You think too much.

407
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm not like you.

408
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,920
I only want to solve the problem.

409
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,280
"Automated Production Plan"?

410
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,000
Isn't it a plan drafted long time ago?

411
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,960
We have only two solutions now.

412
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,000
One,

413
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
you need to apologize to Zhou Zhan

414
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,640
so that we can continue to work with Haifei.

415
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,400
The other,

416
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,680
we may come back to life

417
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,040
if we downsize the factory as planned.

418
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
This is how you'll treat

419
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,680
the island people who've been supporting you?

420
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
I guess you two

421
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,280
must agree with Zhengren.

422
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,200
Why don't you let Zhengren
deal with the downsizing?

423
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,720
It's a good opportunity for him
to practice his business skills.

424
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,640
What if I don't take either option?

425
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,680
Xiyi,

426
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,680
we are talking to you as your elders.

427
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,800
If you don't respect our decision,

428
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,600
we will also exercise our
due authority tomorrow

429
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,680
on the Board Meeting.

430
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,920
You are not in charge here.

431
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,320
Mr. Chen! Mr. Xie!

432
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,400
Brother, you...

433
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,160
Mr. Chen! Mr. Xie!

434
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,480
Well.

435
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,080
The "Automated Production Plan"

436
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,600
has been drafted long time ago, right?

437
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,680
Why did you reject it suddenly

438
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,200
just for Chen Jiaxin?

439
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,640
I didn't do it for Chen Jiaxin.

440
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,480
Grandma once promised the island people

441
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,440
that they wouldn't get fired.

442
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
So how can I do things

443
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,960
that will undermine grandma's reputation?

444
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,880
Alright, then let's not talk about Jiaxin.

445
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,200
But what should we do now?

446
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,200
We've just offended Zhou Zhan,

447
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,040
and now we've even offended
Mr. Chen and Mr. Xie,

448
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,240
who used to support us the most.

449
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,080
So what are we gonna do
on tomorrow's Board Meeting?

450
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,320
How come you are so absent-minded today?

451
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,840
Let me think about it.

452
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,200
Where are you going?

453
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,560
We still have an appointment with the bank!

454
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,440
Hey!

455
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,440
I've rescheduled your meeting

456
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,320
with Mr. Xu of the bank.

457
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,120
Okay.

458
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,200
You really

459
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,080
would rather mortgage the company's assets

460
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,400
than downsizing or apologizing to Zhou Zhan?

461
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,320
Let's talk to the bank first.

462
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
I must be crazy.

463
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,440
I leave all the things behind

464
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,880
and come to find Chen Jiaxin.

465
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,000
What... What brought you here?

466
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,000
You've done your checkup?

467
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,920
Yes.

468
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,240
Jiaxin!

469
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,080
Sister.

470
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,880
I walked all the way here. So hot.

471
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,960
Thank you for coming!

472
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:21,920
Mr. Yi?

473
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,920
You came with Jiaxin for the checkup?

474
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,320
Yes!

475
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,760
I just knew it!

476
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,960
People don't have a chance to
see how close you are.

477
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,360
That's why they always gossip.

478
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,200
I can't stand my husband doing that.

479
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,560
So I left home.

480
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,000
Mr. Yi,

481
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,040
would you like

482
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,680
to go shopping with Jiaxin and me?

483
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,000
He still has work to do.

484
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,000
I happen to be free this afternoon.

485
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,520
I'll accompany you then.

486
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,600
That's great.

487
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,880
I'll max out Jia Tiancai's credit card.

488
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,440
Let's go.

489
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,080
This store is so amazing.

490
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,200
You guys suit yourselves.

491
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,160
I'll go take a look now.

492
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,040
Is it boring to go shopping with us?

493
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,520
I hope we are not disturbing your work.

494
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,360
Actually, I wasn't that nice to you.

495
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,000
I used you and Ximi to approach Doctor Hao.

496
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,880
And you didn't tell anybody.

497
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,200
So, we are even now.

498
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,080
Well,

499
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,040
I think you were nice to me.

500
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,280
You even stood up for me yesterday

501
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,040
on the signing ceremony.

502
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,760
To be frank,

503
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,520
you don't have to think of me first

504
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,560
when you do things.

505
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,080
About Doctor Hao,

506
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,600
I actually over-reacted.

507
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,360
I will often

508
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,160
remind myself in the future.

509
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,800
Please forgive me.

510
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,680
You didn't go to the hospital

511
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,680
for my checkup, right?

512
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,240
No.

513
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,640
You wanted to persuade Doctor Hao?

514
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,200
He's the only one who can help

515
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,920
with the revival of the Heritage series.

516
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,000
Xiyi!

517
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Will you come help me?

518
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,880
I don't know which size to choose.

519
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,320
Would you try this for me?

520
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,920
See, should I choose

521
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,160
size M or L? Help me.

522
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,080
The Heritage series is the glory

523
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,600
and lifeblood of Wang Xiyi's family.

524
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,320
Though he never admits defeat,

525
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,080
I'm not surprised
that he's been terribly busy.

526
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,000
Jiaxin.

527
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,480
Would you come and help me?

528
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,640
Okay.

529
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,120
I feel so awesome.

530
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,920
Each time I swiped the card, I felt like

531
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,360
I just slapped hard in Jia Tiancai's face!

532
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,760
His face

533
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,240
must have been swollen by now!

534
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,360
Even so,

535
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,280
you've bought all the things for him.

536
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,600
Is that also a slap in his face?

537
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,080
You don't understand.

538
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,640
If I really drive him away,

539
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,040
what am I supposed to do with my baby?

540
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,400
When you two

541
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,240
fight a few more times, you'll understand

542
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,560
my mixed feelings.

543
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,400
Come on, I'll take you guys out for a meal.

544
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,880
What's going on?

545
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,440
What happened?

546
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,640
No response?

547
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
Try again! Don't be panic.

548
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,200
We are stuck in here.

549
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,280
What should we do?

550
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,880
Calm down, sister!

551
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,800
Sir, how may I help you?

552
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,520
Hi,

553
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,840
we are stuck in the elevator.

554
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,120
Sorry.

555
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,640
I'll contact the repairman now.

556
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,080
Sir, don't be panic.

557
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,080
Please press the button of each floor

558
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,520
in case the elevator drops suddenly. Okay?

559
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,280
I've done it.

560
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,120
Of course, I'm worried!

561
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,560
If anything happens,

562
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,760
the three of us and two unborn babies

563
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,760
will all be killed!

564
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,840
I don't... I don't want to die in here.

565
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,560
We'll be fine!

566
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,840
Calm down for your baby's sake.

567
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,520
It hurts!

568
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,240
What's wrong?

569
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,640
Sister, don't scare me!

570
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,040
Maybe it's contraction!

571
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,720
Have you experienced
this type of pain before?

572
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,400
No.

573
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
My waist has been sore the whole day.

574
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,840
That should be the sign of contraction.

575
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,680
Sister, hold on!

576
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,320
Sister, take it easy!

577
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,640
Sit here.

578
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,120
Sit here, easy.

579
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,780
Stretch out your legs.

580
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,960
Jiaxin,

581
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,560
check her cervix.

582
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,440
Sister, you'll be fine.

583
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,520
Hello?

584
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,280
Will you be quicker?

585
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,480
Here's a pregnant woman in labor!

586
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,480
Please wait a moment!

587
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,240
The repairman is already on his way!

588
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,360
No signal!

589
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:49,880
By the way,

590
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,480
would you please dial
a doctor's number for me?

591
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,160
The number is...

592
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,220
18625599688.

593
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,240
It so hurts!

594
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,560
I can't stand it anymore!

595
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:01,920
Sister!

596
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,240
Here, hold on to my hand. Don't be panic.

597
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
I don't want to give birth anymore!

598
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,920
I don't want to!

599
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,520
Calm down!

600
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,320
Jiaxin, how's her cervix?

601
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,120
It has dilated.

602
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,200
About...

603
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,400
How wide is it?

604
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,480
About

605
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:18,920
four-fingers wide.

606
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,800
Four.

607
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,040
It's Doctor Hao.

608
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,680
Doctor Hao, it's Wang Xiyi.

609
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,200
I've made myself very clear.

610
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,400
Please don't bother me anymore!

611
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,760
I'm not calling for the spokesman.

612
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,760
We are stuck in the elevator!

613
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,920
Jiaxin's cousin is in labor.

614
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,240
Tell me, what's her condition?

615
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,880
Her contractions occur every two minutes.

616
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,840
Each contraction lasts for about one minute.

617
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,200
Her dilation of cervix is
about four fingers now.

618
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
So it's still in phase one.

619
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:44,840
However,

620
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,720
it doesn't mean there's no danger.

621
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,560
Tell me,

622
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,800
do you have anything contains alcohol,

623
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,360
and is there anything can cut umbilical cord?

624
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,800
I have alcohol pads and a small scissors!

625
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,360
Good!

626
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,080
Since we don't know

627
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,000
when the rescue team will arrive,

628
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,240
use the alcohol pad
to clean the scissors first,

629
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,320
just in case.

630
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,760
Okay, I'm on it!

631
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,760
Do you know how to do Lamaze breath?

632
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,480
Lamaze?

633
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,360
Doctor Hao, I know!

634
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,680
Okay, then keep doing it

635
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,640
till the rescue team is there.

636
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,920
Alright, got it!

637
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,480
Sister!

638
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,240
It's so painful!

639
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,920
I can't stand it!

640
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,400
Sister!

641
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,920
Sister, calm down!

642
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,560
Listen, look at me.

643
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,360
Jiaxin and I are here.
Nothing will happen to you!

644
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:26,840
Okay?

645
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,560
You'll be fine!

646
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Sister, listen to me.

647
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,600
Your contractions

648
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,680
will occur more often

649
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,320
and the pain will be more intense.

650
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,360
But trust me, it's all normal.

651
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,840
You are fine!

652
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Follow my lead, okay?

653
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,600
Now,

654
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,320
take a deep breathe. Inhale.

655
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,440
Deep breathe. Inhale through the nose.

656
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,920
Inhale.

657
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,880
Inhale.

658
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,840
A deep one.

659
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,280
Okay, now, exhale.

660
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,400
Like blow the candles.

661
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:48,880
Exhale.

662
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,000
Now, inhale.

663
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,600
Inhale.

664
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,200
Inhale.

665
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,960
Inhale hard.

666
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,360
Alright, exhale.

667
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,680
Like blow the candles. Face to Jiaxin.

668
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,520
Exhale.

669
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,240
Exhale.

670
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,120
Very good.

671
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,160
Let's do it again.

672
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,800
Inhale.

673
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,000
Blow the candles. Exhale.

674
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,280
How do you feel? Better?

675
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,400
Yes, a little.

676
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,560
You can make it.

677
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,520
I'm sorry, my baby.

678
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,120
I was lying when I said
I didn't want to give birth.

679
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,160
For you,

680
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,040
I can take any kind of pain.

681
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,600
Jiaxin,

682
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,400
Hurry!

683
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,080
Hurry up. Hurry.

684
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,800
Take it easy.

685
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,560
Take it easy.

686
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,000
This guy

687
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,520
is quite impressive
when dealing with emergency.

688
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,920
Smells so good.

689
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,680
Instant noodles.

690
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,760
I'm starving.

691
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,680
Hey.

692
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,080
Wanna eat it?

693
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,720
Yes.

694
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,840
It'll cost you 100 yuan.

695
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,560
I don't have cash.

696
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,280
I'll add you to my WeChat later
and transfer the money to you.

697
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,360
Hot! Hot!

698
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,360
Xiyi.

699
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,000
You were so amazing.

700
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,160
If it wasn't for you,

701
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,760
I wouldn't even know what to do.

702
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,000
It was all thanks to Doctor Hao's book.

703
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,480
Jiaxin.

704
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,280
Thank you!

705
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,320
Huh?

706
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,720
I want to thank you.

707
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,640
I had no idea

708
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,880
pregnancy would cause discomforts,

709
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,960
and giving birth could be so dangerous.

710
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,760
Thank you for keeping Ximi.

711
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,360
When you are in labor,

712
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,480
I promise I'll be by your side.

713
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,760
Okay.

714
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,000
The baby is born!

715
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,760
You little monster!

716
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Why did you have to come out
while your dad wasn't around?

717
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,240
In this case, how can he know

718
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,360
how much pain I've suffered?

719
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,160
Your husband was worried sick.

720
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
He even cried on the bus when he heard

721
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,920
the baby was born.

722
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,800
Let Xiyi hold the baby.

723
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,160
He's done me a big favor!

724
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,400
Careful.

725
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,320
His nose looks

726
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,240
just like his mother's.

727
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,640
So interesting.

728
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,360
Will my baby

729
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,120
look like me?

730
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,800
Eyes?

731
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:51,960
Nose?

732
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,040
Mouth?

733
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,200
Maybe mouth!

734
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
Will the baby inherit his mom's personality?

735
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,040
Better not.

736
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,400
But it's also not a good thing

737
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,360
if the baby inherits my temper.

738
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,160
Grandma.

739
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,720
If I were to be replaced
after the Board Meeting,

740
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,400
it'd be even harder for me
to protect the Heritage series.

741
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Will you blame me then?

742
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,480
What are you doing here?

743
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,560
You'll face a tough war today

744
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,480
on the Board Meeting.

745
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,680
And it's highly possible

746
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,080
that you'd be defeated.

747
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,320
That way, I'd also lose my job,

748
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,000
and become unemployed together with you.

749
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,680
So,

750
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,240
I wanted to pay the Chairwoman
a visit while I'm still

751
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,240
one of the employees of Cheng Jie Group.

752
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:23,840
No worry.

753
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,160
I will write you a recommendation letter.

754
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,440
Forget it.

755
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,720
I'm very picky. I won't just
work for anybody.

756
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,200
So,

757
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,080
please hang in there!

758
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Who sent me a message now?

759
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,200
It's an Email from the Europe!

760
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,680
I'll forward it to you right now.

761
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Forward it to you.

762
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,780
"To Cheng Jie Group"
"Congratulations on passing PIF certification"

763
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,920
The company has injected a lot of money

764
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,520
to protect our market.

765
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,720
Even so,

766
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,640
the stock price is still sinking.

767
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
Since the Chairwoman is in the hospital,

768
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,400
I don't want to give Wang Xiyi a hard time,

769
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,200
but the company has become like this,

770
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,960
so he's not qualified anymore
to be the Mr. Yi.

771
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,680
Dear directors, you are right.

772
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,360
As the Mr. Yi of Cheng Jie,

773
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,000
he should apologize to Zhou Zhan

774
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,000
and sign the contract with him.

775
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,840
I will never apologize to him!

776
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,280
Let me show you something.

777
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,840
This is the PIF Authorization Report

778
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,120
sent from France government just now.

779
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,200
PIF

780
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,960
is authorization of Cosmetics Europe.

781
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,800
To obtain this authorization,

782
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,440
experimental report on effectiveness

783
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,960
and safety will be required.

784
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,880
The packing material

785
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,720
and the substances of essence
will go through strict inspection,

786
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,840
even the testing by a toxicologist.

787
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,680
We've spent three years

788
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,080
and finally got the authorization
for Heritage series.

789
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,120
So what?

790
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,520
The problem at hand

791
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,320
is that Haifei has stopped
the partnership with us.

792
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,360
Our stock price is declining
and the market is unstable.

793
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,480
Don't shift the focus.

794
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,520
You've studied overseas,

795
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,040
yet you don't even know what PIF is.

796
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,960
I seriously doubt your
academic qualifications!

797
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,760
Of course, I know.

798
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,400
Since you know,

799
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,560
then I'll ask you not to shift the focus!

800
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,560
Dear directors,

801
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,280
with this authorization,

802
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,120
we'll become the very first domestic company
that can sell its products

803
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,640
through the major supply channels in Europe.

804
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,760
Chinese products will from now on
be sold in overseas markets.

805
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,800
Cheng Jie is making history!

806
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,320
Alright, guys,

807
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,600
we still need to talk about

808
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
replacing the General Manager.

809
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,280
Everybody, listen to me.

810
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,800
Since Heritage soap was first

811
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,960
put on the market 20 years ago,

812
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,240
we've been rejected by the European market

813
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,280
for several times.

814
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,760
And now, Mr. Yi has finally made this happen.

815
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,560
Why should we replace him?

816
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,560
But his recklessness

817
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,360
made our stock price suffer.

818
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,160
With such an inconsiderate leader,

819
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,440
how can the customers

820
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,040
trust our products?

821
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,560
Even with the PIF Authorization,
they still wouldn't let you go.

822
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,560
Seems like they won't change their minds.
What should we do?

823
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,920
Doctor Hao?

824
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,040
Director Xie.

825
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,920
What brought you here?

826
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,520
Gentlemen,

827
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,680
I'm here today as

828
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,920
Advisor to the World Health Organization.

829
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,600
I've accepted Mr. Wang's invitation,

830
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,720
and I'm willing to represent
the Heritage series.

831
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,080
Wish us a successful cooperation.

832
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,840
Thank you, Doctor Hao.

833
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,720
To be honest,

834
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,480
rarely do I meet a leader

835
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,400
as passionate and determined as Mr. Wang.

836
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,440
So,

837
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,520
I would say I have faith

838
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,160
in the Heritage series

839
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,280
because I trust Wang Xiyi.

840
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,600
With Doctor Hao as the spokesman,

841
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,560
I would like to give Mr. Yi another chance!

842
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:27,640
What about you guys?

843
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,880
No worry. Your husband is safe now!

844
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,960
Next time, unless you are in labor,

845
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,560
I won't forgive you

846
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,960
if something like today's
accident happens again.

847
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,840
Doctor Hao, thank you.

848
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,800
Doctor Hao.

849
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,320
Doctor Hao.

850
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,840
Thank you.

851
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,280
But why did you

852
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,760
suddenly decide to represent
the Heritage series?

853
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,400
You should

854
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,480
ask Jiaxin this question.

855
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,100
(Parent-child Classroom)

(Ninety-nine Things Fathers-to-be Must Know)

857
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,780
(Ninety-nine Things Fathers-to-be Must Know)

858
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,880
I've bought

859
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,080
the textbook for you.

860
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,800
You'll take the class together with me?

861
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,560
From now on, I'll try my best

862
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,760
to take every class with you

863
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,480
and accompany you to
the rest of your checkups.

864
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:49,920
Why?

865
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,480
Because you've helped me invite Doctor Hao.

866
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,760
So it's only fair that I take class with you.

867
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,640
Oh.

868
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,560
Let's get ready.

869
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,360
(Ninety-nine Things Fathers-to-be Must Know)

870
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,040
Because I can't let the mother of my child

871
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,360
go through this

872
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,120
and face everything alone.

873
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,880
Mr. Yi.

874
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,280
Mr. Yi.

875
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,040
Good news! Mr. Yi!

876
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,120
Mr. Yi.

877
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,360
Mr. Yi.

878
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,720
Mr. Yi.

879
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,360
Good news!

880
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,840
I told you...

881
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,920
Listen to me, Mr. Yi.

882
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,880
We are so in luck.

883
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,840
Look at this!

884
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,840
Take a look. You know what?

885
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,920
Based on the news report,
the content of plasticizer

886
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,720
in Haifei's products exceeds the standard.

887
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,640
Meanwhile,

888
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,480
all the products on the market

889
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,680
that copied theirs

890
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,160
misused dioxane and estrogen.

891
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,880
All the disqualified daily chemical products

892
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,680
have been taken off the market.

893
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,880
As a result, the market is
so out of stock now.

894
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,080
On the other hand, due to the PIF
we've just obtained,

895
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,360
all the supplier channels are trying

896
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,080
to order our products!

897
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,040
I've told you,

898
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,080
chance favors only the prepared mind.

899
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,720
According to the regulations of
the State Food and Drug Administration,

900
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,440
Haifei's products have all
been taken off the market

901
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,760
due to use of plasticizer,

902
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,400
which has severely impacted
almost all the suppliers

903
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,240
that worked with Haifei.

904
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,120
The safety issue of daily chemical products

905
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,040
has once again aroused
the attention of consumers.

906
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,440
After interviewing the consumers,
reporter has found

907
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,920
that when choosing daily chemical products,

908
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,040
people prefer high-quality

909
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,760
and safe Chinese products.

910
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,840
They also become more rational
towards advertising marketing.

911
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,200
Please stay tuned.

912
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,120
I thought working with Zhou Zhan

913
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,960
might open another path for us.

914
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,040
It turns out

915
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,880
it was dead-end.

916
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,080
The Heritage series, however,

917
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,320
rose from the ashes,

918
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,560
and became more and more popular.

919
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,080
The most unexpected thing is

920
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,680
that Jiaxin actually saved us

921
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,000
by stopping us from working with Zhou Zhan.

922
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,360
Whether it's medicine or tea,

923
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,720
timing is important when making them.

924
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,880
At my age,

925
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,120
I can't taste nothing anymore

926
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,440
but medicine and tea.

927
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,760
Didn't understand?

928
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,240
When you are my age,

929
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,720
you will.

930
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,720
Master,

931
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,080
I'm afraid I won't be able
to reach your spiritual level

932
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,560
even when I'm your age.

933
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,600
Spiritual level?

934
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,440
What spiritual level?

935
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,360
There are so many temptations

936
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,920
in this world.

937
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,680
Speaking of tea,

938
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,440
I think I've tasted all the top tea.

939
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,760
But, Master Zhongshan Long,

940
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,480
you only drink one type
of tea for several decades.

941
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,520
I don't think I can ever

942
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,440
have this kind of focus.

943
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,680
I picked this tea

944
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,360
together with her back then.

945
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,320
I guess what you are enjoying is not the tea,

946
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,280
but your memory.

947
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,640
Maybe.

948
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,200
How is she doing?

949
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,800
Grandma.

950
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,720
Heritage series is safe,

951
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,760
and has become very popular.

952
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,280
Really?

953
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,640
Really.

954
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,840
I've been applying for PIF for three years.

955
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,200
And now we've finally got it.

956
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,680
Doctor Hao also agreed to
represent the Heritage series.

957
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,960
Our products have been sold out.

958
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,480
That's great, Xiyi. You are so amazing.

959
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,840
Grandma!

960
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,400
Did you hear me?

961
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,960
We've succeeded!

962
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,240
What are you doing?

963
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,400
My mom has told me,

964
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,760
no matter it's the happiest

965
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,320
or saddest time,

966
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,040
you need to hug someone.

967
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,720
Otherwise,

968
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,120
happiness will become sadness,

969
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,920
and sadness will become worse.
