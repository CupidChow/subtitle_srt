=You Are My Destiny=

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,940
(Episode 13)

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,160
It's delicious.

29
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,400
Why are you making such a loud noise
when you're eating?

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,240
If I'm not making a noise, how could I
enjoy the good taste of the drumstick?

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
Is it necessary to eat it like this?

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,120
Did you starve to death
in your previous life?

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,360
You have been hungry for so many days.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
I think you are the person
who'd starve to death.

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,520
Be careful not to be choked.

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,240
You're going on a diet
to meet your ex-boyfriend.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Is it necessary?

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,880
Your blood sugar level drops
when you go on a diet.

39
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,400
Low blood sugar level
will cause endocrine disorders,

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,840
which will cause bad mood.

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm the one who bears
the brunt of your bad mood.

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,160
Why will I have to be the victim?

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,440
Have a drumstick.

44
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,520
Imagine it as your ex-boyfriend's arm.

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,360
You bite it

46
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,320
with all your force

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,720
to break the bone and slice the meat.

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,640
Imagine

49
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,040
your ex-boyfriend lying down before you,

50
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,800
with blood spurting out
of his mouth before he dies.

51
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,360
Then you won't feel guilty.

52
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,200
Stop tempting me!

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,440
Am I so easily tempted?

54
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,640
It's up to you. I'm gonna eat them.

55
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,680
I'll eat them in my room.

56
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,880
Having dessert after a meal is a real treat.

57
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,880
Bye-bye.

58
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,460
(Good morning)

59
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,160
Grandma.

60
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,120
Where is Jiaxin?

61
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,360
Early this morning,
Dylan picked her up for work.

62
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,040
They will have a meeting
with the Marketing Dept. today.

63
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,520
You had breakfast with Dylan?

64
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,600
Yes.

65
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,680
What about me?

66
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,560
Where are my sticky notes?

67
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,240
Where were you this morning?

68
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
Are you waiting for me?

69
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,040
What's up?

70
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,240
Oh, this. It's very important.

71
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,040
Is there anything wrong with the team work
building plan for the second half of this year?

72
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,840
You said that

73
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,960
you would make big decisions

74
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,640
while I would manage small matters.

75
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,640
Yes. There's nothing wrong.

76
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,120
I just want to tell you that

77
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,480
you can do it according to your idea.

78
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,120
We'll talk about it later.

79
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,600
Time for lunch.
We'll have a meeting in the afternoon.

80
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,400
Let's have lunch.

81
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,160
No. I've had lunch.

82
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,360
Don't worry.

83
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,160
My stomach

84
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,800
will never growl

85
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,200
in the middle of the meeting again.

86
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,560
This afternoon let's...

87
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,600
Hello.

88
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,400
Delta Health?

89
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,240
Yes.

90
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,880
I've received next week's class schedule.

91
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Okay, thanks.

92
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,000
Can you reschedule the class?

93
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,840
When I come back, I'll go to class with you.

94
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,360
Their classes repeat themselves
after some time, don't they?

95
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,080
This time we are gonna learn
how to touch new born baby in the water.

96
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
I want to learn it this time.

97
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,040
You alone?

98
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:32,920
Yes.

99
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
Don't worry. I will take care of Ximi.

100
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,640
You should take it easy and go to Europe.

101
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
If there's nothing else to do,
I'm gonna get off work.

102
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,480
When I am in Europe,

103
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,320
Jiaxin will attend the celebration dinner party
held by the Sales Dept. alone.

104
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,040
Will there be any problem?

105
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,680
No. You're too worried about that.

106
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,440
Even if the chairwoman doesn't go with her,

107
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,560
Dylan will be with her.

108
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,080
I gotta go.

109
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,560
I think grandma did it intentionally.
What do you think?

110
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,760
She knows that I'm going to
Europe not to work

111
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,640
but to find Anna.

112
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,080
So you mean

113
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,640
the chairwoman deliberately
asked Dylan to accompany Jiaxin

114
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,800
because she knew you'd be jealous of Dylan

115
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,040
and then not go to Europe.

116
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm not jealous.

117
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,760
I'm worried about Dylan.

118
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,560
He is so intimate with Jiaxin

119
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,080
that there'd be spreading rumors
throughout the company.

120
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,480
Yes. You're not jealous.

121
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,480
So bro.

122
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,480
Think about Anna who is far away in Europe.

123
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,200
How lonely she is in a foreign country!

124
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,840
Furthermore, with the rumor
being spread for some time,

125
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,640
it'd be easier for you
and Jiaxin to get divorced.

126
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,920
At that time,
even the chairwoman cannot stop you.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,360
I'm telling you, you'd better
get rid of this bad idea

128
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,840
from your mind.

129
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,680
Gross.

130
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,440
I gotta go.

131
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,480
Wait.

132
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
Jiaxin is going to class alone.

133
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,440
When she sees other people
are accompanied by someone

134
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
while she is alone.

135
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,720
Will she be sad?

136
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,200
And will my aunt

137
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,360
be hard on her by asking her
to do a lot of housework

138
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,920
when I'm not around?

139
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,800
And will those

140
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,680
who think Jiaxin has
no knowledge of management

141
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,840
take advantage of her

142
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,640
when I'm not around?

143
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,720
No. I think you are now

144
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,000
trying to persuade yourself to stay here.

145
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,960
Are you questioning my love for Anna?

146
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,720
Hey bro.

147
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,440
To tell you the truth,

148
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,160
if

149
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,040
you miss the plane to Europe this time,

150
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,360
you'd find

151
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
less and less common ground
between you and Anna.

152
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,240
If you choose to stay here,

153
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
accompany Jiaxin to attend the nursery class

154
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,280
and eat lunch made by her,

155
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,080
you'd find

156
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,760
more and more common ground
between you and Jiaxin.

157
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,720
Is it what you want?

158
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,040
If so, you don't need to
consider my suggestion.

159
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,560
One more thing. It's the most important.

160
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
It's not working hours now.
But I've stayed here for forty minutes.

161
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,440
If there's nothing else to do, can I leave?

162
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,320
Yes, you can.

163
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,840
Bye.

164
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,200
This time I go to Europe,

165
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,120
I must tell everything to Anna in person.

166
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,200
But will she

167
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,320
forgive me?

168
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,360
Why don't you two talk to each other？

169
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,280
It doesn't matter.

170
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,680
Even if we break up, we can still be friends.

171
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,880
Right?

172
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,960
Look. Who's the person over there?

173
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
She is Liu Siqi, isn't she?

174
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,800
Yes, she is.

175
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,520
Yes, she is. Long time no see.

176
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,840
Since my graduation,

177
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,960
I've excluded love, sex and fun from my life.

178
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,280
I've been used to hardship and loneliness.

179
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,080
I did that just for this moment

180
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,920
when everyone
at the class reunion surrounds me,

181
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,160
admires me, talks about me
and is jealous of me.

182
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,560
Then I would say:" It's no big deal.

183
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,080
If you try to do it you can also make it."

184
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,240
It'd be so great.

185
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,400
Your child is going to primary school.

186
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
I admire you for having such a good son.

187
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,920
What about your daughter?

188
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
My daughter took part in
the piano contest several days ago.

189
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,160
And she got the second place.

190
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,440
Really? That's great.

191
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,960
But after we came back home, my husband
blamed us for not getting the first.

192
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,360
Did my husband expect
too much of my daughter?

193
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
Your husband blamed you?

194
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,400
Yes.

195
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,640
My husband never blames me.

196
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,920
He is so good that he even doesn't
let me do anything at home.

197
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,160
Hello. Darling.

198
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,360
I'm at the class reunion.

199
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,680
You're gonna pick me up when it's over?

200
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,000
I'll send the address to you.

201
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,800
Okay.

202
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,880
I love you.

203
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,360
Okay. Bye.

204
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,560
How happy you are!

205
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,400
Siqi.

206
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,880
Long time no see.

207
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,880
It seems

208
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,600
you are still single.

209
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,240
I've some good news for you.

210
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,040
Next month, I will become a father.

211
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,840
You'd better hurry up and not lag behind us.

212
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,960
Yes. Siqi. Why are you still single?

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,960
Yes. Why aren't you married yet?

214
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,080
I'm not married and have no child.

215
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,080
But does that mean lagging behind you?

216
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,280
How many of you here have more money
in your bank account than I do?

217
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
How many of you get
promoted faster than I do?

218
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,160
See.

219
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,320
She is still what she used to be.

220
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,560
When we broke up, I said that

221
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,360
you were too desperate to prove that

222
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,640
you are better than men.

223
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,320
No man will marry a girl like you.

224
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,040
See.

225
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,040
That makes sense.

226
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,360
Weng Jiaming. It's a pity that

227
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,480
my boyfriend is a leader of a company.

228
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,240
And he really loves me.

229
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,920
That's great. She's good.

230
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,040
Liu Siqi, why are you so stupid?

231
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,760
Just a couple of questions

232
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,600
could easily freak you out.

233
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,200
You didn't get married in three years.

234
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,760
He's not willing to marry you, is he?

235
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,920
He proposed to me a long time ago.

236
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,240
Siqi.

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,400
I know you're a good talker.

238
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,760
But even so,

239
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
you still cannot

240
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,640
palm off falsehood as truth.

241
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,120
Right?

242
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,240
Yes. She cannot turn falsehood into truth.

243
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,560
I'll ask him to come.

244
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,880
This is even more humiliating
than being found guilty of perjury.

245
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,600
Liu Siqi.

246
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,920
You can make it.

247
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,280
Calm down.

248
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,320
Believe yourself.

249
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,360
But where can I find myself a boyfriend?

250
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,680
Liu Siqi. Excellent employee of the year.

251
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,840
You put a trophy

252
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,280
at such an outstanding place.

253
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,040
Who do you want to show it to?

254
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,600
Oh my Gosh.

255
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,160
Oh my Gosh. This is cherished by her.

256
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,800
Will she file a lawsuit against me

257
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,360
and make me compensate
for this stupid trophy with all my money?

258
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,880
I can just tell them that my boyfriend
is working overtime on a business trip

259
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,880
or has just got a car accident.

260
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,440
But that doesn't make sense.

261
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,400
Liu Siqi.

262
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,040
Why did you come to
this stupid class reunion?

263
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,000
It's no good.

264
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,440
It broke into so many pieces.

265
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,680
It's from that jerk.

266
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,120
What's up?

267
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,320
Don't beat around the bush.
Just tell me what you want.

268
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,400
The pipe in your house broke into pieces.

269
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,680
No. The pipe is leaking.

270
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,160
And

271
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
the water is all over the floor.
It's very dirty and smelly here.

272
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,880
Don't come back tonight.

273
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,880
Wait. I've no money to pay for the lunch.

274
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,160
Could you come and pay for me?

275
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,080
You can pay the money with your mobile phone.
I've business to do here.

276
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,520
I can't pay it with my mobile because
I didn't bind my phone to the bank account.

277
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
But how did you order takeout on your mobile?

278
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,920
Can you stop nagging like a woman?

279
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,000
Do as I told you. Come here!

280
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,920
If you don't come,

281
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,040
I'd not only sing songs when having a shower,

282
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,840
but I'd sing songs at anytime and anyplace.

283
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,360
I'd sing songs with a microphone at midnight.

284
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,880
Okay, I'm coming.

285
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,720
But I go to help you not
because I'm afraid of you

286
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,320
but I'm afraid of your terrible songs.

287
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,200
Wait.

288
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,000
What's up?

289
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,440
You'd better wash your hair
and dress fashionably before you come.

290
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,080
Why do you want me to dress fashionably

291
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,440
when I'm just gonna pay the money for you?

292
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,200
Just wait for me.

293
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,040
Just do what I told you to.

294
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,920
Bye.

295
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,280
Darling.

296
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,880
Finally you come.

297
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,600
Tell me what to do.
I'm feeling a chill on my back.

298
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,640
No matter what they say,

299
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,000
you just nod and smile. Okay?

300
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,080
Who are they?
Why will I have to nod and smile?

301
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Just do as I told you. Come on!

302
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,800
Are you Liu Siqi's boyfriend?

303
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,640
Are you the guy who proposed marriage
eight times and got rejected?

304
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,720
Darling, I didn't want to tell them.

305
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,160
But they didn't believe
that I have a boyfriend.

306
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,960
Darling, you should've told me this earlier.

307
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
Turns out you just want to

308
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,360
make everyone witness the love between us.

309
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,360
No problem. Darling.

310
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,480
Excuse me.

311
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,560
Did Siqi tell you

312
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,000
that I am Weng Jiaming?

313
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,840
I'm her ex-boyfriend.

314
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:56,920
What?

315
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:57,800
Oh.

316
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,520
Oh.

317
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,040
Yes. I remember that

318
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,640
you are not a very good man.

319
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,000
Right?

320
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,040
I feel it strange that

321
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,720
Siqi should fall in love

322
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,040
with a man like you.

323
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,440
I didn't love him.

324
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,800
Baby, you think I don't know?

325
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,280
You have done skincare three times

326
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,720
for this class reunion.

327
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,520
You have bought many clothes
and been on a diet for so long

328
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,000
just to see this man.

329
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,360
Today I meet this guy.

330
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,480
I think it's a waste of money to do so.

331
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,440
It's a real waste of money.

332
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,600
Even if you come here without wearing makeup,

333
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,800
you'd impress him.

334
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,200
Why bother doing this?

335
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,640
Hey, bro.

336
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,600
I think you don't know

337
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,880
what the girl of our
law department really looks like.

338
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,920
What does she really look like?

339
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
Do you mean that

340
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,000
she has a bad temper
and pinches pennies in daily life?

341
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,720
Or do you mean she is a poor singer
and likes singing when having a bath?

342
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,960
It's no big deal.

343
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,760
I have even seen her after she removes
her makeup and applies facial mask.

344
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,520
It's no big deal.

345
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,480
Liu Siqi.

346
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,920
Can you two stop pretending to be a couple?

347
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,280
When

348
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,640
we broke up,

349
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,200
you held my leg in the rain

350
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,280
and painfully begged me not to leave.

351
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm sorry. I dumped you.

352
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,800
But it happened a long time ago.

353
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,080
I will be a father soon.
But you still haven't gotten over it.

354
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,280
You found a man
who seemed to come from nowhere

355
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,160
to be your boyfriend.

356
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,720
If exposed, you'd make
a real fool of yourself.

357
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,840
Weng Jiaming.

358
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,960
Look at it clearly with your big eyes.

359
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,520
I'm the special assistant
to the general manager of Cheng Jie Group.

360
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
But who are you?

361
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,760
And

362
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,760
I'm in love with Siqi. We have fun.

363
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,720
You don't have the right to interfere.

364
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,080
That's enough. You're the pretend boyfriend
who is a special assistant.

365
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,360
I've been down this road before.

366
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,440
Judging from the way
you were complaining to her,

367
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,800
you're not a man
who loves his girlfriend dearly.

368
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,920
I'm telling you,

369
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,200
I'm trying to save your face
in front of everyone

370
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,560
for Siqi's sake.

371
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,440
If you dare to say anything bad about her,

372
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,720
try it.

373
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,840
This one is what he likes.

374
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,680
It doesn't need ironing.

375
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,000
Hello, mom.

376
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,160
How is it going lately? Is Ximi fine?

377
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,760
Ximi is fine.

378
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,520
What about you and sister?

379
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,360
Your sister is fine.

380
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,360
But I'm not fine.

381
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,320
Jincai and Tiancai

382
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,520
go to work every day.

383
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,000
So Zishan gets exhausted

384
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,560
because she has to look after her child
and be in charge of the boarding house.

385
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,120
I suggested looking after the child for her.

386
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,600
I didn't realize that it's so exhausting
to look after a child nowadays.

387
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,360
I have to sterilize milk bottles

388
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,560
seven or eight times a day.

389
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,440
It almost tires me out.

390
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,760
Well.

391
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,600
I am gonna take a leave tomorrow to see her.

392
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,640
Be careful not to get too tired.

393
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,720
You'd better not go to see her.

394
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,760
She is not very well.

395
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,720
And she wants to be alone.

396
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,600
Okay.

397
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,160
You should be careful.

398
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,360
Okay. You'd better take care of yourself.

399
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,520
I'm going to sleep.

400
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,880
Okay. Mom. Goodnight.

401
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,480
Night.

402
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,240
What's up?

403
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,040
Nothing.

404
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,480
Have you taken the tonics grandma bought you?

405
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,240
I'm so busy that I always forget to take it.

406
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,320
Will I have to take all of these?

407
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,040
Pick one.

408
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,560
There's still some left.

409
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,200
Thanks.

410
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,960
I've picked some clothes for you.

411
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,640
You can pack them up yourself.

412
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,080
Okay.

413
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,160
You're going to Europe tomorrow.

414
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,240
Are you looking forward to it?

415
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,640
Definitely.

416
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,280
Because I can see Anna

417
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,240
and her performance on the stage.

418
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm definitely looking forward to it.

419
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,320
It's good.

420
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,240
It's so good.

421
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,320

shall we go and find
a fancy place to have dinner?

459
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,960
Jiaxin, let's go.

460
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,040
Just a minute.

461
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,880
Have a look at this. What about this one?

462
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,080
Jiaxin!

463
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,440
What's wrong?

464
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,920
Hello. I'm at the airport.

465
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,680
Okay.

466
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,760
Tomorrow I'll ask for a leave.

467
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,840
I'll pick you up by car.

468
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,320
After that, I have a whole day

469
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
to be with you.

470
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,640
This time don't complain to me about
not putting you on the list of priorities.

471
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,160
See you.

472
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,160
Mr. Yi.

473
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,200
Hello. Anson.

474
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,960
Jiaxin doesn't look well today.

475
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,600
You'd better cancel her meeting.

476
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,560
She passed out in the company today.

477
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,320
What?

478
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,480
We just got her out of the ER.

479
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,600
She had a blood test.

480
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,840
And we are on our way to the ward.

481
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,840
I'm not clear about what really happened.

482
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,280
I think I have to go back.

483
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,520
No.

484
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,280
Aren't you going to Europe?

485
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,240
I'm here.

486
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,160
You should know that

487
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,320
this opportunity was not easy for you to get.

488
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,640
Aren't you afraid
you'd make Anna worry about you?

489
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,040
She's been waiting for you.

490
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,480
Where is the family?

491
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,960
Where is Chen Jiaxin's family?
Come and check in.

492
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,760
I'm gonna hang up the phone. I gotta go.

493
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,480
I'm here. I'm coming.

494
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,720
Hello? Hello?

495
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,360
Thanks. Congratulations!

496
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,080
Congratulations!

497
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,480
Mr. Wang.

498
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,440
Hello, Mr. Wang.

499
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,840
Let's celebrate my son Jia Fang's birth.

500
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,400
Thanks.

501
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,400
Jia Tiancai.
Why did you name your son Jia Fang?

502
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,960
Because Jia Fang's pronunciation
is the same as "Party A" in Chinese.

503
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,200
Workers like us are Party B.

504
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,400
So I just hope that my son
will become a boss in the future

505
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
and he won't take orders from others.

506
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,120
Bosses at different places
are not all the same.

507
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,600
For example, I'm working
with Cheng Jie Group.

508
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,720
Mr. Wang.

509
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,440
You've done a really good job.

510
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,040
You can surely be my son's role model.

511
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,680
You've done a good job managing our factory,

512
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,160
right?

513
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Yes.

514
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,120
Please take these red eggs
to the general manager,

515
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,080
the chairwoman as well as Jiaxin.

516
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,160
Okay.

517
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,800
Mr. Wang.

518
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,240
When can we get your wedding sweets?

519
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,360
Eh...

520
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,440
I'll try my best and hurry up.

521
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,800
Come on!

522
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,080
Take more.

523
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,680
Let's eat it together and share the joy.

524
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,480
Have one please.

525
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,080
OK.

526
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,320
Jiaxin. Jiaxin.

527
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,360
Grandma.

528
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,520
Where am I?

529
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,280
You're in the hospital.

530
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,800
She's coming round.
We can get her out of hospital.

531
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,040
The doctor said that
you should pay attention to your diet.

532
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,080
I'll buy you a big steak.

533
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,000
You can get enough protein from it.

534
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Seeing you unconscious,

535
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,680
your grandma got so worried
that she almost fainted.

536
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,960
Grandma, don't worry. I'm fine.

537
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,560
I almost forgot that I have
a parenting class to attend today.

538
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,040
Oh.

539
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,760
You're sick now.
You cannot attend the parenting class.

540
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,720
Give me the phone.
Let me ask for a leave for you.

541
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,280
Grandma.

542
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Today's class is very important.

543
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,080
I have to go.

544
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,200
But...

545
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,080
Grandma, let me accompany
Jiaxin to the class.

546
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,120
I'll take good care of her.

547
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,480
Babies of zero to three months old
have feet in the shape of frogs.

548
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,480
Their feet can't be wrapped too tightly,

549
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,960
so as not to affect the baby's hip growth.

550
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,280
Wrap it like this.

551
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,040
I'm done.

552
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,120
Good job.

553
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,840
This father is so great.

554
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,480
Miss, he is not...

555
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,160
It doesn't matter.

556
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,440
Excuse me.

557
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,320
I'm the father.

558
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,560
Now I'm here. You can leave.

559
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,040
Xiyi, haven't you gone to Paris?

560
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
There was something wrong with the ticket.

561
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,360
Let's have class. Please teach me
how to do the wrapping.

562
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,120
Okay.

563
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,200
This foot can't be wrapped too tightly.

564
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,320
Yes. There you go.

565
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,720
Yes.

566
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,040
Jiaxin, since your husband is here,

567
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,600
I've completed my part of the job.

568
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,640
I gotta go.

569
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,720
Thank you.

570
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,880
Jiaxin.

571
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,560
He is very attentive to the baby.

572
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,720
Hey.

573
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,960
Who gave you the right
to talk to my wife like that?

574
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,840
Gotta go.

575
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,800
Don't worry about that.

576
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,720
He just wanted to say...

577
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,240
I don't care what he wanted to say.

578
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,480
He disturbed me
when I was tucking the baby in.

579
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,880
He disturbed me!

580
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,480
I know you are on the plane.

581
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,680
More than ten hours later,

582
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,360
you can receive my WeChat messages.

583
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,160
But the more I know we will meet each other,

584
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,640
the more slowly the time seems to pass.

585
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,280
I'm missing you.

586
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,080
I didn't get on the plane.

587
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,800
Sorry.

588
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,840
Why?

589
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,440
Because...

590
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,960
Well.

591
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
I don't want to know

592
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,320
what's more important than me in your mind.

593
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,360
Anna...

594
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,360
Don't mention her.

595
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:15,920
Chen Jiaxin.

596
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,600
Listen to me.

597
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,760
I'll do whatever I should do for you.

598
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,120
But this year.

599
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,800
Only this year.

600
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,240
I know.

601
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,840
Has the pig liver been blanched in the water?

602
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:50,720
Yes.

603
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,720
When the cubilose is ready,

604
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,320
simmer it on a low heat.

605
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,520
The temperature is too high. Turn it down.

606
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,600
She never steps into the kitchen.

607
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,920
But now for her grandson's wife,
she's acting like a supervisor.

608
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
She didn't treat me like this
when I was pregnant.

609
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Is she really my mother?

610
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,320
Okay.

611
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,080
You should take your time

612
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,720
and cook for Jiaxin

613
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,480
the dishes that I put marks on.

614
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,680
What?

615
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,080
But

616
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,680
there're so many.

617
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,320
She has already had some of them.

618
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,760
Mom. I don't want to complain.

619
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,120
But could you ask Jiaxin
not to go to the company?

620
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,320
Could you ask her to sleep at home?

621
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,960
That is very important to a pregnant woman,

622
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,960
isn't it?

623
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,120
Don't get me started.

624
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,320
Do you remember the time
when you were pregnant?

625
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,880
You were lying on the bed
and sleeping your days away.

626
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,920
What was the result?

627
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,680
Zhengren grew so big that
you almost got a difficult labor.

628
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,200
Mom. I don't want to complain.

629
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,920
But when I was pregnant,

630
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,080
did you care about me like this?

631
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,680
I was also a pregnant woman,
but why had I been treated so differently?

632
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,120
Humans are born different.

633
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,080
You're too lazy

634
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,640
while Jiaxin is too hardworking.

635
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,600
In order to let Xiyi and her
have more interaction,

636
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,320
I asked her to do too much work

637
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,840
and forgot to let her rest.

638
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,360
Remember what I said?

639
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,440
I said

640
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,360
you should

641
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,440
make Jiaxin happy.

642
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,960
She likes art, doesn't she?

643
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,280
You should let her

644
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,720
accompany you to art exhibitions

645
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,920
and concerts.

646
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,920
Or you can make pottery.

647
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:31,880
Those activities

648
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,040
are good for the unborn child.

649
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,320
Furthermore,

650
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,440
don't let Wang Xiyi

651
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,640
handle the business of the company.

652
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,040
Don't put too much pressure on him.

653
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,600
Let Zhengren

654
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,360
share the burden for you.

655
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:43,960
Okay?

656
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,720
It's a good advice.

657
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,840
I'll take your advice.

658
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,160
You're so good.

659
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,080
Sorry.

660
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,760
I didn't make it to watch your performance.

661
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,920
Why?

662
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,720
So many things have happened lately.

663
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,440
I know.

664
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,480
Anson has told me everything.

665
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,080
Okay.

666
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,840
How are things going in the company?

667
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
Are you okay?

668
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,760
I have asked for a leave

669
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,880
and made all the arrangements for your visit.

670
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,120
But you're telling me you cannot come.

671
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,440
Do you know that I've complained
to you numerous times in my heart?

672
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,640
I've thought of different reasons
why you didn't come.

673
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
I'm afraid that you would tell me

674
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,840
you didn't come because of someone else.

675
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,720
I'm sorry.

676
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,320
You stood me up today,

677
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,640
which makes me realize how cruel and selfish

678
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,640
I used to be.

679
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,280
I always make you wait for me.

680
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
My dear, Xiyi.

681
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,560
I'm sorry.

682
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,920
I'll never stand you up anymore.

683
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,480
And I beg you

684
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,200
not to let me wait alone.

685
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,120
Okay?

686
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,880
I'm sorry.

687
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,280
Anyway, it's my fault this time.

688
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,760
And thank you for understanding me.

689
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,400
That means

690
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,200
we have made it up.

691
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,560
The performance will be over in a few days.

692
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,920
And your birthday is close.

693
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,120
I'm gonna ask for a leave to go back

694
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,080
and celebrate your birthday. Is that okay?

695
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,560
Okay.

696
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:02,960
Anna.

697
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:03,880
Yes.

698
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,880
I have something to tell you

699
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,800
when you are back.

700
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:11,920
Okay.

701
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,720
I'm gonna have a rehearsal.

702
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,480
Good night.

704

711
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,600
Think about Anna who is far away in Europe.

712
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,880
How lonely she is in a foreign country!

713
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,680
Aren't you afraid
you'd make Anna worry about you?

714
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,040
She's been waiting for you.

00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,440
I used to wait for Anna.

720
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,920
It never occurred to me that

721
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,840
one day she would be waiting for me.

722
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,920
And I cannot go to see her.

723
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,160
What's wrong with me?

724
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,440
I'm coming.

725
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,160
Sorry, I got the wrong address.

726
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,160
I'm sorry.

727
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,640
Who was it?

728
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,040
What are you doing?

729
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,680
Since the day you kissed me,

730
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,440
I feel like gargling

731
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,920
whenever I see you.

732
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,720
It's post-traumatic stress disorder.

733
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I don't want to be like this.

734
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,920
Even if you want to
become a werewolf after you see me,

735
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,120
I won't care.

736
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,960
But I'm telling you,

737
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,760
if I hadn't kissed you that day...

738
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
Don't say that word.

739
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,360
That day if I hadn't...

740
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
...like that,

741
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,120
you would've lost all your dignity
at the class reunion.

742
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,440
You even want to...

743
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,440
Who on earth was it at the door just now?

744
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,760
It was just a middle aged woman
who got the wrong address.

745
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,720
Is she about this tall?

746
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,480
Was she wearing a colored shirt,
black pants and a necklace?

747
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:55,840
Yes.

748
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,960
How do you know that?

749
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,040
If she knocks the door again,

750
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,800
don't say no whatever she asks.

751
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,720
Don't say no whatever she asks.

752
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,240
Okay?

753
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,960
That sounds familiar.

754
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,960
It's her again.

755
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,320
Don't say no.

756
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:14,760
Oh.

757
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,080
It's you, Dazhu.

758
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,240
The doors around here look like the same.

759
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,320
I got the wrong address just now.

760
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,880
When are you going back
to have a blind date with Wang Jiafei?

761
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,480
Eh...

762
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,960
It's you. Why are you...

763
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,320
Turns out I didn't get
the wrong address just now.

764
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,640
So you two are...

765
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,200
Just like what you're thinking.

766
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
So ask Wang Jiafei not to think
about me anymore. Okay?

767
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,000
Okay.

768
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,280
This girl is much more
beautiful than Wang Jiafei.

769
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,640
But.

770
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,880
Since you are wearing the same clothes,

771
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,680
have you done this already?

772
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,080
Ma'am.

773
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,680
Yes. Yes. Yes.

774
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,440
Just like what you're thinking,

775
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,760
we have done it.

776
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,040
I forgot to make the introduction.

777
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,520
This is my mom.

778
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,040
She is not an outsider.
So it doesn't matter if we let her know.

779
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,520
Okay?

780
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,240
And this is Qiqi.

781
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,960
Qiqi?

782
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,120
Yes. Yes.

783
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,080
Please. Please. Help me out.

784
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,600
Every dog has its day.

785
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,440
Now you're at my mercy.

786
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,720
Ma'am.

787
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,840
Actually I wanted to see you a long time ago.

788
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,640
It's all Anson's fault.

789
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,480
I am Liu Siqi.

790
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,160
I graduated from East China University
of Political Science and Law.

791
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,480
I'm a lawyer.

792
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,920
My hobbies are cooking,

793
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,560
cleaning,

794
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,640
doing housework,

795
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,720
mopping floor

796
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,480
and doing what Anson
is interested in with him.

797
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,400
As a matter of fact,

798
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,200
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

799
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,560
But Anson

800
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,280
doesn't think I'm a good girl.

801
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,280
So...

802
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,440
Dazhu.

803
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,160
I'm gonna blame you.

804
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,360
She is such a loving girl.

805
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,680
You should be compliant with her.

806
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,440
Okay, I will.

807
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,000
Qiqi.

808
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,640
I'm gonna add you as my WeChat contact.

809
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,360
You can turn to me if you need any help.

810
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,600
I can teach you

811
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,440
many ways to keep him under your control.

812
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,920
I promise he will be at your beck and call

813
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,880
and he cannot trick you anymore.

814
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,360
Okay.

815
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,600
I'm eager to learn Sensen's secrets.

816
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,440
Sensen, are you okay?
Why are you coughing suddenly?

817
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,440
Shall I boil some water chestnut
to relieve your internal heat?

818
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,720
Are you and my mom ganging up on me?

819
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,240
