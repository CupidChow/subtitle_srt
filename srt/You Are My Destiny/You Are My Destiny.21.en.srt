25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,880
(Episode 21)

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,420
Hello, Dylan.

27
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,100
I have something to tell you.

28
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,940
My eldest apprentice

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,420
is getting married.

30
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,100
He is starting his own shop.

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,900
I'm sort of worried.

32
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,140
What?

33
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,220
Zhiyuan is getting married?

34
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,260
Congratulations to him.

35
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,060
I'll give him a generous cash gift.

36
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,100
It's a good thing for him.

37
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,780
But I'm in trouble.

38
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,140
Well,

39
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,780
I don't understand.

40
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,420
Do you think

41
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,340
I need to

42
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,380
take on another apprentice

43
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,500
to replace him?

44
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,740
If I don't,

45
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,340
I'd be understaffed.

46
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,980
If I do,

47
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,180
where can I find this person?

48
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,580
It's a big problem.

49
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,540
Fine,

50
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,740
I'll think about this

51
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,020
for you,

52
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,380
alright?

53
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,180
Okay,

54
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,620
I got to go.

55
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,780
It seems you come here in a hurry.

56
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,940
What brings you here today?

57
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,700
Ask me to keep distance from your wife?

58
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,180
Or,

59
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,900
ask me about your wife's

60
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,940
untold feelings?

61
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,380
I'm here

62
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,260
to buy a birthday gift for my grandma.

63
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,260
I've found Jiaxin's

64
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,340
wish card.

65
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,860
Good for you.

66
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,020
From now on,

67
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,340
I'll help Jiaxin

68
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,380
realize her dream.

69
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,580
I don't want an outsider

70
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,980
to meddle in my family affair.

71
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,420
Jiaxin spent her birthday with me

72
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,140
because you chose another girl

73
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,220
over her.

74
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,580
That's something I'll never do.

75
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,140
Jiaxin always comes first for me.

76
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,660
Besides,

77
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,980
it seems you feel too good about yourself.

78
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,820
Perhaps what Jiaxin and you had went through

79
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,940
is not that special.

80
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,300
We have wedding certificate.

81
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,100
You got me on that one.

82
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,540
I'd like you to keep a distance

83
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,660
from my wife.

84
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,020
No problem.

85
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,140
But mind you,

86
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,540
though you entered her
life earlier than I did,

87
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,940
the heart wants what it wants.

88
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,140
I've been helping you

89
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,420
because Jiaxin loves you.

90
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,100
I want her to be happy.

91
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,980
If you ever hurt her,

92
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,700
don't blame me for being rude to you.

93
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,820
Rest assured.

94
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,740
That will never happen.

95
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,540
Okay.

96
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,340
I hope you can keep your word.

97
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,420
You have to understand

98
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,380
your condition is very serious.

99
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,820
If you decide to leave the hospital

100
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,540
before the end of your recovery period,

101
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,860
you might jeopardize your health

102
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,220
and even your whole life.

103
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,180
You have to think it twice.

104
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,620
I will definitely regret it for my whole life

105
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,380
if I don't leave now.

106
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,460
Finally, I'm home.

107
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,100
Mom, what are you doing?

108
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,620
It seems

109
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,620
you're devoured by the massage chair.

110
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,300
I'd like that.

111
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,380
It feels so good.

112
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
Last night,

113
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,700
I lied here all night

114
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,100
covered by a blanket.

115
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,580
I wouldn't get off.

116
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,900
Have a peach.

117
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,420
I'm good.

118
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,060
Alright.

119
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,860
Well,

120
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,260
get off now.

121
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,140
Let's try on the jewelry and clothes.

122
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,260
I've prepared everything.

123
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,700
Let me enjoy the massage a little longer.

124
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,500
My whole life,

125
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,940
I wouldn't spend money on body massage.

126
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,860
Finally, I got the chance
to get myself relaxed.

127
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,220
Just let me.

128
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,940
Okay.

129
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,060
I made dishes

130
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,100
of braised duck feet and chicken gizzards.

131
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,940
Bring it to my son-in-law.

132
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,620
Okay.

133
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,980
Hello, Xiyi.

134
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,820
My mom made some delicious dishes for you.

135
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,460
I'm here to give it to you.

136
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,020
I'm downstairs.

137
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,140
I'll be right there.

138
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,060
Jia...

139
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,460
Xiyi!

140
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,420
Do you miss me?

141
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,460
Is it a surprise for you?

142
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,140
Look at me.

143
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,260
What are you looking at?

144
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,020
What brings you here?

145
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,620
Let's get married.

146
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,540
I used to think

147
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,940
the fact that I've spent
so many days with Xiyi

148
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,820
will give me confidence
to tell Anna everything

149
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,740
when she is back.

150
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,620
But now, why do I still
want to become invisible?

151
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,740
Why do I still want to flee?

152
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,780
Anna.

153
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,380
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,580
I can't marry you.

155
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,020
Jiaxin,

156
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,500
are you alright?

157
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,700
Actually,

158
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,540
I saw what happened there.

159
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,460
To be honest,

160
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,620
they've been together for so long.

161
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,260
Even if Mr. Yi decides to leave her,

162
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,020
he needs some time to explain.

163
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,940
Right?

164
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,140
He needs time

165
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,460
to think of a way

166
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,820
to make it least hurtful for Anna.

167
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,460
But you can be sure about one thing.

168
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,780
I know him well.

169
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,980
Once the decision is made,

170
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,220
he'll stick to it.

171
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,380
So,

172
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,460
don't be upset.

173
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,260
I mean it.

174
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,180
I understand what you said.

175
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,300
But

176
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,940
all my faith collapsed

177
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,380
the moment

178
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,740
I saw Anna

179
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,780
run into Xiyi's arms.

180
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,540
I was so naïve.

181
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,180
Things are complicated

182
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,140
when it comes to relationship.

183
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,580
That's right.

184
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,380
Things are complicated.

185
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,420
But it has to be cleared up.

186
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,340
Judged by the current situation,

187
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,620
you might want to believe him.

188
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,220
Anna

189
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,020
is my biggest concern.

190
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,500
In the whole thing,

191
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,820
I'm the worst person.

192
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm hurting someone

193
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,340
in the pursuit of my happiness.

194
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,900
She helped me

195
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,340
back on the ship.

196
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,420
She is a nice girl.

197
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,500
But I'm taking away her happiness.

198
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,660
Jiaxin,

199
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,660
you don't have to blame yourself.

200
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,420
We all can see

201
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,500
Mr. Yi is much happier

202
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,940
when he is with you.

203
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,740
Do you think

204
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,180
he should give up his own happiness

205
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,580
for Anna's sake?

206
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,780
Isn't it unfair

207
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,260
for him?

208
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,900
I'm glad

209
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,940
that you told me

210
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,020
what happened these days.

211
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,700
I'm so touched.

212
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,060
Thank you.

213
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,700
I have to say

214
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,820
that it makes me sad.

215
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,820
But things are not that complicated.

216
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,220
I did some research.

217
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,180
You divorce her

218
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,140
and we get married,

219
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,300
then I can adopt the baby.

220
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,300
I'll tell people

221
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,540
that the baby is mine.

222
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,420
No one will know

223
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,380
the disgraceful part of our marriage.

224
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
I'll do my best

225
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,060
to take care of this baby.

226
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,060
When he is of age,

227
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,620
I'll tell him

228
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,780
everything.

229
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,980
I'll let him choose

230
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,620
to meet his natural mother or not.

231
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,380
As for that woman, we can...

232
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,380
Her name is Chen Jiaxin.

233
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,380
Our baby's name is Ximi.

234
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,100
What happened between us

235
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,740
is not a disaster,

236
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,780
nor something to be frowned upon.

237
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,740
Since when

238
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,860
I'm not a part of

239
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,180
"we"?

240
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,460
Have you really thought for us?

241
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,380
I'm the one who always believed in you.

242
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,780
I'm the one who always waited for you.

243
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,620
I'm the one who was abandoned
back on that ship.

244
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,020
Anna,

245
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,340
you love yourself

246
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,260
the most.

247
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,700
I'm a normal person.

248
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,340
I can choose not to be hurt.

249
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,900
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,780
Have you ever thought

251
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,860
why you haven't seen

252
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,660
or heard from me

253
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,940
ever since your birthday?

254
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,140
You must have your reason.

255
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,020
But I don't want to know.

256
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,500
No.

257
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,740
You have to hear me out.

258
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,420
Before the finale,

259
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,060
I got injured

260
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,380
and was sent to hospital.

261
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,540
I had concussion

262
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,420
and missed the grand finale.

263
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,180
I lied in bed over a week before
I could get out of bed.

264
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,540
I couldn't focus and fell to the
ground during the rehearsal

265
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,300
because I saw this photo.

266
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,880
("The Most Beautiful Photo" competition
has announced the winner.)

267
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,400
("The Most Beautiful Photo" competition
has announced the winner.)

268
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,860
Zimo has told me about you two long ago.

269
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,860
I was laughing at it

270
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,700
till she sent me this photo.

271
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,020
It was appended to the advertisement

272
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,420
of a shopping mall.

273
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,660
I was the last one in the world

274
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,300
who knew about it.

275
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,140
I was sad.

276
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,100
I was upset.

277
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,940
But I kept silent.

278
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,900
I kept it to myself.

279
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,660
Because I was lying to myself.

280
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,300
I was hoping that you'd tell me

281
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,100
that everything is a mistake,

282
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,540
and that you still love me the most.

283
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,140
However,

284
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,620
you admitted it

285
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,260
and left me callously.

286
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,060
Say something, please.

287
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,620
If you're really that callous,

288
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,460
if you really don't care for me anymore,

289
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,340
look into my eyes

290
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,700
and say it.

291
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,120
("The Most Beautiful Photo" competition
has announced the winner.)

292
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,380
I'm sorry, Anna.

293
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,980
I don't think it's gonna happen.

294
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,980
I can change myself for you.

295
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,380
I mean it.

296
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:00,980
Xiyi,

297
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,100
please,

298
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,740
please give me a second chance.

299
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,340
I'll learn to be

300
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,700
-a good wife.
-Anna.

301
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,620
I'm begging you.

302
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,500
Anna.

303
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,540
You don't have to lose yourself.

304
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,660
You're everything

305
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,780
to me.

306
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,940
You see,

307
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,020
a ballet dancer

308
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,380
has to find a focus

309
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,940
so that she won't fall when she spins.

310
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,540
But my focus is gone,

311
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,420
that's why I fell.

312
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,860
Xiyi!

313
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,740
Without you,

314
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,860
stage means nothing to me.

315
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,300
Glory and applause mean nothing to me.

316
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,620
All I want is you.

317
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,860
You still have feelings for me, right?

318
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,460
You still like me, right?

319
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,660
Nothing has changed, right?

320
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,060
Xiyi,

321
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,700
am I right?

322
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,580
If everything can be changed,

323
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,900
then I hope

324
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,180
I didn't choose to tolerate it

325
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,620
every time you disappointed me.

326
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,460
I wish you hadn't gotten
off the ship the other day,

327
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,620
so that nothing would happen.

328
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,660
But it had happened.

329
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,020
And both of us are at fault.

330
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,100
Please don't.

331
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,140
Please hear me out.

332
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,900
Anna,

333
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,380
this is all my fault.

334
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,420
I didn't tell you

335
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,900
because I thought I could handle it.

336
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,460
In fact,

337
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,500
I failed.

338
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,300
We should stop hurting each other.

339
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,460
I want to enjoy the freedom to love someone.

340
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,300
I don't want to hurt you

341
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,580
or Jiaxin

342
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,620
because of my hesitation.

343
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,020
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,580
Anna.

345
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,580
Xiyi.

346

Hello?

407
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,980
Hello, Jiaxin.

408
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,580
Is it okay for you to go to the gallery?

409
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,060
I have something important for you.

410
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,980
No problem.

411
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:23,620
Okay.

412
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,220
I'll be waiting for you.

413
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,900
Jiaxin,

414
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,820
what happened to you?

415
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,820
I forgot my umbrella at home.

416
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,140
There are so many coffee shops on the street.

417
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,980
Why didn't you find a shelter?

418
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,460
Que sera,

419
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,300
sera.

420
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,420
If I knew you didn't bring
your umbrella with you,

421
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,900
I'd drive my car and pick you up.

422
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,140
Let's get inside. It's windy here.

423
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,100
Let's go to my office.

424
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,060
Okay.

425
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,340
There you go.

426
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,140
Thanks.

427
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,380
Last time when I was in Europe,

428
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,820
I gave the pot you made

429
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,020
to Zhongshan Long.

430
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,260
You mean the one I made
together with grandma?

431
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,140
Why didn't you tell me?

432
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,420
That pot is unfished.

433
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,300
Well,

434
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,660
I'm bad at craftsmanship.

435
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,380
Wouldn't the master

436
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,780
laugh at it?

437
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,780
It's so embarrassing.

438
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,140
What did he say?

439
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,100
I remember he said

440
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,260
"interesting, interesting".

441
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,660
Just so you know,

442
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,740
he never pays people compliment.

443
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,900
I've brought many people's work to him.

444
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,740
He wouldn't say a word

445
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,700
for things he doesn't like.

446
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,260
Come on.

447
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,060
I know

448
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,780
my work

449
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,820
is not good enough for him.

450
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,620
If you don't believe me,
you can check it out yourself.

451
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,980
Come, come over here.

452
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,160
(Zhongshan Long)

453
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,420
The signature of Zhongshan Long?

454
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,380
Here is a letter

455
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,820
from Zhongshan Long.

456
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,340
Check it out.

457
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,420
Check it out.

458
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,540
Jiaxin?

459
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,020
He knows my name?

460
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,460
Yes.

461
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,460
Jiaxin,

462
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,460
I've received your pot.

463
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,340
It's original and unadorned.

464
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,140
You have great potential.

465
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,780
Attached is my gift called "the Golden Couple".

466
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,460
Best wishes for your wedding.

467
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,460
It...

468
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,100
It should be in one piece.

469
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,060
I think it was broken during transport.

470
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,340
Jiaxin.

471
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,940
Jiaxin.

472
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,780
Jiaxin, it's all my fault.

473
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,100
I didn't deliver it properly.

474
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,060
I'll have it fixed.

475
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,980
I promise it will be good as old.

476
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,220
I just feel

477
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,700
insecure.

478
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,740
Anna

479
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,460
is back.

480
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,580
Que sera, sera.

481
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,620
When it comes to her, I...

482
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,460
Jiaxin,

483
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,580
I believe

484
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,020
everything happens for a good reason.

485
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,500
Believe in yourself.

486
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,460
When will she be back?

487
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,940
I'm starving.

488
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,380
Be patient.

489
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,340
We'll have dinner when everyone is here.

490
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,900
Mom, have some tea.

491
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,140
Grandma, auntie.

492
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,180
-You're back.
-Zhengren.

493
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,620
Where is my brother?

494
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,100
You're not together?

495
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,260
He

496
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,860
has something to deal with in the company.

497
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,620
It might take some time.

498
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,620
Then we're not waiting for him.

499
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,480
-Let's have dinner.
-OK.

500
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,100
Grandma. Auntie.

501
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,900
We thought you're working in the company.

502
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,300
How come you're back home so soon?

503
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,540
Jiaxin said you're dealing with something.

504
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,580
Is it over yet?

505
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,340
Don't worry. Everything is set.

506
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,780
Oh, my eyes!

507
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,140
How long have you been separated?

508
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,620
Your eyes are glued to each other.

509
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,260
You're so lovey-dovey, I just can't stand it.

510
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,540
Let's have dinner.

511
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,420
Don't exaggerate.

512
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,820
Alright, alright, let's have dinner.

513
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,020
Let's go.

514
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,340
It's dinner time.

515
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,740
I'm sorry,

516
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,860
Anna.

517
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,460
I don't think it's gonna happen.

518
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,500
Someone fell down over there.

519
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,860
Is she okay?

520
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,220
What happened?

521
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,420
Miss, are you alright?

522
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,380
Call 120.

523
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:08,860
What happened?

524
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,940
Just call 120.

525
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,660
-Well...
-Today...

526
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,820
You want to ask about Anna, right?

527
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,180
Yes.

528
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,100
Actually, it's hard for me.

529
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,860
I told her everything

530
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,700
and explained everything.

531
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,500
I feel relieved.

532
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,700
But I don't think

533
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,020
you're.

534
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,380
It seems a load is off your mind

535
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,700
and another load sets in.

536
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,660
I had many good memories about Anna.

537
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,220
And

538
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,140
sad memories about her, too.

539
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,220
I don't want to go back to the past.

540
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,060
But it still hurts me

541
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,300
to say goodbye to those old days.

542
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,020
She is a really nice girl.

543
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:55,980
That's right.

544
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,580
Xiyi,

545
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,140
I'm sorry.

546
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,460
This is not your fault.

547
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,060
Did you cry today?

548
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,260
You have puffy eyes.

549
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,660
No.

550
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:29,980
Xiyi,

551
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,540
I want to ask you a question.

552
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,500
Do I still get to live in this house?

553
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,260
Or,

554
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,500
does this room,

555
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,860
this bed,

556
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,860
still belong to

557
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,780
our Ximi's mom?

558
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,660
The first day I entered this house,

559
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,580
I told myself

560
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,060
that I must restrain myself.

561
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,940
I must not take this place as my home.

562
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,900
I must not get used to living here.

563
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,660
Because I don't belong here.

564
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,020
I shouldn't get attached to it.

565
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,300
But grandma is so nice.

566
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,220
And you're so nice.

567
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,060
So I started to long for more of it.

568
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,980
Actually, I'm so frightened.

569
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,300
I fear that I'll have to leave here

570
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,660
when I wake up in the morning.

571
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,220
Don't be upset.

572
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,340
It will make you less pretty.

573
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,100
It's weird.

574
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,460
I feel my hands are empty.

575
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,620
I feel I lost something.

576
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,540
Chen Jiaxin,

577
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,740
from now on,

578
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,260
please feel free to long for more.

579
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,020
Enjoy my love for you.

580
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,660
Come on.

581
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,100
From now on,

582
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,740
I'll never make you cry.

583
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,020
Anna is back?!

584
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,220
What kind of best friends are you?

585
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,580
She even didn't tell you?

586
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,020
No way.

587
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,180
What are you doing?

588
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,980
I'm gonna teach her some moves.

589
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,180
She is a simple girl.

590
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,700
She doesn't stand a chance
against that woman.

591
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,700
I can't watch her die.

592
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,820
What are you doing?

593
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:41,980
Babe,

594
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,260
it's their business.

595
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,940
You should stay out of it.

596
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,980
I'm her friend.

597
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,020
If I don't teach her to be tactful,

598
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,500
she'd be too silly

599
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,180
to protect herself.

600
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,380
No, no, no.

601
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,060
I can't stand it

602
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,340
when I think of her innocent face.

603
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,140
Trust me,

604
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,180
she is not a pushover.

605
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,100
She is a snail

606
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,500
who gets to ride Mr. Yi.

607
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,660
You know nothing about it.

608
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,780
But I see it clearly.

609
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,580
Listen,

610
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,860
let them deal with it.

611
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,700
Mr. Yi

612
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,060
had a change of heart for her.

613
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,300
They'll deal with it in their own way.

614
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,060
Give them some time.

615
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,300
Your intervention will only make it worse,

616
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,900
don't you think so?

617
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,900
Give them some time.

618
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,620
Even if what you said is true,

619
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,100
I still feel disconcerted.

620
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
I'm your boyfriend, and
you still don't trust me.

621
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,300
I think you should learn to

622
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,740
care for me,

623
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,660
otherwise we might break up.

624
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,140
Listen,

625
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,340
An Dazhu,

626
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,380
are you getting bold?

627
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,380
It hurts. It hurts.

628
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,820
My phone is ringing.

629
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,020
It might be my mom.

630
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,540
See, it's mom.

631
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,740
Hello, mom.

632
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,460
What's up?

633
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,380
What?

634
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:50,980
Dad is hit by a car?

635
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,180
Which hospital did they take him to?

636
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,380
Hello?

637
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,420
Hello,

638
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,900
do you know Miss Anna?

639
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:11,700
Yes, I do.

640
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,660
What's the problem?

641
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,900
Miss Anna fainted

642
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,900
and was sent to our hospital.

643
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,020
Someone needs to be here.

644
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,780
What?

645
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,820
Okay, I see.

646
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,500
I'll be right there.

647
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,500
What happened?

648
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,620
Anna fainted and is now in hospital.

649
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,180
How come?

650
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,660
I don't know.

651
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,580
I need to go to the hospital.

652
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,380
Okay.

653
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,420
Jiaxin,

654
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,900
it's okay.

655
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,100
Anna has no family or friends

656
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,300
in Shanghai.

657
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,820
I've got to see her.

658
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,740
Trust me.

659
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,660
Don't worry.

660
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,820
Go ahead.

661
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,780
I'm going to see her.

662
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,660
Be careful on the road.

663
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:51,980
Okay.

664
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,900
Lie still. Don't move.

665
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,140
My hand hurts so much.

666
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,340
Why am I in the hospital?

667
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,660
You got injured.

668
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,580
Got injured?

669
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,780
Aren't we on the cruise ship?

670
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,420
What on earth happened?

671
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,660
Xiyi, my head hurts so much.

672
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,140
Anna, please lie still.

673
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,260
I'll get a doctor for you.

674
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,860
How is she?

675
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,340
Had the patient been hospitalized before

676
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,340
due to severe head wound?

677
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,660
When she was sent here,

678
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,460
we found bruises

679
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,100
and healed head wound

680
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,780
besides the new injury.

681
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,060
That's right.

682
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,100
She had an accident

683
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,340
and suffered a mild concussion.

684
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,420
Concussion?

685
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,260
What are you talking about?

686
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,180
I refused

687
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,260
to play the black swan

688
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,460
in order to take the cruise with you.

689
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,780
When did I get injured and hospitalized?

690
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,380
Anna,

691
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,820
that's four months ago.

692
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,140
Four months ago?

693
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,900
How come?

694
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,980
It seems Miss Anna is suffering from

695
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,300
retrograde amnesia.

696
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,020
It's a typical concussion syndrome.

697
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,260
The patient might lose her
memory of a certain period.

698
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,780
It comes with nausea, dizziness and headache.

699
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,140
Amnesia?

700
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,620
Doctor, will I recover from it?

701
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,340
Don't worry too much.

702
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,620
It's only temporary.

703
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
Have some rest

704
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,220
and exercise as normal.

705
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,020
You'll recover

706
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,220
once the bleeding in your
head has been absorbed.

707
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,220
During this time,

708
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,100
please avoid vigorous exercise

709
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,540
and mood swings.

710
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,460
Try to stay emotionally stable.

711
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,020
This is very important for your recovery.

712
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:37,540
Okay.

713
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,100
No problem.

714
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,020
My boyfriend will take good care of me.

715
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,700
Thank you, doctor.

716
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,180
Do you hear that?

717
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,380
I need to be in a calm mood

718
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,820
and stay away from emotional stimulation.

719
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,380
So, don't get me irritated.

720
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,180
Okay.

721
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:57,980
Okay?

722
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,580
Have some water.

723
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:01,940
Okay.

724
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,420
Amnesia?

725
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,260
It's caused by concussion.

726
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,540
How is she now?

727
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,820
So far so good.

728
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,180
The doctor said

729
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,420
she might be lucky enough to recover soon.

730
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,580
But,

731
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,900
but she had no recollection
of the past few months,

732
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,060
including our breakup yesterday.

733
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,100
Judged by her current condition,

734
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,460
she should stay away emotional stimulation.

735
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,340
Anna told me

736
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,540
she had the accident

737
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,660
because she saw

738
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,940
our photo.

739
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,540
She missed the finale

740
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,340
and suffered from sequela.

741
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,100
Now she is most in need of
someone to take care of her.

742
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,380
This is not the time to disturb her mind.

743
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,580
Besides...

744
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,540
I'm running out of ideas.

745
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,940
Well,

746
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,900
what about her family?

747
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,420
At this time,

748
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,180
it's most suitable for her
family to take care of her.

749
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,380
She is adopted by a ballet dancer

750
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,140
who stays abroad.

751
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:47,900
That is to say,

752
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,460
she has no family in Shanghai.

753
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,540
In that case,

754
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:56,980
you,

755
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,500
you should take care of her.

756
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,020
Both of us are to be blamed

757
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,140
for Anna's disease.

758
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,140
We can't leave her alone

759
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,980
like this.

760
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,780
You said she can recover soon.

761
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,740
Then, during this time,

762
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,500
let's take care of her together.
