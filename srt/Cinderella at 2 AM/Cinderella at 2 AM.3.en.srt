(International Arrivals)

15
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:14,216
Two years ago,

16
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:16,517
the day I came back from studying abroad.

17
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:20,487
Do people still take crying selfies?

18
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:21,855
He's so funny, seriously.

19
00:01:21,856 --> 00:01:24,385
Sweetie, look at AL CARD's vice chairman's crying selfie.

20
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:26,495
What's that? That's hilarious.

21
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:28,195
- What is that? - He's so ridiculous.

22
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:29,326
How cheesy.

23
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:31,866
- What is he doing? - Gosh, I can't stand this.

24
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:33,097
What is that?

25
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,236
("Why Is the Vice-Chairman of AL CARD Doing This?")

26
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:36,606
It's so funny.

27
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:43,007
The day Si Won posted a crying selfie while drunk.

28
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:48,017
And the day he was banned from social media for life.

29
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:58,226
What kind of humiliation is this? Seriously.

30
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:00,726
Oh, my gosh.

31
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:02,726
Goodness.

32
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,397
Hey, get in.

33
00:02:20,677 --> 00:02:22,076
- Why? - What's this?

34
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:23,715
I said I'd take a cab. Why'd you come to pick me up?

35
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:24,887
You didn't have to.

36
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:27,786
Did you miss me that much?

37
00:02:28,256 --> 00:02:29,926
Did you perhaps cry because you missed me?

38
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:32,426
Hey, you... Don't you do that too.

39
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:34,996
I feel upset enough as it is without you adding to it.

40
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:39,636
By the way,

41
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,336
why did you come back earlier than scheduled?

42
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:43,267
Weren't you going to come next month?

43
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:45,237
I was,

44
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:47,805
but they said the new recruits were starting work next week.

45
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,346
I wanted to start then too.

46
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:52,617
But do you really have to hide your identity like that?

47
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:54,275
Whose idea was this?

48
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:56,547
Mother suggested it to me carefully.

49
00:02:56,987 --> 00:02:58,585
When you started working as a new recruit,

50
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:00,617
the employees felt so uncomfortable that they were all going crazy.

51
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,386
You made it so obvious that you were the third-generation heir.

52
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:06,227
Hey, I didn't make it obvious.

53
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:09,125
It's not my fault I exude a certain vibe even when I don't try.

54
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,927
That's not something I can help.

55
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:14,697
But you might be able to help it.

56
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,406
Hiding your rich image, I mean.

57
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:18,006
Seriously...

58
00:03:18,836 --> 00:03:21,677
Anyway, be prepared. Working in the office isn't easy.

59
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:24,376
Si Won.

60
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:30,487
I'm Seo Ju Won.

61
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:33,086
Don't you know me?

62
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:37,656
I don't know.

63
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:41,255
I have no idea what your standard was when organizing this.

64
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:42,465
You should've asked me first.

65
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,727
Why did you do it like this?

66
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:44,897
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:47,637
You looked so busy, so I tried to do it myself.

68
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:49,636
Mr. Seo Ju Won.

69
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:51,335
From now on, don't make things worse...

70
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:53,005
and just report to me beforehand.

71
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:54,707
It's only been a month since you started working.

72
00:03:54,806 --> 00:03:55,806
Yes, ma'am.

73
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:03,316
Ms. Ha Yoon Seo was my mentor.

74
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:05,517
She wasn't likable from the beginning.

75
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:08,586
She was meticulous and coldhearted.

76
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:10,155
She was a bit...

77
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,156
She's scary, isn't she?

78
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:12,227
Yes.

79
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:14,356
What? No.

80
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:17,866
As if. Gosh, she was scolding you like crazy.

81
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:21,236
I know. Does she think everyone can be a legendary rookie like her?

82
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:22,906
- A legendary rookie? - Yes.

83
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:24,836
I mean, when all of her colleagues were just dazed and confused,

84
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:26,375
she would volunteer to work overtime every day...

85
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:28,677
to get an idea of the work within a week.

86
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:31,505
She joined all of the marketing workers' clubs out there...

87
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:33,716
and learned everything she could about work on the weekends.

88
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:35,375
Just after two months of working here,

89
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,787
she took over everything...

90
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:39,886
the chief used to do or whatever.

91
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:42,385
You don't look so great.

92
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:44,027
Did you get yelled at for doing something wrong?

93
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:45,626
It's not like that.

94
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:46,626
As if.

95
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,695
Your face obviously looks like you got told off by your boss.

96
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:50,896
Do you know how many times I've seen faces like that at work?

97
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:53,936
Working in the office is not what you expected, right?

98
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:55,337
You're struggling right now, aren't you?

99
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:56,967
No, I'm not.

100
00:04:58,136 --> 00:04:59,376
That was what I said,

101
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:01,407
but I was actually struggling.

102
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:10,246
Ju Won.

103
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:12,587
Can you still not work the copy machine?

104
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,787
- I'm sorry. - Are you bad with machines?

105
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,956
Sir, I took a look at the data analysis report from last quarter.

106
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:24,366
Me? Are you asking me?

107
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,336
You skipped the chief and assistant manager,

108
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:27,395
and you're asking me?

109
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:28,436
I'm sorry, sir.

110
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:29,667
Gosh.

111
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:33,607
Good job on that.

112
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,477
- Here's your coffee. - Oh, hey.

113
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,347
Assistant Manager, you had the hot tea.

114
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:40,716
Ju Won, why is there so little in here?

115
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:42,847
- What? - Didn't you take a sip from it?

116
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:44,646
No, sir.

117
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:45,717
Watch out.

118
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:48,456
Sorry, sir.

119
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:53,656
- Si Won. - Yes?

120
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,027
I've been thinking about this lately.

121
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:57,296
If I weren't the second son of AL Group's chairwoman,

122
00:05:57,297 --> 00:05:58,927
I'd be lacking in so many ways.

123
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,266
Gosh.

124
00:06:05,006 --> 00:06:06,277
We have another team dinner tomorrow.

125
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:08,306
Can you teach me how to make good soju bombs?

126
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:10,107
Hey, how would I know that?

127
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,416
Why? Did someone tell you to make soju bombs?

128
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:15,375
Yes, they asked me to make it with golden proportions,

129
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,515
but how would I know? I've never made it before.

130
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:18,016
Well, then, look it up.

131
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:20,056
(Second, pour half a glass of soju and pour it into the beer glass!)

132
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:21,487
I see.

133
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:23,326
Okay.

134
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:26,695
Sir, I'll mix you a drink myself.

135
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:28,895
- Oh, okay! Make a good one for me. - Hey.

136
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:29,896
Yes, sir.

137
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:32,695
He's doing his job now.

138
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:35,037
Gosh, you should teach him well.

139
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,836
Gosh, you're frustrating.

140
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:39,536
Gosh, I might sober up while waiting for you.

141
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:40,705
Sorry, I'll make it quickly.

142
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:41,907
Hurry up!

143
00:06:43,706 --> 00:06:45,177
Gosh, hurry up!

144
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,116
Are you trying to kill me with that drink?

145
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,815
Gosh, what have you done all these years,

146
00:06:49,816 --> 00:06:50,816
not even learning to mix drinks?

147
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:53,386
Back in my day, while I was job searching,

148
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:56,026
I studied English during the day and soju bombs at night.

149
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:57,226
Goodness.

150
00:06:57,227 --> 00:07:00,125
- I know, right? He's so... - What's wrong with you?

151
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:03,426
Give me that! I'll show you how to do it.

152
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:04,427
Applause!

153
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:06,065
- Nice. - Thank you.

154
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:08,436
I don't show this to just anyone.

155
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:11,866
Watch. Half a shot, just like that. There you go.

156
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:13,205
Beer? I can pour it with my eyes closed.

157
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:14,875
Just pour it all in.

158
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,705
See that? Take one!

159
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:18,106
- There you go! - That was awesome!

160
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:20,777
- All right. Drink up! - Go!

161
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:22,516
Very nice.

162
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:41,935
- Cheers! - Gosh, that tasted great.

163
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:44,435
Sir, excuse me while I use the restroom quickly.

164
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:46,705
Gosh, you sure have a knack for making me lose my appetite.

165
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:48,177
Fine, go on!

166
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:50,476
Hurry up and go!

167
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:51,847
Here you go, sir.

168
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:53,516
Okay.

169
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:56,087
Gosh, where is he going?

170
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:57,917
Seriously, he's so frustrating.

171
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:00,217
Nice.

172
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:12,227
Seriously, this is so tough.

173
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,206
(Si Won)

174
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:22,846
- What? - You little punk.

175
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:25,705
How dare a new recruit answer the vice chairman's call like that?

176
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,716
What do you think?

177
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,216
I'm trying to give this rookie a chance to spend time...

178
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,717
with the vice chairman.

179
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:31,946
Hey, let's go and play tennis this weekend.

180
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:33,015
Forget it.

181
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:34,557
I don't think tennis is for me.

182
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,987
I know it's hard to get better in a short period of time,

183
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:39,457
but I'm not getting better as I had hoped.

184
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:41,396
I don't feel any sense of achievement either.

185
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,496
I just want to quit.

186
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,197
Bye.

187
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,376
Are you going to quit?

188
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:57,576
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:59,717
I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I just happened to hear you.

190
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:03,386
It's tough, isn't it? Working in the office, I mean.

191
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,216
I've only scolded you so far...

192
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:09,827
and haven't told you this yet.

193
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:13,227
Ju Won, you're doing just fine.

194
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:15,925
You've gotten a lot better at your work,

195
00:09:15,926 --> 00:09:19,967
and your trend research report was good too.

196
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:22,666
Thank you.

197
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,867
I hope that...

198
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:28,006
you won't quit working here.

199
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:32,275
Oh, well, I didn't mean I wanted to quit my job...

200
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:34,847
If you can't handle this period now and just quit,

201
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:37,117
it'll be the same at any other job.

202
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:40,716
So, for now,

203
00:09:40,717 --> 00:09:43,227
just hang in there for another day tomorrow.

204
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:46,156
Then, a week would've gone by in no time,

205
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:50,026
and a month, a year? They pass by so quickly.

206
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:52,526
Okay.

207
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:55,097
I want to see how you look...

208
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:57,766
a year from now.

209
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:13,816
- Here you go! - Thank you!

210
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:14,915
It's time for another round.

211
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,456
- Drink up. - Okay.

212
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:18,285
All right! All together now, cheers!

213
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:20,727
- Cheers! - Cheers!

214
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:41,745
What's this?

215
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:43,847
He looks totally fine. Why did you drink that for him?

216
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:45,616
What, are you two dating or something?

217
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:46,617
Sir.

218
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:49,357
Don't you know I love to drink?

219
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:53,356
So, why are you only pouring drinks for Ju Won?

220
00:10:53,357 --> 00:10:56,926
I also want to drink the liquor that you pour me.

221
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:01,135
Okay, drink! Go on, then.

222
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:03,236
Gosh, if our capable Ms. Ha wants to drink,

223
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:04,265
I should pour you a glass!

224
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,306
My glass is empty too.

225
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:08,077
Gosh, you drink so well! Here you go!

226
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:12,347
All right. Enjoy that drink.

227
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:15,476
- There. Are your glasses full? - Cheers?

228
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:18,286
- Yes, sounds good. - Drink, okay? You have a drink. Go.

229
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:20,486
- Cheers! - Cheers!

230
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:21,857
Thank you!

231
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:25,526
I think that was the moment...

232
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,327
I started to see Ha Yoon Seo as a good person...

233
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,727
and not as a good boss.

234
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:51,817
I kept looking at her without realizing it.

235
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:06,396
I thought that she had a pretty smile.

236
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:43,136
Like that, I ended up...

237
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,506
liking you.

238
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:12,266
Call him. I'll go home.

239
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:18,467
What are you doing?

240
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:20,477
Yoon Seo.

241
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:23,676
Let me ask you something.

242
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:29,246
Will you really break up with me?

243
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:47,766
Do you not like me anymore?

244
00:13:52,636 --> 00:13:53,636
No.

245
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:56,546
I still...

246
00:13:57,947 --> 00:13:59,207
like you a lot.

247
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:37,217
Well...

248
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:39,187
Well... So...

249
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,386
I don't think this is right.

250
00:14:44,156 --> 00:14:45,357
Why not?

251
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:47,026
Well, you know.

252
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:50,426
We're broken up. How can we even kiss?

253
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,026
You should know that. What's wrong with you?

254
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:56,867
Still.

255
00:14:57,737 --> 00:14:59,367
You said you still liked me a lot.

256
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:04,646
I love you so much too.

257
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:10,117
We were happy.

258
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:14,217
We loved each other.

259
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,005
So, how could you abandon me in a flash...

260
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:32,707
as if you're throwing out an old shoe?

261
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:35,476
How could you do that?

262
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:39,347
I gave you all my heart.

263
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:40,576
- Are you crazy? What... - I...

264
00:15:40,577 --> 00:15:41,577
What's going on?

265
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:44,415
I gave you my body and heart.

266
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,586
Sit down.

267
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:49,216
How could you accept money from Mother and abandon me?

268
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:51,886
How could you take money and dump me?

269
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,295
The woman took money?

270
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:56,596
So, that woman accepted money...

271
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:58,025
from that man's mother?

272
00:15:58,026 --> 00:16:00,995
Yes, and then, she abandoned him right away.

273
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:02,436
He even gave her his body.

274
00:16:02,437 --> 00:16:04,437
How pitiful. I feel bad for him.

275
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:06,136
Yoon Seo.

276
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:08,477
Yoon Seo.

277
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:10,876
Don't abandon me.

278
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:12,746
Shut up.

279
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:15,847
Shut your mouth, darn it.

280
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:34,136
Hey, Seo Ju Won. Get up.

281
00:16:36,737 --> 00:16:39,107
Get up already.

282
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:45,846
What are you doing here this early in the morning?

283
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:48,317
I had something to report to Mother in the morning.

284
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:51,217
Then, I found out that you came home totally drunk.

285
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:52,886
Here.

286
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:57,926
I mean...

287
00:16:59,357 --> 00:17:01,255
You barely ever drink over your limit since you don't want to...

288
00:17:01,256 --> 00:17:02,727
show yourself in a messy state.

289
00:17:02,926 --> 00:17:04,767
Who on earth did you drink with to get so drunk?

290
00:17:07,537 --> 00:17:10,136
Hey, did you drink with Yoon Seo?

291
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:12,367
Well...

292
00:17:13,577 --> 00:17:14,936
Gosh, brother.

293
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,507
I'm saying this out of concern.

294
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:20,476
If you want to hold onto Yoon Seo, you should refrain from drinking.

295
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:22,846
- Why? - Why do you think?

296
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,017
That's because showing your drunk side will do no good.

297
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:27,486
Why do you think I built a bar at home and drink alone?

298
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:31,026
When you get drunk, your facial features loosen up and look uglier.

299
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:34,455
If you say everything in your head with a twisted tongue,

300
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:35,826
how pitiful would that look?

301
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:38,327
Forget it. I don't act like that when I'm drunk.

302
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:45,606
So, how could you abandon me in a flash...

303
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,536
as if you're throwing out an old shoe?

304
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:49,635
- What's wrong with you? - How could you do that, Yoon Seo?

305
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,875
I gave you all my heart...

306
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:54,047
How could you accept money from Mother and abandon me?

307
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,946
Si Won, what do I do?

308
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:00,116
What? What's the matter?

309
00:18:00,117 --> 00:18:03,017
I was a total moron last night.

310
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,307
I, Seo Ju Won,

311
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,307
am a neat guy who can't accept letting myself become unkempt.

312
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:31,317
I wish I could wash it all away in this flowing water.

313
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,756
Even all of the bad memories.

314
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:34,817
I...

315
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:38,986
gave you my body and heart.

316
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,726
Why did I say such a humiliating thing?

317
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,266
Why?

318
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:46,936
Why?

319
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:50,406
You must be crazy!

320
00:18:50,636 --> 00:18:52,567
"I still like you a lot?"

321
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:56,376
Why did I say such a thing? What did I expect?

322
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:08,416
Why did I close my eyes? What was I thinking?

323
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,037
What?

324
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:22,696
Why are you suddenly doing that?

325
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:24,935
Are you going to drink more in the morning...

326
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:26,235
after getting drunk last night?

327
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:28,807
I'm not drinking these. I'm quitting.

328
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:32,346
From now on, there is no more alcohol in Ha Yoon Seo's life.

329
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:33,816
This is all because of alcohol.

330
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:35,716
I'm never going to drink again in my entire life.

331
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:38,046
Don't make me laugh.

332
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:40,916
I bet my life savings of 15 dollars that you can't quit drinking.

333
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:48,527
I mean, what kind of trouble did you get into to do this?

334
00:20:07,716 --> 00:20:08,915
He's not here yet.

335
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,117
Figures. He got really drunk last night.

336
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:14,155
Perhaps, he can't remember anything because he blacked out.

337
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:17,126
I wish that kind of good luck would come my way.

338
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:18,626
"Good luck?"

339
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:21,597
You're suddenly hoping for good luck.

340
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:23,297
You bought a lottery ticket, right?

341
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:24,895
Or what? Did you apply for an apartment subscription?

342
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:26,327
No, it's nothing.

343
00:20:27,236 --> 00:20:28,297
It isn't?

344
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:31,267
- Hello. - Hello.

345
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:34,837
Well, then. Bye.

346
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:36,876
Why are you leaving as soon as you got here?

347
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:37,976
Do you have a meeting?

348
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:39,376
No.

349
00:20:41,577 --> 00:20:43,915
Then, I wish you good luck for today.

350
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,716
- Oh, let's go! - Let's go!

351
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:48,886
Director Seo! You should go that way.

352
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:50,186
Oh, right. That way.

353
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:53,456
What's wrong with him?

354
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:01,097
Good luck, my foot. I'm certain he remembers everything.

355
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,837
I think I looked foolish just now too.

356
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:10,247
My gosh.

357
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:11,945
Why do you think she's doing that?

358
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:12,946
What do you mean?

359
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,347
I mean my sister.

360
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:18,915
Yesterday, she came home completely drunk.

361
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,986
But this morning, she was dumping all the alcohol out.

362
00:21:21,456 --> 00:21:23,756
I think she made some huge mistake after getting drunk.

363
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:24,757
What do you think it is?

364
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:27,056
By the way, is your sister pretty?

365
00:21:27,057 --> 00:21:28,655
Why are you bringing that up now?

366
00:21:28,656 --> 00:21:30,297
I'm curious.

367
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:32,027
She is quite pretty.

368
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,997
Hey, you brought a lot of money today.

369
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:38,307
You brought a lot of money, right?

370
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,807
What are you doing?

371
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:48,175
Oh, it's nothing. Don't mind us.

372
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,146
Let's go.

373
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,956
Gosh, that guy...

374
00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:57,385
He's getting ripped off yesterday and today.

375
00:21:57,386 --> 00:22:00,026
Hey, he spent the money he stole on us...

376
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,556
when we went to karaoke and arcades.

377
00:22:01,557 --> 00:22:03,257
- Did he really? - Yes.

378
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:06,067
Gosh, I don't want to get involved. This is so annoying.

379
00:22:20,446 --> 00:22:22,747
All right. Shall we go and have some food now?

380
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:25,247
We've been working late for the past few days, so I'm tired.

381
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:26,486
How does ginseng chicken soup sound?

382
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:28,956
Oh, I still have to review a few more reports.

383
00:22:29,857 --> 00:22:31,027
Go ahead without me.

384
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:32,757
Okay.

385
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:36,425
Director Seo.

386
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:38,966
You're okay with having ginseng chicken soup for lunch, right?

387
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:41,567
I'll give you one of my legs.

388
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:45,837
I mean, I'll give you my drumstick, not my real leg.

389
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:47,636
You didn't misunderstand what I said, right?

390
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:50,476
I didn't, but I still have to review some reports.

391
00:22:50,976 --> 00:22:52,176
Please go ahead without me.

392
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:55,116
Ms. Ha said she couldn't join us for the exact same reason.

393
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:57,547
Wait! While you two review your reports,

394
00:22:57,617 --> 00:22:59,216
you should have this with some coffee.

395
00:23:00,456 --> 00:23:01,956
- I'll just join you... - I'll just join you...

396
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:05,426
- No, I'll just stay... - No, I'll just stay...

397
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:11,166
What is this, a choir competition? You keep saying the same thing.

398
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:14,966
Right? It looks like you two have done this before.

399
00:23:16,497 --> 00:23:18,566
Anyway, when you aren't sure whether you should eat something,

400
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,136
it's always better to just go and eat it, you know.

401
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:22,406
The longer you hesitate, the longer the wait time will be.

402
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:23,945
Let's go, okay?

403
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:25,375
Yes, let's go.

404
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:26,876
You need to eat something to have the energy to work.

405
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,976
- Let's go. Come on. - All right.

406
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:30,686
- Come on. - Okay.

407
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:32,445
Ginseng chicken soup sounds great!

408
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:33,486
It'll be so good.

409
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:34,716
Let's go!

410
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:36,186
Hello.

411
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:37,725
- Hello. - Hello.

412
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:39,686
- A table for 4, please. - For 4 people?

413
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:43,326
Sorry, it looks like we have to give you two different tables.

414
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:46,567
Oh, then I'll sit with Ye Young.

415
00:23:47,337 --> 00:23:48,666
- Let's take that table. - Let's go.

416
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:50,067
Oh, wait.

417
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,267
Mr. Bae.

418
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:54,337
The design team wants to move the 4pm meeting to 1:30pm.

419
00:23:54,537 --> 00:23:55,537
Does this work for us?

420
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:57,445
Well, why don't we talk about it while we eat?

421
00:23:57,446 --> 00:23:58,646
- Oh, sure. - All right.

422
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:01,247
Oh, sorry.

423
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:03,446
The two of us have to talk about work.

424
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:06,446
We'll eat quickly and head back to the office.

425
00:24:06,787 --> 00:24:08,156
- Okay. - Enjoy your lunch!

426
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,287
Why don't you tell them that we will...

427
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:17,496
Enjoy.

(Chae's Ginseng Chicken Soup)

429
00:24:28,537 --> 00:24:29,636
What should I do?

430
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:32,176
We can't keep being awkward like this.

431
00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:34,017
Should I just act like it was nothing?

432
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:36,617
Should I say everyone does it with their ex when they're drunk...

433
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:38,547
and act like I'm totally cool with it?

434
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:47,757
What are you doing?

435
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:50,156
What?

436
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:52,426
I like pepper.

437
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:57,507
Oh, my gosh.

438
00:25:01,037 --> 00:25:02,236
We ordered chicken soup,

439
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:04,247
but you got a hedgehog.

440
00:25:13,716 --> 00:25:14,956
I'll have the hedgehog.

441
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:17,386
No, I'll eat it...

442
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:21,557
It's really okay...

443
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:37,976
I must've looked so stupid when I was drunk last night.

444
00:25:38,547 --> 00:25:40,915
No, I was worse.

445
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,145
No, I was way worse...

446
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:43,547
- Hello. - Hello.

447
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:48,317
Shall we talk in my office?

448
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,757
Shall we?

449
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:57,566
Sorry, I have to take this. I'll meet you upstairs.

450
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:58,626
Okay.

451
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:38,406
I came here to see Ju Won,

452
00:26:39,537 --> 00:26:40,706
but no one was here.

453
00:26:41,777 --> 00:26:44,307
Oh, he'll be back shortly. He's taking a call now.

454
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:46,706
- I'll let him know you're here... - About Ju Won...

455
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:49,747
I know I promised you to transfer him abroad.

456
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:51,986
Sorry for not keeping my promise.

457
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:55,257
He said he couldn't leave right away.

458
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:58,757
He wanted to stay by your side to pull himself together and move on.

459
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:04,196
I knew it made no sense but still let him have his way...

460
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:09,396
because I trusted you.

461
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:18,347
That day,

462
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:20,747
I liked what you said.

463
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:24,587
You said you knew your place.

464
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:27,386
I was impressed.

465
00:27:31,226 --> 00:27:33,287
Can you keep your promise...

466
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:36,357
and break up with my son?

467
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:48,037
Oh, hey.

468
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:51,507
I came to the office to get some updates...

469
00:27:51,906 --> 00:27:54,716
and stopped by to check in on you.

470
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:57,716
When the others see you here after their meeting,

471
00:27:58,547 --> 00:27:59,686
they'll be uncomfortable.

472
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:02,986
Let me walk you out.

473
00:28:28,146 --> 00:28:31,146
Are you flustered because I came to see you unannounced?

474
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,287
I wouldn't say I'm flustered,

475
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:35,986
but it made me uncomfortable.

476
00:28:38,386 --> 00:28:40,696
It sounds like you're telling me not to visit you again.

477
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:43,327
Am I right?

478
00:28:43,328 --> 00:28:44,966
I know what you're worried about,

479
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:48,767
and I can assure you that I won't let you down.

480
00:28:58,146 --> 00:28:59,277
Let's go.

481
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:36,547
Yes, I understand.

482
00:29:37,247 --> 00:29:39,216
I will break up with Ju Won.

483
00:29:40,857 --> 00:29:42,857
When I met her, she had an icy cold demeanor.

484
00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:45,226
She was realistic and brazen,

485
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:48,196
but this is the way she looks...

486
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,696

Hey, what's with Yoon Seo today?

493
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:52,426
Well, I guess she wants to rinse some rice.

494
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:11,146
Hey, Yi Rae.

495
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:13,476
Yoon Seo is making kimchi now.

496
00:31:13,777 --> 00:31:14,817
Leave her be.

497
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:16,577
I guess she just wants to make some kimchi.

498
00:31:17,747 --> 00:31:19,446
What is with her today?

499
00:31:28,757 --> 00:31:29,797
Hey, Yi Rae.

501
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:33,827
Leave her be.

502
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:35,966
She has to keep busy to forget about it.

503
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,307
Forget about what?

504
00:31:38,436 --> 00:31:40,205
When she's stressed out about something,

505
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:43,276
she has to keep doing things nonstop not to think about it.

506
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:45,406
Oh, she's like that?

507
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:46,546
Why would she do that?

508
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:48,577
She should just cry if she's that stressed.

509
00:31:48,817 --> 00:31:51,247
I've never seen her cry.

510
00:31:51,747 --> 00:31:54,287

What are you saying?

519
00:32:56,647 --> 00:32:59,216
You're being like this because you don't want to break up with Ju Won.

If you're pregnant with his child,

521

524
00:33:15,837 --> 00:33:17,236
The truth is,

525
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:22,636
I never had a warm, loving family, as you know.

526
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:26,347
That's why...

527
00:33:27,476 --> 00:33:31,517
so I really hoped to start a warm, loving family of my own.

528
00:33:33,817 --> 00:33:36,117
I can't dream of starting such a family...

529
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:41,497
and making Ju Won estrange himself from his parents because of me.

530
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:50,837
I'm afraid...

531
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:53,906

- Hey, over here! - Block him!

538
00:34:20,296 --> 00:34:21,636
So, you're saying...

539
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:25,667
our kids extorted money from your son a few times, right?

540
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:28,477
Our kids can just return the money and apologize.

541
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:30,436
Is this really necessary?

542
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:32,147
My point, exactly.

543
00:34:32,477 --> 00:34:34,776
They're boys who I'm sure were just goofing around.

544
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:37,517
Did the anti-bullying committee really have to get involved?

545
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:38,816
Look, Young Soo's mother.

546
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:41,986
The CSAT is just a month from now.

547
00:34:42,187 --> 00:34:44,287
Let's settle this and put it behind us.

548
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:46,057
They're all in 12th grade.

549
00:34:50,597 --> 00:34:52,566
- Mom. - My gosh.

550
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:55,696
(Hwamun High School)

551
00:34:57,807 --> 00:34:59,736
(There is no place for violence in our happy school.)

552
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:10,117
I...

553
00:35:11,747 --> 00:35:14,216
I wanted to die when I saw this.

554
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:18,627
Would you just let it go if this happened to your own son?

555
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:20,187
Twelfth grade?

556
00:35:21,227 --> 00:35:22,327
So what?

557
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:25,526
I really can't let this slide.

558
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:29,566
The punks who did this to my son should all be punished!

559
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:32,937
All right. Please calm down.

560
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:35,536
We will return the money and take care of his medical expenses.

561
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:36,775
And if you'd like,

562
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:38,747
we could give you settlement money as well.

563
00:35:38,946 --> 00:35:40,077
You can all pitch in, right?

564
00:35:40,176 --> 00:35:42,846
- Yes, of course. - If we could avoid a hearing...

565
00:35:42,847 --> 00:35:44,916
If the committee decides to hold a hearing,

566
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:47,756
it will affect my kid's college admission chances, right?

567
00:35:48,017 --> 00:35:49,215
Oh, no.

568
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:51,356
I can't believe you people.

569
00:35:51,827 --> 00:35:52,827
Wait.

570
00:35:53,356 --> 00:35:54,957
Ji Seok didn't do it.

571
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:58,026
Ji Seok and Seok Hyun never hit that jerk...

572
00:35:58,796 --> 00:35:59,867
I mean...

573
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,066
They never hit Han Young Soo.

574
00:36:02,836 --> 00:36:04,367
Teachers. You heard that, right?

575
00:36:04,437 --> 00:36:05,966
My son didn't do it.

576
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:07,606
My gosh.

577
00:36:19,486 --> 00:36:20,747
Ma'am.

578
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:26,187
I'm sorry. It's all my fault for teaching him wrong.

579
00:36:26,986 --> 00:36:28,327
I sincerely apologize.

580
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:30,526
Yoon Seo, I didn't do it.

581
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:33,026
I swear, I never extorted money from him or hit him.

582
00:36:34,397 --> 00:36:35,397
So?

583
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:38,437
Did you really not know that your friends were hitting Young Soo?

584
00:36:39,736 --> 00:36:41,836
- What? - Had you stopped them,

585
00:36:42,477 --> 00:36:44,546
Young Soo wouldn't have had to go through this.

586
00:36:45,877 --> 00:36:47,247
But you just ignored it.

587
00:36:47,816 --> 00:36:50,176
You turned a blind eye to it, knowing they were hitting Young Soo.

588
00:36:59,187 --> 00:37:01,156
I really taught him wrong.

589
00:37:01,897 --> 00:37:02,997
I'm sorry.

590
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:06,066
If you're doing this to change my mind,

591
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,136
you're wasting your time.

592
00:37:11,336 --> 00:37:13,236
I'm not doing this to change your mind.

593
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:16,106
Let them hold a disciplinary hearing.

594
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:17,577
Look.

595
00:37:17,877 --> 00:37:20,276
What are you doing, without even consulting us first?

596
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:22,347
I won't complain,

597
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,247
no matter what they decide to reprimand them.

598
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:25,716
Look, Ji Seok's sister.

599
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:28,156
Are you sure about this?

600
00:37:28,256 --> 00:37:29,957
If they're suspended,

601
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:31,986
it'll remain in their student records forever.

602
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:34,457
Then they should deal with it,

603
00:37:36,627 --> 00:37:37,627
for the rest of their lives.

604
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:50,276
You said earlier that Ji Seok and Seok Hyun didn't do it.

605
00:37:51,006 --> 00:37:52,276
Did you do it for the sake of loyalty?

606
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:54,247
Sorry?

607
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:56,117
Were you just trying to be a loyal friend?

608
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:59,687
You felt like they got dragged into this because of you guys?

609
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:01,356
And you felt bad?

610
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:04,287
Yes, it's not fair.

611
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:10,026
I see. That's what "loyalty" means to you.

612
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:15,037
That's ridiculous.

613
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:51,537
Eat and poop.

614
00:38:52,836 --> 00:38:54,006
All you do is eat and poop.

615
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:55,906
Hey!

616
00:38:57,537 --> 00:38:58,606
Get out.

617
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:00,946
Get out, you fool!

618
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,116
Gosh.

619
00:39:02,117 --> 00:39:05,946
Hey, why won't you listen to me?

620
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:07,747
Why won't you listen to me?

621
00:39:08,917 --> 00:39:10,086
You little...

622
00:39:10,287 --> 00:39:13,356
All right, fine. I'll spank you first, then.

623
00:39:14,057 --> 00:39:15,057
- Come here. - Yoon Seo...

624
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:16,957
Good grief.

625
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:20,897
Back then,

626
00:39:21,597 --> 00:39:24,366
I could hold out because I had you.

627
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:25,636
(Ha Yoon Seo)

628
00:39:29,176 --> 00:39:30,275
(Korea National University)

629
00:39:30,276 --> 00:39:31,306
(Name: Ha Yoon Seo)

630
00:39:31,307 --> 00:39:32,647
(You've been admitted to the Class of 2010.)

631
00:39:43,986 --> 00:39:45,557
Ji Seok, wake up.

632
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:50,627
Why, Yoon Seo?

633
00:39:50,656 --> 00:39:51,667
Here, put this on.

634
00:40:04,606 --> 00:40:07,406
Leaving that miserable home with you...

635
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:11,276
was one of the best things I ever did.

636
00:40:24,497 --> 00:40:25,497
What?

637
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:28,196
Thanks, Yoon Seo.

638
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:31,296
For leaving with me.

639
00:41:31,897 --> 00:41:32,926
Let's go.

640
00:41:38,736 --> 00:41:40,836
Because your tiny hand felt so warm that day,

641
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:45,106
I could hold out no matter how difficult things got.

642
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:03,227
Yoon Seo.

643
00:42:05,227 --> 00:42:07,267
If there's anything you want to say, just let it out.

644
00:42:08,397 --> 00:42:09,836
You can yell and swear at me.

645
00:42:10,066 --> 00:42:12,267
You can hit me too, so please...

646
00:42:16,077 --> 00:42:18,077
Please don't ignore me like this.

647
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:20,247
Hey.

648
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:23,977
What did you think when you saw him get bullied like that?

649
00:42:27,247 --> 00:42:28,986
It really didn't remind you of anything?

650
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,156
You know...

651
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:36,127
how horrible it feels to be trampled on because you're weak.

652
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:40,097
So, how could you do this?

653
00:42:41,537 --> 00:42:44,097
Sorry, Yoon Seo. I'm sorry.

654
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:48,676
Once, when I was little,

655
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:50,376
he hit me for hours,

656
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:52,076
- and I tried to run away. - Help me!

657
00:42:52,077 --> 00:42:54,676
- Help! - Hey, Yoon Seo!

658
00:42:55,276 --> 00:42:58,147
You little... Stop right there!

659
00:42:58,247 --> 00:42:59,416
- Help! - Hey!

660
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:00,746
- I screamed. - Hey!

661
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:02,255
- Help! - To be saved.

662
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:04,356
- When I catch you... - I screamed for help.

663
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:06,057
Hey, watch where you're going.

664
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:07,756
Yoon Seo!

665
00:43:09,397 --> 00:43:12,397
I'll catch you and teach you a lesson. Come here!

666
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:14,627
Come here.

667
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,466
You little... Come here.

668
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:20,005
Come here.

669
00:43:20,006 --> 00:43:22,207
- Let go! - No, let's go home.

670
00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:24,207
- Come on. - But...

671
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:26,707
- Yoon Seo! - no one helped me.

672
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:30,675
- Many walked by, but no one helped. - Help!

673
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:32,046
Be quiet!

674
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:34,517
- Come here. - Help...

675
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:39,086
Help!

676
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:41,997
Still to this day,

677
00:43:42,597 --> 00:43:45,196
I can't forget seeing those people turn their heads away.

678
00:43:46,397 --> 00:43:47,997
If you had to turn a blind eye to it...

679
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:52,267
out of fear because those guys are stronger than you,

680
00:43:53,937 --> 00:43:55,537
I can understand.

681
00:43:58,037 --> 00:43:59,377
But that wasn't the case.

682
00:44:01,147 --> 00:44:02,417
Your friends...

683
00:44:03,816 --> 00:44:05,417
You could have stopped them.

684
00:44:09,386 --> 00:44:10,617
I feel like...

685
00:44:11,886 --> 00:44:14,356
I failed to take good care of you,

686
00:44:17,097 --> 00:44:18,627
and it really breaks my heart.

687
00:44:36,147 --> 00:44:39,546
Dating was the least of my worries.

688
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:56,097
Have a drink.

689
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,606
You can get drunk when it's just us.

690
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:02,336
A day like this deserves the hard stuff.

691
00:45:02,676 --> 00:45:04,037
- Si Won. - What?

692
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:07,477
Why did she do it?

693
00:45:07,946 --> 00:45:08,977
Who do you mean?

694
00:45:09,216 --> 00:45:10,377
Mother.

695
00:45:12,617 --> 00:45:16,386
She was cold, but she always made the right call.

696
00:45:17,917 --> 00:45:19,457
I always respected her.

697
00:45:22,557 --> 00:45:24,327
I didn't think she'd be so disrespectful.

698
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:28,167
I tried to understand her at least once.

699
00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:31,937
For what she did to Yoon Seo over dinner...

700
00:45:34,336 --> 00:45:36,136
I tried to make sense of it.

701
00:45:48,117 --> 00:45:49,117
Ju Won.

702
00:45:50,517 --> 00:45:53,227
I once loved someone as much as you do now.

703
00:45:56,026 --> 00:45:57,727
She was a junior of mine in college.

704
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:00,127
I fell for her and pursued her.

705
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:02,966
She came from a decent family.

706
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:05,936
Her father owned a medium-sized company,

707
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:09,776
so she was decently rich and decently spoiled.

708
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:13,207
However, Mother disapproved.

709
00:46:15,977 --> 00:46:18,175
At first, I considered Mother...

710
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,847
an obstacle in love that I had to overcome.

711
00:46:21,386 --> 00:46:24,156
It was as if we were like Romeo and Juliet,

712
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:27,687
and the harder it got, the harder I fell in love.

713
00:46:28,156 --> 00:46:31,026
So why did you break up?

714
00:46:35,136 --> 00:46:36,497
She told me...

715
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:41,466
being with me had become just too hard.

716
00:46:43,336 --> 00:46:46,807
The longer she stayed with me the more miserable she felt.

717
00:46:47,477 --> 00:46:49,946
She said she felt trivial and worthless.

718
00:46:52,216 --> 00:46:53,586
She begged me to let her go.

719
00:46:56,086 --> 00:46:57,517
Seeing you now...

720
00:46:58,356 --> 00:47:00,756
reminded me of those days, and I felt for you.

721
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:04,756
So here I am, getting involved and giving you silly advice.

722
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:07,897
Ju Won.

723
00:47:09,066 --> 00:47:11,696
Think carefully about what would be best...

724
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:14,236
for Yoon Seo.

725
00:47:28,687 --> 00:47:31,057
Ever since she broke up with me,

726
00:47:31,586 --> 00:47:34,727
all I thought about was how to get Yoon Seo back.

727
00:47:35,656 --> 00:47:36,656
Yoon Seo.

728
00:47:37,656 --> 00:47:38,667
Wait.

729
00:47:38,827 --> 00:47:40,127
I was desperate.

730
00:47:40,997 --> 00:47:42,537
Will you really break up with me?

731
00:47:43,537 --> 00:47:46,406
I pretended I didn't hear her or understand.

732
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:48,477
I clung to her.

733
00:47:51,776 --> 00:47:54,676
I didn't consider her at all.

734
00:47:56,716 --> 00:47:58,546
(Manager Ha Yoon Seo)

735
00:48:38,386 --> 00:48:40,086
Sorry I called so late at night.

736
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:44,256
There's something I must say tonight.

737
00:48:46,497 --> 00:48:49,667
I came over to say something as well.

738
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:50,867
No.

739
00:48:53,236 --> 00:48:54,707
I'll go first.

740
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:01,077
I know I confused you for a while.

741
00:49:02,077 --> 00:49:03,117
I'm sorry.

742
00:49:05,117 --> 00:49:07,787
To be honest I was confused myself.

743
00:49:08,856 --> 00:49:10,756
It was a sudden breakup,

744
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:13,827
and it wasn't because I'd grown to dislike you.

745
00:49:15,397 --> 00:49:17,196
I didn't know what to do.

746
00:49:19,526 --> 00:49:21,296
I let you lead me on.

747
00:49:22,997 --> 00:49:24,066
That's the truth.

748
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:26,937
But...

749
00:49:30,937 --> 00:49:32,847
I won't waver anymore.

750
00:49:34,807 --> 00:49:37,476
There are a lot of things...

751
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,747
I must strive to protect other than love.

752
00:49:40,617 --> 00:49:42,256
I'm sorry for asking to break up...

753
00:49:42,886 --> 00:49:44,986
only to drag things on.

754
00:49:49,897 --> 00:49:50,997
We should...

755
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:57,097
end it here and now.

756
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:00,767
Let's...

757
00:50:03,276 --> 00:50:04,636
call it quits.

758
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,017
What are your plans...

759
00:50:17,356 --> 00:50:18,386
for tomorrow?

760
00:50:19,287 --> 00:50:20,326
For tomorrow?

761
00:50:20,327 --> 00:50:21,756
Shall we go somewhere to hang out?

762
00:50:22,557 --> 00:50:24,727
- What? - I'll cancel...

763
00:50:25,497 --> 00:50:27,196
the rest of our dinners.

764
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:29,836
Let's go have fun.

765
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:32,906
We don't have to break up sadly out here.

766
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,136
We can laugh and have fun.

767
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,506
Let's have a great day together.

768
00:50:41,707 --> 00:50:43,776
That's how I'd like to spend our last day.

769
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:46,917
Can't we?

770
00:51:01,327 --> 00:51:02,397
Okay.

771
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:04,466
Let's do that.

772
00:51:12,847 --> 00:51:15,147
You want to break up here?

773
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:18,846
Isn't this place too full of hope...

774
00:51:18,847 --> 00:51:21,516
and dreams to break up?

775
00:51:21,517 --> 00:51:23,287
What is a good place to break up?

776
00:51:23,756 --> 00:51:26,687
A park? A cafe? Outside someone's home?

777
00:51:27,827 --> 00:51:29,796
We've been through a lot.

778
00:51:30,327 --> 00:51:32,926
Let's have lots of fun today.

779
00:51:33,566 --> 00:51:35,937
Do you know the phrase "get your money's worth?"

780
00:51:36,037 --> 00:51:37,565
"Get your money's worth?"

781
00:51:37,566 --> 00:51:39,366
It means to do something as best you can...

782
00:51:39,367 --> 00:51:41,606
so you don't think about or regret the cost.

783
00:51:42,037 --> 00:51:44,606
I know what the phrase means,

784
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:47,175
but do rich people use it too?

785
00:51:47,176 --> 00:51:48,307
Yes.

786
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,577
I'll show you today that the rich are even stingier.

787
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:54,886
Let's get our money's worth of these all-day passes.

788
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:10,666
I'll finalize the contract, then.

789
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:13,807
See you next week at the signing ceremony.

790
00:52:14,136 --> 00:52:18,176
I hope all goes well. See you then.

791
00:52:18,276 --> 00:52:19,406
Thank you.

792
00:52:23,577 --> 00:52:24,917
Yes, I'm off work.

793
00:52:28,886 --> 00:52:29,917
I'm off.

794
00:52:31,517 --> 00:52:33,086
Sebastian, are you ready?

795
00:52:36,597 --> 00:52:37,626
What happened?

796
00:52:37,627 --> 00:52:40,127
Did drunk me turn this on before going to bed?

797
00:52:43,937 --> 00:52:46,466
Good for you, Si Won.

798
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:49,537
Shall I clean the house, then?

799
00:52:54,446 --> 00:52:55,816
What happened?

800
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:59,117
Did I clean the place before going to bed?

801
00:53:01,247 --> 00:53:03,187
That's impossible.

802
00:53:04,287 --> 00:53:05,386
Now that I think about it...

803
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,655
We had this?

804
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:08,926
When did I buy it?

805
00:53:10,597 --> 00:53:12,796
What's wrong with me these days?

806
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:16,037
Do I have...

807
00:53:16,867 --> 00:53:18,597
alcohol-induced dementia?

808
00:53:20,537 --> 00:53:22,207
A doctor. I must see a doctor.

809
00:53:25,037 --> 00:53:26,175
No.

810
00:53:26,176 --> 00:53:28,046
If I saw a doctor and someone were to find out,

811
00:53:28,207 --> 00:53:29,847
our stock prices would fall.

812
00:53:31,546 --> 00:53:33,247
What should I do?

813
00:53:33,517 --> 00:53:34,586
Darling.

814
00:53:53,207 --> 00:53:55,367
You're almost impossible to see.

815
00:53:55,937 --> 00:53:57,176
Hi, sweetie.

816
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:02,417
You did away with...

817
00:54:02,946 --> 00:54:05,276
a lot of restrictions since I left.

818
00:54:05,586 --> 00:54:06,687
Both with the house...

819
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:09,156
and the dress code.

820
00:54:25,196 --> 00:54:26,506
You wanted to get your money's worth,

821
00:54:26,707 --> 00:54:28,106
and we're on a carousel?

822
00:54:28,437 --> 00:54:31,506
Yes. I can't go on the scary rides.

823
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,076
You don't like carousels?

824
00:54:33,077 --> 00:54:34,876
It's not that I don't like them.

825
00:54:34,877 --> 00:54:37,247
Don't you think a carousel ride...

826
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:39,546
wouldn't have cost that much money?

827
00:54:39,586 --> 00:54:41,585
- What? - To get your money's worth,

828
00:54:41,586 --> 00:54:44,057
you must go on a ride that clearly looks expensive.

829
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,956
Something big and grand...

830
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:49,926
with facilities that look like it cost a lot to set up.

831
00:54:50,296 --> 00:54:52,026
You lose out less that way.

832
00:54:54,727 --> 00:54:55,767
That's solid logic.

833
00:54:55,897 --> 00:54:58,196
Right? I knew it.

834
00:54:58,767 --> 00:55:00,135
The rich are clueless.

835
00:55:00,136 --> 00:55:02,577
They don't know what it really means to get your money's worth.

836
00:55:03,377 --> 00:55:04,807
I'll teach you how today.

837
00:55:05,307 --> 00:55:06,307
Okay.

838
00:55:07,776 --> 00:55:09,446
- Are you having fun? - Yes.

839
00:56:01,497 --> 00:56:02,497
You look silly.

840
00:56:04,437 --> 00:56:05,707
Goodness.

841
00:56:32,696 --> 00:56:34,667
You're enjoying yourself.

842
00:56:37,267 --> 00:56:38,336
I'm getting my money's worth.

843
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:41,966
The labor alone must cost a fortune here.

844
00:56:42,207 --> 00:56:43,577
Goodness.

845
00:56:43,807 --> 00:56:46,776
The princesses are out in force.

846
00:56:47,506 --> 00:56:50,216
Did you like to dress up as a princess when you were young?

847
00:56:51,017 --> 00:56:52,077
Of course not.

848
00:56:52,716 --> 00:56:56,316
Princesses just give kids weird fantasies.

849
00:56:56,557 --> 00:56:57,787
Like what?

850
00:56:58,216 --> 00:57:00,585
That a prince on horseback will come to their rescue...

851
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:01,957
when they're in trouble?

852
00:57:04,426 --> 00:57:05,497
Shall we go now?

853
00:57:45,236 --> 00:57:46,367
I like this one.

854
00:57:58,477 --> 00:57:59,517
Let's take a photo together.

855
00:58:14,267 --> 00:58:15,466
That day,

856
00:58:16,136 --> 00:58:18,397
we didn't take a single photo.

857
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:26,446
Were we unsure we could stand preserving the memory of a breakup?

858
00:58:29,477 --> 00:58:31,077
Our last day together...

859
00:58:31,747 --> 00:58:33,716
was setting with the sun.

860
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:47,897
Dad...

861
00:58:48,796 --> 00:58:50,267
Mom...

862
00:58:50,497 --> 00:58:52,336
Dad...

863
00:58:53,136 --> 00:58:55,037
Mom...

864
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:57,437
Dad!

865
00:58:58,336 --> 00:59:00,106
Mom!

866
00:59:08,187 --> 00:59:09,287
Don't cry.

867
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:11,287
Did you lose your mom and dad?

868
00:59:13,026 --> 00:59:14,156
I'll find them for you.

869
00:59:15,227 --> 00:59:19,296
Do you remember where you last saw Mom and Dad?

870
00:59:20,196 --> 00:59:21,767
Prince Charming.

871
00:59:24,836 --> 00:59:26,706
- Hyo Jin. - Mom.

872
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:28,266
Oh, my gosh.

873
00:59:28,267 --> 00:59:30,275
- Goodness. - Where did you go?

874
00:59:30,276 --> 00:59:31,876
- Thank you. - Not at all.

875
00:59:31,877 --> 00:59:32,946
Thank you.

876
00:59:40,687 --> 00:59:41,687
Goodbye.

877
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,816
- Bye. - Bye.

878
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:46,727
Let's go. Thanks so much.

879
00:59:48,227 --> 00:59:49,256
Come along.

880
00:59:54,397 --> 00:59:55,426
Let's go.

881
01:00:02,937 --> 01:00:04,006
Did you hear that?

882
01:00:04,236 --> 01:00:05,477
She called me "Prince Charming."

883
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:07,606
I didn't hear that.

884
01:00:08,446 --> 01:00:09,716
Did you mistake what she said?

885
01:00:09,747 --> 01:00:12,347
No. She called me a prince.

886
01:00:13,546 --> 01:00:15,486
She'd lost her parents and was crying,

887
01:00:15,647 --> 01:00:17,716
and I think she was moved that I stopped to help.

888
01:00:22,287 --> 01:00:23,296
See?

889
01:00:24,196 --> 01:00:25,966
Princes aren't all bad.

890
01:00:31,397 --> 01:00:33,466
I know you don't need a prince.

891
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:35,977
You can get through hardships...

892
01:00:36,506 --> 01:00:38,606
on your own just fine.

893
01:00:39,977 --> 01:00:40,977
But...

894
01:00:44,147 --> 01:00:45,377
I thought...

895
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:50,457
you'd need someone to lean on when life is extra hard.

896
01:00:56,356 --> 01:00:57,727
I hoped that would be me.

897
01:01:04,566 --> 01:01:06,466
I wanted to make you the happiest.

898
01:01:08,767 --> 01:01:11,406
I'm sorry I made your life the hardest.

899
01:01:26,957 --> 01:01:28,526
Our day is almost over.

900
01:01:31,957 --> 01:01:34,267
You hadn't smiled at me in a long time.

901
01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:37,767
I was so happy today it felt almost magical.

902
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:44,437
It's time for the magic to end.

903
01:01:48,577 --> 01:01:49,716
I should...

904
01:01:55,147 --> 01:01:56,756
let you go, right?

905
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:17,307
Should I?

906
01:03:04,886 --> 01:03:08,057
Stars sparkled, fireworks went off,

907
01:03:08,227 --> 01:03:09,796
and soapy bubbles flew.

908
01:03:17,597 --> 01:03:20,606
We were the only two people there...

909
01:03:20,937 --> 01:03:22,406
who were unhappy.

910
01:03:45,597 --> 01:03:46,666
(Sorry for texting. I couldn't forget you.)

911
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:50,296
They're clearly things an ex-boyfriend would send.

912
01:03:50,437 --> 01:03:53,335
Don't you think this was wrong when we decided to break up?

913
01:03:53,336 --> 01:03:54,336
(Are you well? I am if you are.)

914
01:03:55,236 --> 01:03:57,807
I can't forget the desperate messages.

915
01:03:58,736 --> 01:03:59,846
"Yoon Seo's phone?"

916
01:03:59,847 --> 01:04:01,406
Ms. Ha, have you been in this car before?

917
01:04:02,106 --> 01:04:03,347
Babe, eat up.

918
01:04:03,816 --> 01:04:04,847
"Babe?"

919
01:04:05,477 --> 01:04:08,247
Whenever I get a text from you,

920
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,057
I feel rattled.

921
01:04:12,856 --> 01:04:13,886
Yoon Seo.

922
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:16,057
I left everything behind.
