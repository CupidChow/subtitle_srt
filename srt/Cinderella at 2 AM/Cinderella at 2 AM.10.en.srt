Hey, what's the occasion this early in the morning?

14
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:11,723
I was taken aback by the news article.

15
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:13,022
Is Ju Won okay?

16
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:15,633

Yes, I'll call you later.

The husband of AL Group's chairwoman Kim Seon Ju,

20

CEO Seo Dong Jin of AL Global,

21
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:34,412
has shocked people after it was revealed that he has been living...

22
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:37,284
with a mistress in New York for the past two years.

23
00:01:37,653 --> 00:01:40,052
CEO Seo has disclosed that his marriage to Chairwoman Kim...

24
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:43,564
was already broken before he arrived in New York.

25
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:47,093
He claims the discord began after he lost in the general election...

26
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:50,192
and that they have been married in appearance only,

27
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,902
leaving nothing but distrust between them.

28
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:55,474
People are expecting a divorce suit of the century...

29
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:05,682
Yes, I understand. Please review it once more.

30
00:02:05,683 --> 00:02:06,683
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:11,553
What happened?

32
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,823
Father has asked for a divorce,

33
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:15,294
and I think Mother will prepare for the lawsuit.

34
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,623
Have you known about it?

35
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:18,323
Well, I expected as much,

36
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:20,334
but I didn't know he would go public with it like this.

37
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:21,992
As Father wanted,

38
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:24,164
the public opinion is going in a bad direction for Mother.

39
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,103
What about Mother?

40

Where is she now?

41
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:41,253
You must've been taken aback as I asked to see you amid all this.

42
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:43,454
I'll get straight to the point.

43
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:48,053
Your marriage with Ju Won...

44
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:49,854
I'll allow it.

45
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,264
But under one condition.

46
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:58,104
You should take charge of our scholarship foundation.

47
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:01,373
The scholarship foundation?

48
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:04,603
With rumors of arranged marriages and power trips,

49
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:06,503
the atmosphere on our side isn't too great at the moment.

50
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:11,014
We need a way to restore our image again.

51
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:15,513
So, let's open up about your entire background...

52
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:17,084
and proceed with your marriage.

53
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:23,023

00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:25,194

Gosh, no way.

59
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:42,312
Then will you become someone high up,

60
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:43,414
like a chairwoman or a director?

61
00:03:44,313 --> 00:03:46,143
Figures. It would be weird for the youngest daughter-in-law...

62
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,113
of AL Group to work at a different company.

63
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:50,523
And even if you do, everyone will find you uncomfortable.

64
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:52,584
It is pretty unrealistic.

65
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:57,092
But in order for me to take charge of the scholarship foundation,

66
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:59,794
I have to open up about my entire family history.

67
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:01,794
What? Why would you open up about your family history?

68
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:05,833
Well, the atmosphere at the company isn't great these days.

69
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,872
What? Because of the conglomerate family power trip issues?

70
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,443
Hey, but that's because that guy had an affair...

71
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:13,543
and was saying he had it hard...

72
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,473
in that family to justify his affair.

73
00:04:17,014 --> 00:04:19,043
Still, people seemed to buy it.

74
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:23,722
So, I think she believes that if Ju Won marries me,

75
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:26,053
someone who grew up...

76
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:27,553
in a worse-than-average household,

77
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:30,153
the company image will change.

78
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:31,693
She must be crazy.

79
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:32,694
Are you all right?

80
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:35,933
Honestly, I'm fine now...

81
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:39,304
since my family history isn't my fault.

82
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:42,673
But I feel bad about Ji Seok.

83
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:46,574
You're right. Ji Seok won't feel good if he reads articles like that.

84
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:51,112
Hey, but your personal details will go public someday anyhow.

85
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:53,282
And it's very likely that people talk about...

86

how you've gone up in class status and whatnot.

87
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:58,323
But if they just release an article from your perspective,

88
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:00,953
wouldn't that be better to spin the story how you want to?

89
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:02,324
That way, later on...

She looked like someone standing on the edge of a cliff.

Even when she was being attacked after the articles were released,

148

she came to see me first.

149
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:37,404

now is the only time you can console her.

161
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:18,012
Why are they asking me about the chairwoman?

162
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:19,944
It's not like I'm Director Seo's secretary.

163
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:23,553
If it had been back in the day,

164
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:25,982
I would've thought of this as the chairwoman's business.

165
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,222
But now, I think of it as something happening to the parent...

of someone I know. I feel kind of bad.

167
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,222
I know, right?

168
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:32,793

By the way, this is a secret,

172
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,933
but after I was promoted to manager,

173
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:42,403
I bought some of our company's stocks.

174
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:45,142
I thought my great performance might make the company better.

175
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:48,213
But our company's stock prices won't drop because of this, right?

176
00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:50,743
Gosh, they can't drop.

177
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:55,153
I was saying...

178
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:56,953
I didn't want my tie clip to drop.

179
00:09:56,954 --> 00:09:59,324
I bought a cheap one to imitate you, Director Seo...

180
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:04,923
What was that? Did something happen again?

181
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:06,793
I think something just happened to me.

182
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:08,392
You don't think he heard about the stock prices, do you?

183
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:11,304
What if I get demoted right after becoming a manager?

184
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:14,834
What do you want to tell me in private?

185
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:16,632
If you're going to take Mother's side, don't.

186
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,444
Hey, I can't defend her for that.

187
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:19,704
But...

188
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:22,343
I think what Yoon Seo said was right.

189
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:25,213
How about you put aside your anger for now...

190
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:27,213
and be a family member for her?

191
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:32,554
Well, Mother has never really been a motherly person to us,

192
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:34,924
but we've never been nice to her as sons either.

193
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:37,824
Actually,

194
00:10:38,564 --> 00:10:41,763
Mi Jin once invited Mother to my house after you left home.

195
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:44,034
She said Mother seemed lonely.

196
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:46,063
Both Mi Jin...

197
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:48,404
and Yoon Seo could see Mother's weakness.

198
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:51,074
But only us, her sons, couldn't see it.

199
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,674
(Counterclaim)

200
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:17,763
Mother.

201
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:22,334
Oh, what brings you here together at this hour?

202
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:28,814
If you're here because you're worried about your inheritance,

203
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:31,613
I'll make sure he can't touch what's meant for you.

204
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,713
Don't worry.

205
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:37,353
Let's go and have fun, Mother.

206
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,154
- "Have fun?" - Yes.

207
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,592
Let's take time off and have a cheat day.

208
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:43,722
"A cheat day?"

209
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:45,722
You little punk. How could you say such a thing?

210
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:47,534
- That word is banned. - Oh, right.

211
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:49,233
Mother.

212
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:52,103
Let's not have a cheat day. Let's go and lift our moods.

213
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:54,373
Forget it.

214
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:57,842
I have so much to take care of. I don't have time for that.

215
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,602
So, just take care of those things later.

216
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:01,842
Let's cool our heads first.

217
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:03,943
- Hey, grab her coat. - Okay.

218
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:06,284
- Mother. - Oh, my. Hey!

219
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:09,712
- Gosh, hey. What... - Hang on. Help me.

220
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:11,352
- Boys. - Here we go.

221
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:13,623
- Hey, I'll get her. - I'll get her legs.

222
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:17,053
Gosh, you're as light as a feather.

223
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:19,092
Hey, what are you doing?

224
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,892
- Gosh. - Here we go.

225
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:24,204
- What's wrong with you? - Seriously, how are you so light?

226
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:46,383
This is awkward.

227
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:49,794
Right? You've always sat in the backseat.

228
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:51,263
That's not what I mean.

229
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:53,392
Taking a cheat day...

230
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:54,434
I mean...

231
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:57,393
Going out to lift our moods.

232
00:12:58,404 --> 00:12:59,533
It feels strange.

233
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:00,534
Right.

234
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:04,003
I'm sure we're the only family that has never had an outing together.

235
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:06,774
But you know,

236
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:09,413
I haven't been able to do this because I was busy.

237
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,044
I've always cared and worried about you more than anyone.

238
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:15,453
Hey, Seo Ju Won.

239
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:18,054
Don't sit there like the boss and take out the lunch box.

240
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:20,423
- A lunch box? - Yes.

241
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,023
You want to eat in the car?

242
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:23,992
Yes, in case you were hungry on the way there,

243
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:26,824
I asked Ms. Park to prepare something simple.

244
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:31,033
So, we especially prepared a shrimp sandwich which you like.

245
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:32,632
- Shrimp? - Sounds good, right?

246
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:36,334
I don't eat shrimp these days because of my high cholesterol.

247
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:37,674
Didn't you know?

248
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:45,583
Then, how about some tomato juice which is good for your skin?

249
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:47,084
- Hey, tomato juice. - Okay.

250
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:50,413
Tomato? I don't like tomatoes.

251
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,684
I don't like how bland it tastes.

252
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:54,353
Didn't you know?

253
00:13:55,424 --> 00:13:56,722
Gosh, Mother.

254
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:58,992
You can't be such a picky eater at your age.

255
00:13:58,993 --> 00:14:01,263
You should eat a balanced diet to grow big and...

256
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:05,103
Oh, I guess you're done growing. Right.

257
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:10,573
Then, let's eat something good when we arrive.

258
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:12,204
We'll go to the sea with a great view...

259
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:14,043
- The sea? - Yes.

260
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:16,173
Ever since I nearly fell off a yacht,

261
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:17,882
I have had a traumatic memory of the sea.

262
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:18,914
Didn't you know?

263
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:23,054
Well...

264
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:26,153
We can take our time to learn about you.

265
00:14:26,154 --> 00:14:27,853
Let's make today about that, Mother.

266
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:30,852
Then, let's pass on going to the sea.

267
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,524
Which mountain is close by?

268
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:34,533
- Si Won, - What?

269
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:36,893
shall we listen to the radio on our way there?

270
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:38,163
Hey, that sounds good.

271
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:40,503
Mother, you like listening to the news, right?

272
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:42,633
(Radio)

273
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:45,842
This time, we'll hear about this week's hot topics.

274
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,773
It's being called the divorce suit of the century.

275
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:50,673
Everyone has been talking about the divorce of the AL Group couple.

276
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:51,944
What do you think about this?

277
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,102
- What? - What?

278
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,133
What's this?

279
00:15:12,664 --> 00:15:14,373
Why is this slowing down?

280
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:21,343
Hey, you're out of fuel.

281
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:22,414
What?

282
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:24,444
What?

283
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:35,554
But...

284
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,294
What on earth...

285
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:45,633
Yes, I understand.

286
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:51,473
Secretary Kim is coming now.

287
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:53,373
We should wait for whoever gets here first,

288
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:55,113
the insurance company or Secretary Kim.

289
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,784
Hey, how could you not even know that the car was out of fuel?

290
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:02,314
Well, it's not like I refuel the car myself.

291
00:16:02,784 --> 00:16:05,424
I've never cared about that stuff my whole life.

292
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:08,794
By the way, I think we should move the car to that side.

293
00:16:09,223 --> 00:16:10,623
We could get that far, couldn't we?

294
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:13,293
Well, if you and Mother give it a push.

295
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:16,434
What? You want me to push the car?

296
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:18,732
Wouldn't it be hard for Ju Won to do it alone?

297
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:21,034
- What will you be doing? - I should steer the car.

298
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:24,333
Of course, it is a bit awkward for you to push the car,

299
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:25,944
but you don't have a driver's license.

300
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:27,972
You said you couldn't drive yourself after the car accident trauma...

301
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:29,242
when you were seven years old.

302
00:16:29,243 --> 00:16:30,372
Oh, my.

303
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:32,482
How could you remember such things so well?

304
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:33,643
Don't get me wrong.

305
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:37,853
Hey, push harder!

306
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:40,423
Mother, please try harder.

307
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:41,492
That fool.

308
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:45,424
Push to the same rhythm. One, two!

309
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:50,092
One, two!

310
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,603
Just a bit more!

311
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:53,463
A bit more!

312
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:55,904
Okay!

313
00:16:57,904 --> 00:17:00,804
Okay, Mother, I think we're good.

314
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:07,913
Oh, my back.

315
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:12,254
Why are you laughing?

316
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:15,993
I just can't believe this sight right now.

317
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,122
Should I take a photo of you?

318
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,362
- What? No, don't take it. - Wait.

319
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:22,033
- Hey, you! - No, let's take one together, Mom!

320
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:23,593
- In 1, 2, 3! - In 1, 2, 3.

321
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:24,963
- Gosh, why are you doing this? - In 1, 2, 3.

322
00:17:24,964 --> 00:17:27,132
- Don't do this. - Hey, you should take one too.

323
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,432
- Hey, don't do that. Boys, don't. - Come on.

324
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:31,673
- No, don't do it. - In 1, 2, 3.

325
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:34,673
- Gosh, boys. - All right.

326
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:42,913
Mother, you should have some of this.

327
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:46,452
It may not be the Jamaica Blue Mountain that you like,

328
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:47,923
but I'm sure it's nice and sweet.

329
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:51,863
Don't you know that I'm managing my blood sugar levels?

330
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:54,464
Of course you don't.

331
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:16,153
Let me know if I can help throughout the lawsuit.

332
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:17,923
I'll help in any way I can.

333
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:23,653
The lawyer will take care of everything.

334
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,963
Having lawyers talk for you...

335
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:29,093
and having your own family talk for you will be very different.

336
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,663
I'm on your side too, Mother.

337
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,673
I want you to be happy.

338
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:43,413
Thank you.

339
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:53,382
I didn't get to eat anything.

340
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,023
Oh, Mother. They were selling toast over there too.

341
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:57,122
Should I buy some of that, at least?

342
00:18:57,123 --> 00:18:59,922
Oh, no. Forget about the toast.

343
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,994
I don't really like street food, you know.

344
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:08,603
You say that, but you finished your coffee.

345
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:14,103
I'll just go and buy some. Wait a little while. Here.

346
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,452
Whose idea was it?

347
00:19:26,453 --> 00:19:27,484
What?

348
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:29,593
To have a cheat day... I mean...

349
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:31,524
To come out to lift our moods.

350
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:35,693
I can tell it wasn't either of you. Who gave you this advice?

351
00:19:36,064 --> 00:19:37,093
Mi Jin?

352
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:39,863
Yoon Seo.

353
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:47,673
I met with her yesterday.

354
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:51,584
I said I'd allow your marriage...

355
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,714
but only if she took charge of our scholarship foundation.

356
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,024
I thought if we used her story of having overcome her poor background,

357
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:01,824
it might help our company's image.

358
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:05,623
Did you know about it?

359
00:20:07,494 --> 00:20:09,133
I happened to hear about it.

360
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:15,804
Yoon Seo told me...

361
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:19,203
that I could get angry anytime,

362
00:20:19,873 --> 00:20:21,413
but I could only console you now.

363
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:25,413
And that family is supposed to do that.

364
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:31,824
It may sound like an excuse,

365
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:34,993
but I thought someone who will become family anyway...

366
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:36,254
should be where she is needed.

367
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:39,893
Considering the profits of the company first...

368
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:43,294
was such an obvious thing for me.

369
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,203
But she said this to me.

370
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:47,963
And even if...

371
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:50,103
I take charge of the scholarship foundation,

372
00:20:50,703 --> 00:20:52,403
please don't let Ju Won know...

373
00:20:53,843 --> 00:20:55,373
about divulging my family background.

374
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,843
Even if the articles are published,

375
00:20:58,044 --> 00:20:59,382
I think it might be best that he doesn't know...

376
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,584
where the information came from.

377
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:02,084
Why?

378
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,153
Ju Won will worry.

379
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:11,893
And feel sorry.

380
00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:20,433
I only thought about the company, but she...

381
00:21:24,403 --> 00:21:25,843
only thought about you.

382
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:31,913
So, I was just feeling embarrassed...

383
00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:33,843
about whether I shouldn't have made that offer.

384
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:38,883
A happy family...

385
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:42,193
It was something I never had,

386
00:21:42,923 --> 00:21:44,994
so I wasn't able to give that to you boys either.

387
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,933
But I think she could give that to you.

388
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:56,834
Please tell her that we won't reveal her family background,

389
00:21:57,574 --> 00:21:58,574
and you should...

390
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:01,474
get married as soon as you can.

391
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:04,143
Well, that way,

392
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:06,814
my issue will blow over a bit.

393
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:09,353
I can hope for that much, right?

394
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:19,422
Mother, here.

395
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,663
- Oh, gosh! - Goodness!

396
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:23,132
My goodness, you.

397
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,432
Have one.

398
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:25,863
Thank you.

399
00:22:26,964 --> 00:22:28,933
- Cheers. - But...

400
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:35,673
(2 months later)

401
00:22:57,494 --> 00:22:58,663
Did you sleep well?

402
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:03,504
Seriously.

403
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:05,504
What do you think?

404
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:09,372
So, why not just go home right after the meeting?

405
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:11,043
Why drink so much?

406
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:13,243
You have a room in this house too. Sleep there.

407
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:15,213
Hey, once you get married,

408
00:23:15,214 --> 00:23:17,784
you won't be able to sleep next to me like this.

409
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:20,983
I barely managed to persuade Mi Jin to let me stay out...

410
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,652
after telling her that I wouldn't be able to have this time with you...

411
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,662
once you got married.

412
00:23:25,663 --> 00:23:28,633
So, why did you persuade her on that?

413
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:31,034
Gosh, I'm cold. Give me the blanket.

414
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:34,632
- What's wrong? - Get out.

415
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:36,372
- Come on. - Seriously, get out.

416
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,504
- Get out. - I'll catch a cold.

418
00:23:48,214 --> 00:23:49,412
Hello.

419
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:53,084
(AL Scholarship Foundation)

420
00:23:58,593 --> 00:23:59,623
- Hello. - Hello.

421
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:03,764
(AL Scholarship Foundation)

422
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:07,834
(Ha Yoon Seo)

423
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,573
Good morning.

424
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,842
- You're here. - Hello.

425
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:12,843
(Teen Support Division)

426
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:27,254
Do I send this via fax?

427
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:28,554
Oh, yes.

428
00:24:30,024 --> 00:24:33,293
By the way, why did Yoon Seo go to the Teen Support Division?

429
00:24:33,294 --> 00:24:34,794
She was interested in that field in the first place.

430
00:24:35,163 --> 00:24:36,234
No, what I mean is...

431
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,803
Mother offered the position of General Administration Director.

432
00:24:38,804 --> 00:24:40,264
Why did she take on a smaller division?

433
00:24:41,403 --> 00:24:44,534
I wanted to figure out each part of the work in order.

434
00:24:45,244 --> 00:24:47,943
Didn't you begin as a new recruit for the same reason?

435
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:49,343
Well, that's true,

436
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:53,343
but you actually want to work at the Scholarship Foundation, right?

437
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:54,683
Of course.

438
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:57,583
Actually, after I saw Artist Lee Sung Min...

439
00:24:57,584 --> 00:24:59,183
supporting young artists,

440
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:03,153
I thought about donating my talent to a social enterprise.

441
00:25:04,693 --> 00:25:06,693
When I first left home with Ji Seok,

442
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:09,192
I couldn't get any support...

443
00:25:09,193 --> 00:25:11,163
because we technically had parents on paper.

444
00:25:11,933 --> 00:25:13,334
It was pretty hard, to be honest.

445
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:15,974
So,

446
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:19,774
you should understand my perspective too, okay?

447
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:23,112
What's there to understand or not?

448
00:25:23,113 --> 00:25:24,673
Things were resolved in the end.

449
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:28,113
I was sorry about last time.

450
00:25:28,514 --> 00:25:32,183
I suddenly became so mad to think my sister wasn't being respected.

451
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:34,524
Ji Seok.

452
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:37,224
Respect from others isn't all that important.

453
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:40,893
I just have to know my own value.

454
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:54,574
Gosh, Yoon Seo is amazing.

455
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:57,313
Then, you guys must be really busy.

456
00:25:57,314 --> 00:25:58,583
Are your wedding preparations going well?

457
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:01,513
Of course. As you saw from the photos in my room,

458
00:26:01,514 --> 00:26:03,612
we already took our wedding photos.

459
00:26:03,613 --> 00:26:05,283
I chose the venue...

460
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:07,253
and the champagne we'll be having at the reception too.

461
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:09,324
I already picked out the bouquet design too.

462
00:26:09,353 --> 00:26:11,862
Wait. What about Yoon Seo?

463
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:13,264
She's busy.

464
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:17,764
Still, she said she'd come to see the wedding invitations for sure.

465
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:29,913
Well, it is pretty unique.

466
00:26:30,244 --> 00:26:31,544
"Pretty unique?"

467
00:26:32,214 --> 00:26:35,683
Gosh, my dear junior, you respected me so much when we were drinking.

468
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:37,382
Where did all that respect go?

469
00:26:37,383 --> 00:26:38,653
I don't know about that,

470
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:40,882
but I am grateful.

471
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,824
You must be busy with your upcoming exhibition.

472
00:26:43,254 --> 00:26:44,623
I am,

473
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:47,964
but I wanted to be the one to draw your wedding invitation.

474
00:26:48,564 --> 00:26:49,794
I went out of my way for this.

475
00:26:50,494 --> 00:26:52,633
Oh, Yoon Seo seemed really busy these days.

476
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,233
Can she come today?

477
00:26:54,234 --> 00:26:56,304
Come on. Of course she should come.

478
00:26:56,873 --> 00:26:58,543
It's the first time we see our wedding invitation.

479
00:26:58,544 --> 00:26:59,603
Right.

480
00:27:04,843 --> 00:27:06,143
Hey, are you on your way?

481
00:27:06,443 --> 00:27:09,054
Hey, I'm sorry. I don't think I can make it.

482
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:14,652
Well, I'm on my way back from a meeting now,

483
00:27:14,653 --> 00:27:15,922
and I was going to drop off the assistant manager...

484
00:27:15,923 --> 00:27:17,452
and go straight there.

485
00:27:17,453 --> 00:27:20,192
But we were asked to send over the schedule for...

486
00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:21,724
the scholarship certificate ceremony right away.

487
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,403
Yes.

488
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:28,933
Sorry, I think I'll have to see the invitation in a photo.

489
00:27:29,403 --> 00:27:31,473
I'm getting a call. Bye.

490
00:27:31,474 --> 00:27:32,974
Yoon Seo. Ha Yoon Seo.

491
00:27:42,683 --> 00:27:44,452
Just talk to me.

492
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:46,883
Although, it is a bit awkward for us to talk about wedding invitations.

493
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:49,153
Yes, well...

494
00:27:51,794 --> 00:27:54,893
However, this was only the beginning.

495
00:27:56,994 --> 00:27:58,393
Why did your meeting get pushed?

496
00:27:59,163 --> 00:28:01,203
Yoon Seo. Ha Yoon...

497
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:04,433
Should we postpone until tomorrow?

498
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:06,672
We can't push it back any further.

499
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:08,304
Then, pick things out with me.

500
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:10,574
I had to pick the wedding invitations with Lee Sung Min...

501
00:28:10,744 --> 00:28:12,682
and our furniture with Mi Jin.

502
00:28:12,683 --> 00:28:13,714
And even...

503
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:17,784
It will be a little uncomfortable to live above a newlywed couple.

504
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:19,984
But why can't Yoon Seo come?

505
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:22,093
Well...

506
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:24,794
She's going to headquarters...

507
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:26,824
to get additional funding.

508
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:28,024
I see.

509
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:30,494
I had to see our newlywed home...

510
00:28:31,234 --> 00:28:32,703
with Ji Seok.

511
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,774
Ju Won, let's go.

512
00:28:36,004 --> 00:28:37,574
- Oh, gosh. - Hey.

513
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:39,373
Ji Seok, are you okay?

514
00:28:39,903 --> 00:28:41,102
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

515
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:42,913
No, it's just a light sprain.

516
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:44,413
Can you hold me up a little more?

517
00:28:46,044 --> 00:28:48,753
Gosh, this place is really nice, though.

518
00:28:48,754 --> 00:28:51,613
The bathtub is big, so it would be nice for washing up.

519
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:53,824
- Right? - Yes.

520
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:55,693
It's perfect for a newlywed home.

521
00:28:56,254 --> 00:28:58,093
This house is meant to be the newlywed home...

522
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,122
of AL Group's youngest son, right?

523
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:01,123
Yes.

524
00:29:01,124 --> 00:29:04,663
Let's not fight in the future and live happily together, okay?

525
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:05,933
Okay.

526
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:09,474
There were rumors that the chairwoman opposed this marriage.

527
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:11,074
Was that perhaps...

528
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:15,513
Also, in order to quell an unexpected scandal,

529
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:17,074
the group had to step up.

530
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:19,113
But what was even harder than that was...

531
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:22,584
I missed Yoon Seo.

532
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:24,314
Is she very busy?

533
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,153
I'm not such a petty guy who gets mad over these things.

534
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:31,653
Right.

535
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:33,763
You can't come today either?

536
00:29:33,764 --> 00:29:35,533
No, I'm sorry.

537
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:38,603
I think we'll have to fix the list of scholarship recipients.

538
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:40,403
Do you have to finish that by today?

539
00:29:40,703 --> 00:29:43,602
We said we'd go see Uncle Jae Ha and Yi Rae since it's been a while.

540
00:29:43,603 --> 00:29:45,902
And we were going to see if Ji Seok is doing well working there.

541
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:48,474
Sorry. I'll reschedule a day to visit Yi Rae's.

542
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:51,143
I'll call you later when I'm done.

(Seo Si Won, Lee Mi Jin's 2nd wedding anniversary)

545
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:02,493
What if my husband cries his eyes out...

546
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:04,723
from being so moved after receiving this gift?

547
00:30:04,724 --> 00:30:06,793
(Seo Si Won, Lee Mi Jin's 2nd wedding anniversary)

548
00:30:06,794 --> 00:30:09,893
Did I go overboard with making it myself?

549
00:30:15,603 --> 00:30:16,633
Yes?

550
00:30:24,143 --> 00:30:26,443
Ms. Lee, Vice Chairman Seo Si Won sent this.

551
00:30:40,693 --> 00:30:42,933
Oh, my. How pretty.

552
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,383
Oh, your necklace.

553
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:09,054
Gosh, how pretty. It looks great on you.

554
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:11,393
When did you buy it?

555
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:18,464
Don't you know?

556
00:31:20,534 --> 00:31:21,564
I feel a chill.

557
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:24,703
I think I must know about this necklace.

558
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:31,113
Excuse me. Here is the cake you ordered.

559
00:31:31,843 --> 00:31:33,843
Oh, we didn't order a cake.

560
00:31:34,044 --> 00:31:35,284
You did.

561
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:36,584
Pardon?

562
00:31:36,814 --> 00:31:39,153
The person who made the reservation ordered it.

563
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:48,464
"Happy Wedding Day?"

564
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:55,303
- Wife... - Tell Secretary Kim...

565
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:56,932
- that I enjoyed the cake. - Let me explain...

566
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,473
And that I appreciate the gift too.

567
00:31:58,474 --> 00:31:59,573
Well, so I...

568
00:31:59,574 --> 00:32:01,173
You're finished, right? Let's get going.

569
00:32:05,943 --> 00:32:07,343
Wife. Mi Jin!

570
00:32:09,683 --> 00:32:10,683
Wife.

571
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:12,724
Come on. Mi Jin.

572
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:16,923
Let's go home separately.

573
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:18,623
Separately?

574
00:32:19,264 --> 00:32:20,264
Why?

575
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:24,793
I thought it was your idea...

576
00:32:24,794 --> 00:32:27,563
to send me a present and eat together today.

577
00:32:27,564 --> 00:32:29,804
I thought you wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

578
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,103
I'm sorry.

579
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:36,013
Since we haven't celebrate our anniversary before...

580
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:39,143
I know that, but now...

581
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:43,953
But now, I like you.

582
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:48,254
So, I thought things would be different this time.

583
00:32:52,324 --> 00:32:53,593
I'll be going first.

584
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:55,224
Hey, Mi Jin...

585
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:05,903
Gosh, darn it.

586
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:14,784

(Seo Ju Won)

589
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,093
Hello?

590
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:34,003
This isn't who you think it is.

591
00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:36,304
This is Uncle Jae Ha.

592
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:38,903
Why are you answering the phone?

593
00:33:39,304 --> 00:33:40,574
Is Ju Won there?

594
00:33:49,683 --> 00:33:51,753
I said we should come some other time.

595
00:33:51,754 --> 00:33:53,254
Why are you here?

596
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:56,254
Well, Father-in-law said he cooked for us...

597
00:33:57,393 --> 00:34:00,922
I mean, Uncle Jae Ha cooked chicken soup that's not even on the menu.

598
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:02,862
He and Ji Seok boiled it for three hours.

599
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:03,994
How could I not come?

600
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:09,504
I'm sorry. But you know how things are for me these days.

601
00:34:10,904 --> 00:34:13,543
I know. Your work is more important than me.

602
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:16,143
You know I'm busy with an important project coming up.

603
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,073
I know.

604
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:22,254
The meticulous Ha Yoon Seo has to mind every detail from 1 to 10.

605
00:34:28,183 --> 00:34:29,424
What's with your manner of speech?

606
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:31,352
What's with your glare?

607
00:34:31,353 --> 00:34:33,293
- Are you picking a fight? - I've held it in for a long time.

608
00:34:33,294 --> 00:34:34,622
What did you hold in?

609
00:34:34,623 --> 00:34:36,093
This is way too much.

610
00:34:36,094 --> 00:34:37,463
You work so hard,

611
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:39,162
but how could you be so haphazard about our wedding plans?

612
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,003
What? "Haphazard?"

613
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:42,634
Yes, haphazard.

614
00:34:42,774 --> 00:34:43,932
I chose the venue,

615
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:45,543
the champagne we'll drink at the reception,

616
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:47,903
and even the bouquet design.

617
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:50,412
This will be a simple wedding with just family,

618
00:34:50,413 --> 00:34:51,943
so all the venues are pretty much the same.

619
00:34:51,944 --> 00:34:55,484
And you've had more champagne than I have, so I left it to you.

620
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:58,083
And bouquets all seem similar to me.

621
00:34:58,084 --> 00:34:59,122
What do you want me to do?

622
00:34:59,123 --> 00:35:00,654
"What do you want me to do?"

623
00:35:01,254 --> 00:35:02,993
Gosh, seriously.

624
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:04,923
I really wasn't going to say this,

625
00:35:04,924 --> 00:35:06,492
but I chose the wedding invitations with Lee Sung Min.

626
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:07,762
I chose the furniture with Mi Jin.

627
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:09,963
The house? I looked at it with Ji Seok.

628
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:12,463
I saw the invitation in the photos and the furniture in the catalog.

629
00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:14,432
And we said we'd go see the house again next week.

630
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:15,702
What's the problem?

631
00:35:15,703 --> 00:35:17,532
No, this is a huge problem.

632
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,742
You have to check with your own eyes and feel it with your hands to know.

633
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,472
I was so upset and lonely yesterday...

634
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:24,143
that I even bought a plant on my way home.

635
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:28,314
What does that have to do with a plant?

636
00:35:29,814 --> 00:35:30,814
What?

637
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:34,223
Are you the logical type?

638
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:37,452
Excuse me, guys.

639
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:39,322
The owner here says not to fight at someone else's business...

640
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:40,424
and to leave.

641
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:45,904
We're doing business here.

642
00:35:52,873 --> 00:35:53,944
Gosh.

643
00:36:03,754 --> 00:36:04,984
He's being so harsh.

644
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:07,722
I'm worried I might disgrace him if I don't do a good job.

645
00:36:07,723 --> 00:36:09,953
I'm working so hard with gritted teeth.

646
00:36:13,993 --> 00:36:15,694
(The sofa you ordered will be delivered tomorrow afternoon.)

647
00:36:18,564 --> 00:36:22,504
I didn't even thank Mi Jin for helping us choose our furniture.

(Senior Managing Director Lee Mi Jin)

649
00:36:29,674 --> 00:36:32,413
Is it better to call or text?

650
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:38,183
Gosh. It's late anyway. Let's do it tomorrow.

651
00:36:42,084 --> 00:36:43,654
Hello? Yoon Seo?

652
00:36:44,623 --> 00:36:46,294
Hello? Yoon Seo?

653
00:36:46,694 --> 00:36:47,694
What?

654
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,334
Yoon Seo.

655

(Senior Managing Director Lee Mi Jin)

656
00:36:51,763 --> 00:36:52,763
What do I do?

657
00:36:55,103 --> 00:36:56,504
Hello? Yoon Seo?

658
00:36:58,433 --> 00:36:59,673
Hello.

659
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:00,943
Yes, is something wrong?

660
00:37:00,944 --> 00:37:03,013
Oh, well, I...

661
00:37:04,743 --> 00:37:07,613
I was supposed to go look at furniture,

662
00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:09,683
but I wasn't able to make it. I wanted to say sorry.

663
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:12,653
Oh, you don't have to apologize to me.

664
00:37:12,654 --> 00:37:14,822
It took a lot of effort to pick them out, so use them well.

665
00:37:14,823 --> 00:37:15,953
It's my wedding gift.

666
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:19,064
Don't say that. It's way too much.

667
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:21,194
Then buy me a drink later.

668
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:22,733
A drink?

669
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:25,433
Yes. I want to get to know you.

670
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:28,963
I was going to call to ask you out to dinner,

671
00:37:28,964 --> 00:37:31,274
but you seemed so busy. Are you still at work?

672
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:34,603
No. I left work, and I'm on my way home.

673
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:37,314
Then can we meet for a drink now?

674
00:37:37,774 --> 00:37:39,183
Right now?

675
00:37:39,444 --> 00:37:41,782
Yes. I seriously need one right now.

676
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:43,553
Where are you? Let's meet.

677
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,222
I looked forward to getting a drink with you,

678
00:37:52,223 --> 00:37:53,723
and that day is today.

679
00:37:53,864 --> 00:37:54,864
It is.

680
00:37:56,993 --> 00:37:58,233
Hello, Ms. Lee.

681
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,833
Is it okay that I didn't make a reservation? Is the room free?

682
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:02,602
Well, no.

683
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:05,302
Some guests booked the room long ago.

684
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:06,703
I'll see what I can do.

685
00:38:10,513 --> 00:38:12,583
I'm sorry, Yoon Seo. I should've called ahead.

686
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:16,183
No, it's okay. I don't mind where we drink.

687
00:38:16,384 --> 00:38:18,384
I'm worried you might feel uncomfortable.

688
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:25,053
Can I take you to a place I often go?

689
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:28,094
Somewhere you often go?

690
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:29,634
Yes.

691
00:38:31,364 --> 00:38:33,064
- Here you go. - Thank you.

692
00:38:33,263 --> 00:38:36,472
You'll have your usual soju and beer, right?

693
00:38:36,473 --> 00:38:37,473
Yes.

694
00:38:37,474 --> 00:38:38,802
- Enjoy yourselves. - Thanks.

695
00:38:38,803 --> 00:38:40,572
Call if you need anything.

696
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:41,603
- Okay. - Good.

697
00:38:41,674 --> 00:38:43,972
This place has the aura of a famous restaurant.

698
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:45,814
The food really is good too.

699
00:38:51,714 --> 00:38:52,723
Gosh.

700
00:38:56,853 --> 00:38:58,254
- Shall we? - Sure.

701
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:07,703
That was stupid of me.

702
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:10,234
I forgot our wedding anniversary.

703
00:39:11,473 --> 00:39:13,973
You darn lunatic.

704
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:32,924
Hello, darling husband.

705
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:35,293
You know our wedding anniversary is coming up, right?

706
00:39:35,294 --> 00:39:38,162
It feels a bit different this time.

707
00:39:38,163 --> 00:39:41,504
Is it because it's the first one since I got to like you?

708
00:39:42,134 --> 00:39:44,774
So I prepared a little something.

709
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:47,143
Ta-da.

710
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:51,643
It's a present.

711
00:39:52,114 --> 00:39:54,983
We went out for makgeolli once.

712
00:39:54,984 --> 00:39:58,613
I think of that time often, so I'm making makgeolli cups.

713
00:39:58,614 --> 00:40:00,352
Let's have another drink.

714
00:40:00,353 --> 00:40:03,024
Congratulations on marrying me, darling.

715
00:40:03,553 --> 00:40:04,953
You're really blessed.

716
00:40:05,754 --> 00:40:07,123
I'll show you how this works.

717
00:40:16,603 --> 00:40:17,603
I'm back.

718
00:40:18,234 --> 00:40:19,243
Hi.

719
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:20,944
You're still up?

720
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,873
The second hearing's next week.

721
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:27,384
I had a lot on my mind, so I was having a glass of wine.

722
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:33,024
What about you? Are wedding preparations going well?

723
00:40:34,123 --> 00:40:35,154
Yes, I guess?

724
00:40:35,254 --> 00:40:38,623
I knew Yoon Seo would do a thoroughly good job,

725
00:40:38,794 --> 00:40:40,024
but she's doing better than expected.

726
00:40:40,424 --> 00:40:43,162
She visited every agency and organization for a meeting...

727
00:40:43,163 --> 00:40:45,433
to select people who she believes are eligible for a scholarship.

728
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:47,662
Many children are neglected by people...

729
00:40:47,663 --> 00:40:51,033
who, on paper, are their parents who are alive and well,

730
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:53,404
so she's selecting candidates from scratch.

731
00:41:14,893 --> 00:41:16,234
(Yoon Seo)

732
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:24,834
(Seo Si Won, Lee Mi Jin's 2nd wedding anniversary)

733
00:41:30,774 --> 00:41:32,473
(Seo Si Won, Lee Mi Jin's 2nd wedding anniversary)

734
00:41:34,214 --> 00:41:35,413
You lunatic.

735
00:41:36,654 --> 00:41:39,114
You don't deserve to be loved.

736
00:41:48,294 --> 00:41:49,794
(Mi Jin)

737
00:41:53,703 --> 00:41:55,533
(Call history: Yoon Seo)

738
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,203
She'll be so angry.

739
00:41:57,234 --> 00:41:58,234
Darn it.

740
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:01,174
Is she out there somewhere crying?

741
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:03,114
Cheers.

742
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:06,614
This is no joke.

743
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:09,044
You're a heavy drinker, Ms. Lee.

744
00:42:09,654 --> 00:42:12,214
Why do you keep calling me "Ms. Lee?"

745
00:42:12,484 --> 00:42:14,484
Shouldn't we get our titles straight?

746
00:42:14,623 --> 00:42:16,622
Oh, then...

747
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:17,623
"Sister-in-law?"

748
00:42:17,624 --> 00:42:18,693
"Sister-in-law?"

749
00:42:18,694 --> 00:42:21,492
Yes, I'm your sister-in-law now.

750
00:42:21,493 --> 00:42:22,794
And you are mine.

751
00:42:23,163 --> 00:42:24,964
Yes, sister-in-law.

752
00:42:32,844 --> 00:42:36,413
Did you have a bad day today?

753
00:42:36,444 --> 00:42:38,012
- Why? - Earlier,

754
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,814
you said you seriously needed a drink.

755
00:42:42,114 --> 00:42:43,953
Si Won and I fought.

756
00:42:44,714 --> 00:42:46,452
I fought with Ju Won too.

757
00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:48,423
- You did? Why? - Yes.

758
00:42:48,424 --> 00:42:52,322
He said I didn't care much about the wedding preparations.

759
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:55,492
I'm having the worst time ever getting used to an unfamiliar job.

760
00:42:55,493 --> 00:42:57,262
Can't he put in a little more effort?

761
00:42:57,263 --> 00:42:59,602
Right. If you're working hard,

762
00:42:59,603 --> 00:43:02,163
you won't have attention to spare on the wedding.

763
00:43:02,504 --> 00:43:04,734
I didn't think Ju Won was like that.

764
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,174
He's petty.

765
00:43:06,803 --> 00:43:10,643
Petty isn't the word I'd use to describe him.

766
00:43:11,013 --> 00:43:12,843
Why did you and Si Won fight?

767
00:43:12,844 --> 00:43:16,114
Today's our wedding anniversary, and he forgot about it.

768
00:43:16,353 --> 00:43:18,552
I was so pleased to get a gift,

769
00:43:18,553 --> 00:43:20,323
but his secretary had picked it out.

770
00:43:20,553 --> 00:43:23,694
That's not nice. He should've gotten a gift himself.

771
00:43:23,723 --> 00:43:24,924
That's horrible.

772
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:29,933
It's not exactly horrible but...

773
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:33,532
To be honest, isn't Mother the real horrible one?

774
00:43:33,533 --> 00:43:34,802
I can finally say this,

775
00:43:34,803 --> 00:43:37,003
but how could she give you money...

776
00:43:37,004 --> 00:43:38,932
and ask you to leave her son?

777
00:43:38,933 --> 00:43:42,503
You're capable, great at your job, and have outstanding character.

778
00:43:42,504 --> 00:43:45,643
You make a mean soju and beer mixer too.

779
00:43:46,484 --> 00:43:47,813
Exactly.

780
00:43:47,814 --> 00:43:50,614
We should barge in and complain.

781
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:52,352
Complain?

782
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:53,353
Yes.

783
00:43:53,424 --> 00:43:56,723
Whose fault is it that we're upset today?

784
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:01,392
We're upset because of Mother's two sons.

785
00:44:01,393 --> 00:44:05,334
We must go over there and figure out who's at fault.

786
00:44:05,663 --> 00:44:06,663
Yes.

787
00:44:07,964 --> 00:44:09,163
(Husband)

788
00:44:09,364 --> 00:44:10,373
My gosh.

789
00:44:17,944 --> 00:44:19,444
Hey, husband.

790
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:23,083
Me? I'm out drinking with Yoon Seo.

791
00:44:23,084 --> 00:44:25,613
No, don't bother coming over.

792
00:44:25,614 --> 00:44:29,353
We're going to Mother's to get a few things straight.

793
00:44:29,794 --> 00:44:30,794
What?

794
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:34,194
Darling wife. You'll go to Mother to get what things straight?

795
00:44:35,024 --> 00:44:37,533
Honey. Mi Jin?

796
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:41,904
This is bad.

797
00:44:42,564 --> 00:44:43,603
Hang on.

798
00:44:44,404 --> 00:44:45,933
This is really bad.

799
00:44:49,243 --> 00:44:50,572
Ju Won, Code Red.

800
00:44:50,573 --> 00:44:53,642
Yoon Seo and Mi Jin are going to Mother's to complain.

801
00:44:53,643 --> 00:44:55,544
Wait outside and stop them...

802
00:44:56,214 --> 00:44:58,713
What? You're not at home?

803
00:44:58,714 --> 00:45:00,524
I'm on my way to Yoon Seo's.

804
00:45:00,623 --> 00:45:02,384
Okay. I'll go home now.

805
00:45:15,203 --> 00:45:17,273
Mr. Kim. I have a sister-in-law now.

806
00:45:17,274 --> 00:45:18,403
Let's drink more mixers.

807
00:45:18,404 --> 00:45:20,773
Go! Let's go!

808
00:45:20,774 --> 00:45:22,103
Can you drive a little faster?

809
00:45:35,053 --> 00:45:37,393
Drive on! Faster!

810
00:45:38,294 --> 00:45:40,323
I think we're going too fast already.

811
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:01,682
My gosh. You're the best.

812
00:46:01,683 --> 00:46:04,413
Good luck, sister-in-law.

813
00:46:05,884 --> 00:46:08,622
- Look. There she is. - Hey.

814
00:46:08,623 --> 00:46:09,654
You're right.

815
00:46:09,754 --> 00:46:12,623
That's Mother.

816
00:46:22,973 --> 00:46:25,073
Mother. Get out here.

817
00:46:35,643 --> 00:46:37,283
- Don't. - Get off me.

818
00:46:45,393 --> 00:46:46,622
Let go of me.

819
00:46:46,623 --> 00:46:48,064
Mother!

820
00:47:23,964 --> 00:47:24,964
Hang on.

821
00:47:25,694 --> 00:47:26,964
What happened?

822
00:47:29,103 --> 00:47:30,103
Hey.

823
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:32,972
Yesterday, with Ms. Lee,

824
00:47:32,973 --> 00:47:36,103
no, my sister-in-law Mi Jin, I had a few drinks.

825
00:47:36,473 --> 00:47:38,613
We went to the chairwoman's to complain...

826
00:47:38,614 --> 00:47:39,783
and Ju Won came...

827
00:47:40,044 --> 00:47:41,084
My gosh.

828
00:47:41,384 --> 00:47:43,384
What is wrong with me?

829
00:47:44,053 --> 00:47:45,853
Why did I even go there?

830
00:47:50,053 --> 00:47:51,053
Oh, no.

831
00:47:52,223 --> 00:47:54,263
(Seo Ju Won: Yoon Seo.)

832
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,663
How am I to apologize?

833
00:47:57,694 --> 00:47:58,694
(Seo Ju Won)

834
00:47:58,893 --> 00:48:01,464
Yoon Seo. Do you have a hangover?

835
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:03,573
I'm sorry about yesterday.

836
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:06,603
If you're upset, it's my fault.

837
00:48:07,303 --> 00:48:09,044
Call when you're no longer angry.

838
00:48:14,444 --> 00:48:15,543
(Read)

839
00:48:15,544 --> 00:48:16,984
She read it, so why won't she reply?

840
00:48:20,123 --> 00:48:22,524
I have a stomach ache. Get me some medicine.

841
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:27,594
Should I have bought hangover soup?

842
00:48:29,064 --> 00:48:31,594
That's weird. Why is the door open?

843
00:49:07,303 --> 00:49:08,303
You're here.

844
00:49:09,234 --> 00:49:10,234
Yes.

845
00:49:10,834 --> 00:49:12,072
The door was open.

846
00:49:12,073 --> 00:49:15,803
Oh, I grilled some fish, and it stunk up the place.

847
00:49:18,614 --> 00:49:20,044
What's the occasion?

848
00:49:21,283 --> 00:49:22,743
I just...

849
00:49:23,614 --> 00:49:24,884
felt bad.

850
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:28,384
For making you handle all the wedding preparations.

851
00:49:29,993 --> 00:49:32,694
And for getting into trouble yesterday.

852
00:49:33,524 --> 00:49:35,464
So I prepared a little something.

853
00:49:48,603 --> 00:49:49,742
It looks amazing.

854
00:49:49,743 --> 00:49:52,243
I'd been craving doenjang soup since yesterday.

855
00:49:52,944 --> 00:49:53,984
This is a jjigae.

856
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,283
I hadn't cooked in a while and I added too much water.

857
00:49:59,783 --> 00:50:01,884
You don't scrimp when it comes to ingredients.

858
00:50:02,024 --> 00:50:03,223
That's cool.

859
00:50:19,774 --> 00:50:22,274
The rice is nicely cooked. It's just right.

860
00:50:23,674 --> 00:50:24,774
It's instant rice I microwaved.

861
00:50:33,084 --> 00:50:34,122
The side dishes are delicious.

862
00:50:34,123 --> 00:50:35,323
Ji Seok made them.

863
00:50:36,754 --> 00:50:38,623
I only made the jjigae.

864
00:50:39,323 --> 00:50:41,393
Did you?

865
00:50:41,723 --> 00:50:43,932
It's too salty, isn't it? I'll add more water...

866
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:46,063
No. It's just right.

867
00:50:46,064 --> 00:50:47,504
A little more water...

868
00:50:48,263 --> 00:50:49,303
It's so good.

869
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,004
- Is it? - Yes.

870
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:53,803
- Just a little? - No.

871
00:50:57,373 --> 00:51:00,283
It wasn't too bad, was it?

872
00:51:00,743 --> 00:51:01,743
It wasn't.

873
00:51:02,114 --> 00:51:04,353
It was good. You're the best.

874
00:51:06,254 --> 00:51:09,083
I can't promise I'll cook for you often.

875
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:10,623
Okay. Thank you.

876
00:51:14,493 --> 00:51:15,763
What I meant was...

877
00:51:17,493 --> 00:51:18,763
It's such a shame.

878
00:51:23,774 --> 00:51:26,674
I'm not a passive guy who just eats what he's given.

879
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,143
You just do what you like and what you're good at.

880
00:51:33,044 --> 00:51:35,084
Oh, right. I have something to show you.

881
00:51:36,243 --> 00:51:37,254
Here.

882
00:51:37,314 --> 00:51:38,553
It's our wedding invitation.

883
00:51:39,154 --> 00:51:41,683
I asked Mr. Lee to rush it.

884
00:51:41,984 --> 00:51:43,222
(Seo Ju Won and Ha Yoon Seo)

885
00:51:43,223 --> 00:51:46,253
This makes it feel real that we're getting married.

886
00:51:46,254 --> 00:51:47,263
Doesn't it?

887
00:51:47,594 --> 00:51:48,594
Yes.

888
00:51:49,094 --> 00:51:50,964
It feels a bit weird.

889
00:52:01,504 --> 00:52:02,504
I love you.

890
00:52:03,444 --> 00:52:04,512
That's random.

891
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:05,913
It's not random.

892
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,844
I always love you.

893
00:52:10,683 --> 00:52:11,683
I love you too.

894
00:52:13,783 --> 00:52:14,823
I love you.

895
00:52:17,254 --> 00:52:18,254
Okay.

896
00:52:33,134 --> 00:52:34,944
A wedding invitation?

897
00:52:35,344 --> 00:52:37,243
I still can't believe...

898
00:52:37,643 --> 00:52:40,183
that those two will be married in a few days.

899
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:41,943
Neither do I.

900
00:52:41,944 --> 00:52:44,512
Do you think Ms. Ha will manage?

901
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:47,583
Rich families are hard to handle. What if she gets bullied?

902
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:49,053
Like...

903
00:52:52,723 --> 00:52:53,763
Goodness.

904
00:52:53,993 --> 00:52:56,024
It's terrible table manners.

905
00:52:56,094 --> 00:52:57,364
I can't eat with someone not on my level.

906
00:52:57,464 --> 00:52:59,933
Shall we have dessert without her?

907
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:02,603
I don't want to waste any on her.

908
00:53:05,703 --> 00:53:06,802
Oh, my gosh!

909
00:53:06,803 --> 00:53:08,643
Come and take this away!

910
00:53:10,243 --> 00:53:11,572
No.

911
00:53:11,573 --> 00:53:12,642
Not that.

912
00:53:12,643 --> 00:53:13,913
- That! - That!

913
00:53:14,283 --> 00:53:16,083
Who, me? But...

914
00:53:16,084 --> 00:53:18,852
Wait. Can I please take this?

915
00:53:18,853 --> 00:53:21,622
"Mother. I've never had lobster before."

916
00:53:21,623 --> 00:53:22,923
"Mother."

917
00:53:22,924 --> 00:53:24,393
- Will you stop? - Yes.

918
00:53:27,763 --> 00:53:30,633
Didn't you watch too many dramas, Mr. Bae?

919
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:32,432
I guess I did.

920
00:53:32,433 --> 00:53:35,203
I'll get rid of my TV right away.

921
00:53:36,803 --> 00:53:38,603
- How about a toast? - Yes.

922
00:53:39,274 --> 00:53:40,642
One, two, three.

923
00:53:40,643 --> 00:53:41,843
- Cheers. - Cheers!

924
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,114
- Congratulations on your marriage. - Congratulations.

925
00:53:45,314 --> 00:53:48,182
Of course, the fairy-tale I'm about to write...

926
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,353
could sound like a nonsensical TV drama.

927
00:53:50,413 --> 00:53:52,783
- Hey, look. - Gosh.

928
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:55,154
What are you doing?

929
00:53:55,584 --> 00:53:57,953
The ending many fairy tales have,

930
00:53:58,123 --> 00:54:00,963
"they lived happily ever after..."

931
00:54:00,964 --> 00:54:04,094
is impossible in real life.

932
00:54:10,573 --> 00:54:11,933
- Cheers? - Cheers.

933
00:54:14,274 --> 00:54:16,073
This cup is beautiful.

934
00:54:16,873 --> 00:54:19,742
The liquor tastes much better because you made the cup.

935
00:54:19,743 --> 00:54:21,314
Right? Aren't you grateful?

936
00:54:21,913 --> 00:54:24,283
Be sure to arrange something for next year's anniversary.

937
00:54:26,114 --> 00:54:28,484
I'm really sorry about that.

938
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,753
To be honest, I thought the date we got together...

939
00:54:30,754 --> 00:54:32,823
meant more than our wedding anniversary.

940
00:54:33,493 --> 00:54:34,793
I was preparing something...

941
00:54:34,794 --> 00:54:36,094
to celebrate our 100th day.

942
00:54:36,933 --> 00:54:38,834
Didn't you make that up to make up for...

943
00:54:39,334 --> 00:54:40,363
forgetting our anniversary?

944
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:42,163
No, I swear I didn't.

945
00:54:42,263 --> 00:54:45,703
I knew you'd say that, so I even prepared something.

946
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:47,203
What's that?

947
00:54:47,703 --> 00:54:48,703
Look.

948
00:54:48,973 --> 00:54:50,472
Interior blueprints.

949
00:54:50,473 --> 00:54:52,743
Let's merge our bedrooms on the 100th day.

950
00:54:55,984 --> 00:54:57,453
Not on our 100th day.

951
00:55:04,254 --> 00:55:05,993
We can do that tonight.

952
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:16,834
Mi Jin.

953
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:17,873
What?

954
00:55:18,904 --> 00:55:19,933
I love you.

955
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:22,444
I love you too.

956
00:55:23,844 --> 00:55:25,243
Despite that,

957
00:55:26,044 --> 00:55:29,314
I decided to believe that everlasting love exists.

958
00:55:31,484 --> 00:55:33,883
Ji Seok. The first step of cooking...

959
00:55:33,884 --> 00:55:36,322
is buying the ingredients. Do you get that?

960
00:55:36,323 --> 00:55:39,093
This is where I usually shop. Take a look at all this.

961
00:55:39,094 --> 00:55:40,293
My gosh.

962
00:55:40,294 --> 00:55:42,923
- This is a webfoot octopus. - Can you not?

963
00:55:42,924 --> 00:55:45,093
- Are you out of your mind? - A webfoot octopus.

964
00:55:45,094 --> 00:55:46,163
Uncle!

965
00:55:46,234 --> 00:55:49,634
As simple pleasures fill your every day...

966
00:55:50,504 --> 00:55:53,073
(Lee Sung Min's Exhibition, White Night)

967
00:56:09,884 --> 00:56:12,793
Perhaps your reality will become...

968
00:56:12,794 --> 00:56:15,323
more lovable than a fairy tale.

969
00:56:48,663 --> 00:56:50,893
The Cinderella at 2AM said...

970
00:56:53,033 --> 00:56:56,063
that 2am could be a time not filled with pain...

971
00:56:56,064 --> 00:56:58,033
but excitement and expectation.

972
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,044
It would be ignorant and arrogant to jump in...

973
00:57:02,573 --> 00:57:04,774
not thinking it would be tough.

974
00:57:05,913 --> 00:57:09,044
But the steps you take to brave the pain and go forward...

975
00:57:09,743 --> 00:57:11,053
is courage.

976
00:58:06,634 --> 00:58:08,102
You're so handsome!

977
00:58:08,103 --> 00:58:10,003
- You look amazing! - You're beautiful, Ms. Ha!

978
00:58:10,004 --> 00:58:11,814
Ha Yoon Seo, you look amazing!

979
00:58:14,214 --> 00:58:15,743
Be happy, sis!

980
00:59:25,084 --> 00:59:27,053
I'm surrounded by those I love,

981
00:59:27,584 --> 00:59:29,984
and I have enough courage.

982
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,694
I'm sure my story...

983
00:59:34,194 --> 00:59:37,033
will have a happy ending.

984
01:00:02,754 --> 01:00:07,064
