He came back before it even hit me that we'd ended things.

I'm glad you think they're cute.

Because you're so pretty.

- What? - What?

29
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,267
Did I say that out loud just now?

30
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:53,908
Well, what I meant was...

31
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:56,348
It's not a sudden thing.

32

What's with you, Ju Won? You're very funny.

36
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,098
I wasn't trying to be funny.

- What? - I don't like older women.

I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

I'll be careful from now on.

45

Thank you.

Bye, then.

48
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,397

to let me stay instead of transferring me abroad.

No. Don't be sorry, sir. You must've had a reason.

Yes, absolutely.

"Right, he definitely needs to rest and recuperate."

79
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:39,697

Just relax and teach me the things I need to know, like the old days.

83
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,407
I got you some coffee.

84

Oh. You don't need to do this anymore.

Mr. Bae, I know you don't like it when it's too hot.

88
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,857
I made sure to get two sleeves for yours.

89
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:09,766
Two sleeves?

90
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,697
That's right! Mr. Bae always...

91
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,567
yelled at you for only getting one sleeve for his hot coffee, right?

92
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,937
Hey, Ye Young. When did I yell at him?

93
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,036
I never yelled at him. It's just that I always look...

94
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:24,507
like I'm yelling because of my angry face.

95
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:26,017
I swear, it's a misunderstanding.

96
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,878
And this is for you, Ms. Ha.

97
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,948
Thank you.

98
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,717
Anyway, what brings you here, Director Seo?

99
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:37,387
You no longer need to come here. Am I wrong?

My goodness. Don't be so mean.

101
00:07:40,657 --> 00:07:43,298
All right, let's go.

102
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:47,267
Would you allow me to escort you to your office?

103
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:52,508
This is...

104
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:54,738
my office.

105
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:02,887
What? How could it be your office?

106
00:08:02,888 --> 00:08:04,388

This is where I want to be.

111
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,836
I've learned so much from all of you,

112
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:27,237
and I wish to learn more from you.

113
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:29,137
So, I figured it'd be best to stay close to you,

114
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:30,977
which is why I turned that room into my office.

115

122

the chairwoman's youngest son and the vice chairman's brother.

123
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,687
And his office is right here? Is this really happening?

124
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:13,616
There are so many empty rooms in the building.

125
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:15,687
Why did he have to turn that room into his office?

My point, exactly!

127
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:19,398
Hold on.

128

Someone he wants to see all the time...

130
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:28,497

132
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,376

Right, you didn't really do much.

135
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,517
You just made him run coffee errands,

136
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:45,616
picked on him for being a slow learner,

I mean, think about it.

146

What are you doing here? What do you mean you'll cling to me?

155
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:40,837
And what do you mean you had to persuade the chairwoman?

156
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,007
Didn't I explain everything earlier?

157
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,548
Why are you acting like you don't get it?

158
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:49,078
Your mother clearly told me that you'd be...

159
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,287
transferred abroad if I broke up with you.

160
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:52,548
Right, that was her plan.

161
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,318
But I persuaded her to transfer me to this office.

162
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:56,788
She was actually persuaded?

163
00:10:58,887 --> 00:10:59,996
I told her...

164
00:10:59,997 --> 00:11:02,298
that you broke up with me without telling me why.

165
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:05,127
My brother would get in trouble if I told her he'd given me a heads-up.

166
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:06,898
And I figured that'd get you in trouble too.

167
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:11,808
I told her the breakup was too sudden...

168
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,578
and that I needed some time to get over it.

169
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:15,136
I told her that I'd probably...

170
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:16,577
go out drinking every day and ruin everything...

171
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,778
at the overseas branch if I were transferred there now.

172
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:20,377
What?

173
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:22,347

174

while assisting such a competent manager.

175
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,487
AL CARD is number two in the industry at the moment.

176
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,487
I told her I'd make it number 1 in 2 years.

177
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:30,828
I said she could transfer me overseas if I failed.

178
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,996
In just two years? Is that even possible?

179
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:34,158
I must make it happen.

180

If my mother wants...

181
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,997
to expand the business through an arranged marriage,

182
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,268
I must prove to her that I can do it with my own abilities alone.

183
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:43,237
That way, I can stay with you.

184
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:48,038
Have you no pride?

185
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:51,006
I took the money on the condition that I'd break up with you.

186
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:53,018
I've always known about your love for money.

187
00:11:53,148 --> 00:11:55,147
Who says I love money?

188
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,187
You were excited to work late to receive overtime pay...

189
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:59,817
and volunteered to work on the weekend to get the bonus.

190
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:01,058
That was...

191
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:03,457
I was only doing my duty as a hardworking employee...

192
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:09,398
In any case, I gave her my word...

193
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:11,698
that I would break up with you.

194
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:13,038
And you did.

195
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,798
You kept your promise.

196
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:16,637
So, we can just date again, right?

197
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:19,307
(Headquarters Director Seo Ju Won)

198
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:21,607
You didn't promise her you'd never get back together with me, right?

199
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,278
Well, that's...

200
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,818
Hold on.

201
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,818
Why do you keep talking so casually to me?

202
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,257
The truth is,

203
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:39,586
I couldn't figure out what I could do to win you back,

204
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:40,798
so I looked it up.

205
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:42,528
And I read that the best thing would be...

206
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:45,198
to show you something you never saw when we were together.

207
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:47,867
I also read that it makes women's hearts flutter...

208
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,707
when they hear a younger man talk casually to them, Yoon Seo.

209
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:54,877
And I read that this would make a woman's heart flutter too.

210
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:00,778
You're adorable, Yoon Seo.

211
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:06,918
Hey, what are you doing?

212
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,558
- Gosh. - What? You're so adorable.

213
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:11,328
Hey!

214
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,798
- Why... Gosh! What? - You're cute.

215
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,007
Those two... What was that just now?

216
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:34,977
No way. Are they...

217
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:42,288
How am I going to explain this?

218
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:46,127
I mean, they saw that. There's no way out of this.

219
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,897
Well, about that earlier...

220
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:56,908
It's okay.

221
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,637
You don't need to tell us. We get it.

222
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:02,237
- What? - But honestly, we feel betrayed.

223
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:07,678
How could he do that to intimidate you?

224
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:10,818
Sorry? "Intimidate me?"

225
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:14,356
Yes! What he did earlier. He went like this.

226
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:16,586
Now that he has a director title, he had to act like...

227
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:18,986
he adored you as if you were his pet dog or something.

228
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:20,798
He had to treat you like you worked under him.

229
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:23,028
That's totally why he petted you like that.

230
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:24,297
- Well, that was... - Gosh, totally.

231
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:25,496
I didn't think he'd be like this.

232
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,097
He scares me. He really does!

233
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:29,268
- That's not what happened. - That's exactly what happened.

234
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:31,207
You don't need to lie to us to save your pride.

235
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:34,577
My gosh. You must be so upset.

236
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:37,407
Someone you used to manage is now the headquarters director.

237
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:38,907
You went in there to have a word with him...

238
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,517
and ended up letting him gain the upper hand.

239
00:14:40,518 --> 00:14:42,216
If we don't understand how you feel, who will?

240
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:43,587
- No, that's not what happened. - Oh, please.

241
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,788
Hold on, actually...

242
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:47,688
Is it better that they believe this?

243
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,486
But if you really think about it,

244
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:52,987
it's not a bad thing.

245
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:56,257
He renovated the library to stay close to us,

246
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,366
which means he has fond memories of the time we spent together.

247
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,698
Being on good terms with the owner's family won't harm us in any way.

248
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:04,137
In a way, we could benefit greatly from it.

249
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:06,808
That's true, but...

250
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:09,077
But how's it possible...

251
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:10,778
that he didn't look like a rich heir at all?

252
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,847
What? Why not?

253
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:15,948
Maybe not the heir part, but I knew he was rich.

254
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,318
He always had this air of luxury about him, you know.

255
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:31,798
He was always dressed in designer clothes.

256
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:39,667
Really? There wasn't a single logo,

257
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:41,177
so I thought they were all cheap clothes.

258
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:42,278
My goodness.

259
00:15:42,438 --> 00:15:45,377
People who are truly wealthy avoid brands with obvious logos.

260
00:15:45,548 --> 00:15:47,147
Those who can only splurge once in a blue moon...

261
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:49,078
are the ones who buy clothes with huge logos.

262
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:50,548
My gosh.

263
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,058
And come to think of it,

264
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:58,387
I noticed something at the convenience store too.

265
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:02,597
Buy-1-get-1-free

266
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:04,698
Let's see.

267
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,198
Which one should I get?

268
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,707
Ju Won! That's part of the buy-1-get-1-free deal.

269
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:13,237
I only need one.

270
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:16,808
What?

271
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:18,847
He can get another one for free but doesn't want it?

272
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:20,918
What is he, a rich heir?

273
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:22,418
That day, I bad-mouthed him like that.

274
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,818
Little did I know, he was actually a rich heir!

275
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,857
Also...

276
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:28,788
My gosh!

277
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:30,387
Oh, you said...

278
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:32,457
you couldn't attend Mr. Oh's wedding because of a meeting.

279
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:34,557
I'll make sure he gets your cash gift.

280
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:35,727
Thank you.

281
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:42,967
This is my first time doing this. How much do people normally give?

282
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:47,507
Normally, five bills would do for a colleague's wedding.

283
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:48,977
Five?

284
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:51,877
Here's 500 dollars.

285
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:57,117
What? I didn't mean 500 dollars.

286
00:16:57,587 --> 00:16:59,288
By 5 bills, I meant 50 dollars.

287
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:00,757
Fifty dollars?

288
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:04,156
Let's be honest. Being cool with spending 500 dollars...

289
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,897
as a wedding gift for a colleague...

290
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:09,896
No! Even just the fact that he had 500 dollars in his wallet.

291
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:12,028
It's unreal, you know?

292
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:15,798
Let's see.

293
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,307
Look. Three dollars.

294
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:23,177
This is most people's reality.

295
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:26,477
But three dollars is too little.

296
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,278
Give it back. It's for those fish-shaped buns.

297
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:33,218
Anyway, when Ju Won first joined the company, I thought he was crazy.

298
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:37,587
I always wondered, "What is he trying to pull here?"

299
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:39,687
But looking back,

300
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:42,197
it was all because his family owns the company!

301
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:45,268
I should've observed him more carefully.

302
00:17:45,568 --> 00:17:47,238
I can't believe I had no idea.

303
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:48,798
Ms. Ha. You didn't know either, right?

304
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:50,937
Oh, well...

305
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:55,538
I understand you're all confused, but nothing's changing.

306
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,748
All you have to do is keep up the good work.

307
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:01,677
I know you're uncomfortable because Director Seo's office is so close,

308
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:04,048
but you'll actually see him less often now.

309
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,587
- Okay. - Well understood.

310
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:10,187
A team dinner?

311
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:13,127
Yes. I made you uncomfortable, although I never intended to.

312
00:18:13,187 --> 00:18:15,656
We're working late today, and you're stepping out for dinner,

313
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:17,228
so I want to buy you a nice meal.

314
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:18,897
How about some beef?

315
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,867
No, that's okay. We're going to have ox bone soup.

316
00:18:23,097 --> 00:18:24,208
You prefer ox bone soup, right?

317
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:26,068
Oh, come on.

318
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:29,436
That was before Director Seo offered to buy us beef.

319
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:30,646
That's right.

320
00:18:30,647 --> 00:18:32,547
Compared to beef, ox bone soup is like...

321
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:34,346
It's like drinking the water after washing a cow's feet.

322
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:37,587
We would much prefer to eat beef, obviously.

323
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,657
Oh, I heard the Hanwoo beef place across the street was very good.

324
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,788
How about that restaurant, Director Seo?

325
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,126
I'm fine with anything. Shall we go, then?

326
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:46,288
Yes, let's go.

327
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:48,228
Count me out, then.

328
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:50,197
I'll just stay here and go through the reports.

329
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:52,327
Oh, come on. Must you make everyone so uncomfortable?

330
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:54,337
You're not one of those bosses who always order jjajangmyeon.

331
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:56,836
We can't go and eat without you if you stay here.

332
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,107
Let's just go. Please.

333
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:00,177
Yes, let's go!

334
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:02,037
We'll eat quickly and get the work done.

335
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:03,677
- Let's go, okay? Come on. - But...

336
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,106
- Let's go! - But it's... Let me talk.

337
00:19:06,107 --> 00:19:08,847
- I really am not hungry. - My gosh! Let's go!

338
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,318
Let's go and have some beef! Come on!

339
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:22,528
I'm so excited today.

340
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:25,696
If I could have just one soju bomb,

341
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,367
- I'd be even more excited. - Oh, my.

342
00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:29,896
What? Soju bomb?

343
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:31,507
We have to go back to the office for our meeting.

344
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:32,667
Obviously, I was just joking.

345
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:34,477
We've been working late for several days...

346
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:36,078
to get ready for our presentation.

347
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:37,307
It was just a joke.

348
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:39,847
I wouldn't actually drink.

349
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:43,616
Well, how about we all have a drink since we're already here...

350
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:44,917
and postpone the presentation?

351
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:46,817
What? Postpone the presentation...

352
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,718
just so we could have a drink? Does that make sense to you?

353
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:50,988
Well, it's not that.

354
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:54,097
I read the reports and saw that you still had a long way to go.

355
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:57,627
We still have a long way to go?

356
00:19:57,728 --> 00:20:00,397
How so? Do you care to be a little more specific?

357
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,578
I just think you need more time.

358
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,106
You weren't given enough time to begin with,

359
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:14,917
and I suddenly left the team,

360
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,377
so you're understaffed now.

361
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,217
I just meant that you'd give a perfect presentation...

362
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,788
if you had one more week.

363
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:22,987
Well, that's true. Ms. Ha, you said...

364
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,856
we'd do an even better job if we had just a few more days.

365
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,087
Yes, totally.

366
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:28,498
That is true, but...

367
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:30,468
All right. Today,

368
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:32,768
we'll have a drink so we can bond even more as a team.

369
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:36,238
And we'll work even harder starting tomorrow.

370
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:37,437
Yes!

371
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,208
Excuse me!

372
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:41,537
Could we get a bottle of beer and soju as well?

373
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:43,508
Four servings of prime ribeye too!

374
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:47,147
This is so good.

375
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:49,377
My gosh. Eat up.

376
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:53,617
- Ju Won! Oh. - My goodness.

377
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:56,417
- Director Seo. - Yes, Director Seo.

378
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,528
I'm sorry for everything.

379
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,156
Please don't fire me, okay?

380
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:04,667
My gosh. Why would I fire you? Don't say that.

381
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:05,968
Get home safely.

382
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:08,167
My goodness.

383
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:09,797
I'll go with him. We're going the same way.

384
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:11,008
- Yes, you should. - All right.

385
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:15,237
Promise? Promise me that you won't fire me.

386
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:17,646
Promise

387
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,777
Yes, I promise. You have my word.

388
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,946
Goodness, he promised. Can we please go home now?

389
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,417
- Get home safely! - Okay. Bye.

390
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:34,958
Excuse me.

391
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:46,437
Why are you following me, Director Seo?

392
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:49,807
I wasn't following you. I was going to the office too.

393
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,247
Don't lie. You were following me.

394
00:21:52,248 --> 00:21:53,278
No, I wasn't.

395
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:55,616
You didn't drink so you could go to the office...

396
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:56,647
and finish up work too, right?

397
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,017
Same goes for me.

398
00:21:58,018 --> 00:21:59,818
I have a lot to look over.

399
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:01,357
I only had one glass of beer.

400
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,488
Then, I have a lot of work to do. I'll be going.

401
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,627
(Headquarters Director Seo Ju Won)

402
00:23:19,728 --> 00:23:21,038
I thought he'd leave...

403
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:23,238
if I acted like I wasn't interested in him anymore.

404
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:26,038
I thought that he'd accept the situation...

405
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,778
if I told him I had even accepted money.

406
00:23:56,538 --> 00:23:58,568
(I can't let you go, Ha Yoon Seo.)

407
00:24:06,248 --> 00:24:07,717
(This is a declaration of war.)

408
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:08,718
(I can't let you go, Ha Yoon Seo.)

409
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:10,887
(I can't let you go, Ha Yoon Seo. This is a declaration of war.)

410
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,018
(I can't let you go, Ha Yoon Seo. This is a declaration of war.)

411
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:22,697
(I can't let you go, Ha Yoon Seo.)

412
00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:30,038
(This is a declaration of war.)

413
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:40,778
And after that day,

414
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:43,646
just as Ju Won meant with his declaration of war,

415
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:46,387
he began flirting with incredible intensity.

416
00:24:49,318 --> 00:24:52,728
What shall I have for lunch today?

417
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,157
How about crispy pork cutlet?

418
00:24:55,498 --> 00:24:57,298
Gosh, pork cutlet sounds great.

419
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:58,798
Director Seo.

420
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:00,568
Will you eat with us?

421
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,268
Let's go and have crispy pork cutlet.

422
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:16,048
Then, will you be joining us for lunch from now on, Mr. Seo?

423
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:17,447
Yes.

424
00:25:17,488 --> 00:25:19,518
It's become a habit as I've eaten with everyone since starting work.

425
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:22,857
And most of all,

426
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,258
I like eating together.

427
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:27,558
Me too.

428
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:31,627
I'll be going first.

429
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:39,968
Could you ring me up, please?

430
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:41,307
Yes, just a moment.

431
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:42,337
Okay.

432
00:25:49,947 --> 00:25:51,587
What? Why are you doing this?

433
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:53,886
Sorry. I thought I was grabbing candy.

434
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,187
Candy? As if.

435
00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:57,587
You can't do this at work!

436
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:58,887
We're not at work.

437
00:25:59,087 --> 00:26:00,087
We're at a restaurant.

438
00:26:02,498 --> 00:26:03,968
You must be insane!

439
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,538
You must be going home. Please give me a ride.

440
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:17,907
You should give it a rest.

441
00:26:18,107 --> 00:26:20,346
You can't keep flirting with me like this at work!

442
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:21,978
Then, can I flirt with you outside of work?

443
00:26:35,758 --> 00:26:36,828
Are you okay?

444
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:41,697
I'm not okay. Let's date.

445
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:47,677
What does getting your foot stuck have to do with us dating again?

446
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,248
Let's date.

447
00:26:59,488 --> 00:27:01,616
Gosh, I'm hungry. Buy me food.

448
00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:03,758
Why would a rich guy ask me to buy him food?

449
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,988
Then, should the rich guy buy you food?

450
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,126
Forget it. Why would we eat together?

451
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,258
What's there between us?

452
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,196
We're broken up.

453
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:13,197
If you know that, just keep going on your way, Director Seo Ju Won.

454
00:27:15,437 --> 00:27:17,367
You are obligated to buy me food.

455
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:19,267
I've done a rough count,

456
00:27:19,268 --> 00:27:22,077
and I bought you food more times while we were dating.

457
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:23,538
About 27 times more.

458
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,047
What's that?

459
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:27,008
What's with the subtly precise number?

460
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:28,617
Do you have proof?

461
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:30,318
I do.

462
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:32,347
My photo album.

463
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:35,518
I took pictures of everything we ate and did while we dated.

464
00:27:35,718 --> 00:27:37,356
And you can get a rough estimate...

465
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:38,357
by looking through my credit card statement.

466
00:27:38,358 --> 00:27:39,558
I'm off.

467
00:27:40,857 --> 00:27:43,498
Who's the one who said we should be exact when it comes to money?

468
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:46,027
You have loads of money. You should just let that much slide.

469
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:48,497
You have lots of money too. The money you got from my Mother.

470
00:27:48,498 --> 00:27:49,637
Buy me food with that.

471
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:54,208
I will use that money later on bit by bit.

472
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:57,847
I won't use a single cent of that on you, Director Seo.

473
00:27:58,078 --> 00:28:01,117
Gosh, see? You like money.

474
00:28:01,818 --> 00:28:03,078
That's why I'm perfect for you.

475
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:05,947
If you're with me, you get money and me.

476
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:07,887
It's "Buy-1-get-1-free."

477
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,058
That's not how "Buy-1-get-1-free" deals work!

478
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:14,427
Stop following me.

479
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:37,347
She really left.

480
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:58,508
Are you sure you're okay?

481
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:02,708
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.

482
00:29:02,738 --> 00:29:04,548
Sometimes, it's better not to know.

483
00:29:04,647 --> 00:29:05,677
No.

484
00:29:06,248 --> 00:29:07,578
Thanks for telling me everything.

485
00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:11,346
By the way, I knew you'd try to keep Yoon Seo by your side,

486
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:13,187
but I didn't know you'd even refuse to go abroad.

487
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:15,218
You've never gone against Mother's words before.

488
00:29:16,258 --> 00:29:18,387
She hasn't made me an offer that I wanted to go against before.

489
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:27,697
Hey, Alberto! Get out of there.

490
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,538
Why, that little...

491
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:41,947
Gosh, Si Won. Why are you dressed like that?

492
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:45,417
Who cares? It's just me here.

493
00:29:46,288 --> 00:29:48,317
Hey, Ju Won. Do you know when I thought...

494
00:29:48,318 --> 00:29:50,086
having an arranged marriage was a good idea?

495
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:52,788
- Do I have to know? - It's right now.

496
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:55,298
I've never had freedom like this in my entire life.

497
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:57,696
Mi Jin went to France as soon as we got married,

498
00:29:57,697 --> 00:29:58,896
and I started living alone.

499
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,697
But, you know... Gosh.

500
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:03,366
All my life, I've had to mind other people's eyes on me,

501
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:06,568
having to dress properly even at home and minding my manners.

502
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:10,207
But all of that has gone away.

503
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,377
It's so comfortable!

504
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,978
I don't know how I put up with such a stuffy life before.

505
00:30:17,318 --> 00:30:19,187
Right. Congratulations.

506
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:21,416
I'll be going.

507
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:22,518
Are you leaving already?

508
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:24,458
But why?

509
00:30:24,728 --> 00:30:26,458
Hey, you must be feeling upset.

510
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:28,058
Stay for another drink.

511
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:33,768
Why? Don't you feel like drinking?

512
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:36,637
Or do you want to watch a movie?

513
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:40,607
You know, I made my own little movie theater recently...

514
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:43,677
so I can watch romantic movies and cry as much as I want to.

515
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:47,518
Oh, right. You don't like movies.

516
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:51,186
That's not true. Watching movies has become my hobby lately.

517
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:52,846
What? I thought you didn't like theaters...

518
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:53,947
because they were dark and stuffy.

519
00:30:54,157 --> 00:30:55,917
You said it felt stifling to keep staring at the screen.

520
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,787
I did, but I've been watching movies often lately with Yoon Seo,

521
00:30:58,788 --> 00:30:59,828
and it was all right.

522
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:01,857
Yoon Seo really likes horror movies.

523
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:04,267
- Horror movies? - Yes.

524
00:31:04,268 --> 00:31:06,998
Didn't you particularly hate horror movies more than others?

525
00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:10,837
Ju Won tried really hard.

526
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,208
It's easy to say,

527
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,777
but it's hard to actually cling to someone who wants to break up.

528
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:16,937
Hey, it's hard for me too.

529
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:19,577
You should be worrying about me. I'm your friend.

530
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,547
I'm saying this because I'm your friend.

531
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,416
To be honest, who cares if his mother opposes you?

532
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:28,656
Right, how could everyone in the world accept you?

533
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:30,186
That's not it.

534
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:32,926
Yoon Seo, if you look up our business...

535
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:34,328
It's not our business.

536
00:31:35,258 --> 00:31:36,427
It's my business.

537
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:42,166
Anyway, if you look up Ms. Yi Rae's business,

538
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,637
there are these things called ratings.

539
00:31:43,897 --> 00:31:46,467
But some guys leave a one-star rating.

540
00:31:46,468 --> 00:31:48,507
Some other guys leave five-star ratings.

541
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:51,007
They had the same food and the same makgeolli.

542
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:52,707
That's what life is like.

543
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:55,817
So what if your future mother-in-law gave you a one-star rating?

544
00:31:55,818 --> 00:31:58,947
Our young master Ju Won says "Five stars."

545
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:00,987
That's the rating he'll give you.

546
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:04,656
How could you satisfy everyone in life?

547
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:05,657
That's what I'm saying.

548
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:07,926
It's very common for your future spouse's parents...

549
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,297
to oppose you.

550
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:10,866
Right. I mean,

551
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:13,927
your parents could oppose a rich son-in-law too.

552
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:18,637
Watch what you say. Yoon Seo doesn't have any parents.

553
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,637
Oh, right.

554
00:32:22,738 --> 00:32:24,606
Oh, yes? Did you need something?

555
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:26,177
I'll be right there.

556
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,578
How dare you talk back?

557
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:05,988
I told you to hurry up and go buy some liquor!

558
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:10,317
Hey, will you come to your senses...

559
00:33:10,318 --> 00:33:12,356
after another beating?

560
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,728
Get going!

561
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:42,018
Yul, give that to me. Mommy will carry it.

562
00:33:42,258 --> 00:33:45,258
I'm going to carry it. It's not heavy.

563
00:33:45,328 --> 00:33:48,228
People will badmouth me if a little girl carries liquor.

564
00:33:48,258 --> 00:33:50,327
Your dad is putting us through this hassle...

565
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,667
because he wants some soju.

566
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:53,167
Let's get going.

567
00:34:37,277 --> 00:34:38,406
Did you catch a cold?

568
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:41,347
Yes, I think it's because I stood in the cold for a while last night.

569
00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:44,517
Gosh, had I known, I would've made some soup.

570
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:45,847
It would've been nice and warm to put rice in it.

571
00:34:46,947 --> 00:34:48,816
Why? Was it not enough...

572
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:50,688
that you made a nice, warm mess out of your midterms too?

573
00:34:52,328 --> 00:34:53,427
Gosh, seriously.

574
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,127
You should either cough or nag.

575
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,828
Just do one at a time, will you?

576
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:03,237
Eat up.

577
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:08,378
The more I think about it, the more annoying it is.

578
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,236
Does that Wimp not even have a car?

579
00:35:10,237 --> 00:35:11,847
Why is he making my sister walk around in the cold?

580
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,208
"Wimp?"

581
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:16,078
He's my sister's boyfriend. I don't like him.

582
00:35:16,918 --> 00:35:18,217
Gosh, he's so annoying.

583
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:21,588
Then, should we cut school and go to the arcade to blow off some steam?

584
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:23,357
Forget it. I won't cut school.

585
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:25,087
Why not?

586
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:26,327
You never study.

587
00:35:26,328 --> 00:35:27,957
Why do you never skip a single class?

588
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,597
My sister said never to skip class more than anything else.

589
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:33,026
I mean, I don't even pay attention in class.

590
00:35:33,027 --> 00:35:34,597
Gosh, this little punk!

591
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:38,038
Carry around some more cash. Are you a beggar?

592
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:41,108
Next time, bring some more.

593
00:35:41,677 --> 00:35:43,477
What are friends for?

594
00:35:43,478 --> 00:35:45,947
We can lend each other money when the other one needs it.

595
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:49,148
At first, they started doing that as a joke.

596
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:51,486
But things are getting worse these days.

597
00:35:51,487 --> 00:35:53,887
I know. Are those jerks still doing that?

598
00:35:54,657 --> 00:35:56,688
You should stop them.

599
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,327
Still, they listen to what you say.

600
00:35:58,328 --> 00:35:59,558
We need money.

601
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,228
We need money.

602
00:36:02,097 --> 00:36:03,097
Answer me.

603
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:04,667
Answer me.

604
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:07,066
- What use is that? - "Yes!"

605
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:09,067
- Let's go. - Why won't you answer me?

606
00:36:19,808 --> 00:36:21,047
One moment.

607
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:22,918
The doors are closing.

608
00:36:32,487 --> 00:36:33,987
The doors are closing.

609
00:36:38,628 --> 00:36:40,426
He said he heard from his brother.

610
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:43,038
That means he knows all about how I accepted money.

611
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,708
And that I coldly dumped Ju Won.

612
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:47,938
Gosh, this is so uncomfortable.

613
00:36:49,538 --> 00:36:50,978
It's rather cold today.

614
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:53,478
Yes, the temperature has suddenly dropped.

615
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:55,616
Ju Won is giving you a hard time these days, right?

616
00:36:55,617 --> 00:36:56,617
Pardon?

617
00:36:56,918 --> 00:37:00,217
That kid can be unpredictable sometimes.

618
00:37:00,648 --> 00:37:02,788
So, he sometimes surprises the people around him.

619
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:07,027
But all of that is so adorable, which drives you crazy.

620
00:37:07,387 --> 00:37:09,398
- Right? - Yes.

621
00:37:09,558 --> 00:37:10,597
No!

622
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:12,927
"Yes, no?"

623
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:17,866
I'm not feeling so great right now.

624
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:20,367
It was a slip of the tongue.

625
00:37:24,078 --> 00:37:28,176
And my relationship with your brother is already over.

626
00:37:28,177 --> 00:37:29,248
So,

627
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:33,617
please refrain from talking about such things with me at work.

628
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:42,426
Yes, I understand.

629
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,527
I was simply trying to provide you with information.

630
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,838
"Provide me with information?"

631
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,038
Ju Won...

632
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,006
He's a man of conviction and rather stubborn.

633
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:53,308
No one can stop him.

634
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:57,438
So, I'm telling you it won't be easy to win against Ju Won.

635
00:37:58,907 --> 00:38:02,217
At times, he can be more decisive than I am.

636
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,986
But that kid has met someone he likes this much.

637
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:06,748
I just thought he wouldn't give up so easily.

638
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,058
Actually,

639
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:11,188
I was a bit surprised after hearing him talk about movies.

640
00:38:12,128 --> 00:38:13,957
He used to hate movies,

641
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,797
but I heard you made him enjoy watching them.

642
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:17,597
I found that fascinating.

643
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:20,527

Here's your popcorn.

648
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:34,717
It was normal for us to go out for dinner and a movie.

649
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:36,878
If there was a movie I liked,

650
00:38:37,018 --> 00:38:39,248
we'd even watch it several times over.

651

Should we go watch it today?

654
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:47,288
Yes.

655
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,157
He knew about new releases better than I did.

656
00:38:50,398 --> 00:38:52,398
But he didn't like watching movies?

657
00:38:55,197 --> 00:38:57,168

Opera.

661
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,998
Did we ever watch anything like the opera before?

662
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:25,196
- Sweetie. - Yes?

663
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,097
Shall we go see an opera next week?

664
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,297
No.

665
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:29,998
Okay.

666
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:31,507
Right.

667
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,038
He did say that once.

668
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:37,407
And he never mentioned a word about the opera after that.

710
00:42:46,498 --> 00:42:47,797
I'm going to call it an industrial accident.

711
00:42:48,597 --> 00:42:51,038
An industrial accident? You're going overboard.

712
00:42:51,297 --> 00:42:53,066
What kind of company puts an employee in the VIP room...

713
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:54,338
because she passed out?

714
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:55,677
Right here.

715
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,407
Manager Ha Yoon Seo is setting the guidelines for company welfare.

716
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:00,708
You can brag about it.

717
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,677
I feel fine. I want to leave.

718
00:43:05,987 --> 00:43:07,418
Are you sure you feel fine?

719
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,958
To me, it looks like you're pretending to be fine.

720
00:43:15,558 --> 00:43:16,628
Am I wrong?

721
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:22,338
Yoon Seo.

722
00:43:26,168 --> 00:43:27,367
This is hard on me.

723
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:32,378
I knew what I was getting into,

724
00:43:33,748 --> 00:43:35,578
but constant rejection is tough.

725
00:43:37,078 --> 00:43:39,847
And so is seeing you pretend to be fine when you're not.

726
00:43:48,697 --> 00:43:49,858
If it's so hard,

727
00:43:50,998 --> 00:43:52,128
why do it?

728
00:43:56,237 --> 00:43:57,898
You don't like watching movies.

729
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:02,637
You can't stand being in closed spaces for a long time.

730
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,108
Why did you put up with it?

731
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:07,208
Who told you that?

732
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,078
The vice chairman.

733
00:44:13,288 --> 00:44:14,347
We dated...

734
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:17,487
for a year and a half.

735
00:44:18,387 --> 00:44:19,927
And I found that out today.

736
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:22,157
From someone else too.

737
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:26,498
I didn't mean to hide it from you. I just...

738
00:44:27,228 --> 00:44:28,398
You did it for me?

739
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:33,438
No.

740
00:44:34,907 --> 00:44:36,108
I did it for me.

741
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:40,907
I didn't just put up with what I didn't like.

742
00:44:42,018 --> 00:44:43,518
I wanted to enjoy with you...

743
00:44:44,277 --> 00:44:45,918
the things you liked.

744
00:44:49,288 --> 00:44:50,317
Yes.

745
00:44:51,387 --> 00:44:53,288
I had to force myself to stay at first.

746
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:02,097
It wasn't easy in the beginning.

747
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,547
But I was fascinated by how much you enjoyed yourself.

748
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:20,617
When you enjoy things,

749
00:45:21,248 --> 00:45:22,987
you sparkle and shine.

750
00:45:26,987 --> 00:45:29,297
So I kept going to movies with you,

751
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,168
and I learned to enjoy them.

752
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,668
Now I actually really like movies.

753
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,438
I even collect DVDs.

754
00:45:41,308 --> 00:45:42,777
I grew to like other things too.

755
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:45,608
I couldn't stand spicy foods.

756
00:45:46,478 --> 00:45:48,108
I disliked soju mixed with beer,

757
00:45:48,347 --> 00:45:50,078
and I didn't like winter either.

758
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:51,547
Now I like them all.

759
00:45:54,088 --> 00:45:56,358
I didn't put up with things I didn't like for you.

760
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:00,328
I learned to like things thanks to you.

761
00:46:08,797 --> 00:46:10,367
You could've told me sooner.

762
00:46:12,507 --> 00:46:15,237
I never wanted you to cater to me.

763
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:18,978
Even if I find operas strange and boring,

764
00:46:20,308 --> 00:46:22,047
if I'd known you liked them,

765
00:46:23,018 --> 00:46:24,648
I'd have tried to learn.

766
00:46:26,188 --> 00:46:28,117
You didn't even give me a chance.

767
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,858
I'm sorry.

768
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,228
Let's...

769
00:46:40,728 --> 00:46:43,168
eat together 27 times.

770
00:46:45,108 --> 00:46:46,108
What?

771
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:49,137
I don't like how you went by it,

772
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:52,078
but you tried hard for me until now.

773
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,617
You worked on dating me.

774
00:46:56,817 --> 00:46:59,217
Let's work on breaking up too.

775
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:03,918
I don't want to work on that.

776
00:47:05,927 --> 00:47:06,987
Even so.

777
00:47:07,887 --> 00:47:09,657
I just had the thought...

778
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:11,797
that maybe...

779
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:14,597
I must treat it like a bad cold and fight through it.

780
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:20,467
Only then can I maybe free myself of these feelings.

781
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:22,578
What?

782
00:47:23,277 --> 00:47:25,148
Are you going to shake me off like a cold?

783
00:47:25,947 --> 00:47:27,547
Are you saying I'm a virus?

784
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,616
Is that how it sounds?

785
00:47:30,617 --> 00:47:33,887
Then I'll become an antibody and stick right to you.

786
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:36,188
Fine.

787
00:47:36,558 --> 00:47:39,257
This way or that, all I need to do...

788
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:40,927
is eat with you 27 times.

789
00:47:44,398 --> 00:47:46,027
I'll show you...

790
00:47:46,728 --> 00:47:48,297
just how much I like you...

791
00:47:49,268 --> 00:47:50,668
and why we must be together.

792
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:10,688
Your food's ready.

793
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,188
Thank you.

794
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:14,157
Enjoy your meal.

795
00:48:23,297 --> 00:48:24,338
Let's eat.

796
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:49,327
That's how we started to eat out together.

797
00:48:49,328 --> 00:48:51,427
(Meals remaining: 26)

798
00:49:12,788 --> 00:49:15,358
That's right. Tangsuyuk must be drenched in sauce.

799
00:49:24,797 --> 00:49:27,797
It felt like we were on dates that weren't dates.

800
00:49:32,007 --> 00:49:33,437
(Meals remaining: 25)

801
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:34,466
(Meals remaining: 24)

802
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:36,277
Gosh. This is good.

803
00:49:36,438 --> 00:49:38,608
- I think this tastes best. - Me too.

804
00:49:39,578 --> 00:49:41,177
- Is it good? - Try the jjigae.

805
00:49:42,148 --> 00:49:43,148
This?

806
00:49:45,987 --> 00:49:47,748
When we were eating,

807
00:49:48,148 --> 00:49:51,987
it felt as if we'd gone back to when we were a couple.

808
00:50:02,498 --> 00:50:03,937
(Meals remaining: 24)

809
00:50:03,938 --> 00:50:05,808
(Meals remaining: 23)

810
00:50:38,907 --> 00:50:40,907
You're a mess because of Ju Won, aren't you?

811
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:46,907
I didn't want to go this far.

812
00:50:48,717 --> 00:50:50,378
I was told they'd broken up.

813
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:51,748
Why are they still dating?

814
00:50:53,288 --> 00:50:56,418
From what I know, Ms. Ha's doing her best.

815
00:50:56,918 --> 00:50:59,288
It's Ju Won who's clinging to her like crazy.

816
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:02,227
Even if you were to approve of them,

817
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:03,998
I think Ms. Ha would refuse.

818
00:51:04,858 --> 00:51:06,768
That's another problem in itself.

819
00:51:08,297 --> 00:51:09,897
Watch and wait.

820
00:51:09,898 --> 00:51:12,237
You know couples don't break up just like that.

821
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,438
I thought...

822
00:51:16,137 --> 00:51:18,947
she seemed the responsible type, so she'll keep her word.

823
00:51:20,407 --> 00:51:23,148
Can you take care of these for me?

824
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:25,047
Without Ju Won knowing.

825
00:51:25,518 --> 00:51:28,518
Why? You don't want him to know?

826
00:51:29,558 --> 00:51:31,188
Nothing good will come of it.

827
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:35,427
That I met with Ms. Ha.

828
00:51:36,157 --> 00:51:37,898
Are you sure Ju Won doesn't know?

829
00:51:38,027 --> 00:51:40,768
What about the fact that I had these photos taken?

830
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,137
He won't know that, will he?

831
00:51:42,197 --> 00:51:43,597
Well, no.

832
00:51:44,398 --> 00:51:46,406
Don't get someone to take photos...

833
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:47,837
and give him time instead.

834
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,708
I'm sure Ju Won will take care of things.

835
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,676
Do you want Ju Won too to go with...

836
00:51:54,677 --> 00:51:56,447
an arranged marriage?

837
00:51:57,148 --> 00:51:58,886
You had an arranged marriage...

838
00:51:58,887 --> 00:52:00,817
and Father hasn't returned from New York in two years...

839
00:52:04,088 --> 00:52:07,128
Mother. I'll get rid of these right away.

840
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,867
By the way.

841
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:18,297
Why are all the photos of them eating?

842
00:52:23,938 --> 00:52:24,978
Are you ready?

843
00:52:25,378 --> 00:52:26,407
Okay.

844
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,677
Why does it feel like we're conquering famous restaurants?

845
00:52:31,617 --> 00:52:32,617
Who cares what it's like?

846
00:52:32,648 --> 00:52:34,188
- Let's go. - Okay.

847
00:52:39,257 --> 00:52:40,557
(Meals remaining: 23)

848
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:42,058
(Meals remaining: 22)

849
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,966
Hello. We're back.

850
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:47,328
Hello, guys.

851
00:52:47,567 --> 00:52:49,168
Give us a medium, extra spicy.

852
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:51,136
And a bottle of soju, please.

853
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:53,737
- Okay. - No, forget the alcohol.

854
00:52:53,907 --> 00:52:55,007
Okay.

855
00:52:55,808 --> 00:52:56,878
What's up?

856
00:52:57,538 --> 00:53:00,148
You always drink when we eat here. Why not today?

857
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:05,918
We agreed to 27 meals, not to food and drink.

858
00:53:06,117 --> 00:53:07,788
Are you afraid alcohol will weaken your resolve?

859
00:53:09,257 --> 00:53:10,457
Weaken what resolve?

860
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:12,018
You're barely controlling yourself.

861
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:13,526
Are you afraid drunk you...

862
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:15,058
will go back on it and take me back?

863
00:53:18,197 --> 00:53:20,197
Ma'am, give us a bottle...

864
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:22,938
- Two bottles of soju. - Okay!

865
00:53:49,597 --> 00:53:50,958
Your car's ready.

866
00:53:51,157 --> 00:53:52,527
Will you go straight home?

867
00:53:53,728 --> 00:53:56,538
Shall we drop by the wine store?

868
00:53:56,597 --> 00:53:58,367
- I'm craving a drink. - Sure.

869
00:54:03,938 --> 00:54:06,108
Do you have the Chateau-d'Oex 2002?

870
00:54:06,878 --> 00:54:09,017
I'm sorry, sir. It's so expensive,

871
00:54:09,018 --> 00:54:10,917
not many people ask for it.

872
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:14,116
A few days ago, Ms. Lee Mi Jin mentioned it on her social media,

873
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,157
and people have been asking for it.

874
00:54:16,288 --> 00:54:17,518
My wife posted about it?

875
00:54:17,817 --> 00:54:18,828
Yes.

876
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:25,867
(Following 1)

877
00:54:27,728 --> 00:54:30,267
(Lee Mi Jin, Wine)

878
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:31,736
She has a huge influence.

879
00:54:31,737 --> 00:54:34,338
(12,223 likes, 2,682 comments, 3 days ago)

880
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:51,918
This...

881
00:54:54,688 --> 00:54:56,097
We had this?

882
00:54:56,757 --> 00:54:57,927
When did I buy it?

883
00:54:58,597 --> 00:55:00,067
I don't think I did.

884
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,498
That's insane.

885
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:38,697
You really know that chairman?

886
00:55:38,907 --> 00:55:41,108
- Yes. - What's he like in real life?

887
00:55:41,637 --> 00:55:44,378
He looks the same as he does on the news.

888
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:47,947
What do you call him?

889
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:49,248
"Mister."

890
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,647
- It's fascinating. - What?

891
00:55:53,648 --> 00:55:56,116
I feel like I'm with...

892
00:55:56,117 --> 00:55:57,757
a celebrity.

893
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,927
Not to mention that you're so nonchalant about it.

894
00:56:01,788 --> 00:56:03,257
Seo Ju Won...

895
00:56:04,297 --> 00:56:07,197
Do you want your celebrity friend to do something special for you?

896
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:08,367
What?

897
00:56:30,858 --> 00:56:31,918
Get lost.

898
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:38,596
You're such a sweet couple.

899
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:40,127
When are you getting married?

900
00:56:40,128 --> 00:56:42,097
We broke up, ma'am.

901
00:56:42,168 --> 00:56:44,737
What are you on about? Are you serious?

902
00:56:44,797 --> 00:56:46,268
We really broke up.

903
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:48,567
I'm being clingy to get her back,

904
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,177
but she's fighting it.

905
00:56:50,777 --> 00:56:53,677
Oh, I don't care if you broke up or not.

906
00:56:53,907 --> 00:56:55,816
Here's a beer on the house.

907
00:56:55,817 --> 00:56:57,117
Have a good time.

908
00:56:57,617 --> 00:56:59,588
- Thank you. - Sorry, but no.

909
00:56:59,947 --> 00:57:01,887
Ma'am. We don't accept freebies.

910
00:57:02,387 --> 00:57:04,886
I need to milk her dry.

911
00:57:04,887 --> 00:57:07,427
What? Is she buying today?

912
00:57:07,887 --> 00:57:11,427
Yes. Not just this meal but 22 more after that.

913
00:57:11,998 --> 00:57:13,397
You can't tell,

914
00:57:13,398 --> 00:57:16,197
but this guy here is filthy rich.

915
00:57:16,538 --> 00:57:20,268
But he insists that I treat him.

916
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:22,608
The rich are worse.

917
00:57:22,777 --> 00:57:24,007
Okay, then.

918
00:57:24,177 --> 00:57:25,808
If you treat me 22 times,

919
00:57:25,947 --> 00:57:28,007
I'll treat you 220 times. Will that do?

920
00:57:28,748 --> 00:57:31,747
Quit with the love spat...

921
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,788
and don't get too drunk.

922
00:57:33,847 --> 00:57:36,918
It's not a love spat. We broke up.

923
00:57:40,688 --> 00:57:41,887
I feel so sad.

924
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:45,058
How about...

925
00:57:45,998 --> 00:57:47,197
a soju and beer mixer?

926
00:57:49,097 --> 00:57:50,796
I'll mix one with the perfect ratio.

927
00:57:50,797 --> 00:57:51,797
Okay.

928
00:58:07,018 --> 00:58:08,018
Thanks.

929
00:58:15,288 --> 00:58:17,197
- It's so good. - Isn't it?

930
00:58:20,268 --> 00:58:22,437
- What? - Feed me a piece.

931
00:58:22,438 --> 00:58:23,837
- Feed yourself. - Feed me.

932
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:25,907
- Forget it. - That hurts.

933
00:58:27,867 --> 00:58:29,608
Hey, that's pretty.

934
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:31,578
As if they broke up.

935
00:58:31,737 --> 00:58:33,577
They're a couple of fools.

936
00:58:33,578 --> 00:58:36,046
- Goodness. - Feed me.

937
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:37,917
Can't you eat on your own?

938
00:58:37,918 --> 00:58:38,947
Please?

939
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:48,358
Ju Won.

940
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,097
Seo Ju Won.

941
00:58:52,898 --> 00:58:54,668
Go home.

942
00:58:55,067 --> 00:58:56,538
A chauffeur... No.

943
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,108
Call your secretary.

944
00:58:59,338 --> 00:59:00,338
What?

945
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:15,018
Call him. I'll go home.

946
00:59:19,128 --> 00:59:20,788
What are you doing?

947
00:59:22,157 --> 00:59:23,197
Yoon Seo.

948
00:59:25,297 --> 00:59:26,728
Let me ask you something.

949
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:32,268
Will you really break up with me?

950
00:59:49,257 --> 00:59:50,757
Do you not like me anymore?

951
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:04,697
Why did I do that?

952
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:08,668
Was it because it was late,

953
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:10,907
there was a breeze,

954
01:00:12,338 --> 01:00:14,108
and I was drunk?

955
01:00:17,717 --> 01:00:20,487
I told him the truth.

956
01:00:22,487 --> 01:00:23,518
No.

957
01:00:25,558 --> 01:00:26,828
I still...

958
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,398
like you a lot.

959
01:01:16,078 --> 01:01:20,347
(Cinderella at 2AM)

960
01:01:20,447 --> 01:01:23,148
I was a total moron last night.

961
01:01:26,547 --> 01:01:27,648
Darling.

962
01:01:28,347 --> 01:01:29,656
I wasn't lucky.

963
01:01:29,657 --> 01:01:31,458
He must remember everything.

964
01:01:32,657 --> 01:01:34,657
I think I was pathetic just now.

965
01:01:35,128 --> 01:01:37,228
Can you keep your promise...

966
01:01:37,797 --> 01:01:39,058
and break up with my son?

967
01:01:39,367 --> 01:01:40,828
She looks at my son...

968
01:01:41,467 --> 01:01:42,527
like this?

969
01:01:42,697 --> 01:01:43,938
Shall we hang out tomorrow?

970
01:01:44,137 --> 01:01:45,137
What?

971
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,708
I want to have fun and laugh a lot.

972
01:01:48,567 --> 01:01:50,438
That's how I want to spend my last day.

973
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:52,538
Can't I?
