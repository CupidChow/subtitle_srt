Yes, I understand.

13
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:20,641
I will break up with Ju Won.

14
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,712
My boyfriend, who I had dated for a year and six months,

15
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:27,512
was the youngest son of the major shareholder of my company.

16
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:30,081
I'm glad we're on the same page.

17
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:45,562
I guess this is how they give out money these days.

(Jungseo Bank, Ha Yoon Seo)

20
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:02,081
Thank you.

21
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,551
Actually, I was worried we'd have to raise our voices at each other.

22
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:09,521
I'm glad we're able to talk without doing so, Ms. Ha.

23
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:12,792
There's no need to thank me.

24
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,132
I'm grateful too.

25
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:16,602
You're treating me to a meal at a nice place like this,

26
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:19,472
and you also brought this up after we finished eating.

27
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:23,172
When will you be able to put an end to the relationship?

28
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:27,811
I think I will need some time for that.

29
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,680
- And the reason? - Until just a while ago,

30
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:32,012
the two of us were getting along fine.

31
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:34,811
What would Ju Won think if I suddenly wanted to break up?

32
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:37,351
He's already worried ever since I found out...

33
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:39,722
that he was your son.

34
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,422
But if I ask him to break up at this moment,

35
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,561
he'd figure out that you came to see me soon enough.

36
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:47,331
That would put you in a tough spot too.

37
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,831
So?

38
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:50,901
What do you want to do?

39
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:53,502
I will make him lose interest in me...

40
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:55,102
slowly and on his own.

41
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,901
It looks better to others to break up over differences.

42
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:02,072
And that would leave Ju Won with fewer lingering feelings as well.

43
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:05,282
I will sort things out within two months.

44
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,551
You seem to be very honest,

45
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:11,581
so I'll ask you honestly too.

46
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:14,121
Did you really...

47
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:18,891
date my son without knowing who he was?

48
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:22,702
Did you even...

49
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:26,831
like my Ju Won?

50
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:31,841
Ms. Ha.

51
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:42,211
Ms. Ha Yoon Seo.

52
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:44,322
Are you going home now?

53
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:10,711
Ju Won...

54
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:13,452
I liked him a lot.

55
00:04:16,352 --> 00:04:18,082
But if our differences are this great,

56
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:20,491
I'm not sure I can handle it.

57
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:22,821
Don't worry.

58
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:24,722
I'm good at knowing my own place.

59
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:27,891
I have no intention of not accepting the money you give me...

60
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,131
just to maintain my pride.

61
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,462
Within two months,

62
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:35,571
I will make a clean break with Ju Won.

63
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:06,172
Midnight.

64
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:09,741
What did Cinderella think after the magic had worn off?

65
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:15,712
At first, she would've been amazed that she went to the ball...

66
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:17,782
and would've been elated that she had met the prince,

67
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:19,751
finding it hard to fall asleep.

68
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:24,722
However, how did she feel at 2am?

69
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:28,852
Would she have felt nothing but giddiness then too?

70
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:34,092
I don't want to be in a relationship that would damage my self-esteem...

71
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:35,792
and cause me heartache.

72
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:44,102
Goodbye,

73
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,011

What? You're going to break up?

77
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,022
Hey.

78
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:03,162
You and Seo Ju Won will split up...

79
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,321
like this pair of chopsticks?

80
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:07,891
Yes, I will.

81
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:10,131
So, you mean you and Seo Ju Won...

82
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:12,931
will break apart...

83
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:14,631
like this piece of tofu?

84
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:16,601
Yes, that's right.

85
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:18,101
How many times do I have to say it, Uncle?

86
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:20,740
Well, I can't believe it, no matter how many times I hear it.

87
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,981
You were getting along just fine until recently.

88
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,681
So? Why do you suddenly want to break up?

89
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:29,551
Ju Won is...

90
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:31,951
the youngest son of AL Group.

91
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:34,591
Yes, Ju Won is the youngest guy on your team.

92
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,222
I'm sure everyone adores him like he's the youngest son of the family.

93
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:39,162
No, my company, AL Group.

94
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:41,191
He's the son of the chairwoman.

95
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,931
- A third-generation conglomerate. - What?

96
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:45,301
The youngest son of a conglomerate? Since when?

97
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:47,231
I'm sure it was since he was born.

98
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:49,402
That's not what I mean. When did you find out?

99
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,142
About a month ago?

100
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:57,811
It was something I never even imagined either.

101
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:00,652
That he was the chairwoman's son.

102
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:04,022

103

Yes, please look kindly upon me as well.

Everyone, let's give him a hand!

106
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:12,792
Oh, have a seat over here. Sit down.

107
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:15,092
- Gosh, he's handsome. - Hello.

108
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:16,801
He looks just like I did when I was young.

109
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:20,701
I had heard that conglomerates are a meritocracy these days,

110
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:23,601
but neither I nor anyone on our team...

111
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:24,901
ever imagined...

112
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,272
that our team's newest member was the chairwoman's son.

113
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:33,881
I didn't realize even while dating him.

114
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:40,022
Our relationship started while he was keeping his identity a secret.

115
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:44,222
I'm sure Ju Won missed his opportunity to tell me too.

116
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:51,561
It's a shame to say goodbye. Should I take you home?

117
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:55,232
No.

118
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,001
It's fine. You must be tired.

119
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:00,311
You always bring me home.

120
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,172
Why won't you let me do the same?

121
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:04,582
Well...

122
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:07,251
Now that I think about it,

123
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,621
I could've figured it out.

124
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:14,222
- Ta-da. - What's this?

125
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:15,852
I thought it might look good on you.

126
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:19,892
I see.

127
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,962
You thought this would look good on me?

128
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,001
Yes.

129
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:31,002
I look even better when I'm getting a refund.

130
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:32,502
Let's go and get that refund.

131
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:33,671
A refund? Why?

132
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:34,940
- Give me the shopping bag. - No.

133
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:36,111
- What about the receipt? - I don't have it.

134
00:08:36,112 --> 00:08:37,480
- When he bought me... - Quickly.

135
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:38,680
an expensive bag for our anniversary,

136
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,152
I should've known.

137
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:42,981
I didn't realize that he was from a rich family...

138
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:45,981
where a bag like this wasn't even a big deal.

139
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,392

140
00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:49,450

All right.

Let's go upstairs together.

144
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:57,700
I have a bottle of whiskey I got as a gift.

145
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:58,731

It's fine. Let's not interact at the office as much as possible.

How clumsy. You're the vice chairman.

159
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:25,362

182
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:31,792
And this credit card...

183
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:33,892
His family's company makes these cards?

184
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:38,101
Wait, but if you found this out a month ago...

185
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:39,401
and were fine until now,

186
00:10:39,402 --> 00:10:42,201
why did you decide to break up with him today of all days?

187
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:43,601
Excuse me!

188
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:46,412
Hey, they're calling for the owner. Hurry up and get over there.

189
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:48,741
You should go.

190
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:50,681
The employee should be the one hustling around here.

191
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:51,742
Now!

192
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:54,450
Gosh, I want to hear what Yoon Seo has to say.

193
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:56,451
- Darn it. - Gosh.

194
00:10:58,451 --> 00:10:59,480
Okay, so?

195
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:01,321
Why are you suddenly breaking up with him today?

196
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:04,791
His mother didn't give you an envelope full of money...

197
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,022
like in the dramas, did she?

198
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:08,992
No. She gave me a piece of paper.

199
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:10,402
To write my bank account number down.

200
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:12,101
What? Is that how it's done these days?

201
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:14,600
So? Did you write it down?

202
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:16,070
- Yes, I did. - Really?

203
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:17,340
- Really. - What's this?

204
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,772
- What do you mean? - I mean...

205
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:20,871
Are you the type of girl...

206
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:22,441
who'd easily accept money from your boyfriend's mom?

207
00:11:22,512 --> 00:11:24,081
What on earth is the reason?

208
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:27,151
I'm going to use it for Ji Seok's studies.

209
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:28,480
Who are you trying to fool?

210
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,350
You worked yourself to the bone to put yourself through college,

211
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:32,580
not even buying yourself a cup of coffee.

212
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:34,450
After you got a job, you didn't even buy yourself any clothes...

213
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:36,521
until your fifth year on the job, looking like a beggar,

214
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:37,560
to save up for Ji Seok's tuition.

215
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:40,060
Do you think I don't know that you would've already saved enough...

216
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:41,231
for Ji Seok's tuition?

217
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,402
Why on earth did you accept that money?

218
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:48,032
I thought I could break up if I accepted some money, at least.

219
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:51,971
And I'm telling you this just in case I can't break up...

220
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:53,811
even after accepting money.

221
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:56,882
You tell me each time you quit smoking.

222
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:58,840
You said that you had to tell people around you...

223
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:00,210
so you kept your word,

224
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:01,451
even if it was just to mind other's watching eyes.

225
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,081
That's why I'm telling you too.

226
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:08,451
It's a promise I must keep, no matter what.

227
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:11,492
But you'll have to keep seeing him after you break up.

228
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:13,591
What will you do?

229
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:16,561
She said not to worry about that.

230
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:18,430
If I just break up,

231
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:20,402
she'll send Ju Won to an office abroad.

232
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:25,101
That might be a better opportunity for Ju Won too.

233
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:32,481
Gosh.

234
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:34,681
I have no appetite anyway. I'll be going.

235
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:38,281
The next time I come here, I'll be single.

236
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:39,992
Make lots of makgeolli.

237
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:41,152
I'm off.

238
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:43,721
Yoon Seo.

239
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:46,262
Bye.

240
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:50,632
Ha Yoon Seo.

241
00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:56,441
What will I do with her?

242
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:11,351
(Seo Ju Won)

243
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:26,231
The person you reached is unavailable.

244
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:44,782
Doesn't it look weird?

245
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:46,492
It is weird.

246
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:47,892
Really?

247
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:49,591
Which part?

248
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:51,162
All of it.

249
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:53,691
I doubt that.

250
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:56,700
The best master tailor in Korea...

251
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:59,131
made this one and only suit for me...

252
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:01,471
out of the best fabric, made exactly to fit my body.

253
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:02,902
It makes no sense...

254
00:14:02,903 --> 00:14:05,571
that this suit and my physique put together is weird.

255
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,971
What?

256
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:10,382
Oh, you were talking about you.

257
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:12,782
What were you talking about, then?

258
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:14,451
Me? Yoon Seo.

259
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:16,211
She won't answer my calls.

260
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:18,451
There you go again about Ms. Ha.

261
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:19,851
Give it a rest, will you?

262
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:21,821
She must have days where she doesn't want to call you.

263
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,022
Look at me.

264
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,961
Your sister-in-law and I only check to see if the other is alive.

265
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:26,691
Gosh, you must be so proud.

266
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:28,031
Treat her well.

267
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:30,801
Not calling her is how I treat her well.

268
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:32,961
She isn't interested in me.

269
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:36,541
There are some marriages that are about the union of two families...

270
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,672
for business purposes that you don't know about.

271
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:42,112
Aren't you even worried about her when she's alone in Paris?

272
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:44,441
That's why I check in on her every now and then on social media.

273
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,652
I've been keeping up with her activities to see how she is.

274
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:50,580

(326 posts, 823,000 followers, 175 following)

277
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:54,492
By the way, are you allowed to be on social media?

278
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:56,391
Didn't you get banned...

279
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:58,491
by your secretarial staff after you posted that crying selfie?

280
00:14:58,492 --> 00:14:59,661
(Early morning vibes, I sometimes cry)

281
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:00,891
(Collecting my tears, It's good that I can cry)

282
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:02,362
(Banned forever from using social media)

283
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:03,801
Why, you little...

284
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:05,101
That was a long time ago.

285
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:08,101
And this account is just for looking around.

286
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:11,402
Hey, but since we're on the subject...

287
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:15,641
My secretarial staff were so against me being on social media,

288
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:16,882
but they're okay with Mi Jin using it.

289
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:18,042
Look.

290
00:15:18,412 --> 00:15:20,381
What she ate, what she wore...

291
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:22,511
She posts stuff like this all the time, but they don't care.

292
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:23,521
(Posts)

293
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,782
I think it's because...

294
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:26,590
everything she eats, wears, and uses...

295
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:28,191
leads to sales.

296
00:15:28,522 --> 00:15:30,422
Yes. What do you think?

297
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:35,792
Who am I talking to right now?

298
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,201
You little punk.

299
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:41,532
Anyway, I'm going to change into my next outfit.

300
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:43,672
Well, I'm sure it'll look good on me anyway.

301
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:48,471
Look at me.

302
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,882
(Ha Yoon Seo)

303
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:57,022
I'm tired. I'll see you later.

304

(Ha Yoon Seo)

305
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:15,632
I will break up within two months.

306
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:17,142
No matter what.

307
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:20,441
Let's make him lose interest in me...

308
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:23,071
slowly and on his own. All right.

309
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:27,252
But how?

310
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:32,681
Ms. Ha, did you have a good weekend?

311
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:34,091
I missed you.

312
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,221
Me too.

313
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:40,091
I'll head inside first.

314
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:41,262
Okay.

315
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:48,231
Darn it. That wasn't it.

316
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:04,981
How can I make him lose interest in me?

317
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,861

"Borrow money?"

321

"There's no worse quality in a partner than borrowing money."

322
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:31,941
"At first, you start with a small amount..."

323
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:34,511
Ju Won.

324
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:36,511
Could you...

325
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:39,781
lend me some money?

326
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:43,291
How much will it take?

327
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,592
How much can you lend me?

328
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,342
However much it is, just say the word.

329
00:18:03,412 --> 00:18:05,842
I apologize for my frankness, but I'm rich.

330
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,862
Gosh.

331
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:24,231
I mean, I'm sure money is no big deal for a rich guy.

332
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:26,902
If not...

333
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:29,872
"Show your rough side?"

00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,152
Why, that piece of trash.

335
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:44,981
Darn, you jerk. You ought to freeze to death...

336
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:46,352
You're so dead.

337
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:49,351
What's wrong? Just let it go.

338
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:50,991
Hold on tight to your seatbelt.

339
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,531
No, Yoon Seo!

340
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:06,602
Sweetie.

341
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:11,681
Gosh, that'd be so out of the blue.

342
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,582
Are there any good ideas?

343
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:20,491
Oh, I see.

344
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:39,741
"Maintaining a frown."

345
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:47,511
Yes. Frowning like this all day will make me very unlikeable.

346
00:19:47,912 --> 00:19:50,281
From now on, this is my default facial expression.

347
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:52,720
- I'm back. - My gosh!

348
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:55,751
Oh, my. That must've been heavy.

349
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:57,592
- These came for you. - Thanks.

350
00:19:58,491 --> 00:19:59,591

Thank you!

352
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:03,261
I could've picked them up myself. Why did you pick these up?

353
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,430
You told me to pick up some coffee on the first floor...

354
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:06,872
and pick up the packages too.

355
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:09,602
Oh, right.

356
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:11,741

Hey, Ju Won.

358
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:16,641
I asked you to get me two sleeves. It's way too hot.

359
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:18,240
Must you be such a slow learner?

360
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:21,180
You had to struggle and study very hard to join AL Group,

361
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:22,680
so you should do your best to learn things.

362
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,421
You still haven't even mastered such basic tasks.

363
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:27,322
How will you move on to the next level?

364
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:37,361
Keep working hard, and you'll be able to move up the ladder.

365
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,901
My gosh! Isn't this so cute?

366
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:41,131
This is a pet rock.

367
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:42,902
It's a rock, but people think of this as their pet.

368
00:20:43,031 --> 00:20:46,001
And I bought these to improve my blood circulation.

369
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:48,611
There are massage chairs on every floor of the company...

370
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:49,911
where my friend works,

371
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:51,612
but we have none, you know.

372
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,612
So I bought these to boost my circulation...

373
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,092
To boost my circulation...

374
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:06,362
I'll refrain from getting personal packages delivered to work.

375
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,072
She's acting a little strange today.

376
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:23,040
You saw that, right? The look on Ha Yoon Seo's face.

377
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,882
I was simply giving my junior colleague...

378
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:26,740
some pointers on how to get ahead at work.

379
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:27,812
What's wrong with that?

380
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:30,210
Ha Yoon Seo and I are the same age,

381
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:32,781
but she manages a team, whereas I'm just an assistant manager,

382
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:35,521
so I bet she gave me that look thinking I had no right to do that.

383
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:37,460
I think that's a bit of a stretch,

384
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:39,020
but she does seem to be in a bad mood today.

385
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:41,790
Usually, I get way more packages delivered to the office, you know.

386
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,101
But I caught her giving me the evil eye earlier.

387
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,132
I nearly handed in my resignation right then and there.

388
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:49,072
Let's get back to work.

389
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:51,000
She'll glare at us again if she sees we've all stepped out.

390
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:52,372
Okay, let's get back to work.

391
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:55,672
By the way,

392
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:57,311
our company...

393
00:21:57,312 --> 00:21:59,141
doesn't care about its employees' welfare at all. Right?

394
00:21:59,142 --> 00:22:00,812
There's nothing in the office kitchen,

395
00:22:00,882 --> 00:22:03,281
except for green tea.

396
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,351
I heard other companies... What was it? Rev-Dazs?

397
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:08,651
They buy such expensive ice cream for their employees.

398
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:10,761
I'm telling you. I can't stand the higher-ups.

399
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:12,721
All they care about is fattening up their own wallets.

400
00:22:13,221 --> 00:22:14,332
Right?

401
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:16,632
Yes, agreed.

402
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:33,341
We stocked the green tea shelf.

403
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:34,352
- I see. - Yes.

404
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:53,062
(They'll think of me as a boomer boss.)

405
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:55,072
They'll think of me as a boomer boss at this rate.

406
00:22:57,072 --> 00:22:59,372
I really can't allow that to happen.

407
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:04,342
- Babe. - Yes?

408
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:11,582
That's right. I should only do it outside of work.

409
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:14,092
I'll pick a fight every time he says anything.

410
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:16,392
One moment. Let me order some coffee first.

411
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:17,922
I'm hungry.

412
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:21,161
Then shall we eat something?

413
00:23:21,162 --> 00:23:22,362
What do you feel like eating?

414
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:24,230
- I don't know. - What?

415
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:25,832
I do not know.

416
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:29,701
You don't know?

417
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:32,001
Normally, you would...

418
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:33,872
Let's have pasta today.

419
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,271
Today, we should have kalguksu.

420
00:23:35,612 --> 00:23:37,041
Today, we'll check out all the famous bakeries.

421
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:40,082
Normally, you're very decisive with these things.

422
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:45,921
- How about pasta? - It won't sit well with me.

423
00:23:45,922 --> 00:23:46,950
How about the spicy kalguksu?

424
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:48,591
It's too spicy.

425
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:50,490
Oh, right. But you said you liked how spicy it was.

426
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:51,661
But I don't feel like it today.

427
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:54,931
I see, not today. Then today, why don't we...

428
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:57,332
My answer is no.

429
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:01,802
I didn't even name a dish.

430
00:24:03,971 --> 00:24:05,072
Then why don't we...

431
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:07,642
just go somewhere and have a drink?

432
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:14,481
Well, I said we should eat something.

433
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:18,021
My gosh. You really are annoying me.

434
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:26,892
I'm never like this, so it feels very awkward to act like this.

435
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:35,201
Let's get out of here. Come on.

436
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:37,371
What? And go where?

437
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:39,102
We should decide where we are going.

438
00:24:39,302 --> 00:24:40,302
Hey, why...

439
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:43,411
- Come on. - Where are we going?

440
00:24:43,412 --> 00:24:45,241
- Let's go. - We should decide...

441
00:24:46,481 --> 00:24:47,680
Enjoy.

442
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:49,112
- Thank you. - Thank you.

443
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,251
See?

444
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:54,822
You always like coming here, so I knew you'd like this.

445
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:58,562
Today, I didn't really want to come here.

446
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:01,931
But we're already here anyway, so I will eat this.

447
00:25:16,211 --> 00:25:17,882
Anyway, is something the matter?

448
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:22,112
You've been acting a little strange since yesterday.

449
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:24,852
By any chance, did Ji Seok...

450
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:26,152
Ji Seok? What about him?

451
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:28,592
Are you going to ask if he caused another trouble?

452
00:25:28,852 --> 00:25:30,250
No, don't get me wrong.

453
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:31,290
Don't lie.

454
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:34,092
Do you think all he does is cause trouble?

455
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,831
Why must you make it sound like my brother is a troublemaker?

456
00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:40,162
I'm sorry. I apologize for jumping to conclusions about Ji Seok.

457
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:42,172
But...

458
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:48,271
why do I feel like you keep trying so hard to get me riled up?

459
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:53,951
What? What did I even do?

460
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:58,352
I need to use the restroom.

461
00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:17,872
This is ridiculous.

462
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:21,612
I wanted to make Ju Won hate me slowly but surely...

463
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:25,780
so he'd get sick of me and leave me of his own accord.

464
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:27,812
I thought it'd be better for both of us.

465
00:26:28,882 --> 00:26:30,621
I thought, "I'll be irritable around him..."

466
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,021
"and neglect him like a couple in a rut."

467
00:26:33,322 --> 00:26:36,151
"Then I'll just say I've met someone else."

468
00:26:36,152 --> 00:26:37,960
"It'll break his heart,"

469
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:40,731
"but he'll say we should end things."

470
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,802
That was my plan,

471
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:47,872
but how come he won't even get angry with me?

472
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:55,341
Hey, your girlfriend seems a little upset today.

473
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:56,672
Did you do something wrong?

474
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:58,342
I'm not sure.

475
00:26:58,842 --> 00:27:00,811
She's scary when she's angry.

476
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:02,052
You must find her scary too.

477
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:04,052
Not really.

478
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:06,281
I even find that adorable.

479
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:07,721
My goodness.

480
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:27,441
Ju Won.

481
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:30,342
How am I going to break up with you?

482
00:27:39,082 --> 00:27:40,082
My gosh.

483
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,852
Yoon Seo.

484
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:44,490
- So? You're alone now? - Yes, I came alone.

485
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,220
No, I mean... Are you single now?

486
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:48,191
You said you'd break up with him.

487
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:50,291
I knew it.

488
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:51,960
It's not easy to break up with someone.

489
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,862
If you could just declare something and do it,

490
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,902
I'd be living smoke-free now.

491
00:27:56,832 --> 00:27:58,470
Hey, Yoon Seo. You're here.

492
00:27:58,471 --> 00:27:59,671
I'm glad you're here.

493
00:27:59,672 --> 00:28:01,710
Can you try this new batch of makgeolli I made?

494
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:02,711
It's organic makgeolli.

495
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:04,641
I used 20 types of grains to make it.

496
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,642
Hey, Uncle.

497
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:07,680
I'm not going to drink for a while.

498
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:11,450
Why not? You're in charge of tasting our new makgeolli.

499
00:28:11,451 --> 00:28:14,422
Yes, you must do your job even if you're facing a breakup.

500
00:28:14,691 --> 00:28:16,421
- Yes. - Hey, go inside.

501
00:28:16,422 --> 00:28:17,892
I'll cook you something nice. All right?

502
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:22,561
Uncle, where's the booze?

503
00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:24,531
Oh, it's inside.

504
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:29,831
Hey, she said she was breaking up with her boyfriend.

505
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:31,171
Did they really break up?

506
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:32,602
Can we really give her booze now?

507
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:34,912
Yes, go for it. She needs to get drunk.

508
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,680
If not, she'll just keep it all bottled up and never let it out.

509
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:39,342
It'll drive me nuts.

510
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:42,151
- How much makgeolli did you make? - Twenty jars.

511
00:28:42,152 --> 00:28:44,121
Let her drink them all today.

512
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,751
And she took it?

513
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:47,491
Yes.

514
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:53,922
Ms. Ha Yoon Seo took the money?

515
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,291
I didn't think she was the type to do that.

516
00:28:57,332 --> 00:28:59,431
It's better this way because she won't cause trouble later on.

517
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:02,402
Unlike someone else, I had to deal with.

518
00:29:03,572 --> 00:29:06,441
Anyway, are things going well between you and your wife?

519
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,470
Yes, of course.

520
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:11,111
I was on the phone with her on my way here.

521
00:29:11,112 --> 00:29:14,280
She had beef bourguignon today but didn't really like it.

522
00:29:14,281 --> 00:29:15,582
She said she couldn't even eat half of it.

523
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:17,651
See?

524
00:29:17,652 --> 00:29:19,180
You were utterly devastated back then,

525
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:22,152
but you're doing great now.

526
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:25,260
I'm sure Ju Won will eventually come...

527
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:27,092
to thank me.

528
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:32,931
Anyway, about Ha Yoon Seo...

529
00:29:34,632 --> 00:29:37,302
I'd call her polite based on her attitude and the way she talks,

530
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:39,572
but the things she says...

531
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,112
She's very brazen.

532
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:47,312
Is she really dating Ju Won for his money?

533
00:29:48,082 --> 00:29:50,082
Why? Does that make you angry?

534
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:53,382
Like you said, it's a good thing as she won't cause trouble later on.

535
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:07,632
So, she has to break Ju Won's heart like this too.

536
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:12,642
Anyway,

537
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:15,471
Ms. Ha took the money?

538
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:18,181
I certainly didn't expect that to happen.

539
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:20,280
Just go and meet with the chairwoman again.

540
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:21,651
Go and give it back to her.

541
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:23,511
Go and be like Cinderella!

542
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:26,021
Hey. "Cinderella?"

543
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:28,451
Do you really think it suits me?

544
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:30,990
Cinderella who marries the prince...

545
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:32,790
does not exist in real life.

546
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:35,631
That only happens in the fairy-tale world.

547
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:38,562
So? Are you really going to break up with Ju Won?

548
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:41,331
- Yes, I must break up with him. - You can't.

549
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:43,131
How will you break up with him when you love him so much?

550
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,902
You are wrong. I can totally end things with him.

551
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:48,812
I am a tough cookie.

552
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:51,940
Shall I show you how cold and ruthless I can be?

553
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:53,281
- Show me. - You want me to show you? Fine.

554
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:03,092
What are you doing?

555
00:31:04,491 --> 00:31:06,591
(I can't figure out a solution. Let's just break...)

556
00:31:06,592 --> 00:31:08,861
Hey, what are you doing?

557
00:31:08,862 --> 00:31:10,960
Sending a breakup text when you're drunk...

558
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:12,401
is the worst thing you can do.

559
00:31:12,402 --> 00:31:13,862
- Don't do it. Hey! - Give it back!

560
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:17,030
I can't stoop any lower!

561
00:31:17,031 --> 00:31:18,971
I already took the money, you know.

562
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:27,912
I really can't hurt him every single day...

563
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:30,882
for the next two months for this slow breakup thing.

564
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:34,791
It's better to be heartbroken and just get it over with.

565
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:38,062
For both of us.

566
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:44,862
Hey.

567
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:46,731
Hey, Yoon Seo!

568
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:49,902
- Hey, wake up. - Ju Won...

569
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:53,342
I'm sorry.

570
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:01,211
I'm sorry...

571
00:32:20,902 --> 00:32:21,971
Oh, it's perfect.

572
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:24,172
Ha Yoon Seo, wake up!

573
00:32:26,241 --> 00:32:27,402
Wake up!

574
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:34,652
Is your stomach all right?

575
00:32:34,981 --> 00:32:36,582
Why did you drink so much?

576
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:37,721
Did something happen?

577
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:40,481
Did you get into a fight with that lanky wimp or...

578
00:32:41,491 --> 00:32:43,491
Hey, he's older than you. Don't be so rude.

579
00:32:43,892 --> 00:32:45,721
I'm only saying this for your own sake.

580
00:32:45,892 --> 00:32:47,731
I told you. I don't like him.

581
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:49,861
He looks like he's dead broke.

582
00:32:49,862 --> 00:32:51,031
He's far from a rich prince.

583
00:33:02,142 --> 00:33:05,112
(Seo Ju Won, the youngest son of one of Korea's largest conglomerates)

584
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:08,312
You're such a good judge of character.

585
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:09,481
I sure am!

586
00:33:09,882 --> 00:33:12,251
Men know when they see a guy who's a real good catch.

587
00:33:12,582 --> 00:33:14,021
You'll struggle if you stay with him.

588
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,691
Financial stability is very important.

589
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:18,562
These days, love is not enough.

590
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,862
Is he texting you already?

591
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:29,971
Ms. Ha, what does that mean?

592
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:31,941
What's he talking about?

593
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:34,241
(Seo Ju Won: Yes, got it!)

594
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,072
I can't figure out a solution. Let's just break...

595
00:33:40,981 --> 00:33:42,781
(Seo Ju Won, Bae Jang Hee)

596
00:33:44,281 --> 00:33:45,281
What are you doing?

597
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:47,790
Hey, what are you doing?

598
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,891
Sending a breakup text when you're drunk...

599
00:33:49,892 --> 00:33:51,220
is the worst thing you can do.

600
00:33:51,221 --> 00:33:52,521
Don't do it. Hand it over!

601
00:33:52,662 --> 00:33:53,721
What is this?

602
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:56,362
I can't figure out a solution. Let's just break...

603
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:02,231
I must be going crazy. Why did I send it in the group chat?

604
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,102
Hey, what's with you? You're scaring me!

605
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:08,711
You don't need to know.

606
00:34:12,112 --> 00:34:14,081
I can't believe I tried to break up with him over text.

607
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:15,851
I didn't know I was such a jerk.

608
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:19,182
And I sent that in the group chat, for goodness' sake!

609
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:20,822
Darn it.

610
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:23,250
(Recents, Seo Ju Won)

611
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:24,422
And what is this?

612
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:27,291
What on earth did we talk about for over a minute?

613
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:29,691
I don't remember anything.

614
00:34:41,141 --> 00:34:42,242
Wait!

615
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:43,711
Going up.

616
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:45,282
The doors are closing.

617
00:35:16,441 --> 00:35:17,811
Why are you standing there like that?

618
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:20,682
Well, it's just...

619
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:23,952
I saw that we talked on the phone last night.

620
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:25,581
For a minute and ten seconds.

621
00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:30,021
But I couldn't remember what we talked about.

622
00:35:32,492 --> 00:35:33,791
Nothing much.

623
00:35:34,561 --> 00:35:36,190
I saw your message in the group chat...

624
00:35:36,191 --> 00:35:38,061
and called to ask you what was up.

625
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:40,262
Then I just said "Sweet dreams," and we hung up.

626
00:35:42,702 --> 00:35:44,871
Anyway, who were you with that you drank so much last night?

627
00:35:45,472 --> 00:35:47,541
Oh, I was at Makyirae.

628
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:49,072
I see.

629
00:35:49,172 --> 00:35:51,882
Also, about the message in the group chat...

630
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:54,310
Oh, Ms. Ha.

631
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:55,552
Hello!

632
00:35:55,882 --> 00:35:57,052
Good morning.

633
00:35:57,152 --> 00:35:58,382
- Hello. - Going up.

634
00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:00,251
The doors are closing.

635
00:36:01,052 --> 00:36:02,092
Hey, you.

636
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:08,161
Oh, right. Ms. Ha. Are you ignoring my message?

637
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,461
Sorry?

638
00:36:09,592 --> 00:36:11,402
The message you sent last night. What was it about?

639
00:36:12,632 --> 00:36:13,661
Oh, that was...

640
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:16,532
I got drunk and sent it by mistake.

641
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,441
My goodness. You drunk-texted.

642
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:22,512
Hold on. Yes, here.

643
00:36:24,072 --> 00:36:26,782
"I can't figure out a solution."

644
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:28,382
"Let's just break..."

645
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:32,981
Was this about someone's hairstyle? Who were you talking about?

646
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:35,291
What?

647
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:38,321
Oh, come on. Must you ask?

648
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:40,621
We already know the answer.

649
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:44,701
Hey, I go to a barbershop in Gangnam.

650
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,600
Clearly, she was talking about Ju Won.

651
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:49,471
Ju Won. I bet you still see the same hairstylist...

652
00:36:49,472 --> 00:36:51,172
you saw all through high school who charges eight dollars for a cut.

653
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,001
You don't understand why some people pay so much for a haircut, right?

654
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,441
Ju Won, your hairstyle is just too plain.

655
00:36:57,981 --> 00:36:58,981
Right, it is too plain.

656
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:01,581
Ms. Ha, you were criticizing...

657
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:03,112
Mr. Bae's hairstyle, right?

658
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:05,721
No way. You were talking about Ju Won, right?

659
00:37:05,722 --> 00:37:07,350
Or you were probably talking about how Ye Young...

660
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:09,020
desperately needs to get her roots touched up.

661
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,491
Hurry up and tell us.

662
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:12,390
Why make us uncomfortable by sending...

663
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:13,560
such a cryptic message without a subject?

664
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:15,531
Whose hairstyle were you talking about?

665
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:16,532
Mine!

666
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:20,132
I was talking about my own hairstyle.

667
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:22,072
I see.

668
00:37:22,932 --> 00:37:24,202
So, you knew.

669
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:27,141
Well, I couldn't bring myself to say it.

670
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:28,911
I must say,

671
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:31,882
She always sees herself objectively. We must learn this from her.

672
00:37:32,842 --> 00:37:36,411
Oh, Leah who works at the salon across the street is very good.

673
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:37,581
Do you want to go there?

674
00:37:37,782 --> 00:37:39,221
If you tell her that I recommended you,

675
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:42,191
we'll both get a 20-percent discount.

676
00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:43,851
Shall I book you an appointment for this evening?

677
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:46,592
Yes, you have to go.

678
00:37:47,322 --> 00:37:48,791
Nice, I'll get a 20-percent discount!

679
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:56,972
- Leah. - Yes!

680
00:37:57,731 --> 00:37:59,201
I'll be back in a moment.

681
00:37:59,202 --> 00:38:00,202
Okay.

682
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,152
What am I doing here right now?

683
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:22,231
But does Ju Won really believe this?

684
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:34,611
Ms. Ha,

685
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,112
I'm working on the press release we'll send out tomorrow morning.

686
00:38:37,242 --> 00:38:40,581
Do you mind sending me the exhibition schedule again?

687
00:38:43,052 --> 00:38:45,882
(Call Recording, Seo Ju Won)

688
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:49,992
What? This is from yesterday.

689
00:38:50,992 --> 00:38:52,422
Nothing much.

690
00:38:52,492 --> 00:38:53,961
Then I just said "Sweet dreams," and we hung up.

691
00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:59,331
(Call Recording, Seo Ju Won)

692
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:01,731
Hey, Ju Won.

693
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:03,831
I think you sent the message in the group chat by mistake.

694
00:39:03,972 --> 00:39:06,342
Ju Won, let's end it.

695
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,072
What?

696
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:11,782
Let's break up.

697
00:39:13,911 --> 00:39:15,782
Let's talk in person. Where are you now?

698
00:39:16,282 --> 00:39:18,182
No, don't come.

699
00:39:20,182 --> 00:39:22,422
Nothing will change even if you show up now.

700
00:39:24,021 --> 00:39:26,791
We're going to break up.

701
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:01,992
I ordered you a hot tea.

702
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:06,001
Why did you put on a show...

703
00:40:07,762 --> 00:40:09,202
after that call last night?

704
00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:14,271
I wanted to pretend it never happened.

705
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:22,381
Ju Won. The truth is...

706
00:40:22,382 --> 00:40:23,952
I don't want to hear about it.

707
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:28,751
You met my mother, didn't you?

708
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:32,291
What are you on about?

709
00:40:34,492 --> 00:40:35,691
I heard about it.

710
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:49,511
You visited Mother?

711
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:51,411
Yes. You're late.

712
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:52,711
Yes.

713
00:40:53,481 --> 00:40:54,481
Si Won.

714
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:56,911
Yoon Seo is acting a bit weird.

715
00:40:57,652 --> 00:40:59,552
Oh, really?

716
00:40:59,722 --> 00:41:01,251
She won't take my calls...

717
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,291
and her texts are short.

718
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:05,791
Do you think I upset her?

719
00:41:09,432 --> 00:41:10,492
Never mind.

720
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:12,101
I'll head inside.

721
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:20,641
Ju Won.

722
00:41:24,012 --> 00:41:25,041
Yoon Seo.

723
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,711
She had dinner with our mother.

724
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:36,952
My mother...

725
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:38,960
I'll talk to her.

726
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:40,561
That won't solve anything.

727
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,992
You must get it if your brother told you everything.

728
00:41:47,362 --> 00:41:50,231
We should break up.

729
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,711
Let's break up, Ju Won.

730
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:10,121
Let me apologize first.

731
00:42:11,052 --> 00:42:12,322
You must've been offended.

732
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:14,092
It wasn't because of the chairwoman.

733
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:17,632
Well, yes.

734
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,861
To be honest, I decided to break up with you...

735
00:42:20,862 --> 00:42:22,501
after meeting with the chairwoman.

736
00:42:23,802 --> 00:42:24,802
But...

737
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:29,072
Ever since I knew who you were,

738
00:42:30,572 --> 00:42:33,282
I'd been thinking we should break up.

739
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:35,481
And the timing is now.

740
00:42:38,882 --> 00:42:39,882
You thought of...

741
00:42:41,282 --> 00:42:42,722
breaking up with me?

742
00:42:47,592 --> 00:42:49,391
You said you wanted to...

743
00:42:50,592 --> 00:42:52,531
marry and live with me forever.

744
00:42:52,532 --> 00:42:53,601
That was...

745
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:57,771
That was...

746
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:01,101
before I knew who you really were.

747
00:43:04,742 --> 00:43:07,112
There was a time when I dreamed of such a future.

748
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:14,282
I'd never met someone I loved with all my heart.

749
00:43:23,262 --> 00:43:24,961
Can't you forget about my background...

750
00:43:25,862 --> 00:43:27,302
and love me for me?

751
00:43:34,202 --> 00:43:36,041
Did you ever skip lunch...

752
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:38,682
because you couldn't afford it?

753
00:43:41,612 --> 00:43:44,612
I bet you never had to work to earn your own tuition.

754
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:48,722
Or had to worry about finding a job.

755
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:54,092
We're too different.

756
00:43:55,862 --> 00:43:57,632
The chairwoman did nothing wrong.

757
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:01,101
Nothing good will come from a union of people...

758
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:03,271
who are so different.

759
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:08,541
I don't want a charming prince...

760
00:44:09,242 --> 00:44:10,572
on a white steed.

761
00:44:12,211 --> 00:44:14,342
I don't want to enter a world I'm not part of...

762
00:44:14,842 --> 00:44:16,182
and become miserable.

763
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:17,452
Stop it.

764
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:19,251
Why?

765
00:44:19,922 --> 00:44:21,121
Is this bothering you?

766
00:44:21,182 --> 00:44:22,251
It's not that.

767
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,961
I don't mind. I'm fine, but...

768
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:28,362
Why do you...

769
00:44:29,092 --> 00:44:31,262
keep disparaging yourself?

770
00:44:33,702 --> 00:44:36,072
The more you say, the worse you must feel.

771
00:44:42,311 --> 00:44:44,012
I'm sorry to put you through this.

772
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:45,841
Will you think about...

773
00:44:45,842 --> 00:44:46,882
No.

774
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:50,182
I've told you clearly how I feel.

775
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,751
Let's call it quits.

776
00:45:17,112 --> 00:45:19,311
Yoon Seo. Wait.

777
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,541
Let's talk a bit more.

778
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:31,391
Is that all the vice chairman said?

779
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,222
That I met with the chairwoman?

780
00:45:36,632 --> 00:45:38,961
I even accepted money.

781
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:42,532
You know...

782
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:44,702
I love money.

783
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:55,711
So...

784
00:45:57,512 --> 00:45:58,882
Goodbye, Seo Ju Won.

785
00:46:24,711 --> 00:46:27,512
Cinderella's magic spell ends at midnight.

786
00:46:28,182 --> 00:46:30,211
She leaves behind the shoe that falls off...

787
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:33,021
and vanishes from the prince's view.

788
00:46:34,952 --> 00:46:37,952
Did she leave her trace on purpose?

789
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:42,992
No.

790
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:46,101
She hated more than death...

791
00:46:46,601 --> 00:46:48,061
that the prince would see her shabby reality.

792
00:47:04,911 --> 00:47:07,322
I wanted to make a grand exit...

793
00:47:07,782 --> 00:47:10,291
and leave no trace behind.

794
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:22,101
The team rookie suddenly went on leave?

795
00:47:22,402 --> 00:47:24,731
We could never imagine doing that.

796
00:47:24,771 --> 00:47:27,201
Right. He'll be away for a whole week.

797
00:47:27,202 --> 00:47:28,871
Is something up with him?

798
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:31,882
I don't know.

799
00:47:32,211 --> 00:47:33,382
Let's start the meeting.

800
00:47:36,882 --> 00:47:39,351
Some can't even afford to show...

801
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,081
the pain of a break-up.

802
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:46,290
Our application, "All Lara," focuses on growth...

803
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:49,461
and connects small business owners with interested customers...

804
00:47:49,592 --> 00:47:51,960
Customers and businesses...

805
00:47:51,961 --> 00:47:54,032
Life comes at us every single day.

806
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:57,632
Does Ji Seok focus in class?

807
00:47:57,731 --> 00:47:59,371
He seems to manage...

808
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:06,282
Responsibilities spring up from all sides.

809
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,351
You can head home first.

810
00:48:14,481 --> 00:48:16,390
Are you sure you don't mind?

811
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:18,721
I feel bad, but see you tomorrow.

812
00:48:18,722 --> 00:48:19,992
See you.

813
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,682
(AL CARD Employee, Seo Ju Won)

814
00:48:44,811 --> 00:48:47,652
I must bear it even if I'm not okay.

815
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:52,722
Because this is the ordinary life I chose instead of love.

816
00:49:08,101 --> 00:49:09,512
Hey, what?

817
00:49:09,742 --> 00:49:12,012
"What?" I called because I was worried.

818
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:13,481
Are you all right?

819
00:49:13,842 --> 00:49:15,811
- I guess... - You aren't, of course.

820
00:49:16,282 --> 00:49:17,282
So what?

821
00:49:17,552 --> 00:49:18,981
When does Ju Won come back?

822
00:49:19,282 --> 00:49:20,520
Tomorrow?

823
00:49:20,521 --> 00:49:21,521
Do you think...

824
00:49:21,522 --> 00:49:22,921
he was transferred abroad?

825
00:49:22,922 --> 00:49:23,952
I don't know.

826
00:49:24,552 --> 00:49:25,560
What's wrong?

827
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:28,290
Did your heart break to think he left without saying goodbye?

828
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:30,492
Don't be silly. I twisted my ankle.

829
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:32,432
Bye. I have to get back to work.

830
00:49:41,742 --> 00:49:42,910
Are you okay, Ms. Ha?

831
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,141
Ju Won.

832
00:49:45,342 --> 00:49:46,342
I'm fine.

833
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:47,882
Didn't you just hurt yourself?

834
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:50,112
I'm fine.

835
00:49:53,382 --> 00:49:54,851
I said I was fine.

836
00:49:56,652 --> 00:49:57,691
I'm...

837
00:49:59,161 --> 00:50:00,391
Wait here.

838
00:50:00,691 --> 00:50:02,132
I'm really fine.

839
00:50:15,072 --> 00:50:16,072
Ms. Ha.

840
00:50:21,612 --> 00:50:22,612
No.

841
00:50:36,691 --> 00:50:37,762
Let me.

842
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:39,532
Okay.

843
00:50:44,371 --> 00:50:46,702
Where did you get such cute slippers?

844
00:50:46,972 --> 00:50:48,402
I'm glad you think they're cute.

845
00:50:48,742 --> 00:50:51,242
The only store still open was a stationery store.

846
00:50:51,371 --> 00:50:54,080
Also, I noticed earlier that you had...

847
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:55,981
scraped your foot.

848
00:51:04,152 --> 00:51:05,922
Would it be weird if I put it on for you?

849
00:51:08,621 --> 00:51:09,731
It would.

850
00:51:15,101 --> 00:51:16,101
Thanks.

851
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:32,081
In the end, we were left with nothing but a scrape,

852
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:36,851
but one day, even that will heal.

853
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:43,461
My acupressure slippers hurt like crazy.

854
00:51:43,891 --> 00:51:45,601
Let's brew some green tea teabags.

855
00:52:26,842 --> 00:52:29,572
This is madness. Let's go see.

856
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,511
- Hurry up. - I'm hurrying.

857
00:52:31,512 --> 00:52:34,441
- Hurry up faster. - I'm trying, okay?

858
00:52:38,552 --> 00:52:40,681
- Ice cream? - What's all this?

859
00:52:40,682 --> 00:52:42,821
These are really tasty brands.

860
00:52:42,822 --> 00:52:44,791
- I don't believe this. - My gosh.

861
00:52:44,952 --> 00:52:46,092
Ice cream too?

862
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,221
No way. This is amazing.

863
00:52:48,222 --> 00:52:49,891
There's green tea flavor too.

864
00:52:52,862 --> 00:52:55,202
Ms. Ha, we have a fridge full of ice cream.

865
00:52:55,362 --> 00:52:57,100
A coffee machine and massage chair too.

866
00:52:57,101 --> 00:52:59,040
Ms. Ha, there's crazy news.

867
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:00,640
Check the online notice board.

868
00:53:00,641 --> 00:53:01,702
What's the fuss about?

869
00:53:01,802 --> 00:53:03,441
Quick. Check this out.

872
00:54:21,621 --> 00:54:22,691
Thank you.

873
00:54:32,132 --> 00:54:33,501
Bye, then.

874
00:54:36,831 --> 00:54:38,331
It took me a while to persuade my mother...

875
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:40,902
to let me stay instead of transferring me abroad.

876
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,140
I can't help it if you want to break up with me.

877
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:47,512
You have free will.

878
00:54:48,242 --> 00:54:49,282
But...

879
00:54:50,311 --> 00:54:51,682
I'm also free to cling to you.

880
00:54:53,682 --> 00:54:54,882
From now on...

881
00:54:55,851 --> 00:54:57,152
I'll cling to you.

882
00:54:59,492 --> 00:55:02,021
I'll act as desperate and pitifully as possible.

883
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,532
Don't be too mean, Yoon Seo.

I don't want us to drift apart.

887
00:55:57,452 --> 00:55:59,321
Ju Won threw down the gauntlet,

888
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:02,182
and he started to throw himself at me in earnest.

889
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:04,391
Why are you following me, sir?

890
00:56:05,521 --> 00:56:07,322
- Are you all right? - I'm not all right.

891
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:08,661
Date me.

892
00:56:08,891 --> 00:56:10,561
I'll show you...

893
00:56:11,061 --> 00:56:14,262
just how much I like you and why we must be together.

894
00:56:15,402 --> 00:56:18,831
Can you keep your promise and break up with my son?

895
00:56:19,202 --> 00:56:21,302
Let's work on breaking up too.
