(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

12
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,578
I should...

13
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:57,749
let you go, right?

14
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:18,069
Should I?

15
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:37,728
That night,

16
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:40,659
when the fireworks were at their brightest,

17
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,969
we broke up.

18
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,789
(Ha Yoon Seo)

19
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:21,969
Ta-da.

20
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:24,668
What's this?

21
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:27,238
They were so pretty I had to get them.

22
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:32,379
And this is what I made myself.

23
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:39,119
You should've brought something with a jewel, not a flower.

24
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:42,559
How could you say that? You're so materialistic.

25
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,129
You didn't know that about me?

26
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:49,728
You can make flower rings?

27
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:51,969
That's pretty cute.

28
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,539
I still prefer something with a shiny jewel.

29
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,439
Seriously?

30
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,548
Will she say yes if I give her a ring?

31
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,138
You can't take photos without asking.

32
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,678
I had to. You were so pretty.

33
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:37,508
Look over here. I'll take some more.

34
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,219
That's adorable.

35
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:45,589
Will you stop?

36
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,638
(Camera)

37
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,279
(Delete profile)

38
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,428
I'll build up on the resort event...

39
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:31,029
based on what we discussed today.

40
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:32,698
(Event schedule)

41
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,238
When should we have the next meeting?

42
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:40,108
Hello? The next meeting?

43
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:43,878
What?

44
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:46,548
Oh, I'm sorry.

45
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:49,988
What did you say? I didn't hear you.

46
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:54,089
I'd appreciate it if you'd concentrate.

47
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:56,688
When should we have the next meeting?

48
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,498
- Hey, how about... - Yes?

49
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:14,709
We both hung in there hoping the time would somehow end.

50
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:17,308
We'll meet up again tomorrow.

51
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:18,579
Bye.

52
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:21,248
Do you think Ms. Ha...

53
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,988
Just then...

54
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,759
(Sorry for texting. I couldn't forget you.)

55
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:33,628
What is this text about?

56
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:00,388
I kept getting texts...

57
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,557
from a number that wasn't saved on my phone.

58
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:04,589
(Block, Report as spam)

59
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:18,839
It can't be.

60
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:42,928
(Are you well? I am if you are.)

61
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,297
(Be sure to eat dinner. You skip when you're busy.)

62
00:06:47,298 --> 00:06:50,909
They're clearly things an ex-boyfriend would send.

63
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,938
It's not Ju Won.

64
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:56,649
Did he get a new number?

65
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:00,247
My goodness.

66
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:02,649
(Seo Ju Won)

67
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,618
Hello, sir.

68
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:06,089
Why did you call?

69
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:08,019
Let's postpone today's meeting to next week.

70
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:10,188
Yes, sir.

71
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:12,958
(Seo Ju Won)

72
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,358
He didn't change his number.

73
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:15,659
What's going on, then?

74
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:18,127
Who would continuously send texts...

75
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:20,438
to the wrong number?

76
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:28,009
I'm sorry but I think you have the wrong number.

77
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:33,849
Wait. What if this is a phishing scam?

78
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,818
As soon as I text back...

79
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:39,248
No.

80
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:44,889
(Headquarters Director Seo Ju Won)

81
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:47,628
Hang on. He has two phones?

82
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,769
(Headquarters Director Seo Ju Won)

83
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:56,568
Why would he hide...

84
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:06,019
(Headquarters Director Seo Ju Won)

85
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:10,748
What are you doing?

86
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:13,158
- What? - Don't you think this was wrong...

87
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,759
when we decided to break up?

88
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,728
- What do you mean? - What do I mean?

89
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:23,867
(Are you well? I am if you are.)

90
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:25,568
Did you think I wouldn't catch on...

91
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:27,039
if you used another number?

92
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,268
I think there's a misunderstanding.

93
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:32,538
It took a lot of courage to break up with you.

94
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,039
- If you send such texts... - I didn't.

95
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:36,109
What?

96
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,149
I caught you red-handed.

97
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:39,879
You have two phones.

98
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:41,418
Oh, that?

99
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:46,088
I'm testing an AL Electronics phone that will be released next quarter.

100
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:50,489
What?

101
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:55,529
You know everything's top secret.

102
00:08:55,798 --> 00:08:57,268
I used it only when I was alone,

103
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:59,298
and I freaked out when I saw you looking.

104
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,039
Is that so?

105
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:05,468
Yes.

106
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:11,509
Bye, then.

107
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:15,847
Yes, Ye Young. You want to grab dinner?

108
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,718
- Where shall we meet? - That's my phone.

109
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:45,848
I'm heading home.

110
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:50,718
Bye.

111
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,659
She suddenly left on time?

112
00:09:57,058 --> 00:09:58,259
We should too, then.

113
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,198
- Nice one. - Let's go.

114
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:05,899
Stupid me.

115
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:08,369
Why did I get it so wrong?

116
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,838
(Can we meet again someday?)

117
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,109
Because of you...

118
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:20,619
Who on earth are you?

119
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:24,588
Is it your ex-ex-boyfriend?

120
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:25,918
Yoon Seo.

121
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,827
I know a bit because I've gotten a lot of these in my time.

122
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:32,058
These texts are dripping with longing.

123
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:35,328
It's something you'd send an old flame.

124
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:39,129
Your ex-boyfriend Ju Won said it wasn't him,

125
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:41,568
so think about your ex-ex-boyfriend.

126
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:44,468
Or your ex-ex-ex-boyfriend.

127
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:47,779
Or your four times ex-boyfriend.

128
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:49,678
Uncle.

129
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:51,208
Get your own life on track.

130
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,409
It is on track.

131
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:56,048
Didn't you eat out with someone in the past?

132
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,188
You wouldn't send such texts to someone you just had a meal with.

133
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,718
You have a point.

134
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:07,029
"Sorry for texting. I couldn't forget you."

135
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,999
I think it's a clever phishing scam.

136
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:13,098
Since I know it's not Ju Won,

137
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,039
I'll report it as spam.

138
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:17,139
What are you doing?

139
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:18,708
It's weird.

140
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:21,109
No scammer would be this sentimental.

141
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,548
- I need to check. - What for?

142
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,548
Hello?

143
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:32,619
You've been texting this number recently, haven't you?

144
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,318
Who the heck are you?

145
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:36,688
Put it on speaker.

146
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,828
Isn't this Kang Jae Hee's number?

147
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:42,229
It's not.

148
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,298
It's Ha Yoon Seo's number.

149
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:47,698
I thought you were someone I knew.

150
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:50,909
I saved the number but couldn't find a profile picture.

151
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:52,539
I'm sorry for the trouble.

152
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,379
I apologize.

153
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:05,649
I'm sorry for reading the texts...

154
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,759
that weren't meant for me.

155
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:10,129
Okay, bye.

156
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:13,229
Darn it.

157
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,898
It wasn't spam. It was a sad story.

158
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,529
He wasn't a scammer.

159
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:19,529
He was just a sad man.

160
00:12:19,668 --> 00:12:20,769
Yes.

161
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:22,598
I guess he broke up too.

162
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:24,568
Excuse me.

163
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,279
Yes, I'm coming.

164
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:47,958
Why are you offering to help when I can manage on my own?

165
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:49,869
You'll be done sooner if you have help.

166
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:53,639
You weren't...

167
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:58,168
bummed or anything to find out it wasn't Ju Won, were you?

168
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:00,608
- What? - You know how it is.

169
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:02,437
You want to be forgotten,

170
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:05,948
but you'd be bummed if he forgot you too soon.

171
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:08,348
I wouldn't.

172
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,749
But now I'm seeing why people say...

173
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,818
you shouldn't date a colleague.

174
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,428
It's really hard having to face him at work.

175
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:23,968
- Don't face him, then. - How do I do that?

176
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:25,769
You can avoid him as much as you can.

177
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:29,938
That's not an easy thing to do while working in the same office.

178
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:34,739
Yoon Seo. Ji Seok's here.

179
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:37,078
Okay. Is it that time already?

180
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:40,619
Hey, you're a grown man now.

181
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:42,648
Did you come over to walk your sister home?

182
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:43,848
Good boy.

183
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:46,088
I should give you some pocket money for...

184
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:50,889
I only have a dollar. Maybe next time.

185
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:52,328
Hi, Ji Seok.

186
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:56,598
You get a little more handsome each time we meet.

187
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:58,428
Are your grades still as bad?

188
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:00,068
Pretty much.

189
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:04,308
- Let's go. - Already?

190
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:05,968
Have something to eat while you're here.

191
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:07,278
Do you want some noodles?

192
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,779
No, thanks. It's fine.

193
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:11,109
Bye.

194
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,347
See you.

195
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:13,578
- Okay. - Bye.

196
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:15,119
Goodbye.

197
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:22,619
What's up with the siblings that used to be the closest?

198
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,029
I wonder.

199
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:27,028
(Makyirae, Craft Makgeolli)

200
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:28,558
Unless you have other plans,

201
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,729
we'll meet here and walk home together from now on.

202
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:33,838
I'd love to meet you at the school gate, but I won't.

203
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:35,369
Do you object?

204
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,468
No.

205
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,909
What did the school say?

206
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:42,308
They're still discussing what to do with the others,

207
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:45,078
but Seok Hyun and I are to do voluntary work at school for a week.

208
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:49,649
A week of voluntary work doesn't mean you didn't do wrong.

209
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:51,789
I know.

210
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:54,718
And don't expect Young Soo to be understanding.

211
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:56,958
Don't force your apology on him either.

212
00:14:57,328 --> 00:15:00,229
It can't be helped if he hates you. That's your burden to bear.

213
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,129
Okay.

214
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:08,568
I'll bear the burden and apologize properly.

215
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,779
I'm sorry I said such nasty things.

216
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:15,639
But...

217
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,808
do you know it's because I care about you?

218
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,619
I know.

219
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:26,718
But Yoon Seo.

220
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,859
This is a bit gross.

221
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,758
I know it is.

222
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,197
But you'll run off if I don't do this.

223
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:36,899
I'm taking you somewhere.

224
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:40,139
- Follow me. - I can still do that if you let go.

225
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:41,769
Yoon Seo.

226
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,479
(School workbooks)

227
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,948
I know I'm not in a position to say this,

228
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:52,909
but do you think this will help when the KSAT is just a month away?

229
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,418
To be honest, there's no college I want to go to...

230
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,989
or anything I want to be.

231
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:01,457
I left you alone so far...

232
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,458
because I didn't want to force you to do anything.

233
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:06,499
But I want you...

234
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:09,129
to experience the feeling of accomplishing something.

235
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,168
To do something ordinary like everyone else.

236
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,639
So take the KSAT.

237
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,769
Do the best you can.

238
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:18,668
Can you do that?

239
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,509
- Yes. - Good.

240
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:27,718
Finish all of them, okay?

241
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:29,078
All of them?

242
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:31,118
Yes. Why else would you buy books?

243
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,289
Hey, it's Wimp.

244
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:35,489
I mean, this guy looks like your boyfriend.

245
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:38,428
His eyes and nose. They're just like Wimp's.

246
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:40,859
He doesn't look like him at all.

247
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,398
Let's go and pay.

248
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,428
It's stupid of me...

249
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:45,999
to liken Wimp to a rich heir, right?

250
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:48,438
He'd sue me if he heard.

251
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:49,639
Yes.

(AL Group Director Seo Ju Won kicks off joint data deal)

253
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,749
To think I asked if he sent me such texts...

254
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,818
when all he cares about is his career.

255
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:05,648
I should avoid him as best I can starting tomorrow.

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,029
(AL Group Director Seo Ju Won kicks off joint data deal)

257
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:23,039
I came to say something.

258
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:27,378
Is there anything left between us to say?

259
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,238
We can still talk even if we have broken up.

260
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,608
Did you and Wimp break up?

261
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,877
What did you do to my sister?

262
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:36,248
Why did you dump her?

263
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:37,749
Why did you abandon her?

264
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:41,658
She dumped me.

265
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,158
I got abandoned.

266
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:45,489
No way.

267
00:17:46,828 --> 00:17:48,729
Why did you do that all of a sudden? I thought you liked him?

268
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:52,728
Go on inside unless you want to die.

269
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,298
I should stay with you.

270
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:56,068
What if Wimp...

271
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,268
What if he tries to hurt you to get revenge?

272
00:17:58,269 --> 00:17:59,668
I should beat him up.

273
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:01,979
Get lost before you get beaten up.

274
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,479
What? But...

275
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:05,878
Go.

276
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:40,378
Why are you here?

277
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:47,189
I want the presents back.

278
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:51,358

and asking if I'd sent the weird texts.

281
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:11,449
What were those texts?

282
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,419
I know I no longer have the right to ask,

283
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:19,249

What are you on about?

291
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,588
There was a mix-up.

292
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:53,818
It looked like he'd broken up too.

293
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:55,358
I see.

294
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,628
It can't be helped if you think I'm pathetic for coming here.

295
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:02,929
It takes time to get over someone.

296
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:06,669
Consider this customer service. So just accept it.

I try to stay in my office in case you do.

299
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,588
Tell me if it becomes too much.

300
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:27,919
What will you do then?

301
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:31,289
I'll move my office or something.

302
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:37,769

305
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:48,009
It's not easy.

306
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:49,908
I'm learning that now.

307
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:54,378
But still,

308
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,588

309
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:00,219
I should try to get through it.

Yes.

311
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:07,398
All right.

00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,837
Even though AL CARD had a late start,

313
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:16,567
it has managed to become number two...

in the industry through aggressive marketing.

315
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:20,407
However, it has not been able...

316
00:21:20,408 --> 00:21:22,908
to catch up to number 1 for the past 3 years.

If so, how about we take my car?

00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:11,557
- Right, the work trip. - I bought it a month ago,

329
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:12,959
so it's still new.

330
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:16,397

Oh, right. We're supposed to stay there for one night.

334
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:29,739
I have to make a few stops along the way, so I'll go alone.

335

All right, then.

Gosh. I wanted to give him a ride in my new car...

to win him over and gain his favor.

340
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:50,969
- Darn it. - Gosh.

341
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:53,269
He's avoiding me on purpose.

342
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:56,969
I keep avoiding her like this. Is this the right thing to do?

343
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:02,209
She ate in Cheongdam-dong, which means she's still in Korea.

344

And it means she'll come home today.

00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,979
Good grief. How long is she planning to stay?

It feels awkward.

My gosh. Then how do you live with him?

We haven't been living together.

364
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:17,748
Right. You moved to Paris...

00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:20,719
That's right.

367
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:24,429
The most time we've spent together was like 13 hours.

368
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:25,657
Thirteen hours?

369
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:28,028
Yes, on the day we first met.

370
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:29,528
From Incheon to Paris.

371
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:32,229
Oh, we had our blind date on the plane.

372
00:24:32,368 --> 00:24:33,398
- What? - What?

373
00:24:42,878 --> 00:24:45,279
I've never had a blind date on a plane before.

374
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:47,949
Same here.

375
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:50,989
But I thought this was a good idea.

376
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:57,558
As you know, the arranged marriage has to happen.

377
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:00,157
I'm not expecting any romance,

378
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:03,098
but it'll be hard to live together if we can't stand each other.

379
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:06,628
Well, right.

380
00:25:07,068 --> 00:25:08,998
This is better than meeting for a couple of hours a few times.

381
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,768
Here, we have to spend many hours together in the same space.

382
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,468
This way, we can learn about each other's food...

383
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,338
and wine preferences,

384
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,337
movie tastes,

385
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:18,748
what we like to do to kill time on the plane,

386
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:21,578
and even each other's sleeping habits.

387
00:25:21,848 --> 00:25:23,279
Isn't it kind of nice?

388
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:27,459
On top of that, you got to meet me.

389
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,157
What kind of wine would you like?

390
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:37,269
- I'll have red. - White wine, please.

391
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:41,397
Is the temperature all right with you?

392
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:42,598
- It's hot in here. - I'm cold.

393
00:25:58,219 --> 00:25:59,719
(Husband)

394
00:26:03,618 --> 00:26:05,388
The person you've reached is unavailable...

395
00:26:06,158 --> 00:26:07,199
Why isn't she picking up?

396
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,458
She's not picking up her phone,

397
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:11,199
and I don't even know why she's in Korea.

398
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,298
So, when is she leaving?

399
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,068
Gosh.

400
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:19,269
I feel so uncomfortable.

401
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:34,358
Oh, boy.

402
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:47,439
What can I do to get through this?

403
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:56,438
Look, I clearly told you I wasn't the person you were looking for.

404
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:57,648
Why are you texting me again?

405
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,419
Hearing that you weren't the one I was looking for...

406
00:27:02,548 --> 00:27:03,918
made me feel more at ease.

407
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,648
What is this nonsense about?

408
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:09,358
(Incoming Call)

409
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:19,728
Hello? What are you doing?

410
00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:21,568
Why did you call me?

411
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:23,769
And what does this text message mean?

412
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,239
I literally meant what I wrote.

413
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,408
I'll be honest. While sending those text messages,

414
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:33,578
I was secretly hoping they wouldn't get delivered.

415
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:36,578
I can't really figure out how I feel.

416
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:39,019
I was hoping they'd reach her.

417
00:27:40,189 --> 00:27:41,519
But in a way, I hoped they wouldn't.

418
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:48,529
With that said...

419
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:52,828
Can I keep texting you once in a while since this happened anyway?

420
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:56,539
You can just ignore my messages like you've been doing.

421
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:00,739
My gosh. Is he a psychopath or something?

422
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,938
- "Psychopath?" - Oh, no.

423
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:04,209
You heard that?

424
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:07,108
Yes, I heard you.

425
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:08,678
I'm glad you heard me.

426
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:11,317
I understand that you sent me those messages by mistake.

427
00:28:11,318 --> 00:28:12,718
But you'll keep texting me...

428
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:14,288
when you know I'm not the right person?

429
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:15,588
Does it make sense to you?

430
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:16,789
So, I can't do it?

431
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:22,998
Look. I really wasn't going to say this,

432
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:25,428
but I thought my ex-boyfriend sent me those messages,

433
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:27,769
so I asked him about it and embarrassed myself.

434
00:28:28,098 --> 00:28:30,637
Whenever I get a text from you,

435
00:28:30,638 --> 00:28:33,638
I feel rattled as if I've received an emergency disaster alert.

436
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,638
I guess you still have feelings left for your ex-boyfriend.

437
00:28:36,908 --> 00:28:38,748
Not exactly.

438
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:41,019
We're in the process of breaking up at the moment.

439
00:28:41,148 --> 00:28:43,547
I'm trying to focus on work...

440
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:46,749
to overcome the breakup.

441
00:28:50,058 --> 00:28:51,127
Gosh.

442
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:52,858
What is this? Why do I keep answering your questions?

443
00:28:53,128 --> 00:28:55,529
Forget it. Do not text me again.

444
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:13,378
My gosh.

445
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,489
Just forget about it.

446
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,789
I need to work.

447
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,519
I have such an important project coming up.

448
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,888
Yes, I must get some work done. Focus.

449
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:35,669
You're here, Ms. Ha.

450
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:39,039
This is my car. Isn't it so nice?

451
00:29:39,138 --> 00:29:41,538
Yes, you said it was new, right? It really is nice.

452
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:45,078
I know. I love my car so much!

453
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:47,577
I'm sorry I'm late!

454
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:48,578
Oh, there you are.

455
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:49,948
Be punctual, will you?

456
00:29:49,949 --> 00:29:51,948
What if Director Seo gets there before we do?

457
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:52,949
I'm sorry.

458
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,657
It's not like I slept in.

459
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:58,327
I'm late because I picked up snacks for all of us.

460
00:29:58,328 --> 00:29:59,587
Ta-da!

461
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:01,798
I got all kinds of new snacks on the market.

462
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:04,699
You did? My gosh, thanks.

463
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,827
- Why did you buy so many things? - Don't I deserve a compliment?

464
00:30:06,828 --> 00:30:09,468
Yes, well done. Shall we get going now?

465
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:10,768
- Yes. - Let's go!

466
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:11,808
All right, let's go.

467
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:32,029
Ye Young, you're really...

468
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:34,958
No wonder your surname is No.

469
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:38,529
You really have no manners, Ye Young.

470
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:40,938
You knew those crumbs would get everywhere.

471
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,638
How could you eat that in my car?

472
00:30:42,969 --> 00:30:44,009
I'm sorry.

473
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:50,138
Oh, no.

474
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,317
Don't do that! Hold on.

475
00:30:57,318 --> 00:30:58,888
Ye Young, use this.

476
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:00,618
Like this.

477
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:02,759
Wear it like this while you eat that.

478
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:09,259
Thank goodness Director Seo isn't here to see this.

479
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:12,368
Seriously, thank goodness he didn't come with us.

480
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:14,269
Anyway,

481
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:16,598
is Director Seo coming with his driver?

482
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,038
I don't know.

483
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,837
If I were him, I'd bring along...

484
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,107
my driver, secretary, and so on...

485
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:25,978
in a huge limousine and drink champagne on the way.

486
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:28,377
How much longer will you make me do this shoulder dance?

487
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:30,047
I'll drink and dance like that on the way.

488
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,689
Director Seo never makes it obvious that he's a rich heir.

489
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:34,758
You know,

490
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,218
when I first heard that Ju Won was the chairwoman's son,

491
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:39,157
I was utterly shocked.

492
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:42,298
I still feel as though someone crashed into me.

493
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,038
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm okay.

494
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,878
- Are you okay? - Yes. Are you all right?

495
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,648
Oh, no.

496
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,588
Then I'll be in touch. All right.

497
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:09,118
Bye.

498
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:17,528
How did it go?

499
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:19,498
He admitted it was his fault.

500
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:21,169
He'll have his insurance company handle it.

501
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:30,108
I still haven't even removed the plastic covers yet.

502
00:32:31,578 --> 00:32:34,348
I'm sorry, Jang Dol!

503
00:32:35,548 --> 00:32:36,618
Jang Dol?

504
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:38,618
Your car has a name?

505
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:43,157
Oh. We aren't running late, are we?

506
00:32:43,158 --> 00:32:44,428
No. I just looked it up.

507
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,728
We can get to the nearest rental car store in ten minutes.

508
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:48,558
If we leave now, we won't be late.

509
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,657
Shall we cab there?

510
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:52,328
- Yes. - There he is.

511
00:32:59,608 --> 00:33:01,308
What? Why is Director Seo here?

512
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:02,738
I called him.

513
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:05,948
I was worried that he'd be all flustered without me...

514
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:07,877
if he arrived there before we did.

515
00:33:07,878 --> 00:33:10,888
But I didn't know he'd come here to pick us up.

516
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,449
Oh, my.

517
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,189
Are you not hurt?

518
00:33:14,858 --> 00:33:17,459
- No, I'm fine. - You should see a doctor first.

519
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:19,788
I can handle the business trip alone, so go ahead and cancel...

520
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,598
We shouldn't cancel the trip over this.

521
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:23,098
You two should go to the nearest hospital.

522
00:33:23,298 --> 00:33:24,397
I'm totally fine.

523
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:25,898
I'm totally fine too.

524
00:33:26,098 --> 00:33:27,668
Mr. Bae, you can go alone.

525
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:30,338
Although it doesn't look like you have any serious injuries.

526
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:34,238
Well, I'm fine too.

527
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,678
Besides, it doesn't matter if I'm hurt...

528
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,648
because it's such an important day.

529
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,508
Okay, let's not waste any more time.

530
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:41,547
- Let's hurry. - Let's go.

531
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:42,749
- Wait, but... - Let's go.

532
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:51,128
But are you sure you can drive all the way there?

533
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:54,557
Long-distance driving is exhausting. Let me drive.

534
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:57,529
It's fine. You know I'm a good driver.

535
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,797
You said you always fell asleep when I was driving.

536
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:04,439
I drove your car many times when we had meetings elsewhere.

537
00:34:04,838 --> 00:34:06,368
Well, back then...

538
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:08,737
I just closed my eyes for a few moments.

539
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:10,947
Shall we listen to some music?

540
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,379
Oh, I'll pick the songs.

541
00:34:12,808 --> 00:34:14,847
Director Seo, can I connect my phone to your car via Bluetooth?

542
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:15,919
Yes, of course.

543
00:34:18,948 --> 00:34:19,948
What?

544
00:34:20,218 --> 00:34:21,618
"Yoon Seo's Phone?"

545
00:34:23,658 --> 00:34:25,359
Ms. Ha, have you been in this car before?

546
00:34:26,528 --> 00:34:28,828
Oh, well...

547
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:32,399
Oh, right.

548
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:36,737
I have a friend named Kim Yoon Seo.

549
00:34:36,738 --> 00:34:37,968
I see.

551
00:34:46,348 --> 00:34:48,519
(Assistant PR Manager Kwon Gyeong Eun)

552
00:34:49,618 --> 00:34:51,648
Hello, Ha Yoon Seo speaking.

553
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:54,757
Hello, Ms. Ha. What time will you be arriving?

554
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:56,789
We'll arrive on time.

555
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:58,658
I'll call you when I'm close.

556
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:06,697
Oh, that's right!

557
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:10,367
The other day, Director Seo wanted to talk to me about work...

558
00:35:10,368 --> 00:35:12,807
and gave me a ride to the subway station.

559
00:35:12,808 --> 00:35:15,108
I guess it was connected that day.

560
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:18,749
Oh, right. I forgot about that.

561
00:35:19,278 --> 00:35:22,677
So, it was you, not my friend, Kim Yoon Seo.

562
00:35:22,678 --> 00:35:24,178
Yes.

563
00:35:34,328 --> 00:35:37,299
(Boyoung Rest Area)

564
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,278
Don't you think something's going on between those two?

565
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:57,717
Something's going on? Like what?

566
00:35:57,718 --> 00:36:00,448
I could tell something was up during the meeting we had.

567
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:02,057
I think they're seeing each other.

568
00:36:02,058 --> 00:36:03,257
What? They're seeing each other?

569
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:04,987
Gosh, be quiet.

570
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:07,427
How could I be quiet when you're talking such nonsense?

571
00:36:07,428 --> 00:36:10,027
He worked under the scary Ha Yoon Seo for two years.

572
00:36:10,028 --> 00:36:11,728
They're seeing each other? As if.

573
00:36:11,729 --> 00:36:14,027
She should be grateful he hasn't run away yet.

574
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:15,169
That's true.

575
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:16,998
But how will you explain the Bluetooth thing earlier?

576
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:18,038
What do you think?

577
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,068
Seo Ju Won is trying to discipline her.

578
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:21,838
- Discipline her? - That's right.

579
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,807
The other day, he called her to his office...

580
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:26,308
and pet her on the head like this to intimidate her.

581
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,688
They can talk about work in the office.

582
00:36:35,689 --> 00:36:37,188
Why talk in the car?

583
00:36:37,189 --> 00:36:39,527
Clearly, he wanted her to see his fancy car and be intimidated...

584
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:41,999
to put her in her place and show her that he was her boss now.

585
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:43,299
You know?

586
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,728
Do you want to get some snacks?

587
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:47,169
You want a snack? Sure.

588
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:48,698
What will you buy us?

589
00:36:49,968 --> 00:36:50,998
Well, let's see what they have.

590
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:52,609
- Oh, sure. - Over there.

591
00:36:57,178 --> 00:37:01,048
Oh, my. You bought all this food for us.

592
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:02,448
You're like Sheikh Mansour.

593
00:37:02,618 --> 00:37:04,149
Others might wonder if he's a rich heir or something.

594
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:05,919
Oh, you are a rich heir.

595
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:07,818
Anyway, thank you.

596
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:09,158
Thank you for the snacks!

597
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,189
You bought us snacks and are driving us too.

598
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:15,629
You have to do all this because of Mr. Bae.

599
00:37:15,698 --> 00:37:16,729
No, it's fine.

600
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:18,697
Because of me?

601
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:21,668
We could've avoided the accident had you driven carefully.

602
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:24,568
What could I have done? That car hit us from behind.

603
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:28,539
Well, you should've seen that car coming behind you.

604
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,039
That's right.

605
00:37:31,278 --> 00:37:33,478
I should've seen that car coming.

606
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:35,578
Why didn't I see it?

607
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:38,018
You were dropping the crumbs all over.

608
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:40,348
I couldn't see that car because I was so distracted!

609
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:43,088
I didn't say anything because I was so kind and understanding!

610
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:46,157
Gosh, why are you being like this? That's enough.

611
00:37:46,158 --> 00:37:49,499
All right, let's eat. Mr. Bae. Here, Ms. No.

612
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,629
- Babe, eat up. - Okay.

613
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:53,999
"Babe?"

614
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:58,269
What? Ms. Ha is your "babe?"

615
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:01,777
My gosh, no! What are you talking about?

616
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:04,407
How could I be Director Seo's babe?

617
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:05,408
Please, Mr. Bae.

618
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,648
But you called her "Babe" just now.

619
00:38:07,649 --> 00:38:09,617
No. I said, "You too."

620
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:12,248
That's right. That's what I heard too.

621
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,617
- I heard that too. - Right?

622
00:38:13,618 --> 00:38:14,959
Yes, for sure.

623
00:38:15,218 --> 00:38:17,388
He clearly said, "You too."

624
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:20,729
What do I do?

625
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:24,528
That was really dangerous, following the Bluetooth incident.

626
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:44,617
He totally called her "Babe."

627
00:38:44,618 --> 00:38:45,618
They can't fool my ears.

628
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:48,188
They can't fool my ears either. See? I was right.

629
00:38:48,189 --> 00:38:51,088
They're definitely seeing each other, at the very least.

630
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:52,358
Well, maybe.

631
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:55,758
I thought it was impossible. But maybe they're seeing each other.

632
00:38:56,658 --> 00:38:58,097
Let's wait and see.

633
00:38:58,098 --> 00:38:59,098
Okay.

634
00:39:00,368 --> 00:39:03,439
Well... There's no way. they know, right?

635
00:39:03,939 --> 00:39:05,039
That we're dating...

636
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:06,808
I mean, that we dated.

637
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:09,508
I'm sorry. I should've been more careful.

638
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:13,848
Well, let's both be more careful from now on.

639
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:15,319
Okay.

640
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:16,678
Wait.

641
00:39:19,419 --> 00:39:20,488
Here.

642
00:39:21,658 --> 00:39:23,189
What is this?

643
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:25,028
You were in an accident.

644
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:28,558
I saw them selling it over there, so I bought it for you.

645
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:31,728
It's an all-natural pain reliever made with medicinal herbs...

646
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:32,998
such as houttuynia cordata, milk thistle, orange peel,

647
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,169
and dong quai.

648
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:37,039
Its name is "Hanbange," as in "instant cure."

649
00:39:37,368 --> 00:39:38,408
It's a double entendre.

650
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:42,609
When did you get this?

651
00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:51,549
Thanks.

652
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:53,348
But...

653
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:55,789
don't do these things for me from now on.

654
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:59,589
Don't pick me up even if you hear that I got into an accident.

655
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:02,428
Don't worry about me from now on.

656
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:05,028
Why not?

657
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:06,229
What do you think?

658
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:08,299
We broke up,

659
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,399
so we're no longer together.

660
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,269
We should let ourselves grow apart.

661
00:40:13,808 --> 00:40:14,878
Yoon Seo.

662
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:15,879
Bye.

663
00:40:42,698 --> 00:40:44,098
You made it, Director Seo.

664
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:47,468
- Hello. - This way, please.

665
00:41:40,629 --> 00:41:43,598
Ju Won will have more responsibilities from now on.

666
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,439
I hope our time together won't make it harder for him.

667
00:41:56,638 --> 00:41:59,078
My gosh. This is so awkward.

668
00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:04,278
Gosh, having to dress like this at home feels so stuffy.

669
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:07,148
I mean, she should've called ahead if she was coming...

670
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,859
to someone else's house.

671
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,189
Oh, it's the house we live in together.

672
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:16,028
We haven't lived together for that long, so I forgot.

673
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:21,769
I want to have a drink.

674
00:42:22,468 --> 00:42:25,808
No. It's my house. I can have a drink.

675
00:42:42,988 --> 00:42:47,028
That's a limited edition bottle with only two imported to Korea.

676
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:50,598
And those are cups I got as gifts from the French Embassy.

677
00:42:50,899 --> 00:42:53,027
And I bought that myself when I went on a trip to Milan...

678
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,198
because the case was pretty.

679
00:42:55,738 --> 00:42:59,408
Oh, is that so? I sure have a good eye for things.

680
00:42:59,808 --> 00:43:01,308
I should post this on social media.

681
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:04,778
Oh, I hear you're opening up the Hanok guesthouse in Yeosu.

682
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:06,209
Won't you go there?

683
00:43:07,008 --> 00:43:10,549
Oh, I have an important meeting tomorrow morning.

684
00:43:11,618 --> 00:43:14,388
If you have an important meeting, why did you come out here?

685
00:43:14,988 --> 00:43:16,689
I was going to go to bed after having a drink.

686
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:19,157
Isn't it better to go to bed without having a drink?

687
00:43:19,158 --> 00:43:20,589
If it's an important meeting, that is.

688
00:43:21,328 --> 00:43:24,098
Thank you for the advice.

689
00:43:33,508 --> 00:43:34,539
Right.

690
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,109
She'll leave after a few days anyway.

691
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:38,848
I'll let it slide.

692
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,209
You know why?

693
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,919
I'm a generous guy. Right.

694
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:46,819
Oh, wait. Why is Sebastian... I mean...

695
00:43:48,388 --> 00:43:50,958
Why are you taking my dishwasher?

696
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:53,657
Oh, Director Lee said she was switching it...

697
00:43:53,658 --> 00:43:54,959
with a new one from Germany.

698
00:43:55,028 --> 00:43:56,757
- Pardon? - There's a new brand coming in...

699
00:43:56,758 --> 00:43:59,098
to her department store, so she wants to test it out.

700
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:02,169
- This goes into storage too, right? - Yes.

701
00:44:02,698 --> 00:44:03,738
Here we go.

702
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:05,908
Wait, what...

703
00:44:11,979 --> 00:44:13,178
Sebastian...

704
00:44:14,549 --> 00:44:15,718
Alberto.

705
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,328
What? Didn't you go to bed?

706
00:44:30,528 --> 00:44:32,999
Oh, I was going to go to bed,

707
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:34,939
but I think we should talk.

708
00:44:35,468 --> 00:44:36,598
Let me come in for a minute.

709
00:44:40,468 --> 00:44:44,138
So, we haven't shared every bit of our lives together,

710
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:47,149
so I just figured you came home all of a sudden from Paris.

711
00:44:48,178 --> 00:44:49,648
- But what's that? - What's what?

712
00:44:49,649 --> 00:44:51,077
I thought you were just here for a few days.

713
00:44:51,078 --> 00:44:52,089
Why switch out the appliances?

714
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,419
I'm not just here for a few days.

715
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,419
Then what?

716
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,088
I'll consider this a congratulatory drink on being appointed to...

717
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:01,428
a position at headquarters.

718
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:03,028
Santé.

719
00:45:05,299 --> 00:45:07,198
"Appointed to a position at headquarters?"

720
00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:11,368
Then, are we going to...

721
00:45:11,939 --> 00:45:14,138
live together forever?

722
00:45:14,408 --> 00:45:16,709
Yes, now, you can't live alone.

723
00:45:17,578 --> 00:45:19,249
Shall we take a picture to celebrate?

724
00:45:19,808 --> 00:45:22,117
I think there are tabloids going around that we're a pretend couple.

725
00:45:22,118 --> 00:45:23,218
We should refute those.

726
00:45:23,618 --> 00:45:25,948
Gosh, are they the truth and not just tabloid gossip?

727
00:45:28,149 --> 00:45:29,758
We are a pretend couple, right?

728
00:45:36,758 --> 00:45:38,197
(AL Group's New Challenge With Hanoks)

729
00:45:38,198 --> 00:45:41,198
Now, we will begin the opening ceremony of Stay Arang.

730
00:45:43,238 --> 00:45:45,709
(AL Group's New Challenge With Hanoks)

731
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:55,878
Gosh. That young guy was born under good parents,

732
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:58,419
so he didn't have to try hard at all to get to a position like that.

733
00:45:58,689 --> 00:45:59,748
I know.

734
00:45:59,749 --> 00:46:01,959
They say he started at the bottom and worked his way up,

735
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,117
but how do we know if he just sat around like an emperor,

736
00:46:04,118 --> 00:46:05,158
acting like he was working?

737
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,359
Did anyone see him?

738
00:46:06,828 --> 00:46:07,828
Me.

739
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:09,359
I saw him.

740
00:46:12,328 --> 00:46:13,669
I was his mentor.

741
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:15,368
He didn't want to hear such comments,

742
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:16,999
so he worked his butt off.

743
00:46:18,138 --> 00:46:19,138
Right.

744
00:46:24,078 --> 00:46:25,708
No matter how much it was,

745
00:46:25,709 --> 00:46:27,408
I'm sure he tried way more than they did.

746
00:46:27,808 --> 00:46:30,819
He worked so hard under me, the spiteful boss.

747
00:46:41,928 --> 00:46:45,098
I have no idea what your standard was when organizing this.

748
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:47,528
You should've asked me first. Why did you do it like this?

749
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:48,838
Mr. Seo Ju Won.

750
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,539
From now on, don't make things worse...

751
00:46:50,638 --> 00:46:53,008
- and just report to me beforehand. - Yes, ma'am.

752
00:47:12,758 --> 00:47:15,898
Ms. Ha, when I looked through last quarter's data analysis report,

753
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,499
there were a few things that were omitted.

754
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:19,399
I made some corrections. Could you please take a look?

755
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:20,769
Okay.

756
00:47:20,928 --> 00:47:23,799
Oh, also, I wrote up a trend research report.

757
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:25,968
If you have time, please read it through for me.

758
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:28,609
- All right. - Thank you.

759
00:47:28,738 --> 00:47:31,808
I know that he didn't get to this position...

760
00:47:32,078 --> 00:47:33,178
all that easily.

761
00:47:38,618 --> 00:47:41,189
I had always hoped you'd become a success.

762
00:47:42,888 --> 00:47:45,658
I was truly happy to be able to see that,

763
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:48,158
and then I realized...

764
00:47:49,558 --> 00:47:51,299
that my time as Manager Ha Yoon Seo...

765
00:47:52,098 --> 00:47:53,499
was over today.

766
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:57,039
- Don't face him, then. - How do I do that?

767
00:47:57,299 --> 00:47:58,908
You can avoid him as much as you can.

768
00:47:58,968 --> 00:48:01,979
That's not an easy thing to do while working in the same office.

769
00:48:06,078 --> 00:48:08,718
I should hang in there until I quit my job.

770
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:12,249
What, quit?

771
00:48:13,749 --> 00:48:16,458
We broke up. It's weird to stay in the same place.

772
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:17,658
What's this?

773
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:20,427
Then, tell him to quit.

774
00:48:20,428 --> 00:48:22,698
Why give up your livelihood just because you broke up?

775
00:48:23,658 --> 00:48:25,098
I'm not giving up.

776
00:48:26,368 --> 00:48:28,198
For me...

777
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:30,198
and Ju Won,

778
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:32,839
it's right for me to leave.

779
00:48:33,939 --> 00:48:36,578
Actually, I already knew.

780
00:48:37,578 --> 00:48:39,348
If one of us has to leave,

781
00:48:39,908 --> 00:48:41,609
it would be me.

782
00:48:44,678 --> 00:48:46,749
I hope he goes up so high...

783
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:48,859
that I can't even reach him...

784
00:48:50,658 --> 00:48:52,289
and be truly happy.

785
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:57,428
Gosh.

786
00:48:57,828 --> 00:48:59,867
Our Hanok Stay...

787
00:48:59,868 --> 00:49:02,439
will be open to the public starting next week.

788
00:49:02,638 --> 00:49:03,968
As soon as the reservations opened today,

789
00:49:04,098 --> 00:49:06,468
all of the rooms were fully booked.

790
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:08,778
Awesome.

791
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,109
Our Hanok is such a hot place.

792
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:12,649
The drinks taste good.

793
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,807
Our work was a big success.

794
00:49:14,808 --> 00:49:16,519
The sunset looks amazing too.

795
00:49:17,149 --> 00:49:18,549
All right. Cheers!

796
00:49:18,848 --> 00:49:20,819
- Cheers! - Cheers!

797
00:49:27,028 --> 00:49:28,958
Why aren't you drinking, Ms. Ha?

798
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:31,057
- Oh, I... - He's right.

799
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:33,668
It's not like you'll be driving like me. Have a drink.

800
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:36,299
I'll drive you home safe and sound.

801
00:49:37,198 --> 00:49:40,238
No, I'm going to stay another day before going back.

802
00:49:40,339 --> 00:49:43,778
There were some parts I couldn't look over because of the ceremony.

803
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,879
I'll stay another day and look things over properly.

804
00:49:48,149 --> 00:49:50,218
She sure is a workaholic.

805
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:52,487
On a day like today, when we finish a project,

806
00:49:52,488 --> 00:49:53,488
she should get some rest.

807
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:55,418
Why is she going to work again?

808
00:49:55,419 --> 00:49:58,289
Our dear Ms. Ha Yoon Seo. Since we finished a project,

809
00:49:58,459 --> 00:50:01,289
she will nag at us so much again starting next week.

810
00:50:01,558 --> 00:50:03,097
She'll be telling us to bring new items

811
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:05,597
But if she tells you to bring an item,

812
00:50:05,598 --> 00:50:07,069
can you even bring one?

813
00:50:08,598 --> 00:50:11,698
- You can't even do that. - You don't know me very well.

814
00:50:12,138 --> 00:50:15,408
I have at least 2 or 3 projects in mind at all times.

815
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:47,169
Didn't everyone go up to Seoul together?

816
00:50:49,138 --> 00:50:51,039
And what about you, Director Seo?

817
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,979
I wanted to take a closer look.

818
00:50:58,178 --> 00:50:59,218
Me too.

819
00:51:04,118 --> 00:51:05,229
Could we...

820
00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:07,988
walk together for a bit?

821
00:51:23,138 --> 00:51:24,479
You were really cool today.

822
00:51:25,848 --> 00:51:29,019
Me? Are you sure it wasn't you?

823
00:51:29,118 --> 00:51:30,919
Come on. I'm not cool at all.

824
00:51:31,879 --> 00:51:34,448
Ha Yoon Seo, the one who planned and led this project, is cool.

825
00:51:36,819 --> 00:51:39,459
As I showed this place to people and received praise today,

826
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:42,028
I was so proud of Manager Ha Yoon Seo.

827
00:51:43,129 --> 00:51:46,368
I was so proud of my good eye for having loved someone so cool,

828
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:48,968
but it also made my heart ache.

829
00:51:53,138 --> 00:51:56,379
You know, I really tried my best.

830
00:51:58,178 --> 00:51:59,209
I know.

831
00:52:01,808 --> 00:52:02,848
So,

832
00:52:04,348 --> 00:52:07,589
I think I could really leave without any regrets now.

833
00:52:14,629 --> 00:52:15,928
I'm going to resign.

834
00:52:18,098 --> 00:52:19,198
Ha Yoon Seo.

835
00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:23,339
I will.

836
00:52:24,669 --> 00:52:25,968
I think I should.

837
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:28,738
Yoon Seo.

838
00:52:29,238 --> 00:52:31,539
I mean, Ms. Ha Yoon Seo.

839
00:52:32,178 --> 00:52:34,077
I've lost you as my lover,

840
00:52:34,078 --> 00:52:35,879
but I don't want to lose you as a colleague as well.

841
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:39,487
I respected Manager Ha Yoon Seo,

842
00:52:39,488 --> 00:52:41,419
and that was how I could come all this way.

843
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:44,859
So?

844
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:47,459
Do you want to keep seeing each other like this?

845
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:52,729
With you not coming out of your office in case I feel uncomfortable,

846
00:52:52,828 --> 00:52:55,999
traveling on your own on purpose when we go on team business trips,

847
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,439
and worrying about saying something by mistake in front of the team?

848
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:03,908
Smart Seo Ju Won.

849
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:07,209
You know this can't go on any longer.

850
00:53:07,908 --> 00:53:09,019
Yoon Seo.

851
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:15,089
Thank you for everything.

852
00:53:17,618 --> 00:53:19,528
I was happy that...

853
00:53:20,689 --> 00:53:21,888
I was able to dream here.

854
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,269
I'll resign as soon as I wrap up some important projects.

855
00:54:45,308 --> 00:54:47,408
Mother, I have something to say...

856
00:54:47,448 --> 00:54:49,419
- Hey. - It's been a while, Ju Won.

857
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:52,518
Yes, have you been well?

858
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:53,519
Yes.

859
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,158
I received the report that the opening ceremony went well.

860
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:58,859
Good work. Have a seat.

861
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:08,569
Please send me to an office overseas.

862
00:55:10,198 --> 00:55:12,209
You were the one who said you wouldn't go.

863
00:55:12,368 --> 00:55:13,968
- But... - Next year,

864
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:18,379
you will take Si Won's place.

865
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:21,749
What does that mean...

866
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,549
I've returned to Korea for good this time.

867
00:55:25,078 --> 00:55:27,388
I'm going to take charge of the department store in earnest.

868
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:29,488
Si Won will go to AL Corporation.

869
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:33,028
It was already planned since our marriage anyway.

870
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:35,027
The time frame has been moved up a bit,

871
00:55:35,028 --> 00:55:37,327
but Mi Jin and I will expand on Distributions.

872
00:55:37,328 --> 00:55:39,669
In order to do that, you have to take charge of AL CARD.

873
00:55:41,399 --> 00:55:42,499
Then,

874
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,039
I believe we're done talking.

875
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:01,548
How could you decide something like this...

876
00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:02,658
without even discussing it with me?

877
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:05,089
Must I discuss...

878
00:56:05,828 --> 00:56:07,557
every little company matter with you?

879
00:56:07,558 --> 00:56:09,028
It's not a company matter. It has to do with me.

880
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:12,028
I'll go to an overseas office. Let me go.

881
00:56:13,528 --> 00:56:16,399
Do you know how immature and irresponsible...

882
00:56:17,698 --> 00:56:18,868
your words are?

883
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:26,078
Please.

884
00:56:28,948 --> 00:56:29,948
It's too late.

885
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:32,078
Just once.

886
00:56:36,388 --> 00:56:38,488
Can't you be my mother and not the chairwoman?

887
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,169
I don't know how much longer...

888
00:56:48,328 --> 00:56:49,439
I must endure this.

889
00:57:24,968 --> 00:57:26,169
Who's there?

890
00:57:36,749 --> 00:57:37,979
What's this?

891
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:40,519
Yoon Seo.

892
00:57:42,919 --> 00:57:44,089
I have nowhere to go.

893
00:57:47,488 --> 00:57:48,789
I have nowhere to go.

894
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:51,528
Can you please let me in?

895
00:57:54,999 --> 00:57:56,269
What do you mean by that?

896
00:57:58,098 --> 00:57:59,638
I left everything and left.

897
00:58:01,508 --> 00:58:02,778
"Left everything?"

898
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:04,539
Now, all I have...

899
00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:08,408
is you.

900
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,617
Wait, Wimp?

901
00:58:50,618 --> 00:58:52,387
I thought you broke up. Why did you come again?

902
00:58:52,388 --> 00:58:54,827
Hey, brother. Do you have the answer key for this?

903
00:58:54,828 --> 00:58:56,558
I don't think we learned stuff like this in my day...

904
00:58:57,198 --> 00:58:58,229
Director Seo.

905
00:58:59,999 --> 00:59:01,328
Is the food here?

906
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:02,967
Director Seo...

907
00:59:02,968 --> 00:59:04,468
What, "Director Seo?"

908
00:59:04,738 --> 00:59:05,908
Then, is Wimp...

909
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:07,807
a third-generation conglomerate?

910
00:59:07,808 --> 00:59:08,939
Hey, so...

911
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:12,008
Delivery! I heard the whole team was here...

912
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:15,447
What? Are you two dating again?

913
00:59:15,448 --> 00:59:17,717
- No! - What? "Dating again?"

914
00:59:17,718 --> 00:59:19,089
Did you two date before?

915
00:59:50,848 --> 00:59:53,819
Our office romance became known...

916
00:59:54,348 --> 00:59:56,019
- after we broke up. - Director Seo...

917
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:59,928
Mr. Bae and I will each split up and tail you as defenders.

918
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:02,288
There are so many office couples that have broken up.

919
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:05,298
Will you get all nosy and interfere each time?

920
01:00:05,299 --> 01:00:06,867
What are you doing?

921
01:00:06,868 --> 01:00:07,999
Open up.

922
01:00:09,069 --> 01:00:11,598
She must've run into the chairwoman and gotten slapped in the face.

923
01:00:11,669 --> 01:00:13,569
Then, is Ms. Ha Yoon Seo coming later too?

924
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:15,308
She seems pretty interesting.

925
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:17,479
What about you? Did you ever truly love me?

926
01:00:17,738 --> 01:00:19,677
I know I'm pathetic for not being able to get over you...

927
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:20,948
after breaking up.

928
01:00:21,178 --> 01:00:22,378
But even in this moment,

929
01:00:22,379 --> 01:00:24,118
I'm only worried about how to keep you...

930
01:00:24,448 --> 01:00:25,618
from getting hurt.
