You said you wanted me to pat you on the back.

13
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,909
Good job on coming this far to sort things out.

14
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,079
It must've been stressful for you.

15
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:54,649
We took necessary measures,

16
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,858
and the assemblyman's press release will prevent future rumours,

17
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,519
so you won't have to worry.

18
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,229
I must attend a Hanok Stay meeting.

19
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,530
Excuse me.

20
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,430
Get back to Seoul safely. Good job.

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,509
Why did he just leave?

22
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,840
I wonder too.

23
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,210
He should just leave. What else would he do?

24
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,050
Think about it.

25
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,849
Just last night, he and I had a childish battle over you.

26
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,819
And he just left after seeing us like this?

27
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:33,388
"Like this?" What did we do?

28
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:34,929
We just painted together,

29
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,590
and I comforted you.

30
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,229
Exactly.

31
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,430
We sat side-by-side to paint,

32
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,699
and you patted my shoulder to comfort me.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,939
And Mr. Jealous Seo Ju Won saw all that and walked away?

34
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,039
You don't find that odd?

35
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,250
Director, I'm on my way to Yeosu.

36
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,789
Someone should be there to handle the press if they gather.

37
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,289
What is it?

38
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,159
Yoon Seo's on her way to Yeosu.

39
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,759
I know it's for work, but it bothers me.

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,530
I called a helicopter for you, and you still haven't won her back?

41
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,698
Win her back?

42
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,869
I got emotional and drunk...

43
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,580
and made a fool of myself in front of her and Lee Sung Min.

44
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,039
My gosh.

45
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,409
This won't do. I must go too.

46
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,520
What the...

47
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,019
Why are you getting in the way of a busy man?

48
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,359
Mother has a lot on her mind, and I am a busy man myself,

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,959
so I was going to stay out of your love life.

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,099
But I just can't stand watching what's going on.

51
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,999
So what? You'll get involved again?

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,098
No thanks.

53
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,269
Getting in the helicopter with you ruined everything.

54
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,038
I told you to rush over in the helicopter and get the girl,

55
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,580
not get dead drunk.

56
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,840
Be honest.

57
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,109
Did you rush over there and bare your heart and tell her...

58
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,009
you were jealous and that you wanted her back?

59
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,418
How do you know that?

60
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,619
You tall but foolish brother of mine.

61
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,388
Who shows their hand when playing poker?

62
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,888
If you show her all your feelings,

63
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,959
you're playing a losing game.

64
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,430
Now you must use another tactic.

65
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,328
Another tactic?

66
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,329
Yes.

67
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,470
If you really want to get her back,

68
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,740
let her go about this much, and then pull her back.

69
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,740
That's called "one step back, ten steps forward."

70
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,279
If I really want to get her back,

71
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,410
I let her go, then pull her back.

72
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,120
(Cinderella at 2AM)

73
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:58,939
What is it?

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,139
Does it feel weird that Seo Ju Won just left?

75
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,779
No.

76
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:07,278
I was just a bit hungry,

77
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,550
so I was wondering what to eat when I got home.

78
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,779
I could have black bean noodles or tteokbokki.

79
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:17,559
To be honest,

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,089
today's incident was a tough one that involved actual politics.

81
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,199
It would be weirder if he let emotions get in the way.

82
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,730
I see him in a different light...

83
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,839
now that I see he can keep his life out of his work.

84
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,939
But he doesn't seem the type to just let it go.

85
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,740
Just thinking about how he'll harass us tomorrow...

86
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,180
exhausts me already.

87
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,079
How about you have the tteokbokki and black bean noodles with me?

88
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,680
Why would I eat that with you?

89
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,420
No, thank you.

90
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,850
What?

91
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,259
Are you bothered the director might find out?

92
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,188
As if.

93
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:56,029
Why would I be bothered about that?

94
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,040
I was bothered. It did get to me.

95
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,540
And the next day, Ju Won acted...

96
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:09,509
more differently than I expected.

97
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,079
Good morning.

98
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,809
Hello. Good morning.

99
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,410
Or is it just a morning?

100
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:18,480
To be honest, it's a troubling morning.

101
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,889
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

102
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,060
The director's moving his office.

103
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:25,459
What?

104
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,500
Director.

105
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,110
Why are you suddenly moving offices?

106
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,480
I have a lot of meetings with Marketing Team Three for now.

107
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,409
Will you return, then?

108
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,050
I can't say. I don't know when that may be.

109
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:51,649
Goodbye.

110
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,029
The first thing you must do...

111
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,660
is to move to a different office.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,100
Move my office? Why?

113
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Why else?

114
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,000
You were never out of Yoon Seo's sight.

115
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,740
You don't notice an addition, but you always notice an absence.

116
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,740
If you disappear when she thought you'd always be around,

117
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,839
she'll think of you even more.

118
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,278
But people also say, "Out of sight, out of mind."

119
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,578
What if I at least got on her nerves when I was around,

120
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,750
but then I go and she feels relieved?

121
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,889
Why would she feel relieved?

122
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,019
If you have time to be clueless and frustrating,

123
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:34,860
go and pack.

124
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,008
It looks like the director's...

125
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,480
trying to get over her, doesn't it?

126
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,709
Yes, it does.

127
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,448
At Ms. Ha's place last time,

128
00:07:58,449 --> 00:07:59,949
and at the team dinner,

129
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,319
he acted like he longed to get her back.

130
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,889
But today, he packed his stuff and left.

131
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,230
Things really must be over. The end!

132
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,229
- Let's get back. - Let's go.

133
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,500
Oh, dear.

134
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,750
He came to the meeting.

135
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,980
I didn't think he would.

136
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,830
Thanks for the detailed report.

137
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,229
When I signed on Lee Sung Min,

138
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,659
there was a condition that we sponsor young artists.

139
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:48,599
I liked the idea and would like to act on it.

140
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,100
What do you think, Ms. Ha?

141
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,940
Yes, it sounds like a good idea.

142
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:54,409
It would improve our brand's image too.

143
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:58,480
How about we create an artists' residence at Hanok Stay?

144
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,710
I don't like that.

145
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,620
Then the next step.

146
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,450
From now on, you will become a bad guy.

147
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,320
A bad guy? What's that?

148
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,389
All this explaining is hurting my facial muscles.

149
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,258
So far, I bet you were the sweetest, kindest, most gentle,

150
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,199
and most polite to Yoon Seo as if...

151
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,299
you were the greatest gentleman in the world, right?

152
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,340
Of course. I liked her.

153
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,399
However,

154
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,370
women love to hate but are still attracted to...

155
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,039
bad guys.

156
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,139
A guy who makes them desperate.

157
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:35,649
Look.

158
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,918
Didn't you lean in closer when I turned away from you?

159
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,250
Did you feel desperate or not?

160
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,119
- I did. - See?

161
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,288
It's not just you.

162
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:44,189
Let's get Yoon Seo worked up too.

163
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,789
You used to be like...

164
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,929
"Okay. Sure. Why not?"

165
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,959
No, you must do this. "No. I'm not sure."

166
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,529
Act gruff and cold.

167
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,268
When she sees the mean you,

168
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:59,799
she'll get fired up with the yearning to turn you back.

169
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,480
Then how about supporting them in the form of a scholarship?

170
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,620
- We could select three people... - Wouldn't four be better?

171
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,259
Yes.

172
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,190
We could select four people...

173
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,528
and give them enough money for them to go abroad for a year...

174
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,159
A year and a half would be better.

175
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,840
How about we order lunch before continuing the meeting?

176
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,139
Yes, that's a good idea.

177
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,569
Ms. Ha, what would you like to eat?

178
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,508
Let's just eat gimbap.

179
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:38,639
Hang on.

180
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,950
Wouldn't tuna gimbap be better?

181
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,490
Why the sudden change?

182
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:53,389
Just a few days ago he said...

183
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,389
he didn't want to live without me.

184
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,659
What do you think got into him?

185
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,860
I don't know.

186
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:02,399
Did you do something that suddenly made him sick of you?

187
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,169
Of course not.

188
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:06,899
It has only been three days.

189
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,269
What could I have done in three days?

190
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,979
Hey. That night.

191
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,648
You drank all night long and came here for hangover soup.

192
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:18,279
Didn't you say you both got drunk and you messed up?

193
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,080
Didn't you disgust him then?

194
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,519
Can you not forget me because I'm so pretty?

195
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,120
Am I that charming?

196
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,329
As if he wasn't drunk himself.

197
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,659
He was even more drunk.

198
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,230
Yes. It can't have been the first time he saw her drunk.

199
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,940
I think it was something else.

200
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,370
Something else what?

201
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,409
From what I heard as I was cooking,

202
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:45,879
you'd been getting on well with another guy.

203
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,579
You said Ju Won said he felt bothered by it.

204
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,850
Do you think he was disappointed...

205
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,378
for not being careful despite that?

206
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,449
The conviction that you were the one...

207
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,888
he should spend the rest of his life with...

208
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,049
melted away.

209
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,820
Yes. That could be it.

210
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,929
If you kept it up when he said he was displeased,

211
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:05,000
it could've looked inconsiderate.

212
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,200
Whatever.

213
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,769
So what if I seemed inconsiderate?

214
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,599
It's for the better.

215
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,009
It's better to drift apart from someone I broke up with.

216
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,740
Who cares?

217
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:18,409
Darn it.

218
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,620
Si Won, I'm scared.

219
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,649
Yoon Seo seemed angry after yesterday's meeting.

220
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,489
I think I need to stop doing this.

221
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,820
Get a grip!

222
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,230
Go and wash your face with cold water.

223
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:37,029
We reached the critical point where you have just one step left.

224
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,959
- One step? - Yes.

225
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,799
- What's that? - Come closer.

226
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,299
It's called...

227
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:48,710
the jealousy strategy.

228
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,508
- The jealousy strategy? - Yes.

229
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:55,709
You got fired up when another man approached her, right?

230
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,710
Yes.

231
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:59,320
That's called "swapping places."

232
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,418
The jealousy that you feel. Yoon Seo should feel...

233
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:04,620
that instinctive feeling to realize how precious you are.

234
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,959
Call a good female friend...

235
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,428
and hang out with her in places Yoon Seo often passes by.

236
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:11,830
I don't know any women other than Yoon Seo.

237
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,298
What Gen Z guy doesn't have female friends?

238
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:16,669
Go on a blind date, then.

239
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,999
No way.

240
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,699
That's cheating, not reeling in.

241
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,639
It's not cheating. You're making her jealous.

242
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,539
Oh, help me.

243
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,039
(Vice Chairman Seo Si Won)

244
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,450
(Wife)

245
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:29,779
Hang on.

246
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,419
Hey.

247
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,889
- Forget it. - I'm in my office.

248
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,220
Are you? Work hard, then.

249
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:38,360
See you later.

250
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:41,460
Why is she saying that when she's in Paris?

251
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:44,799
Hey, Ju Won.

252
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,829
Find someone somewhere.

253
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,669
The jealousy strategy is the best.

254
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,740
Forget the jealousy thing. It's okay.

255
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,559
(Artist Lee Sung Min)

256
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,059
The artist commentary event will be rescheduled for next week.

257
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:21,730
Just so you know.

258
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,470
Is Mr. Jealous Seo Ju Won back to normal?

259
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,440
As if he were back to normal.

260
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,639
I should be grateful he decided to get over me.

261
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,279
It's for the better.

262
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,049
- What's that? - Hey.

263
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,419
The woman next to the director. Is that his girlfriend?

264
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,599
No, that's the vice chairman's wife.

265
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,059
Eunho Department Store's senior managing director.

266
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,330
Oh, right.

267
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,200
I saw her on social media.

268
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,200
I remember her. Senior Managing Director Lee Mi Jin.

269
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,110
I was so taken aback that I didn't recognize her at first.

270
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,019
This was a brief misunderstanding, but it will happen for real one day.

271
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,220
I meant it when I thought I wanted him to find a good person.

272
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,690
What shocked me...

273
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:23,429
was the fact that I was more flustered...

274
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,029
than I expected to be...

275
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,629
when I saw Ju Won with another woman.

276
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,340
Ms. Mi Jin? How about you let go now?

277
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,549
Shall I?

278
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,018
I was in high heels and I considered you my walking stick.

279
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,450
Sorry if that bothered you.

280
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,990
I wasn't bothered, but the employees would notice.

281
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,360
The employees will know I'm your sister-in-law.

282
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,929
Hey.

283
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:59,929
Are you wary of what someone here might think?

284
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:04,470
Ju Won. Are you dating someone at work?

285
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,500
Is that why you left home?

286
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,408
You said it was a secret that you're back,

287
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,279
so I won't tell Si Won we met.

288
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,710
You should go.

289
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,120
Okay.

290
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,360
Going up.

(Vice Chairman Seo Si Won)

292
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,200
Why did she call me?

293
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:34,029
Why say "see you later" from Paris?

294
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,299
She has a weird way of talking.

295
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,639
She only posts photos of what she eats in Paris.

296
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,379
What did she eat today?

297
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,850
(mi_jinlee)

298
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,679
She didn't post anything today.

299
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,119
She ate a pastry yesterday...

300
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,620
and a macaron the day before.

301
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,360
What's this?

302
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,690
I never pressed "like."

303
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,640
Oh, this is so great.

304
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,609
It's so relaxing.

(mi_jinlee)

306
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,390
Did she go there to work or to eat?

307
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,289
This looks tasty. Where is this?

308
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,769
Oh, I don't care.

309
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,740
Is anyone there?

310
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,710
When did this get pressed?

311
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,680
She wouldn't have seen it.

312
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:00,720
How could she when she got over 10,000 likes?

313
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,190
Even if she did see it, she wouldn't know it was me.

314
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,390
I made an account with no posts just to spy on her.

315
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,559
Don't worry, Si Won.

316
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,529
Husband.

317
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,559
Hello.

00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,910
What the...

319
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,680
Shouldn't you be in France now? What are you doing here?

320
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,450
Didn't you hear me earlier? I said, "See you later."

321
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,519
I got everything done quicker than expected.

322
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,349
Oh, that was what you meant?

323
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,319
Why didn't you go straight home? Why are you here?

324
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,660
I wanted to give you this.

325
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,299
What is this?

326
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,798
You must've really wanted to try it...

327
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,400
for you to have pressed the like button.

328
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,410
What? The like button? What are you talking about?

329
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:02,308
You don't think I'd know you've been stalking me on social media?

330
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,709
Social media? What do you mean?

331
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,779
You got a notification on your phone when I posted a new photo at home.

332
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,449
As soon as I saw your user ID,

333
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,949
I knew it was you and memorized it right away.

334
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,719
- Don't. - "West Cool."

335
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Stop.

336
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,259
It literally means Seo Si Won.

337
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:23,328
From now on, if you ever want to know what I'm up to,

338
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,740
just ask me directly.

339
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,469
And if there's anything you want to eat,

340
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,740
just ask me to buy it for you.

341
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,339
Okay, I'll do that.

342
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,210
What are you waiting for? Try it.

343
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,250
It's really good.

344
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:37,579
Okay.

345
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:40,779
Thanks for this. I'm sure I'll like it.

346
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,190
Sure.

347
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,359
Your office gets a lot of sun.

348
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,299
This is a good photo spot.

349
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,170
What?

350
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,779
Ta-da!

351
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,319
Oh, my.

352
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,890
My gosh!

353
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,558
- It's so good! - So, this gets a pass?

354
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,559
Yes, totally.

355
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,759
- Uncle. - Yes.

356
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,868
Then we'll launch this clam soup on the 15th.

357
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:31,129
- Sounds good? - Sounds great!

358
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,700
- Nice. - Hey, what's this?

359
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,710
What's happening on this day?

360
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,308
Oh, it's Yoon Seo's birthday.

361
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:40,009
What? Yoon Seo's birthday?

362
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,278
Hey, tell her to come over on her birthday.

363
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:45,180
I'll make seaweed soup and japchae for her.

364
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,419
Don't bother.

365
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,989
She doesn't like it when people remember her birthday.

366
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,758
- She actually doesn't like it? - No, she doesn't.

367
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,490
Once, I gave her a gift, and she refused it.

368
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,230
Hey, it's how most people express their affection.

369
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,960
Come to think of it,

370
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,969
it doesn't really look like Yoon Seo has fully opened up to you,

371
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,470
but you're always worried about her. Why is that?

372
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,539
Let's be honest. It's not like you're her mother.

373
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,038
Why are you so good to her?

374
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,309
Because her parents were never good to her.

375
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,710
Hey, you're making me look like a jerk.

376
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,710
Anyway...

377
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,619
Even if she doesn't have a happy birthday,

378
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,250
I hope she at least has a good day on her birthday.

379
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:25,289
Ha Yoon Seo.

380
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,768
(Happy birthday. Here is your birthday coupon.)

381
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:41,470
(Visit us within a week to get 30 percent off your purchase.)

382
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,910
Someone's working hard, bright and early.

383
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,169
I'm in charge of cleaning this week, so I have to leave early.

384
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,440
Eat your breakfast before you go to work.

385
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,289
Happy birthday.

386
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,829
Why are you here so early?

387
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:38,160
Why? I wanted to be the first one to wish you a happy birthday.

388
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,029
Let's eat this and go to work together.

389
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,299
I found a good spot where we can eat this.

390
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:47,640
I told you not to do anything for my birthday.

391
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,009
Come on.

392
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,308
You really didn't have to do anything.

393
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:53,809
I wanted to.

394
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,008
Last but not least...

395
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,319
Don't tell me you made a heart with green peas.

396
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,059
You're so mean.

397
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:09,559
Sorry.

398
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,400
I even burned my finger while cooking the beans.

399
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,329
How could you be so mean to me?

400
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,200
Are you all right? Let me see.

401
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:22,569
Any other injuries?

402
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,910
Why did you suddenly decide to do this...

403
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,420
Here's your coffee.

404
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,759
- Nice. - Here.

405
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,528
Here's your latte, Mr. Bae.

406
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:45,799
- Thank you. With 2 sleeves. - Yes, 2 sleeves.

407
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,799
- Ms. Ha. - Yes.

408
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,029
Thank you.

409
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,769
Today is Ha Yoon Seo Day.

410
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,599
Do everything you want, my Yoon Seo.

411
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:02,579
(Do everything you want, my Yoon Seo.)

412
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,318
Have you lost your mind?

413
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,890
I told you not to make it so obvious at work.

414
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:15,630
You'd better not do it again, seriously.

415
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,660
Okay, I'm sorry.

416
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,000
To make up for it, I'll give you my egg.

417
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,700
Fine. I'll forgive you since you gave me your egg.

418
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,709
But I told you to choose a fancier place.

419
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,839
Why this tteokbokki place?

420
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,380
You said I could do everything I wanted today.

421
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:34,740
I really wanted to have this tteokbokki here today.

422
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,349
Sorry to interrupt. Here's what you ordered.

423
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,619
You ordered something else? Nice.

424
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,589
What is this?

425
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,559
To be honest, I wanted to do this at a more romantic place,

426
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,230
but we came here.

427
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,569
This doesn't really suit the mood here,

428
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,970
but...

429
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,710
please accept my gift.

430
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,170
My gosh.

431
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:33,369
Thank goodness no one will throw...

432
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,799
such an embarrassing event for me this year.

433
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,299
No way.

434
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,609
I'm sorry.

435
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:22,788
Here's your coffee!

436
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,219
What? You bought us coffee?

437
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,319
No, Director Seo. I ran into him at the cafe, and he paid for these.

438
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,289
Here's your latte, Mr. Bae.

439
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,059
Here's your Americano, Ms. Ha.

440
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,299
This cappuccino is for me!

441
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,970
Enjoy your coffee.

442
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:41,970
Wishing you a very happy day.

443
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,710
"May your day be filled with amazing things like cappuccino foam."

444
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,279
"Thank you. Please visit us again."

445
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,848
What is this? Who wrote this?

446
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,149
The barista.

447
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,960
He was so nice.

448
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:02,829
He even gave me this cookie on the house!

449
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,670
Why are you here again, looking all depressed?

450
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,910
Is it difficult for you to play hard to get?

451
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,319
Hey, Ju Won.

452
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,079
Hang in there,

453
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,849
and you can make Yoon Seo all yours.

454
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:32,289
So stay strong, okay?

455
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:36,460
I know, but I'm really struggling to hold back today.

456
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:39,130
I wanted to make her really happy on her birthday this year.

457
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,500
What? Her birthday?

458
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,969
Are you crazy?

459
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,200
Don't tell me you're doing nothing for her birthday.

460
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:46,098
You told me I should let her go in order to...

461
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,798
You fool! I want to grab you by the neck right now!

462
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,268
Even so, you have to do something for her birthday!

463
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,839
If you really do nothing, you'll never make her yours.

464
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:55,509
All right.

465
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,109
You've been focusing on playing hard to get,

466
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,220
so get her now. Today is your D-Day.

467
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,279
I'll get her.

468
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,848
- D-Day? - That's right.

469
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:05,689
First, make a reservation at the nicest restaurant you know.

470
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,359
Go all out. Book out the entire restaurant.

471
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,258
But there's nothing she hates more than men who show off their wealth.

472
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:11,558
- Really? - Yes.

473
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,799
Then what does Yoon Seo like?

474
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,500
Super spicy tteokbokki?

475
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:17,869
This is so frustrating.

476
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,240
Hey, make a reservation at the nicest restaurant in Seoul...

477
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:22,939
and prepare a small gift that sparkles.

478
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,269
For example, a ring or...

479
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:29,950
I have it ready.

480
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,279
Look at you. Hey!

481
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,670
Are you really going to be like this?

482
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,839
I wanted to buy something nice for my girlfriend's birthday.

483
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,200
What's so uncomfortable about it that you must return it?

484
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,509
Can't you just accept my gift?

485
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,150
It's just because...

486
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,819
I'm not used to getting birthday presents.

487
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:11,450
Every family does things differently, you know.

488
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,230
Growing up, my family never celebrated birthdays.

489
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,160
It was just like any other day.

490
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,098
So, when someone says "Happy Birthday" to me,

491
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,130
I don't even know what to say.

492
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:24,869
Besides, I'm not sure if it's something to be celebrated.

493
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:32,339
What are you doing?

494
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,730
For me, out of the whole year,

495
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,730
today is the most special day.

496
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:58,130
Thank you for being born.

497
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,940
It was the first time...

498
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:07,980
I'd heard someone say that to me.

499
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,279
Perhaps, that memory...

500
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,579
was the reason I kept expecting...

501
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,819
that something good might happen.

502
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,690
Expecting things, being jealous,

503
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,900
and feeling hurt.

504
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,829
Even more than I thought,

505
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,400
I was viscerally feeling his absence.

506
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,190
Yes, hello?

507
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,319
Hello, I'm calling from Jisan Hospital.

508
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,329
Okay, how may I help you?

509
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:10,339
Can I see you today?

510
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,979
In order to measure our marketing performance,

511
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,018
we should first set clear goals and expectations.

512
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:25,759
For example, increasing sales,

513
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,959
expanding brand awareness, and so on.

514
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,690
First, we should set such goals.

515
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,399
Marketing activities affect...

516
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,599
the average customer retention rate...

517
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:40,139
- My gosh. - Gosh, Director Seo!

518
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,970
How long has it been? I missed you!

519
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,269
Yes, hello.

520
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,710
Oh, Ms. Ha left early today.

521
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:50,079
Did something happen?

522
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,420
Well, I'm not sure.

523
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,519
But she left suddenly, looking upset.

524
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,259
What's going on?

525
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,890
Did I upset her by being selfish?

526
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,170
Even if that's the case, she'd never react emotionally like this.

527
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,079
- Thank you. - Thank you, sir.

528
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:33,920
I'm so embarrassed every time I see her face.

529
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:36,758
You don't think I'd know you've been stalking me on social media?

530
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,429
You got a notification on your phone...

531
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,259
when I posted a new photo at home.

532
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,930
I hope...

533
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,200
she doesn't think I'm like a pervert peeking at her.

534
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,539
Darn it. Stupid notifications!

535
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,308
Hey! Because of you, I kept checking her social media...

536
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:53,710
and got caught stalking her on social media.

537
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:56,809
This is not good. I must punish you.

538
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,779
I'm turning all notifications off.

539
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,078

Hey, you.

542
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,369
Did you have dinner?

543
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,039
What is this?

544
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,308
(1,045 Likes, That's cute.)

545
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:30,480
You promised me that you'd never post my pictures on social media.

546
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:34,318
Right, I did.

547
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,749
But there are rumours going around again...

548
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,650
that we're staying married just for show.

549
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,889
They'll soon say we're getting a divorce...

550
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,859
Then you should've given me a heads-up.

551
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:06,480
So, she visited me with the macarons to take that picture.

552
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,250
To post a picture like that just to stop such rumours.

553
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:13,219
I thought she genuinely wanted me to try it.

554
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,329
Darn it.

555
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,199
People will make fun of me like crazy again.

556
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,570
Just like what happened with that crying selfie.

557
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:42,079
(1,045 Likes, That's cute.)

558
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:43,690
What?

559
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:45,189
(- How cute. - That's adorable.)

560
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,618
What's with this reaction?

561
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:47,819
(- He looks like a macaron model. - I'll buy him a macaron store.)

562
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,189
(- He's so cute. - He's rich too.)

563
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,689
(- I'll buy you 10 macarons. - I want to eat macarons.)

564
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,130
(- He's adorable. - He's so handsome.)

565
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,429
What?

566
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,800
My gosh.

567
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,339
They feel deprived because of me?

568
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,610
Oh, no. That is my fault.

569
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:10,079
Reflect on yourself, Si Won.

570
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:11,749
What is this?

571
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,618
Why is everyone saying I'm cute?

572
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,250
I'm charismatic.

573
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,550
I'm really something, aren't I?

574
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,589
"The epitome of handsome."

575
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,719
"Handsome" is good.

576
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:24,530
Take a screenshot.

577
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:34,269
(Post not found)

578
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,170
What? Where did it go?

579
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,510
What?

580
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,050
Hey.

581
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,050
I'm sorry.

582
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:50,289
What?

583
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,659
I didn't know you'd be so upset.

584
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,929
I deleted the photo, so don't worry. Good night.

585
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,130
Hey, wait...

586
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,769
I haven't read the new comments yet.

587
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:08,699
(mi_jinlee)

588
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,839
(- He's so cute. - He's hot.)

589
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,780
The picture suddenly got deleted.

590
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,150
It must've made many people sad.

591
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,860
Pour me one too.

592
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,130
(- He's hot. - Share more pictures of your life!)

593
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,098
Had I known you'd take screenshots of the comments,

594
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,840
I wouldn't have deleted the post.

595
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,170
Well...

596
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:48,178
I've never experienced a reaction like this,

597
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,610
so I thought it was kind of cool. That's why I did this.

598
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:54,349
Then how about we take a picture together and post it?

599
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:58,050
Gosh, no. What are you talking about?

600
00:36:58,849 --> 00:36:59,889
Really?

601
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,230
All right, then.

602
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,130
I should have a glass of wine.

603
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,869
Today,

604
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:12,840
I should post this.

605
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,780
Oh, you're in the frame.

606
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,550
I did it because it was cute.

607
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,460
What?

608
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,329
Earlier, I was flustered, so I used the rumours as an excuse.

609
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:40,030
But I posted that picture because I thought it was cute.

610
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,769
Oh, that...

611
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,030
Really?

612
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,739
I'm sorry for overreacting and getting angry like that earlier.

613
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,839
I was quite touched, thinking you visited me...

614
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,409
to give me those macarons.

615
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,948
Thinking that you actually came to see me to take that picture...

616
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:58,679
hurt my feelings.

617
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,820
- I see. - Yes.

618
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,889
Then would it be okay to post your pictures from time to time?

619
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,820
Gosh.

620
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,859
Well, we are married.

621
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,800
I can't say no when you're asking me so sincerely.

622
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,269
I respect you. Right.

623
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,610
Then, do you want to take a photo together?

624
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:24,670
Gosh, sure. If you want to.

625
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,849
Two, three.

626
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:39,519
You're good.

627
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,019
It's my first time doing something like this.

629
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,869
Gosh, seeing us like this, we really look like a married couple.

630
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:01,710
I think we look good together too.

(west_coool and one other has liked your post.)

634
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,599
My husband keeps acting cute.

635
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,500
So cute.

636

(Seo Ju Won)

637
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,329
This is Jisan Hospital.

638
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:29,369
Yes, why did the hospital call me?

639
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,429
Are you perhaps Ms. Kim Hee Sook's daughter, Ms. Ha Yoon Seo?

640
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,569
We have something to discuss with you...

641
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,039
regarding your mother's funeral.

642
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:37,939
Ms. Kim Hee Sook...

643
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,909
spent about three years here from heart failure,

644
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,679
and she passed away yesterday.

645
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:51,550
It was my fourth year in college...

646
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,389
when I last saw my mom.

647
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,230
She called me saying my father had died.

648
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:06,099
He drove after getting drunk...

649
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,599
and had been sued by the victim.

650
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,210
But he had died on the spot while drunk driving again.

651
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:18,110
It was a death befitting that man.

652
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:33,659
And in order to handle the mess that man had created,

653
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,730
I saw the face I never wanted to see again in my life.

654
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:44,570
That person, who said she was my mom,

655
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,909
would ignore me whenever I'd get beaten up.

656
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,119
Is it tasty?

657
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:02,860
Why?

658
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,999
I can't even run away because of you kids!

659
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,960
Why should I have to live like this?

660
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:10,730
Seriously!

661
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:13,840
- Why? - It's okay.

662
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:16,170
She would drink like Father...

663
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,809
and cry like a monster.

664
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,090
Darn it.

665
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:37,989
Hey.

666
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:41,000
You unlucky brat.

667
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,170
Please take this punk and get out of my life.

668
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,940
Just disappear!

669
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,539
Disappear!

670
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:05,820
Why...

671
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:08,559
did you come to see me?

672
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,099
He was still your father.

673
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,369
You should say goodbye to him one last time.

674
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,070
That's the duty of a child.

675
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,110
Aren't you graduating soon?

676
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,949
Then, you'll get a job and all.

677
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,489
You have to pay back the debt your dad racked up.

678
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:40,360
Stop wandering about and come back.

679
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,590
You can't break off the connection of family.

680
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,429
"The connection of family?"

681
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,800
If the relationship between parents and children...

682
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:57,139
really is a connection made from the skies above as they say,

683
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:01,610
I'll just be punished by the skies.

684
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,909
To me, my family...

685
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,650
is Ji Seok,

686
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:08,050
and no one else.

687
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,190
Darn it.

688
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,199
All right.

689
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,730
Say everything you want to say.

690
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,139
So, how do you feel?

691
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,139
I don't know.

692
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,210
Ever since I left home,

693
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,380
I've been through so much hardship.

694
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,079
Maybe that's why.

695
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,719
I know that I'll be punished for this,

696
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:45,550
but I'm not sad at all.

697
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,260
I won't go to that man's funeral.

698
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,090
And I won't ever answer...

699
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,929
my mom's call again.

700
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,500
Why did it have to be today?

701
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,769
Stop drinking.

702
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,809
You might collapse at this rate.

703
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,250
Mr. Lee, how are you here?

704
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:46,619
I was on my way out from a meeting with the PR team.

705
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,420
Then, I saw a sad woman by the window.

706
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:54,219
I'll have a bottle of soju and a glass, please.

707
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:55,719
Okay.

708
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,530
What is it about?

709
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:06,070
She's dead.

710
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,440
Pardon?

711
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,679
If she was going to leave like this, she should've been nice to her kids.

712
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:17,409
Did I ask for something huge?

713
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,550
I just...

714
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,420
wanted her to say one thing.

715
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,619
"I'm sorry."

716
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,730
Was that so hard to say?

717
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:40,369
Are you crying?

718
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:43,039
No.

719
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,110
I don't have any tears to shed...

720
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:49,949
for someone like her.

721
00:47:06,929 --> 00:47:08,030
Yoon Seo.

722
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,369
Is something wrong?

723
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:13,570
I'm worried. Please answer me.

724
00:47:16,269 --> 00:47:19,239
Why do I always act like such a fool?

725
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,679
I said I wouldn't live with regrets...

726
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:25,780
and endured everything until now with gritted teeth.

727
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,190
But I'm swayed so much because the person I despised is dead.

728
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:38,460
Actually,

729
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:41,460
after hearing about your father,

730
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,599
I was surprised.

731
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,199
It was just like my story.

732
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,379
My father was violent too,

733
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,039
and my mom was just a bystander.

734
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:58,710
So, I left home with my brother,

735
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:02,119
and we lived without knowing how the other was doing.

736
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,789
But today,

737
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:09,190
I heard the news that...

738
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:12,190
the person called my mom had passed away.

739
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,079
Since something bad happened,

740
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,219
my heart must be growing weaker.

741
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,420
I keep thinking of that guy.

742
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:44,960
He was...

743
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,659
the first person to tell me...

744
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,170
that he was glad I had been born.

745
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:54,039
I keep thinking of him.

746
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
It's annoying.

747
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:23,300
(Seo Ju Won)

748
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,469
(Manager Ha Yoon Seo)

749
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:35,909
Hey, Yoon Seo.

750
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,920
This is Lee Sung Min.

751
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:44,449
Why are you calling me on Yoon Seo's phone?

752
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,319
I know it's not fun for another man to call you...

753
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,889
on your ex-girlfriend's phone,

754
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,360
but is it really necessary to be so hostile toward me?

755
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,929
Explain what the situation is.

756
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,429
Ms. Ha fell asleep after drinking.

757
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,940
We're near the office. Come and get her quickly.

758
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,440
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

759
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:04,308
You seemed to have so many lingering feelings for her...

760
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:05,710
that I called you out of courtesy.

761
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,010
- I'll assume it's over between... - Ten minutes.

762
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,079
Wait. I'll be right there.

763
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,239
Don't look at me like that.

764
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,250
I felt so bad for her today...

765
00:50:45,449 --> 00:50:48,279
that I thought it would be better for you to be by her side.

766
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,579
That was why I made the huge decision to call you.

767
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,619
Has something happened to Yoon Seo?

768
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:54,989
Well...

769
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:59,230
I don't think I should be telling you about that.

770
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:01,900
You should ask her yourself when she wakes up.

771
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:10,169
You're both still pining for each other,

772
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,309
so why did you break up?

773
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,039
I don't think it's any of your business.

774
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,210
Then, do a good job yourself.

775
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,440
What happened?

776
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:16,099
It just happened.

777
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,039
I came after getting a call.

778
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,719
There's only ten minutes left.

779
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,420
What?

780
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:29,550
I'm sorry...

781
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:32,389
for making you spend a day like this.

782
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:36,360
I was wrong...

783
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:38,989
about everything.

784
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:48,170
You don't have to feel sorry.

785
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:51,039
I think it's right for us to keep our distance and grow apart.

786
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,809
This won't happen again.

787
00:52:54,139 --> 00:52:55,210
Then, I'll be going.

788
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,179
Are you okay?

789
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:07,420
Can I ask you what's going on?

790
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,269
You don't have to mind.

791
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,570
If I call you again from now on, just don't answer it.

792
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:22,669
You can just ignore it. No.

793
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:23,869
Please ignore it.

794
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,610
How can I not mind?

795
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,650
How could I not answer your call?

796
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,579
What were you doing until now?

797
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:39,710
You don't even know how dangerous this world is.

798
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,050
You're always drinking these days.

799
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:46,989
Still, it's your birthday.

800
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:48,788
I know you don't care about celebrating,

801
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:50,730
but I thought we'd eat together, at least.

802
00:54:52,929 --> 00:54:54,800
Hang on. Let me get you some honey water.

803
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:56,630
Ji Seok.

804
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,000
Why? Don't you want honey water?

805
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,679
Today, I got a call.

806
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,079
What call?

807
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,519
Mom...

808
00:55:17,889 --> 00:55:19,820
had been in a convalescent hospital.

809
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:23,019
Then, her illness got worse.

810
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,590
She passed away yesterday morning.

811
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,530
- Her funeral... - So?

812
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,599
So what do you want me to do?

813
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:36,639
Should we go and cry for her?

814
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:38,639
Should we go and dress for mourning and greet guests?

815
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,409
- Ji Seok. - Yoon Seo.

816
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,780
I still remember that woman choking you.

817
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,448
- What? - I also remember her...

818
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:52,119
grabbing you and crying every night,

819
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,420
pushing and hitting you, and cursing at us to get out.

820
00:55:57,429 --> 00:55:59,130
When I cried from hunger,

821
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:01,360
you had made porridge for me with the leftover rice.

822
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,000
Then, that woman...

823
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:07,570
cursed at you to go make money if you had time to take care of me.

824
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,710
You fed me porridge while covering my ears in case I heard.

825
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,010
Why do you...

826
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,449
Why do you still remember that? Why?

827
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,820
What, is she a parent just because she gave birth to us?

828
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:27,320
I have no feelings for that woman!

829
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,230
To me, my parent is...

830
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,929
To me, my family is no one else but you.

831
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,699
You're my mom and my dad.

832
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,030
I don't need anyone else.

833
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:43,969
I never thought I was lacking anything.

834
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,110
Did you feel...

835
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,010
you were lacking something because you only had me?

836
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,380
It's not like that.

837
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,750
Then, don't go.

838
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:57,150
Neither of us...

839
00:56:57,989 --> 00:56:59,219
have to go.

840
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,980
Are you going to work?

841
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,150
Yes.

842
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,690
I'll be going.

843
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,929
Oh, yes. Don't worry.

844
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,460
Yes, Ms. Ha.

845
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,530
Yes, got it. Bye.

846
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:21,768
What's this? What's going on?

847
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:22,968
Why? What did she say?

848
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:25,139
Ms. Ha is taking a day off.

849
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:26,239
What?

850
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:28,309
Hello, Director Seo.

851
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,480
Good morning.

852
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:33,409
What brings you here so early in the morning?

853
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,849
Well...

854
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:38,819
Ms. Ha is taking a day off?

855
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,989
Oh, yes. Well...

856
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:55,199
Has something happened to Yoon Seo?

857
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,139
I don't think I should be telling you about that.

858
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,880
You should ask her yourself when she wakes up.

859
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,059
Yes, who's speaking?

860
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:31,469
(Funeral Center)

861
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:36,239
Why did I come here?

862
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,069
(Rest in peace.)

863
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,469
(The Gracious Lord Church)

864
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:25,559

865
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,000
(Kim Hee Sook, Son, Ha Ji Seok, Daughter, Ha Yoon Seo)

866
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,969
I mean, even if that's the case,

867
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:06,769
how could they not even come to their mother's funeral?

868
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,269
It sounded like they didn't even know she was in the hospital.

869
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:11,739
What is this world coming to?

870
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,940
I mean, I told her that her mother had died, but she just hung up.

871
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:18,110
I heard she had a son too, besides the daughter you talked to.

872
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:20,480
Both of them will be punished by the skies.

873
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:22,579
Goodness.

874
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,949
How did you know and come here?

875
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,719
Ji Seok called me.

876
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,420
To be by your side.

877
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:38,989
Yoon Seo.

878
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:40,429
Yoon Seo.

879
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,000
Let go of me!

880
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:46,400
Why are you here?

881
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:49,969
Who are you to come all the way here and interfere?

882
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:55,480
- Yoon Seo. - I don't know how much you heard,

883
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:58,710
but not all families are alike.

884
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,420
And I don't think of that woman...

885
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,989
as my mom.

886
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,219
I'm not sad at all.

887
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:11,929
So, leave.

888
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:14,630
Leave!

889
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:28,539
Then, why are you crying?

890
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:32,050
You say you're not sad.

891
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,550
I don't know.

892
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:41,860
I don't know.

893
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,079
It was my first time I cried like that in my life.

894
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,750
Even when I first left home...

895
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,590
and struggled to find a room to stay in...

896
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,018
Even when I was in pain because there was much I could do...

897
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,489
for Ji Seok,

898
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,530
- I never cried. - It's okay.

899
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,309
I had lived my life without having a decent birthday celebration,

900
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,780
but I never cried.

901
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,019
But as he gently patted me on the back...

902
01:04:45,489 --> 01:04:47,559
with his eyes looking like they were in more pain than me,

903
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:53,590
I felt so overwhelmed with sorrow...

904
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,929
that I crumbled.

905
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,909
Yoon Seo, let's get married.

906
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:42,979
What? You proposed to her?

907
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,178
But I'm not going to rush her.

908
01:05:44,179 --> 01:05:45,908
I'm going to wait for her for as long as it takes.

909
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:48,019
If you keep doing this, Ha Yoon Seo...

910
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,250
will never work here or anywhere else.

911
01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:52,190
Do you want to leave her with nowhere to go because of you?

912
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:55,320
I suddenly have to go to Spain. I'm leaving now.

913
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,960
Seo Ju Won!

914
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:01,800
I'm going to cling on to you...

915
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:03,559
from now on.
