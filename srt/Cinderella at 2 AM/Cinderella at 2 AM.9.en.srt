12
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:55,945
We're already here.

13
00:00:56,116 --> 00:00:58,915
Why do you live so close? You should live farther away.

14
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:02,256
I'll go inside now. See you tomorrow.

15
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:04,184
We'll obviously see each other tomorrow.

16
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:05,786
I'm going to call you when I get home later.

17
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:09,896
Oh, sweetie.

18
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:11,324
You promised you'd stop staying at the hotel...

19
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:12,766
and to go home, right?

20
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,736
Okay. I'll go home.

21
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:20,036
One second.

22
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:25,075
Hey, Ji Seok. Where are you?

23
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:27,376
Seok Hyun's house?

24
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:30,486
It's late, so come home in an hour.

25
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:32,286
Bye.

26
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:37,685
- I'll go inside now. - Okay.

27
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:57,476
What's this?

28
00:01:58,206 --> 00:01:59,646
I'm coming in.

29
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:01,616
What's wrong with you? Where do you think you're going?

30
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:02,876
But...

31
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:04,786
Gosh.

32
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:08,185
Gosh, it's nice and comfortable.

33
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:12,086
What is this? Why are you coming in here?

34
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:13,595
I heard Ji Seok was coming home in an hour.

35
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,255
- So? - So, I'm going to leave in an hour.

36
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:17,795
Is this your house?

37
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:19,565
Can I only come in if it's my house?

38
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:22,065
Aren't you being too calculating between lovers?

39
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:26,935
It's not that. Ji Seok could come home earlier too.

40
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:31,946
Hey, I suddenly feel like I have the chills.

41
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:33,374
- What? - If you just give me...

42
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,744
a glass of hot chocolate,

43
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:36,076
I'll drink it quickly and leave.

44
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:38,946
Please?

45
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:57,866
Come on.

46
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:01,176
What are you doing?

47
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:02,775
Sweetie.

48
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:04,646
Do you want to play hot chocolate?

49
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,546
Is there a game like that?

50
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:15,685
I just said whatever.

51
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:17,956
What?

52
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,905
- No. - What?

53
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:39,904
Seriously, what if Ji Seok comes home?

54
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:43,215
No, don't drink hot chocolate. Just go.

55
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:44,785
Get your coat, okay?

56
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,055
You're really too mean.

57
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:55,825
I'm doing this because I feel sad to leave you.

58
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,225
I feel sad too.

59
00:03:57,565 --> 00:04:00,535
But I live in this house with a minor.

60
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,065
That's why I said we should spend tonight at the hotel together...

61
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:06,166
What are you saying? Seriously.

62
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:10,975
I want to get married soon and be together.

63
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:16,746
Why aren't you answering me?

64
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:19,845
What answer?

65
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:21,816
You don't even wear the ring I gave you.

66
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:24,056
You didn't even answer me for my proposal.

67
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:25,186
Well...

68
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:26,725
"Okay, let's get married."

69
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:28,795
Can't you give me a clear answer like that?

70
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:31,626
Do I have to say that...

71
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,095
Okay.

72
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:36,965
You say you can't do it. I can't keep wishing for it.

73
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:41,535
Then, I'll take my lonesome heart and leave now.

74
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,615
- Bye. - Bye.

75
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:56,115
How can I say that?

76
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:04,965
(Cinderella at 2AM)

77
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:16,505
Why? What now?

78
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:18,806
Why do you keep looking at me and not saying anything?

79
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:20,105
What is it?

80
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:25,615
Well...

81
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:29,355
I feel grateful for Ju Won since he waited for me,

82
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:31,956
and I couldn't answer him properly to his proposal either.

83
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:35,855
So, I want to do some kind of event for him.

84
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:38,196
But I've never done anything like this before.

85
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:42,436
So? Have you thought of anything?

86
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:46,006
I looked a few up. Want to hear what sounds better?

87
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:48,006
Let me hear it.

88
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:55,646
The door opens

89
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:58,544
You come in

90
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:01,415
At first glance

91
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:06,256
I knew that you were mine

92
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:10,355
You came before me

93
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:15,566
Your face as you leaned down

94
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:20,905
It's so blindingly beautiful

95
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:25,376
- I will say it carefully - I will say it carefully

96
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:29,115
- I will find my courage - I will find my courage

97
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:32,016
Don't find your courage for this. Pass.

98
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:53,364
Is this the 90s?

99
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:56,135
What? Why not just write a letter on a sketchbook too?

100
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:57,136
(Will you marry me?)

101
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:01,446
What's this, Uncle? How long have you been listening?

102
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:04,186
Since you started singing that cheesy song.

103
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:06,714
- Bad idea? - Yes.

104
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:08,984
It's cheesy and corny.

105
00:07:08,985 --> 00:07:11,055
You're the manager of the marketing team at a large company.

106
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,655
I can't believe that you came up with that kind of event!

107
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:16,025
So cheesy.

108
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:18,164
Tell me honestly.

109
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:19,496
You didn't resign, did you?

110
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:21,164
You got fired, didn't you?

111
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:23,936
What are you saying? It's because work and love are separate things.

112
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:25,766
I'm leaving.

113
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:29,405
Oh, right. Ji Seok called the restaurant earlier.

114
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,544
Ji Seok? Why?

115
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:34,446
He said he had been interested in cooking.

116
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:36,575
He wants to start cooking.

117
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:39,246
He asked me if he should go to a cooking academy or something.

118
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:42,316
He did?

119
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:45,326
I'm home.

120
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:47,725
You're here. You're right on time.

121
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,996
Something smells great.

122
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:50,965
Sweet! It’s braised galbi.

123
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,735
- It's beef. Braised galbi. - It looks delicious.

124
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:56,336
Thanks for the food.

125
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:21,396
Who are you, Paik Jong Won? Why are you savoring each flavor?

126
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:26,425
I was wondering if you had what it takes to go into cooking.

127
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:29,295
I heard you called Uncle Jae Ha.

128
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:32,605
Well, I...

129
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:35,336
I wanted to try it on my own.

130
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:38,306
That's why I'm saying this.

131
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:42,475
I was thinking of working part-time and going to a cooking academy.

132
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:43,874
At first,

133
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,484
I just started cooking because I wanted to do something for you...

134
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:46,745
since you were raising me yourself.

135
00:08:47,385 --> 00:08:50,286
But as I kept doing it I think I have some talent too.

136
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:52,326
It's fun.

137
00:08:58,095 --> 00:08:59,994
Follow me for a second. I have something for you.

138
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:01,464
What? What is it?

139
00:09:01,465 --> 00:09:02,734
- Come on. - What is it?

140
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:04,635
- Hurry up. - Is it something good? Hang on.

141
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:06,806
What?

142
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:11,345
One, ten, a hundred, a thousand...

143
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:14,075
What is this?

144
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:18,145
It's the bank account I've been saving in for you since college.

145
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:22,855
But this is too much.

146
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:25,686
It's fine.

147
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,025
If I give you a monthly allowance,

148
00:09:32,026 --> 00:09:33,926
you'll tiptoe around me and hesitate to ask for more.

149
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:37,836
Take that and use it to go to the cooking academy or on a trip.

150
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:39,566
Use it wisely for whatever you want.

151
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:43,406
You're a grown-up now. You should know how to manage your own money.

152
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:47,306
Then why not just wire me the money?

153
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:48,975
Who carries around a bankbook these days?

154
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,115
Why, you little...

155
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,086
What? Is this one yours? Can I see?

156
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:56,916
How dare you try to look in my drawer?

157
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,286
Get lost. Go and eat.

158
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:01,895
Thanks.

159
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:11,566
(Cash, Kim Seon Ju, 1 million dollars)

160
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:20,845
I will break up with Ju Won.

161
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:24,416
How much would it take?

162
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:26,515
Can you keep your promise...

163
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:28,255
and break up with my son?

164
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,426
Before answering his proposal,

165
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,355
there was something I had to do first.

166
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,615
She has arrived.

167
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,776
I'm sorry for contacting you out of the blue.

168
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:01,845
So?

169
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:04,145
Why did you come here?

170
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:17,865
I came to return the money you gave me.

171
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:19,895
And I wanted to see you...

172
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:23,235
and apologize to you as well.

173
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:29,235
Does this mean...

174
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:33,005
you won't be able to keep your promise?

175
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,515
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:39,446
I thought I'd be able to break up with him.

177
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:43,885
Once I accepted the money,

178
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:46,725
I thought I'd at least feel responsible and guilty enough...

179
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,296
to break up with him.

180
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:54,235
My heart did not move as I had intended to.

181
00:12:58,706 --> 00:13:01,135
Are you asking me to allow you to get married now?

182
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:04,975
I have nothing to gain from that.

183
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:09,374
I know you don't see me as worthy.

184
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,875
- However... - You must be...

185
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:14,956
mistaken about something.

186
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:19,956
The reason why I even bothered to speak to you...

187
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:23,796
was because you were at least someone who could see reality.

188
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:25,765
Now,

189
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,036
it won't be worth my time.

190
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:55,725
What's wrong with this?

191
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:59,065
- Is something the matter? - I'm on Marketing Team One.

192
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,195
My badge won't scan all of a sudden.

193
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:02,336
- One moment. - Okay.

194
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:06,336
- Please check this badge. - Okay.

195
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:14,145
So, we checked,

196
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,875
and it says your resignation has been processed.

197
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,115
Pardon?

198
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,416
(Visitor's Pass)

199
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:27,225
I mean, Ms. Ha...

200
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:29,955
You only told us you were resigning a few days ago.

201
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,125
How can you leave so suddenly?

202
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,865
Are you perhaps embarrassed to see us and beating us to the punch?

203
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,134
- What? - We know that...

204
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:40,036
you and Director Seo are dating again.

205
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:41,935
We caught on too.

206
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:45,345
You're doing this because you feel shy about dating again, right?

207
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,615
If that's why you're leaving ahead of schedule while you're at it,

208
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:51,014
we'll really act like we don't know.

209
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,946
Please stay longer, okay?

210
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:55,685
It's not like that.

211
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,786
I was going to leave as soon as my projects were wrapped up.

212
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,355
Oh, by the way... Here.

213
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:06,425
If you look at this, it'll be enough to pick up where I left off.

214
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:08,234
If you need anything else...

215
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:10,395
or have any questions, let me know anytime.

216
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:12,306
Okay.

217
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:13,806
You'll do a good job, Mr. Bae.

218
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:17,076
Oh, it's Manager Bae now, right?

219
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:24,845
Director Seo, Ms. Ha is leaving now.

220
00:15:25,046 --> 00:15:26,785
You knew about this, right?

221
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:28,715
That today was Ms. Ha's last day.

222
00:15:37,326 --> 00:15:38,365
Gosh...

223
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:40,926
One moment.

224
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:47,875
What? Where are you going?

225
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,776
The HR Team.

226
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:51,474
I want to hear why they suddenly processed your resignation...

227
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:52,676
even without my approval.

228
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:56,745
I met with the chairwoman.

229
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:02,985
Hello.

230
00:16:07,526 --> 00:16:08,926
Let's talk over there for a second.

231
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:19,935
What are you saying?

232
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:22,235
- Why would Mother... - I contacted her first.

233
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:24,446
To return the money I had accepted.

234
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:26,206
Why would you do that by yourself?

235
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:28,075
Didn't you think to tell me about it first?

236
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:29,515
It's not like that.

237
00:16:29,676 --> 00:16:32,485
If I had said that I was going to meet the chairwoman beforehand,

238
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,255
you would've kept worrying.

239
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:37,316
In case I hear harsh words...

240
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:40,786
and in case I hear those words and have a change of heart again.

241
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:43,355
But Ju Won.

242
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,166
I won't be swayed anymore.

243
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:48,436
I went to see the chairwoman knowing she wouldn't welcome me.

244
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:52,165
And it's fine that she processed my resignation.

245
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,504
What's fine?

246
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:55,405
There's nothing to be serious about.

247
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:58,275
I returned the money I always felt bad about,

248
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:00,245
so I can date you with confidence now.

249
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:02,316
And I was going to resign anyway,

250
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:05,684
but she pulled it up by a week. So, now I get to have a vacation.

251
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:07,715
- But still... - As I've come to be by your side,

252
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:09,286
I'm only going to go straightforward.

253
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,326
So let's not act so pitiful.

254
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:34,746
Goodness. I haven't taken a nap in such a long time.

255
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:40,345
I'll sleep in until I have dinner.

256
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:05,145
What? Only 20 minutes?

257
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:07,605
Gosh, I'm so disappointed.

258
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:09,845
Why can't I sleep?

259
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,685
I've always wanted to try having fun during the day...

260
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:20,355
while everyone else was working.

261
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:24,496
But what did I want to do?

262
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:31,305
(Market Team)

263
00:18:31,306 --> 00:18:33,164
The Design Team will bring us coffee for the meeting.

264
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:34,736
I'll take your orders!

265
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:36,835
I'll take an iced cafe mocha...

266
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:38,506
with a bunch of whipped cream.

267
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:40,904
(- I'll take your orders! - I'll take an iced cafe mocha...)

268
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:42,674
(with a bunch of whipped cream.)

269
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:46,086
You'll be talking about work here. I don't think I should be here.

270
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:48,586
I'll be leaving the group chat now.

271
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:52,026
(I'll be leaving the group chat now.)

272
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:58,225
Goodness, Ye Young.

273
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:01,235
You should've started a new group chat. Why did you post this here?

274
00:19:01,236 --> 00:19:04,236
I'm regretting it now too. Stop yelling at me.

275
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:08,435
But seeing her leave the group chat makes it feel more real.

276
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:11,444
I didn't know she would leave so suddenly.

277
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:12,476
I know.

278
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,776
She was scary, but I still liked her.

279
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,316
Gosh, let's go to the meeting.

280
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:19,516
Right.

281
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:24,016
- Hello. - Hello.

282
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:27,786
Hey, is the rumor true about Manager Ha Yoon Seo?

283
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:31,094
What? Oh, about her resigning?

284
00:19:31,095 --> 00:19:33,364
- Well, that's... - No, not that.

285
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:35,364
How she got cut off from entering the building this morning.

286
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:37,164
- Pardon? - "Cut off from entering?"

287
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:39,604
I mean, I saw her while coming to work.

288
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:42,174
She was so flustered because her entrance badge won't work.

289
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:44,806
So, the Security Team checked it for her,

290
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,205
but they said her resignation had been processed as of today.

291
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:54,485
- Good work. - Thank you.

292
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:55,486
- Bye. - Thank you.

293
00:19:56,455 --> 00:19:59,055
What is this? So, just until this morning,

294
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:01,695
Ms. Ha wasn't aware that her resignation had been processed?

295
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,826
That must've been why Director Seo looked like that.

296
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:07,796
I thought he seemed really angry.

297
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:11,095
But if it was a clerical error,

298
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:14,605
Director Seo could've taken care of it at once. Why...

299
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:20,775
The person who fired Ms. Ha must've been the chairwoman.

300
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:22,644
No way. Why would she do that?

301
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:25,215
Why else? She had found out that the two were dating,

302
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:28,815
and she had even gone to Ms. Ha to tell her to break up.

303
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,715
But since they got back together,

304
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:32,026
she had Ms. Ha kicked out of the company.

305
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:36,325
You're right. Someone who has enough power to do that...

306
00:20:36,326 --> 00:20:38,124
- is the chairwoman and no one else. - Right.

307
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,895
Hey, that was pretty clever.

308
00:20:42,336 --> 00:20:43,835
- Oh, Mr. Lee. - What?

309
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:45,335
- Hello. - Hi.

310
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:46,665
What brings you here?

311
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:48,934
Oh, I came for a meeting with the PR Team.

312
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:51,375
I thought I'd say hello, so I brought snacks.

313
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:53,276
Thank you.

314
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:56,746
If you had come a bit sooner, you would've seen Ms. Ha.

315
00:20:57,476 --> 00:20:58,644
She quit.

316
00:20:58,645 --> 00:21:01,486
Well, she had submitted her letter of resignation,

317
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:05,455
but her last day was moved up suddenly, so she left as of today.

318
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:08,526
Oh, I see.

319
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:14,736
Hi, Ms. Ha. I heard you resigned.

320
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:18,165
Yes. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you beforehand.

321
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:20,066
I've passed on all of my work,

322
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,935
so there won't be any issues with the schedule in the future.

323
00:21:23,135 --> 00:21:24,205
I'm not sure.

324
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:27,205
That's just your opinion.

325
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,316
I decided to do this exhibition because of you.

326
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:32,914
I think I was conned...

327
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:34,645
by AL CARD for not giving me a heads up about this.

328
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,516
- What? - Let's talk for a minute.

329
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:39,124
I'll see you at my studio.

330
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,625
Mr. Lee...

331
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:51,165
What? Yoon Seo went to see Mother?

332
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:54,976
Gosh, she's pretty impressive.

333
00:21:55,476 --> 00:21:57,806
Not many people would be able to do that.

334
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,844
Hey, think positively about this.

335
00:22:01,845 --> 00:22:05,114
Yoon Seo isn't wavering, so all you have to do is convince Mother.

336
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,546
Try everything you can.

337
00:22:08,716 --> 00:22:10,354
Or not.

338
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:12,026
There isn't anything more you can do.

339
00:22:12,526 --> 00:22:14,585
You tried asking her to trust and wait for you.

340
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:16,255
You tried opening up to her emotionally.

341
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:17,925
You even ran away from home.

342
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:19,424
What will you do now?

343
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,226
What? Are you teasing me right now?

344
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:24,335
Hey, I'm not teasing you. I'm just worried.

345
00:22:24,336 --> 00:22:25,766
I'm wondering what you should do too.

346
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:30,236
Gosh, I wish I could buy you a drink tonight,

347
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:32,175
but I have plans with Mi Jin tonight.

348
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,375
Hey, do you want to join us?

349
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:37,375
No, I should go see Yoon Seo as soon as I get off work.

350
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,085
I'm so worried about her, but I couldn't go see her...

351
00:22:40,086 --> 00:22:41,086
because she told me to stay at work.

352
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:45,326
I wonder how she is now.

353
00:22:49,256 --> 00:22:50,296
Mr. Lee?

354
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,265
- Ta-da! - Oh, my goodness.

355
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:54,726
Congratulations on your resignation!

356
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:56,236
What?

357
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:59,005
I wanted to tell you that you've worked so hard to the point...

358
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:02,806
where a hard-working gene has been ingrained into your bones.

359
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:06,945
But I figured you wouldn't come if I just asked to see you.

360
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:11,046
Seriously. Until the end, you weird...

361
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:13,216
- Weird? - Weird...

362
00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:15,615
You're weirdly pranking me again.

363
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:21,526
I mean, it's not like you work for AL CARD.

364
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,756
Why would you do this?

365
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,095
I really was grateful.

366
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:29,796
I got to hold my first exhibition, thanks to you.

367
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:35,506
Actually, I had thought I should do something more,

368
00:23:35,605 --> 00:23:38,174
but I wasn't sure what to do or where to start.

369
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:39,806
Right when I was worrying about those things,

370
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,115
you offered me such a great plan.

371
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:45,016
And because it was from you, Ms. Ha,

372
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,986
I was able to make that decision quickly.

373
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:48,586
I was grateful for that.

374
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:55,855
Oh, right.

375
00:23:57,796 --> 00:24:00,796
(Ms. Ha Yoon Seo, You've worked harder than anyone all this time.)

376
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:05,036
- One moment. - Okay.

377
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:14,776
(Seo Ju Won)

378
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:17,516
- Hey, Ju Won. - What are you doing?

379
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:20,384
Oh, I came outside for a bit.

380
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:23,285
Happy resignation to you

381
00:24:23,286 --> 00:24:26,185
Happy resignation to you

382
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,486
Happy resignation, dear...

383
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:29,855
Well, you're not my dear. Anyway.

384
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,496
Happy resignation to you

385
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:36,766
Who's that? Who's saying he loves you?

386
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:38,865
And who's congratulating you on your resignation?

387
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:41,404
Oh, it's Artist Lee Sung Min.

388
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:43,776
I happened to come by his studio.

389
00:24:44,036 --> 00:24:46,605
He prepared a cake for me, saying I've worked hard so far.

390
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:49,844
I didn't expect this when I came here either, but...

391
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:51,845
Got it. Hang up for now.

392
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:54,486
Seo Ju Won?

393
00:24:57,355 --> 00:24:58,385
Twenty-five minutes.

394
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:00,825
What? What is?

395
00:25:00,826 --> 00:25:03,296
Seo Ju Won will run over here in 25 minutes.

396
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:05,595
It normally takes about 50 minutes to get here,

397
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:07,624
but I think he'll make it in 25.

398
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,694
Gosh, what...

399
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:11,236
Why would Ju Won come here? What did we do?

400
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:12,435
What?

401
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:15,476
Do you want to make a bet on whether he comes or not?

402
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:20,046
Blow out your candle.

403
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:25,716
Let's go now.

404
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:27,086
Where?

405
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:29,655
There has to be wine for a goodbye party.

406
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:31,614
There's a good place nearby.

407
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:34,155
They said they had one table left, so I reserved it.

408
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:36,295
Seo Ju Won might be here soon, so let's get going.

409
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:37,756
What do you mean...

410
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:39,026
Yoon Seo!

411
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,094
What? He actually came?

412
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:42,665
It didn't even take 25 minutes, and he's already here?

413
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:47,935
Let's go, Yoon Seo.

414
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,336
Where are you going? We said we'd have wine together.

415
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:54,705
Have wine with me, Yoon Seo.

416
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:57,316
She said she'd have it with me.

417
00:25:57,845 --> 00:26:00,415
I mean, why would my Yoon Seo drink wine with you?

418
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:01,884
To have a goodbye party.

419
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:02,885
You haven't even known each other for that long,

420
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:03,885
and you're having a goodbye party?

421
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:05,085
Isn't a goodbye party supposed to be with someone...

422
00:26:05,086 --> 00:26:06,155
who worked together for a long time, like me?

423
00:26:06,655 --> 00:26:08,025
Let's have the goodbye party with me, Yoon Seo.

424
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,894
Then you should've prepared it beforehand.

425
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:11,455
I said I'd do it first.

426
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:12,665
Come with me.

427
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:15,894
What is this? Deja vu or something?

428
00:26:15,895 --> 00:26:17,036
Both of you, stop it.

429
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:23,635
I think I should eat with Mr. Lee today.

430
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:25,644
I've been grateful for him about a lot of things.

431
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:27,046
I've been meaning to treat him to a meal.

432
00:26:27,145 --> 00:26:29,475
But you won't like it if I meet him on some other day.

433
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:32,286
So, since we've already met, I'll eat with him today.

434
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,826
But it's fine if Ju Won comes too, right?

435
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:44,095
Let's all eat together.

436
00:26:48,836 --> 00:26:49,836
Let's go.

437
00:26:50,635 --> 00:26:51,836
Wait up, Yoon Seo.

438
00:26:54,135 --> 00:26:56,605
I should go first! You don't even know where it is.

439
00:27:00,905 --> 00:27:01,976
It's good, isn't it?

440
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,715
I've been here before, but I thought of you,

441
00:27:04,716 --> 00:27:06,415
so I brought you here.

442
00:27:06,845 --> 00:27:08,885
- Thank you. - Sure.

443
00:27:30,135 --> 00:27:31,205
By the way,

444
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:34,205
I know it might be weird to say this as a married couple,

445
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:36,875
but don't we feel like we're having a fling?

446
00:27:39,445 --> 00:27:40,486
A bit.

447
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:44,455
Honestly, as I watched my parents living without any affection,

448
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:46,286
I had been against arranged marriages.

449
00:27:46,925 --> 00:27:50,526
But now, I think it's kind of nice.

450
00:27:51,595 --> 00:27:54,265
I mean, I never even thought that I'd get to feel this way...

451
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:57,165
throughout our marriage.

452
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:58,336
Right.

453
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:03,404
Then, try to convince Ju Won.

454
00:28:03,405 --> 00:28:05,345
Mother seemed really upset.

455
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,506
But...

456
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:10,675
I also want to root for Ju Won.

457
00:28:11,016 --> 00:28:13,385
I get how he must feel now.

458
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:15,986
I know from experience, and it's really...

459
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:19,654
Why did you stop mid-sentence?

460
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:21,385
Keep going. What do you know from experience?

461
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:25,594
Oh, nothing. Pretend like you didn't hear anything.

462
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:27,995
I already heard it. How can I pretend like I didn't?

463
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:29,635
Who doesn't have a past?

464
00:28:29,865 --> 00:28:31,435
Gosh, what past?

465
00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:33,905
It's just about when I was young. Like my first love...

466
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:38,506
I see.

467
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:43,016
It was your first love.

468
00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:46,115
And you broke up because Mother was against it, like Ju Won?

469
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:47,785
Wife, I meant...

470
00:28:47,786 --> 00:28:49,454
You must've had a rebellious phase as well,

471
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:51,716
enough to understand how Ju Won feels during his rebellion.

472
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:55,026
That must be why you were against arranged marriages.

473
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,066
You must not have liked me either, right?

474
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:00,395
Gosh, no...

475
00:29:03,595 --> 00:29:05,635
Why is this so hard?

476
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:09,935
You should eat.

477
00:29:10,076 --> 00:29:11,135
Yes.

478
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:20,586
You idiot, why did you have to say that stuff?

479
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:22,655
I mean,

480
00:29:23,655 --> 00:29:24,685
me.

481
00:29:27,185 --> 00:29:30,695
I was just trying to say that I liked our marriage.

482
00:29:31,256 --> 00:29:33,565
But seriously. My wife isn't a kid.

483
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:35,195
Why is she getting upset about what's in the past?

484
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,306
Hang on.

485
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:41,165
Isn't this jealousy?

486
00:29:45,945 --> 00:29:47,645
Gosh, what's this?

487
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,675
What am I supposed to do with her?

488
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:53,145
Hey, it's you.

489
00:29:54,185 --> 00:29:56,516
No, it's me.

490
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:04,026
Shall we have a cup of tea since we're out already?

491
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:06,395
Warm tea is good for insomnia.

492
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:09,295
Don't you need strong whiskey...

493
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:11,036
instead of warm tea?

494
00:30:11,365 --> 00:30:12,904
- What? - You seem nostalgic...

495
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:14,235
thinking about your first love.

496
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:15,875
You must be craving a drink.

497
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,775
I'll butt out,

498
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:20,546
so you can have a drink all by your lonesome.

499
00:30:23,776 --> 00:30:25,816
What's with that adorably pouty face?

500
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:29,086
Are you being jealous?

501
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:32,256
It's not like you're a kid.

502
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:34,526
Mi Jin.

503
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,556
Hey, Hyun Sung!

504
00:30:37,655 --> 00:30:38,665
"Hyun Sung?"

505
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,375
Hey, have you been well?

506
00:30:52,705 --> 00:30:55,046
Why have you gotten so pretty? I nearly didn't recognize you.

507
00:30:55,976 --> 00:30:57,046
What is this?

508
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,746
You've changed so much! You look so cool now.

509
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:02,486
- Do you work out too? - Of course, I do.

510
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:03,855
You surprised me.

511
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:07,425
Oh, your husband was with you.

512
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:09,226
Yes.

513
00:31:10,695 --> 00:31:12,425
Hello. I'm Kim Hyun Sung.

514
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:14,425
Oh, yes.

515
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:17,966
I'm Seo Si Won.

516
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:39,985
The view here is great.

517
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:42,595
I didn't know you had made reservations somewhere so nice.

518
00:31:42,925 --> 00:31:45,766
It does look a little cramped, though.

519
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:47,525
I know.

520
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:49,695
He was boasting about making reservations at a nice place.

521
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:50,934
But what's with the seat?

522
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:53,035
I barely managed to reserve the last table available.

523
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,766
How was I supposed to know it was a table for two?

524
00:31:54,865 --> 00:31:57,976
Who was it that made a party of 2 become a party of 3?

525
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:00,844
Isn't it weirder to come to a place like this with someone...

526
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:01,874
who has a boyfriend?

527
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,015
What kind of place is this?

528
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:04,775
A romantic place with a nice mood.

529
00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:07,716
This place is not romantic. It's just normal.

530
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:11,085
Oh, you must not have been to places like this often.

531
00:32:11,086 --> 00:32:14,086
You should go to some nice places with Yoon Seo.

532
00:32:15,425 --> 00:32:18,654
Tonight is a party for me, right?

533
00:32:18,655 --> 00:32:20,924
But I feel really uncomfortable right now.

534
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:23,336
Right? Mr. Lee is really making people feel uncomfortable.

535
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:25,135
Should we go someplace more comfortable on our own?

536
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:27,205
Gosh. Honestly, Mr. Seo.

537
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:29,175
You should be grateful to me.

538
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:31,405
I'm not one to boast like this,

539
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:33,375
but the fact that you two got back together again...

540
00:32:33,845 --> 00:32:35,145
Isn't it all thanks to me?

541
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:37,716
That's a funny way to put it, Mr. Lee.

542
00:32:37,776 --> 00:32:39,415
How is that thanks to you?

543
00:32:40,385 --> 00:32:42,085
At the gamjatang restaurant the other day,

544
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:45,184
Ms. Ha was going on and on about how much she missed you.

545
00:32:45,185 --> 00:32:47,655
So, I called you to come and pick her up.

546
00:32:48,056 --> 00:32:50,255
Honestly, the fact that you two got back together...

547
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:51,295
When Ha Yoon Seo had given up,

548
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:54,125
thinking Seo Ju Won was leaving for Spain for good,

549
00:32:54,226 --> 00:32:56,394
I gave her a boost of courage...

550
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:58,036
for you to run to him right away, right?

551
00:33:00,435 --> 00:33:04,135
You two have talked about quite a lot while I wasn't around.

552
00:33:06,905 --> 00:33:09,076
(Ji Seok)

553
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:11,615
Hey, Ji Seok.

554
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:12,885
One moment.

555
00:33:14,145 --> 00:33:15,185
Yes.

556
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:23,625
- Gosh. - Gosh.

557
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:32,205
I'm sorry, but I think I'm going to have to step outside.

558
00:33:32,405 --> 00:33:33,465
Why? Is something the matter?

559
00:33:33,466 --> 00:33:36,005
Oh, Ji Seok went to register for an academy,

560
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:37,105
and it's right around here.

561
00:33:37,336 --> 00:33:39,306
I think it would be good for me to take a look too.

562
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:41,374
The steak hasn't been served yet.

563
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,175
It'd be awkward to say goodbye here.

564
00:33:43,316 --> 00:33:45,375
- I'll be right back. - I'll come with you.

565
00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:47,585
Ji Seok likes me.

566
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:49,655
You? Ji Seok?

567
00:33:53,486 --> 00:33:55,425
Yes, of course.

568
00:33:55,526 --> 00:33:56,756
He absolutely loves you.

569
00:33:56,895 --> 00:33:59,895
But it'd be rude to leave Mr. Lee here alone.

570
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:01,695
I'll be right back.

571
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:03,766
- I'll be back soon. - Okay.

572
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,006
Gosh.

573
00:34:14,276 --> 00:34:15,305
You should move.

574
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:17,975
My gosh.

575
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,665
I want to ask you something.

576
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:36,995
- What? - I'm not dying to know or anything,

577
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:39,636
but I'm just slightly curious.

578
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:43,805
Who was that guy who called you "Mi Jin?"

579
00:34:44,776 --> 00:34:47,176
Oh, my first love.

580
00:34:47,676 --> 00:34:48,704
- What? - Are you the only one...

581
00:34:48,705 --> 00:34:49,715
with a first love?

582
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:52,616
I have one too. I loved him so dearly.

583
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:55,445
We were madly in love for about two years, but...

584
00:34:55,446 --> 00:34:57,886
I dated for three years. I was passionately in love too.

585
00:34:58,886 --> 00:35:01,224
My love was even more passionate. It was burning up like a furnace.

586
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:02,495
My love was as hot as lava.

587
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:05,256
I cried for a whole month after we broke up!

588
00:35:05,495 --> 00:35:07,095
I cried for a whole year.

589
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:09,366
I thought I'd never love again.

590
00:35:11,366 --> 00:35:14,705
Fine. Don't ever love again.

591
00:35:17,906 --> 00:35:19,546
Fine. I won't!

592
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:25,586
But...

593
00:35:26,616 --> 00:35:28,645
This isn't it.

594
00:35:31,886 --> 00:35:34,725
I mean, why have a battle about that?

595
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:38,656
My gosh!

596
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:49,506
Goodness.

597
00:35:50,176 --> 00:35:52,276
Who's the one who should be angry right now?

598
00:35:52,346 --> 00:35:53,375
Forget it.

599
00:35:53,846 --> 00:35:55,345
We had an arranged marriage without any love anyway.

600
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:56,346
What did I expect?

601
00:35:57,116 --> 00:35:59,386
But still, I said...

602
00:36:00,515 --> 00:36:02,116
I said so.

603
00:36:02,586 --> 00:36:04,055
That I've come to like you!

604
00:36:04,616 --> 00:36:05,625
Darn it!

605
00:36:09,555 --> 00:36:11,125
I hate you so much.

606
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,346
Can I ask you something?

607
00:36:29,216 --> 00:36:30,875
Throwing her a party like this...

608
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:34,386
You don't still have feelings for her, do you?

609
00:36:38,756 --> 00:36:39,825
Actually,

610
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,125
I like Ms. Ha.

611
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:43,994
What... What did you say?

612
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:45,665
But I like you too.

613
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:49,296
- Pardon? - I like you both.

614
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:52,466
I feel drawn to you guys because you seem like me in the past.

615
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,176
Your family is against your relationship, right?

616
00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:01,075
Why are you surprised?

617
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:03,176
Everyone in the office had caught on and was talking about it too.

618
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:09,816
So, what about you?

619
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:12,086
Have you prepared yourself?

620
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,825
Well, I'm working on it.

621
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:18,954
I'm working to show that I can expand the business...

622
00:37:18,955 --> 00:37:22,026
just with my own capabilities without an arranged marriage.

623
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:24,435
But won't that take a few years, at least?

624
00:37:24,636 --> 00:37:26,035
What about Ms. Ha?

625
00:37:26,136 --> 00:37:29,135
So, I was thinking about giving up everything I had and left home...

626
00:37:29,136 --> 00:37:30,906
That's what guys like me would do.

627
00:37:32,236 --> 00:37:33,276
You know, don't you?

628
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:36,075
I cut ties with my family because they were opposed to me doing art.

629
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:38,245
Yes, well...

630
00:37:38,276 --> 00:37:40,116
The reason why I could cut ties with everything and leave...

631
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:43,116
was because I only had to protect myself.

632
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:45,886
But you have to protect Ha Yoon Seo too.

633
00:37:47,055 --> 00:37:49,555
And yet, how can you act like a rebellious teenager...

634
00:37:49,995 --> 00:37:52,995
and leave home, act up, and react emotionally?

635
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:59,035
Then, what should I do?

636
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:06,645
Right.

637
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:32,466
I don't like the phrase...

638
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:36,506
that parents give in to their kids in the end.

639
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:39,006
A surprising number of parents overpower their children.

640
00:38:39,546 --> 00:38:40,946
Instead of trying to win,

641
00:38:41,546 --> 00:38:42,546
try to bend.

642
00:38:43,346 --> 00:38:45,275
Just like love is something you want to fight for...

643
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:47,145
at the expense of giving everything else up,

644
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:49,915
There must be something...

645
00:38:50,515 --> 00:38:52,685
your mother wants to protect by going this far.

646
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:55,995
Try to understand where she's coming from...

647
00:38:56,296 --> 00:38:57,796
and start a frank conversation.

648
00:38:59,096 --> 00:39:00,165
Who knows?

649
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:02,495
You might get through to her.

650
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:17,315
Sorry I took my time.

651
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:19,546
We ended up meeting with the instructor.

652
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:23,285
What happened? You drank all that while I was gone?

653
00:39:23,316 --> 00:39:24,386
Yes.

654
00:39:24,986 --> 00:39:25,986
Yoon Seo.

655
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:29,595
I see Mr. Lee in a different light now.

656
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:31,895
- What? - I thought he was a psychopath,

657
00:39:32,026 --> 00:39:33,296
but he's a great guy.

658
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:37,865
Why do you speak so informally when I'm older than you?

659
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:40,135
We even went to the same university.

660
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:41,205
Oh, right.

661
00:39:41,736 --> 00:39:45,035
Then Mr... No, my dear senior.

662
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:48,244
Can I call you that now? "Senior?"

663
00:39:48,245 --> 00:39:50,575
I like how that sounds.

664
00:39:51,216 --> 00:39:52,915
Why the sudden...

665
00:39:53,346 --> 00:39:54,415
Senior Lee.

666
00:39:54,946 --> 00:39:57,455
I was actually jealous of you.

667
00:39:58,015 --> 00:40:00,785
There was something I'd wanted to do since I was a kid,

668
00:40:00,926 --> 00:40:02,455
but I gave that up.

669
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:05,526
But you, Senior Lee. You never gave up.

670
00:40:05,756 --> 00:40:07,624
You have my greatest respect.

671
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,395
I didn't know that about you.

672
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,435
Here.

673
00:40:13,265 --> 00:40:16,704
That must've been heartbreaking.

674
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,836
At the time, I felt...

675
00:40:19,846 --> 00:40:20,906
so frustrated.

676
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,046
Did it weigh on you?

677
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:26,216
That's when you should shout!

678
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,986
Why would you suddenly shout?

679
00:40:29,086 --> 00:40:30,785
- Let's shout. - Yes.

680
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:34,756
What am I to do?

681
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:40,765
What should I do?

682
00:40:42,696 --> 00:40:45,566
I dared to

683
00:40:46,305 --> 00:40:49,165
Fall in love

684
00:40:50,136 --> 00:40:51,304
With...

685
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:53,946
I love Ha Yoon Seo

686
00:40:55,645 --> 00:41:01,015
Where are you?

687
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:07,625
Do you hear me?

688
00:41:08,086 --> 00:41:09,955
It's just you

689
00:41:10,696 --> 00:41:14,125
Seriously, I just want Yoon Seo

690
00:41:15,566 --> 00:41:20,605
Please allow our relationship

691
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:33,185
My love only grows

692
00:41:33,515 --> 00:41:39,986
Sometimes it seeps out before I notice

693
00:41:40,225 --> 00:41:46,596
I cry like a child who lost their way

694
00:41:56,336 --> 00:41:58,705
Don't close your eyes

695
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:01,805
Look at me

696
00:42:02,716 --> 00:42:05,175
I try to lean in close

697
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:10,216
And whisper in your ear

698
00:42:10,316 --> 00:42:12,316
It's time for the final song.

699
00:42:12,455 --> 00:42:14,585
We dedicate it to Ms. Ha...

700
00:42:14,586 --> 00:42:16,926
who worked tirelessly for AL CARD.

701
00:42:17,026 --> 00:42:18,455
That's right. Yoon Seo.

702
00:42:18,696 --> 00:42:21,995
A much happier life awaits you.

703
00:42:22,366 --> 00:42:24,835
To that, I say "amor fati!"

704
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:27,906
Such is life

705
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:31,506
Everyone starts off empty-handed

706
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:35,776
They create stories fit for a novel

707
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:38,974
And scatter them as they go

708
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,245
Don't be disappointed in yourself

709
00:42:42,386 --> 00:42:45,985
You can't do everything well

710
00:42:45,986 --> 00:42:50,224
It's fine as long as tomorrow is better than today

711
00:42:50,225 --> 00:42:54,324
Life starts right now

712
00:42:54,325 --> 00:42:55,765
Go!

713
00:42:57,196 --> 00:42:58,196
What?

714
00:42:58,197 --> 00:42:59,765
Amor fati

715
00:43:05,176 --> 00:43:06,846
Amor fati

716
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:10,415
Amor fati

717
00:43:12,475 --> 00:43:13,886
Amor fati

718
00:43:35,305 --> 00:43:36,305
What happened?

719
00:43:37,676 --> 00:43:38,776
Why am I at home?

720
00:43:41,605 --> 00:43:44,276
I'm back home, Mother!

721
00:43:46,185 --> 00:43:48,346
How have you been?

722
00:43:49,855 --> 00:43:51,386
Oh, my goodness.

723
00:43:55,785 --> 00:43:58,355
Mother. You went too far.

724
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:02,895
Did I go too far by stopping you from falling,

725
00:44:02,995 --> 00:44:04,765
or did you go too far by coming back this late?

726
00:44:04,866 --> 00:44:06,105
You went too far.

727
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:09,506
How could you fire Yoon Seo just like that?

728
00:44:09,535 --> 00:44:12,875
Yoon Seo! Before being my girlfriend,

729
00:44:13,105 --> 00:44:17,374
she was a skilled employee who worked hard for your company.

730
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:20,745
So how could you kick her out the very next day?

731
00:44:22,245 --> 00:44:23,656
Let's talk when you're sober.

732
00:44:25,586 --> 00:44:27,325
Can't you just approve of us?

733
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:39,966
This is the first time I ever...

734
00:44:41,736 --> 00:44:42,875
asked for something.

735
00:44:46,846 --> 00:44:49,446
I'm asking you for the first time since that day.

736
00:44:52,046 --> 00:44:55,086
Si Won, look at this. I'll be a sculptor.

737
00:44:55,685 --> 00:44:57,385
I made these at school today.

738
00:44:57,386 --> 00:44:59,755
This is a puppy and this is a turtle.

739
00:44:59,756 --> 00:45:02,026
Are they? They look amazing.

740
00:45:02,526 --> 00:45:04,256
When will Mom be back?

741
00:45:04,355 --> 00:45:05,696
I'm not sure.

742
00:45:05,895 --> 00:45:08,265
She said this business trip would be a long one.

743
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:10,466
She might be home next week.

744
00:45:11,765 --> 00:45:13,636
I want to show these to her soon.

745
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:18,605
- Mom. - Yes?

746
00:45:18,736 --> 00:45:20,975
Mom, I know what I want to be.

747
00:45:21,446 --> 00:45:23,546
I'll be a sculptor.

748
00:45:24,216 --> 00:45:26,116
These are my presents for you.

749
00:45:32,386 --> 00:45:33,455
Seo Ju Won.

750
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:35,325
What does Mom dislike the most?

751
00:45:36,225 --> 00:45:38,125
That's...

752
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:43,136
not doing what I'm supposed to do.

753
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:47,435
I hope you didn't...

754
00:45:47,866 --> 00:45:50,636
forget to do what you're supposed to to make these.

755
00:45:53,145 --> 00:45:56,616
You did enough sculpting, so let's not do that again.

756
00:45:56,975 --> 00:45:58,015
Do you understand?

757
00:45:58,546 --> 00:45:59,546
Yes.

758
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:31,475
Since that day...

759
00:46:32,116 --> 00:46:33,816
I never had a dream.

760
00:46:35,716 --> 00:46:37,415
Dreaming of doing something...

761
00:46:39,185 --> 00:46:41,225
seemed to disappoint you.

762
00:46:43,895 --> 00:46:45,696
So I never dreamed since then.

763
00:46:49,796 --> 00:46:50,866
But Mother.

764
00:46:54,336 --> 00:46:55,805
I want to be happy now.

765
00:47:09,086 --> 00:47:10,515
Why did I bring up...

766
00:47:11,455 --> 00:47:12,555
something from that long ago?

767
00:47:13,586 --> 00:47:14,656
Darn it.

768
00:47:18,526 --> 00:47:20,324
There must be something...

769
00:47:20,325 --> 00:47:22,125
your mother wants to protect by going this far.

770
00:47:22,395 --> 00:47:24,495
Try to understand where she's coming from...

771
00:47:24,765 --> 00:47:26,136
and start a frank conversation.

772
00:47:34,105 --> 00:47:35,745
I want to be happy now.

773
00:48:00,406 --> 00:48:01,705
Are you here to complain...

774
00:48:02,236 --> 00:48:04,006
that I upset the person you like?

775
00:48:05,935 --> 00:48:06,946
I apologize.

776
00:48:09,276 --> 00:48:10,676
I shouldn't have brought up...

777
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,015
what I did last night when I was drunk.

778
00:48:17,756 --> 00:48:20,055
I didn't mean to blame you.

779
00:48:22,325 --> 00:48:24,225
I was young then and I was hurt,

780
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,394
but I'm aware now...

781
00:48:26,395 --> 00:48:28,296
that you were teaching me...

782
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:31,535
what I should and shouldn't do.

783
00:48:35,765 --> 00:48:36,776
But...

784
00:48:37,975 --> 00:48:40,046
I meant it when I said I wanted to be happy.

785
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:43,816
Does that mean...

786
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,946
you're unhappy now?

787
00:48:48,046 --> 00:48:49,546
I meant that with Yoon Seo,

788
00:48:51,716 --> 00:48:53,285
I could be happier.

789
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,596
After you left home,

790
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:09,205
I waited for you to return.

791
00:49:10,636 --> 00:49:13,446
You only returned after I pushed her to the edge of a cliff.

792
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:15,776
As your mother...

793
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,075
That hurt.

794
00:49:20,745 --> 00:49:22,816
- That was... - You asked if I couldn't be...

795
00:49:23,185 --> 00:49:24,855
a mother and not the chairwoman.

796
00:49:27,555 --> 00:49:29,955
That bothered me.

797
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:37,035
I know I wasn't an affectionate mother to you.

798
00:49:37,995 --> 00:49:40,966
But since you were my son,

799
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:44,176
I believed I should raise you to be tough.

800
00:49:45,075 --> 00:49:46,776
Then one day...

801
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:51,346
you'd be grateful toward me for it, just like your brother.

802
00:49:53,716 --> 00:49:54,816
It looks like...

803
00:49:58,216 --> 00:49:59,756
you're different from him.

804
00:50:01,825 --> 00:50:05,395
I just hope you understand I didn't want you...

805
00:50:07,596 --> 00:50:09,066
to not be happy.

806
00:50:16,605 --> 00:50:18,035
I don't know...

807
00:50:19,236 --> 00:50:21,105
how I'm to face her now.

808
00:50:44,466 --> 00:50:46,705
Should I have stopped him from going home?

809
00:50:47,966 --> 00:50:50,276
I hope he didn't take her on with liquid courage.

810
00:50:54,006 --> 00:50:55,676
(Seo Ju Won)

811
00:51:00,216 --> 00:51:02,846
Hey. Was everything okay last night?

812
00:51:03,086 --> 00:51:04,256
What do you mean?

813
00:51:04,486 --> 00:51:07,355
You were pretty dead drunk.

814
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:10,825
You didn't retaliate or headbutt...

815
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:12,555
your mother, I hope.

816
00:51:13,895 --> 00:51:14,926
I didn't.

817
00:51:15,225 --> 00:51:17,096
You pleaded with me not to.

818
00:51:18,895 --> 00:51:20,836
- Yoon Seo. - Yes?

819
00:51:22,336 --> 00:51:23,336
Never mind.

820
00:51:24,176 --> 00:51:25,605
What is it? Tell me.

821
00:51:26,035 --> 00:51:29,046
I wanted to hold back in case I was being hasty,

822
00:51:29,745 --> 00:51:31,846
but it's good news and I couldn't wait to tell you.

823
00:51:32,546 --> 00:51:34,145
What is it? Talk to me.

824
00:51:35,285 --> 00:51:36,346
I think my mother...

825
00:51:37,915 --> 00:51:39,285
opened up.

826
00:51:41,986 --> 00:51:43,026
What?

827
00:52:03,346 --> 00:52:04,346
Good morning.

828
00:52:04,745 --> 00:52:05,776
I don't know...

829
00:52:06,346 --> 00:52:08,116
if it's a good morning.

830
00:52:32,906 --> 00:52:34,506
I brewed too much.

831
00:52:34,946 --> 00:52:36,346
I don't want to waste coffee grinds.

832
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:39,075
This coffee will taste...

833
00:52:39,176 --> 00:52:42,616
as bitter as the memories of your first love.

834
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:44,316
Enjoy.

835
00:52:45,515 --> 00:52:46,555
Mi Jin.

836
00:52:58,665 --> 00:53:00,366
I'll call you by your name now.

837
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:01,935
Can't I?

838
00:53:04,475 --> 00:53:06,675
You can do whatever you want.

839
00:53:06,676 --> 00:53:08,575
Why did you call me anyway?

840
00:53:08,745 --> 00:53:09,776
Shall we date?

841
00:53:12,176 --> 00:53:13,276
Goodness.

842
00:53:14,446 --> 00:53:16,285
How can we date when we're married?

843
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:19,855
I don't know how the order got this jumbled up,

844
00:53:20,955 --> 00:53:23,854
but we skipped dating and proposing to get married,

845
00:53:23,855 --> 00:53:24,926
and I'm confused.

846
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:28,466
I don't know what we can or can't do.

847
00:53:32,665 --> 00:53:33,765
To be honest,

848
00:53:34,165 --> 00:53:35,605
I felt jealous yesterday.

849
00:53:36,805 --> 00:53:37,836
You were jealous?

850
00:53:38,276 --> 00:53:41,176
I hated seeing your first love in person.

851
00:53:41,805 --> 00:53:43,846
That's why I acted so childishly.

852
00:53:44,816 --> 00:53:45,816
I'm sorry.

853
00:53:47,586 --> 00:53:48,716
Okay.

854
00:53:50,386 --> 00:53:52,855
Well, so, that guy...

855
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:55,386
was a kindergarten friend.

856
00:53:56,796 --> 00:53:59,026
- What? - He came to our wedding,

857
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:00,394
so I thought you'd recognize him.

858
00:54:00,395 --> 00:54:01,895
When you didn't,

859
00:54:02,566 --> 00:54:05,096
I lied about who he was to win the argument.

860
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:07,705
I was jealous too.

861
00:54:10,776 --> 00:54:13,006
Right? You were jealous, right?

862
00:54:13,105 --> 00:54:14,846
You like me too, don't you?

863
00:54:19,276 --> 00:54:22,015
I was embarrassed when you didn't say anything...

864
00:54:22,116 --> 00:54:24,455
when I told you I liked you when we were at the market.

865
00:54:25,486 --> 00:54:26,555
Have you really...

866
00:54:27,825 --> 00:54:30,696
grown to like me too?

867
00:54:32,855 --> 00:54:33,895
I have.

868
00:54:36,966 --> 00:54:38,366
Then can we...

869
00:54:39,636 --> 00:54:42,966
link arms in public and hold hands?

870
00:54:44,236 --> 00:54:45,236
Yes.

871
00:54:45,605 --> 00:54:49,006
As family, roommates, and business partners,

872
00:54:49,205 --> 00:54:52,645
we agreed to call, text, or DM each other once a day.

873
00:54:53,716 --> 00:54:56,645
Can I break that rule and contact you whenever I want?

874
00:54:57,455 --> 00:54:58,486
Yes.

875
00:55:17,475 --> 00:55:18,535
What about that, then?

876
00:55:20,406 --> 00:55:21,475
In the morning?

877
00:55:22,546 --> 00:55:24,816
Then how about at night?

878
00:56:04,055 --> 00:56:05,156
Why won't she pick up?

879
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,026
Why are you here out of the blue?

880
00:56:12,426 --> 00:56:14,466
I came to get you since I'm jobless now.

881
00:56:14,796 --> 00:56:17,566
I'd always wanted to pick up my boyfriend from work.

882
00:56:18,136 --> 00:56:20,935
We'll be late. Help me move the stuff from my car.

883
00:56:21,105 --> 00:56:22,105
What?

884
00:56:22,106 --> 00:56:23,974
I'd also wanted to go somewhere randomly,

885
00:56:23,975 --> 00:56:25,875
so I packed some camping gear.

886
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:27,375
For real?

887
00:56:28,906 --> 00:56:30,546
I even brought you clothes.

888
00:56:34,116 --> 00:56:35,116
Thank you.

889
00:56:43,156 --> 00:56:45,696
I'll unpack. You go and get changed first.

890
00:57:10,355 --> 00:57:11,816
Shall we have soju and beer?

891
00:57:12,386 --> 00:57:13,386
Shall we?

892
00:57:17,596 --> 00:57:18,596
Is it hot?

893
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:29,736
Cheers.

894
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:52,756
You brought sweet potatoes too? You're a genius.

895
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:54,795
You bet.

896
00:57:54,796 --> 00:57:57,296
AL CARD lost out when they let me go.

897
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:03,305
Still, I'm relieved the chairwoman...

898
00:58:03,736 --> 00:58:06,605
seemed to open up a little.

899
00:58:10,276 --> 00:58:13,586
To be honest, I was annoyed.

900
00:58:15,886 --> 00:58:17,855
I knew I'd leave because I'd resigned,

901
00:58:18,816 --> 00:58:20,116
but if felt like I'd been dismissed.

902
00:58:21,426 --> 00:58:22,756
I had mixed feelings.

903
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,156
But...

904
00:58:25,895 --> 00:58:27,596
after your call this morning,

905
00:58:28,265 --> 00:58:31,665
I was so pleased I forgot all about that.

906
00:58:35,006 --> 00:58:36,006
I'm sorry.

907
00:58:37,575 --> 00:58:40,035
And thank you.

908
00:58:43,716 --> 00:58:44,946
Skip the apology.

909
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,785
Just say thank-you from now on.

910
00:58:50,316 --> 00:58:51,386
Honey.

911
00:58:52,116 --> 00:58:54,185
I think I burned my hand a bit...

912
00:58:54,825 --> 00:58:57,355
while putting the sweet potatoes in the fire. It hurts.

913
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:59,526
- Really? Let me see. - Yes.

914
00:59:22,745 --> 00:59:23,855
I love you.

915
00:59:28,486 --> 00:59:29,656
Let's get married.

916
01:00:27,245 --> 01:00:29,886
You must've been flustered that I asked to see you.

917
01:00:30,816 --> 01:00:31,816
So...

918
01:00:33,285 --> 01:00:34,825
I'll get to the point.

919
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:38,995
Your marriage to Ju Won.

920
01:00:39,725 --> 01:00:40,926
I'll allow it.

921
01:00:41,966 --> 01:00:44,165
But there's a condition.

922
01:00:45,196 --> 01:00:46,395
I want you...

923
01:00:46,495 --> 01:00:49,066
to run our scholarship foundation.

924
01:00:50,975 --> 01:00:52,305
Your scholarship foundation?

925
01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:56,305
Wouldn't it seem more sincere if you were to run the foundation...

926
01:00:58,415 --> 01:01:00,316
considering your unfortunate upbringing?

927
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:04,716
A Cinderella who married a rich heir...

928
01:01:04,886 --> 01:01:07,125
runs a scholarship foundation to help people...

929
01:01:07,355 --> 01:01:09,725
in similar circumstances as hers.

930
01:01:12,495 --> 01:01:13,555
I need...

931
01:01:14,566 --> 01:01:16,265
a fairy tale like that.

932
01:01:24,636 --> 01:01:25,705
Live like...

933
01:01:26,836 --> 01:01:28,346
a true Cinderella.

934
01:02:02,046 --> 01:02:06,375
(Cinderella at 2AM)

935
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:08,385
Let's go public with your past...

936
01:02:08,386 --> 01:02:09,816
and plan the wedding.

937
01:02:11,015 --> 01:02:12,515
Is this why you got back with my sister?

938
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:14,854
To sell our story and use it?

939
01:02:14,855 --> 01:02:17,995
Is my sister's painful past just a business opportunity to you?

940
01:02:18,096 --> 01:02:20,995
Did Mother really make that kind of offer?

941
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:23,196
How rude of her.

942
01:02:23,296 --> 01:02:24,434
Why are you always so understanding?

943
01:02:24,435 --> 01:02:26,065
You looked precarious.

944
01:02:26,066 --> 01:02:27,906
Like someone by the edge of a cliff.

945
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,906
The necklace. That's beautiful.

946
01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:31,176
You don't know?

947
01:02:31,336 --> 01:02:32,375
I feel a chill.

948
01:02:32,535 --> 01:02:34,906
It must be a necklace I should know about.

949
01:02:35,546 --> 01:02:36,605
It's possible...

950
01:02:37,316 --> 01:02:40,546
for reality to be more loving than a fairy tale.
