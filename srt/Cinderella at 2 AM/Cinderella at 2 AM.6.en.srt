(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

12
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,259
You left your car by the Han River.

13
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,658
I'll drive you.

14
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:58,799
Let's talk on the way.

15
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,399
Okay.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,810
I'm sorry, but she was talking to me.

17
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,109
Don't you want to know how I knew who you were?

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,250
I'll explain. Let's go and eat.

19
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,920
Let's go to the Han River.

20
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,319
Let's go eat.

21
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,158
- The Han River. - Let's eat.

22
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,128
- The Han River. - Let's eat.

23
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,329
- Let's eat the Han River. - What?

24
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,799
I mixed up the two sentences.

25
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:42,269
Eat the Han River on your own.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,180
Let's go and eat.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,349
I'll hear your explanation another time.

28
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,049
Let's go. I have something to say.

29
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,949
What are you doing?

30
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,349
Give me a ride too.

31
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:29,219
You're going to the Han River. I'm heading that way.

32
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,289
What way is that way?

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,689
You don't know where my car is parked.

34
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:35,090
It'll be somewhere on earth.

35
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,300
Seoul's not as big as you think.

36
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,330
Somewhere close to Yongsan works for me.

37
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,139
Director. You should get going.

38
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,240
My gosh.

39
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,330
(The director)

40
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,138
(The director's your ex?)

41
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,149
(The director's your ex?)

42
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,150
Is he?

43
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:29,949
Erase it right now.

44
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,819
(The director's your ex?)

45
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:42,659
So...

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,199
how did you get to know each other?

47
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,529
Oh, well,

48
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,939
how should I explain?

49
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,968
We got close by texting each other.

50
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,869
You can't say we got close.

51
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,110
You texted me by mistake.

52
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,710
Exactly.

53
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,050
I texted her thinking she was someone I knew.

54
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,979
Was it because the texts were wistful?

55
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,750
Ms. Ha mistakenly thought they were from her ex.

56
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,360
Did you say your heart sank as if you'd gotten a red alert?

57
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:11,860
What are you doing?

58
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,860
Don't you think this is wrong when we decided to break up?

59
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,430
You two.

60
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,100
You seem pretty close for people who got phone numbers mixed up.

61
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,439
We are emotionally closer than you'd think.

62
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,378
Is it because we texted and talked a lot?

63
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,009
That was a one-sided...

64
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,310
Forget it.

65
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,419
How did you know I was Ha Yoon Seo who works at AL Group?

66
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,089
I happened to find out by chance.

67
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,220
AL Hanok Stay's opening exhibition?

68
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,829
I get that you're in a bind,

69
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,990
but you need a fill-in.

70
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,959
You know you were our first pick.

71
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,429
Let's meet and I'll explain in person.

72
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,838
No. I have the proposal you sent last time.

73
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,199
I'll read that and get back to you.

74
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,269
(Ha Yoon Seo)

75
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:13,019
(Ha Yoon Seo, Jae Hee)

76
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:17,688
I thought it would be a fun project with a fun acquaintance,

77
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:19,060
so I accepted right away.

78
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,189
I don't care much about destiny,

79
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,399
but I almost believed it this time.

80
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,000
Drop me off at the subway station. That would be faster.

81
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,938
(Saebit Station)

82
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,839
I'll be in touch, Ms. Ha.

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,449
Save my number.

84
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,560
I asked you to drop me off back there.

85
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,970
There was a lot of traffic.

86
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,699
It's just a few steps. You can walk.

87
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:05,699
The street was empty...

88
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,879
Okay. See you next time.

89
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,008
What's going on? Is this...

90
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,378
You've been working here for a while and you call this a report?

91
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,319
- Do it over. - Okay.

92
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,349
- Oh, and Ju Won. - Yes?

93
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,060
Get me a latte.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,129
Sure thing.

95
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:36,199
Did you see how I got revenge?

96
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,139
I waited for three seconds before answering Mr. Bae.

97
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,338
Did you? What a cruel way to get revenge.

98
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,509
He picked on me a few days ago,

99
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,579
so I drove 30m by the subway station he asked me to stop at.

100
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,129
You must be tired. Can you drive?

101
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:08,629
Yes.

102
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,539
Was that your timid way of getting revenge?

103
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,569
What?

104
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,740
It wasn't.

105
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:20,579
I think...

106
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,879
Mr. Lee teased us a bit knowing we used to date.

107
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,889
He's just an odd character. Don't mind him too much.

108
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:32,420
I have to mind anyone who shows interest in you.

109
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,329
Why would you call that interest?

110
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,600
It's not that.

111
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:39,829
Can't you report his number as spam?

112
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:41,999
Why would you say that?

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,698
The exhibition opens on Monday...

114
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,138
and we have tons to discuss.

115
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,739
Why do you work so hard when you said you'd quit?

116
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,740
You said yesterday...

117
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:50,839
that you were disappointed by how irresponsible I was.

118
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,750
I wasn't disappointed.

119
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,449
I was jealous.

120
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,290
I hadn't sorted out my emotions yet,

121
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,220
but you went on a blind date...

122
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:07,258
and was going out to eat right after an all-night shift.

123
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,660
That makes me look like a fool.

124
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,229
Mr. Lee just followed me outside,

125
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,430
and the blind date...

126
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,439
I met him because he was a headhunter...

127
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,639
and I wanted to switch jobs.

128
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:21,069
What?

129
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,310
I showed him my resume not knowing it was a blind date.

130
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,050
What?

131
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,519
My goodness.

132
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,490
I had such a stressful day.

133
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,089
And you were so cold...

134
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,389
and you upset me.

135
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,190
Were you upset?

136
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,360
Because I turned cold?

137
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,029
To be honest, it wasn't nice.

138
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,509
Goodness.

139
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,820
But then,

140
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,049
even I don't know how I feel.

141
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:11,519
I thought I wouldn't mind if you disliked me,

142
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,929
but it was frustrating to be misunderstood.

143
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,360
We're going to break up,

144
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,029
but I didn't like how cold you were.

145
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,970
But...

146
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,600
we can't do this.

147
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,240
Why can't we do this?

148
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,679
We can't keep going on...

149
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,549
with longing and regret,

150
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,419
failing to get over each other.

151
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,539
I'll keep doing this.

152
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,240
Failing to get over you.

153
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,940
Like right now.

154
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,019
You said before...

155
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,279
that you could...

156
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,289
live just fine without love.

157
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,620
But I...

158
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,330
don't want to live like that without you.

159
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,639
Can't you come back to me?

160
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,758
What number time is this?

161
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,628
We broke up so many times I memorized the pattern.

162
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,668
Are you singing in repeat?

163
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,599
Why are we always at square one?

164
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,509
I must be out of my mind because I didn't get any sleep.

165
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,878
Let's call it a day. Now go home.

166
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,039
Go on home.

167
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,220
(Coupon)

168
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:26,819
Did you get home safely?

169
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,528
I'll visit AL Card on Monday.

170
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,190
How about fried chicken for dinner?

171
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,330
I'm fascinated that we met like this.

172
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,029
It feels like it's meant to be.

173
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,939
It's fascinating but I'm not sure if it's good or bad karma.

174
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,509
Don't make any comments about me and the director.

175
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,509
I almost took the bait.

176
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,279
Get a grip, Ha Yoon Seo.

177
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,990
This guy is no longer that psycho.

178
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,460
He's an artist I must work with.

179
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
An artist.

180
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,500
(Artist Lee Sung Min)

181
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
What happened?

182
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:15,769
How dare you stay out all night?

183
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,939
I texted you to say we had an emergency...

184
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,779
and would work all night.

185
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,679
Get out of the way.

186
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,720
Do you mean that? You weren't with Wimp, were you?

187
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,990
I worried about you all night.

188
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,558
I heard that Wimp had left home.

189
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,559
I thought you eloped or something.

190
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,659
As if we'd elope.

191
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,899
Get out unless you want a nosebleed.

192
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,969
Yoon Seo. You need to be strong.

193
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,899
I watched lots of crazy dramas.

194
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,809
You don't want to marry into a family of mad in-laws.

195
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,239
Are you bragging about watching dramas...

196
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,639
instead of studying when you're a high-school senior?

197
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,820
Yoon Seo.

198
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,250
Did Wimp not go home yet?

199
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,590
- What? - If he’s moved out,

200
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,990
is he just out and about all day?

201
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,330
I don't know.

202
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,258
Look at you.

203
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,399
You look worried. You still care about him.

204
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,769
Get lost.

205
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,500
Out.

206
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,769
Darn you.

207
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,580
Who is it?

208
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,450
It's me. Open the door.

209
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,450
Si Won?

210
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,259
What are you doing here?

211
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,230
Is this where you're staying?

212
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:22,100
What? Well, yes.

213
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,070
Take this.

214
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,340
Instead of staying at a hotel, pick one of those apartments.

215
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,678
No. I'll take care of myself.

216
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,480
What can you take care of?

217
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,048
Do you know people are talking about you moving out?

218
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,849
They think you're no longer in line...

219
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,549
to inherit part of the company.

220
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,189
- What? - If you like her that much,

221
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,949
win Yoon Seo back.

222
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,019
But...

223
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,159
if you haven't managed so far, it means she won't take you back.

224
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,629
Give up on what you can't do and go back to where you belong.

225
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,899
Mother asked me to give that to you.

226
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,740
It looks like it means she wants you back, not gone.

227
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,699
Hello.

228
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,100
- Hello. - Mr. Lee.

229
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:31,470
Hello, Mr. Lee.

230
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,999
Have you heard, Mr. Lee?

231
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,909
People crowded the gallery as soon as the exhibition opened.

232
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:40,509
I expect that much.

233
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,179
I'm pretty popular.

234
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,480
You sure are popular.

235
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,219
I thought we were in so much trouble on Friday.

236
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,120
I guess we can say a misfortune turned into a blessing.

237
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:54,590
I don't know how to make it up to you.

238
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:58,399
Thank you again for making a tough decision to help us out.

239
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,529
Instead of just talking about it,

240
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,299
how about we have chicken and beer?

241
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,798
- What? - Yes?

242
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,038
Chicken and beer isn't good enough.

243
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,668
You can have something more expensive.

244
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,639
On AL Card's dime.

245
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,110
Will you treat him to a decent meal today?

246
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:18,179
Well, of course.

247
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,029
Do come inside. The contract's ready.

248
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,230
Okay.

249
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,830
- This is for you. - Thank you.

250
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,779
Yes.

251
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,340
Let's not let my emotions ruin a business deal.

252
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,220
(Artist and Gallery Contract)

253
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,850
Let's move ahead with the deal.

254
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,089
Don't you need another look?

255
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,659
I read it for long enough.

256
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:01,059
You know I studied law.

257
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,929
Didn't we meet a few times at university?

258
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,729
You were famous for being a third-generation conglomerate,

259
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,299
and I was famous for my looks.

260
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,829
I too was famous for...

261
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
We'll go over the contract again before signing and sending it over.

262
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,779
I'll see you at dinner tonight.

263
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,779
You attend team dinners?

264
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,449
What does that mean?

265
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,220
I'm just wondering...

266
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,759
if it's to treat me or to keep me in check.

267
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,160
Don't get me wrong.

268
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,558
You're Ms. Ha's red alert.

269
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,759
Her ex.

270
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,328
I wondered...

271
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:42,769
if you were over her.

272
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:46,769
Why do you want to know that?

273
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,940
Why do you think...

274
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,609
I want to know?

275
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,940
Hi.

276
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,099
Right now?

277
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,609
A sudden meeting was scheduled to discuss the General Cars' MOU.

278
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,979
The client happened to be in Korea,

279
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,650
and can meet with us on Jeju Island.

280
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,078
Are we leaving in an hour?

281
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,079
Yes.

282
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,359
Right now?

283
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,730
I'll be there.

284
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:54,240
I apologize. Something urgent came up.

285
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,109
I'm interested.

286
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:03,150
Should I call it curiosity?

287
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:09,119
I don't know how honest I can be to her ex.

288
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,930
She seems cold, but she's interesting.

289
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,190
And I'm grateful to her for something.

290
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Mr. Lee.

291
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,900
I happened to read the texts you'd sent to your ex-girlfriend.

292
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,170
It looked like you broke up recently yourself.

293
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:30,569
How can you move on so easily?

294
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,309
Those texts weren't for my ex-girlfriend.

295
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,910
I haven't dated in a long time.

296
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:37,650
I see.

297
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,950
Ms. Ha could've gotten the same idea too.

298
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:42,890
I should explain it to her.

299
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,589
- Seo Ju Won. - What?

300
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,259
Didn't you hear what I said yesterday?

301
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,460
Don't cling to what is over and focus on work.

302
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,799
Okay.

303
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,369
(Monhyeon-ro)

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,170
- It's a pleasure to meet you. - It's a pleasure.

305
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,348
Where's the director? He said he'd be here.

306
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:16,490
He went to Jeju Island on urgent business.

307
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:17,819
Oh, I see.

308
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,259
That's perfect.

309
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,230
Why are you staring at me like that?

310
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,439
You look like you should be...

311
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,838
an actor and not an artist.

312
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,778
Instead of drawing landscapes,

313
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:41,849
why don't you paint a self-portrait?

314
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,609
That's a bit much.

315
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:47,449
The thing is, however hard I try,

316
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,849
I don't think I'll be able to do my face justice.

317
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,519
You're right.

318
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,829
That's so right.

319
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,588
- Mr. Lee. - Yes?

320
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,460
This might be the last time we get to eat together.

321
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,629
Can we take a photo?

322
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,130
Yes, sure. Sounds good.

323
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,239
- Yes. - Me too.

324
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Okay.

325
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:09,470
Let's see.

326
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,180
Ms. Ha, join us. It's a rare opportunity.

327
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,450
No, thanks.

328
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,549
Let's not take a photo if we won't all be in it.

329
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:20,848
Ms. Ha!

330
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:22,750
What's wrong with you?

331
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,288
- Lean in. - Are you ready?

332
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,690
Here goes. One, two, three.

333
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,529
- Shall I take one? - Yes, sure.

334
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,970
- Get into the frame. - Okay.

335
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,039
Ms. Ha, look at the camera.

336
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,640
One, two, three.

337
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,380
I will be delighted to meet at our next meeting.

338
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:52,049
Thank you. Bye.

339
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,659
Good job.

340
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,099
- Yes. You too. - Yes.

341
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,500
(Group chat)

342
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:22,749
- Mr. Kim. - Yes?

343
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,808
What time is our flight?

344
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,380
It's in two hours at 9pm.

345
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:26,950
Two hours from now...

346
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,490
Three hours to Gimpo and four to Gangnam.

347
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,190
No.

348
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,829
No what?

349
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:37,730
What's this photo?

350
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:39,930
Actually,

351
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,469
someone's showing interest in Yoon Seo.

352
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,470
What?

353
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,039
Let me see that.

354
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,969
Isn't this Lee Sung Min?

355
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,240
You asked me to get his number to sign a business deal.

356
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,680
Did sparks fly in just a few days?

357
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,949
- So soon? - There are no sparks.

358
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,880
- They're at a team dinner. - What?

359
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,919
Oh, you said you had an acquaintance who was close to Lee Sung Min.

360
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,548
- Yes. - Did you hear anything?

361
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,119
What kind of person he is and so on.

362
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,960
I do know some things about him.

363
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:09,229
He comes from a family of politicians.

364
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,460
His parents had set everything up for him to get into politics too,

365
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,159
but he gave up on his secure future...

366
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,028
and suddenly announced he'd become an artist,

367
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:16,269
so his family went bonkers.

368
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,039
Then he said he'd estrange himself from his family and moved out...

369
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,470
He's just like you.

370
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,548
No. He eventually ditched his family and became an artist,

371
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,210
so shall I say he's even more stubborn than you?

372
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,180
My gosh. It won't be an easy fight.

373
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,990
Forget it. Let's go.

374
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,740
Hey. Isn't Yoon Seo so pretty?

375
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,740
Here, look.

376
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,309
Yes, she is pretty.

377
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:03,849
My goodness.

378
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,348
I thought you didn't like theatres because they were dark and stuffy.

379
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:08,389
But I've been watching movies often lately with Yoon Seo,

380
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,518
and it was all right.

381
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,789
Yoon Seo is acting a bit weird.

382
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,289
Do you think I upset her?

383
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,929
I knew you'd try to keep Yoon Seo by your side,

384
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,599
but I didn't know you'd even refuse to go abroad.

385
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,630
Ju Won did really love her.

386
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,609
Ju Won!

387
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,750
What is it?

388
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,049
I'll help you.

389
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:46,160
If I don't understand how you feel, who will?

390
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,160
Hey, what's with you? People are looking at us.

391
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,960
Listen to me carefully, Ju Won.

392
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,200
I will...

393
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,230
fulfil Mother's expectations since I'm the eldest son.

394
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,240
So, promise me that you will live the kind of life you want.

395
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,308
- Mr. Kim. - Yes, sir.

396
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:06,609
We need the helicopter.

397
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:07,809
The helicopter?

398
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,808
The helicopter? Why, all of a sudden?

399
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,009
Fly there now.

400
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,549
Fly there now and make your dreams come true.

401
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:14,450
Go and join the team dinner right now...

402
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,720
and make her yours.

403
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,559
Can I really do that?

404
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,848
Nice! Let's do this!

405
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:44,710
Okay. Here comes the propeller!

406
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,190
- Cheers! Bottoms up! - Bottoms up!

407
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,489
Nice, bottoms up!

408
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,129
She didn't finish her drink. That's not good.

409
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,159
- Finish it. - Drink up!

410
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,029
How much longer will you make me do this shoulder dance?

411
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,069
- Drink up. Bottoms up! - All right, another one.

412
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,069
- Cheers! - Cheers!

413
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,518
Why don't we call it a night?

414
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,848
Mr. Lee has to go to Yeosu tomorrow...

415
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,618
for the artist talk event.

416
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:23,819
He's already had many drinks.

417
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,358
Well, not too many.

418
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,589
Oh, come on.

419
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:32,930
See? Mr. Lee says he can drink more. Why are you being like this?

420
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,298
Listen. We're putting this on the company credit card,

421
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:39,200
so I ordered more meat and booze when I went to the restroom earlier.

422
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,039
I also ordered four bowls of doenjang rice.

423
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,108
Oh, that must be it.

424
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:46,210
Come on in, my doenjang rice!

425
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,180
I'm going to feast today. Don't stop me!

426
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,799
My gosh! Director Seo. Please have a seat here.

427
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,319
I'm sorry I'm late.

428
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,490
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

429
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,190
Why would I wait for you when I didn't even know you were coming?

430
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:36,529
Well, I thought you went to Jeju Island. Am I wrong?

431
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,358
Oh, Mr. Bae kept calling me nonstop,

432
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,029
so I had no choice but to come here.

433
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,170
Me?

434
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:49,008
Yes! That's right. Of course.

435
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:51,640
This team dinner is so important.

436
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,048
Not having Director Seo here makes no sense,

437
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,910
so I kept calling him like crazy.

438
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,518
I went out of my way to come here to help build teamwork.

439
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,589
Let's eat.

440
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,720
I'm sorry we made you go out of your way, but I'm glad you came.

441
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,390
My, this looks delicious. Ms. Ha, try this.

442
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:11,059
Thank you.

443
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,799
I was in a meeting and didn't have time to eat dinner.

444
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,630
This looks delicious.

445
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:20,069
Gosh, it's hot.

446
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,679
Yes, I did it.

447
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,049
Nice! I managed to get a reservation.

448
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:35,450
This bar is very popular. Let's go for another round, okay?

449
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,890
What? Director Seo, what are you doing here?

450
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,559
Oh, the thing is...

451
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,359
I called him a bunch of times, so he came here to join us.

452
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,129
I see.

453
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,328
I'm sorry, but I should call it a night.

454
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,730
What? Why?

455
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,369
Oh, I guess you're uncomfortable because of Director Seo.

456
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,809
Come on. A team dinner is part of work.

457
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,339
I get that you two broke up,

458
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,980
but you should separate your emotions from work...

459
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,990
Fine, let's go.

460
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,190
Come on, let's go.

461
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:13,359
- Nice! Let's go and drink more! - Okay, let's go.

462
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,459
I'm telling you. This bar is super popular.

463
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,259
(Mother)

464
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,868
Yes, Mother.

465
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:29,039
Yes, I think the collaboration will go well without any issues.

466
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,839
I see. Well done. Good.

467
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,250
And what's going on with Ju Won?

468
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,318
- Ju Won? - I told you to help...

469
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,950
and guide him as his older brother so he wouldn't feel lost anymore.

470
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,420
He stormed out because he was angry in that moment...

471
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,758
and couldn't come home because of his pride. It must be hard for him.

472
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,190
Well, I'm not sure about that.

473
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,799
In my opinion, he's not back yet because he doesn't want to go home.

474
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,130
What?

475
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,309
Even if that's the case... Like I said,

476
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,909
you should comfort him and persuade him to...

477
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,309
Gosh, Mother. As if he will be persuaded.

478
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:11,449
For now, we should just wait until he pulls himself together.

479
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,849
That's the best thing we can do now.

480
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,149
Mother, I'm not wearing anything now.

481
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,348
I'll catch a cold.

482
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,960
I'll call you later. Bye.

483
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:20,119
Hey...

484
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
My gosh.

485
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,859
These brats.

486
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:34,470
The eldest son carrying the weight of the family's expectations.

487
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,809
That's me, Seo Si Won.

488
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:38,940
Very cool.

489
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,549
Anyway, I wonder if he arrived at the team dinner without any issues.

490
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,150
I hope the traffic wasn't bad.

491
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,669
No, don't get the wrong idea.

492
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:07,239
No! Stay back. Don't come any closer.

493
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,440
I'm leaving.

494
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:30,990
I thought you'd be home late because you went to Jeju Island.

495
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,758
Well, yes. But my schedule changed a bit,

496
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,430
so I took the helicopter to return earlier.

497
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:42,210
Hey, about that just now. I didn't do that to show you.

498
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,969
I never closed the door while living by myself,

499
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,839
so I did it without thinking, purely out of habit.

500
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,619
I'm just saying I'll be careful from now on.

501
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,390
Okay. Let's both be careful now that we live together.

502
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,460
Okay.

503
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,319
I'm sorry for screaming like that earlier.

504
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,460
I saw nothing but skin when I opened the door.

505
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,299
I was just so surprised.

506
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,339
Hey, those pills...

507
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:17,210
Are they supposed to calm you down?

508
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,710
Then can I take one too?

509
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,210
To be honest, I was really startled earlier.

510
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,809
These are sleeping pills.

511
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,279
Oh, they're sleeping pills.

512
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,119
I guess you're so shocked that you can't even fall asleep.

513
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,490
It wasn't that impactful.

514
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:34,059
I always have a hard time sleeping.

515
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,259
I see.

516
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,730
I'll add it to the rules we must follow from now on.

517
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,630
"No nudity allowed." I'll write it down.

518
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:44,569
- Okay? - Yes, for sure. Sounds good.

519
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:01,650
Come on down. Hurry.

520
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,049
Mr. Lee, it's here.

521
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,358
This place is awesome. It's your first time here, right?

522
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,289
- No, I've been here before. - Oh, really?

523
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,089
- When did you come here? - Wait.

524
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:12,899
Director Seo, are you sure I called you?

525
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,900
I don't see your name in my recent call history.

526
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,670
Be honest. You came because you still have feelings for her,

527
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,569
because you wanted to have a drink with Ms. Ha.

528
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,279
I'm sorry. Gosh, sorry for being nosy.

529
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,680
Hey, Ye Young! Wait up.

530
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,259
Seriously, why are you doing this?

531
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,659
What?

532
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,230
You said it bothered you. That's why you're here.

533
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,298
It's not like Mr. Lee likes me.

534
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,669
Why did you come all the way here from Jeju Island?

535
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,368
Why are you overreacting like this? Just why?

536
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:54,869
Do you think I'm being like this for no reason?

537
00:33:57,339 --> 00:33:58,369
What?

538
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,250
You two, aren't you coming?

539
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:06,420
Are you back together?

540
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,049
Get back together!

541
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,249
I hope you two get back together!

542
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,288
I'm sorry.

543
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,419
Kiss! Go ahead and kiss!

544
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,960
Kiss!

545
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,260
Let's go inside.

546
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,829
And I think you know...

547
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,230
that I'd never do something like this for no reason.

548
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,539
Oh, my.

549
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,309
Seriously, this place is so cool.

550
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,379
Right? Aren't you glad I brought you here?

551
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,579
Yes, totally.

552
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,650
All right. What shall we drink?

553
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,860
Cocktails? Whiskey?

554
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,090
- Whiskey. - Let's have whiskey.

555
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,159
Oh, I guess you both like whiskey.

556
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:53,000
You two are very similar.

557
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:57,268
Then as for food, between gambas and a cheese plate...

558
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,469
- A cheese plate. - A cheese plate.

559
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:04,010
- They chose the same thing again. - Yes.

560
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:07,279
Goodness. You two should never go on a blind date together.

561
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,980
You'd choose the same girl.

562
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:15,118
Well, on my way to the ladies' room,

563
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,519
I'll order whiskey and a cheese plate for us.

564
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,889
- No, I'll go. - No, I'll go.

565
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,269
Well, I'll just go.

566
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,239
Excuse me for a moment.

567
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,230
My gosh, Director Seo.

568
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,429
Why are you drinking so fast? Here, try this.

569
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,969
Slow down, okay?

570
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,969
Why? They say latecomers must down three drinks when they arrive.

571
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,840
He was late but didn't do it.

572
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:11,409
I'll do it now.

573
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,340
I'll down three drinks.

574
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,400
Oh, my. Applause.

575
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:37,769
Director Seo is a man of his word.

576
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,670
Come on. He only had three glasses of whiskey.

577
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,809
Anyone can do it.

578
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,678
Then why don't you go ahead and do it too?

579
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,110
Sure, why not?

580
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,969
By the way...

581
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:16,409
Mr. Lee, do you not have a girlfriend?

582
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:19,539
No. I've been single for a long time.

583
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,179
It's been over three years.

584
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,920
Someone thinks that I recently went through a breakup.

585
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:31,250
Anyway, I've been single for a long time.

586
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,658
My gosh, I see.

587
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,960
Then may I ask you what your type is?

588
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,130
Well, my type is...

589
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:43,000
someone who's cold but funny at the same time.

590
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:45,170
Someone who's charismatic and silly.

591
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,399
Someone who has to work hard to make ends meet...

592
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,940
and does her very best every day.

593
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:51,670
Someone beautiful like that.

594
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,920
I must do whatever it takes to call it a night.

595
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,789
All right. Why don't we call it a night and go home?

596
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,789
Come on. We should finish this, at least.

597
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,199
Director Seo, you should go home if you're tired.

598
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:14,699
Me?

599
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:17,098
You look tired. You should go home.

600
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,529
I look tired?

601
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,969
Are you sure you're not exhausted?

602
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,340
I can finish this by myself.

603
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:27,110
That night was really weird.

604
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,010
Ju Won is normally polite to everyone,

605
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,780
but he kept losing his cool in front of this man.

606
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,719
I can finish this by myself and have another bottle.

607
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,820
This weirdo who appeared in front of us out of nowhere...

608
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,260
kept provoking us.

609
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:46,900
I can finish this by myself and have two more bottles.

610
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:49,570
I can have three more.

611
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,368
I can have four more.

612
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:52,840
I can easily have five more...

613
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,019
That's enough. You've all had enough to drink.

614
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,050
Once I finish this, we will all go home.

615
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,960
That night, for some strange reason,

616
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,429
I wanted to end the night and that situation as well.

617
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,630
- Oh, my. Amazing. - Nice.

618
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,869
One more bottle!

619
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,539
And eventually...

620
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:33,178
- Cheers! - Cheers!

621
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:36,050
- Cheers! - Cheers! Let's drink!

622
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:37,579
Nice.

623
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:41,118
He's a real man. Nice.

624
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,449
Excuse me. Give us another bottle.

625
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,090
Pour him another one!

626
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,360
Slow down.

627
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:49,829
Let's drink!

628
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,989
What's going on? What is this place?

629
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:30,230
Is this Lee Sung Min's studio?

630
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,400
Why am I here?

631
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:50,489
What is this? What on earth happened?

632
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,760
Gosh, be careful!

633
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

634
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,630
You know, I'm not such a lightweight.

635
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:05,469
But I got so drunk because I drank too quickly.

636
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,169
Oh, my. You are the prettiest woman I've ever seen.

637
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,639
Can you not forget me because I'm so pretty?

638
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,339
Am I that charming?

639
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,340
Of course, you are!

640
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:17,750
But aren't I a pretty good catch too?

641
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:21,619
I'm handsome, tall, rich, and young!

642
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,749
Why do you keep saying you want to break up with me?

643
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,388
I wish you were just adequately good-looking, tall,

644
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:29,888
- and well-off. - Oh, boy.

645
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:31,860
Why do you have to be so incredibly charming? Why?

646
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,928
Oh, dear. You're both way too charming.

647
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:35,159
What am I going to do with you guys?

648
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,840
Hey, charmers. You woke up.

649
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:51,510
Good morning!

650
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,250
It's so sunny here. What a nice place. Oh, my.

651
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:57,219
Yes, totally. My gosh.

652
00:41:57,449 --> 00:42:00,360
This is so comfortable. It's better than my bed.

653
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:01,960
It's amazing!

654
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:06,900
I guess you're embarrassed, seeing how you're talking nonsense.

655
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,429
Yes, I am embarrassed.

656
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,670
I'm so embarrassed!

657
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,739
Yes, I get it.

658
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:19,679
My gosh. Last night, you two went on a drunken rampage.

659
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:24,010
Well, so tell me. You two.

660
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,579
Why did you do that last night?

661
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,050
What? What did we do?

662
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:32,819
Last night, you guys made everyone so uncomfortable.

663
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,719
I tried to call it a night and ended up like this.

664
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,190
I mean, who does a drinking competition? It's so dumb.

665
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:40,999
Wouldn't it be nice if you two got along?

666
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,070
Why couldn't you just get along? Why did you have to cause this?

667
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,170
Why?

668
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:49,440
Are you saying this is our fault?

669
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,510
I'm sorry.

670
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:08,019
Anyway, do not cause another situation like this.

671
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:10,159
I'm off.

672
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,360
I'm hungover.

673
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:14,159
You're hungover?

674
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,429
Shall we have pizza? Let's have pizza and go to work together.

675
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,230
What? Who eats pizza when they're hungover?

676
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:23,070
How about some soybean sprout soup with rice?

677
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:28,440
I'm good. We'll all recover from the hangover on our own.

678
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,329
Well, thank you for your help.

679
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:52,429
Gosh.

680
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:55,639
Wait.

681
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:11,420
Yoon Seo.

682
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,360
Can we talk?

683
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,389
Can we talk later?

684
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,590
I have a headache now.

685
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,899
Is it a bad headache? Shall I give you a ride...

686
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,900
or pick up some medicine for you?

687
00:44:21,901 --> 00:44:23,900
No, it's not that bad.

688
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:25,429
I'll see you at work.

689
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,480
(Fresh)

690
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:37,380
- I'll settle up. - Sure, I can help you with that.

691
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,590
I'm sorry. I didn't bring my wallet.

692
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:51,489
I'll come back another time.

693
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,730
What?

694
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,269
Gosh.

695
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:02,400
Darn it.

696
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,710
Hey, charmer. Wait up.

697
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:10,849
Aren't you grateful that I showed up with your wallet?

698
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,509
Then let's go eat something for our hangover.

699
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,979
How about the gukbap we couldn't have that day?

700
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,618
I have to hurry home and go to work.

701
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,519
Just say that you have a meeting with me first.

702
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,059
Then can't you go to work later?

703
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:21,989
How about some gukbap and a drink to cure the hangover?

704
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,670
Why on earth are you doing this?

705
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:32,570
What did I do?

706
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,968
It might be funny to you that I can't get over my boyfriend...

707
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:39,309
and that I'm acting like a fool in the same space.

708
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,280
But it's not for me.

709
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,110
So, why do you keep making fun of someone else's pain?

710
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,119
I mean...

711
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:54,959
I was just glad to meet you like this.

712
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,389
I'm not glad.

713
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:58,590
I only want to meet you for work.

714
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,959
It's humiliating that you know who my ex-boyfriend is...

715
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,629
and how I feel on the inside.

716
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,800
When we were in the car and at the dinner yesterday,

717
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,599
you keep acting friendly with me and provoking him.

718
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,710
It feels like you're crossing the line, and it makes me angry.

719
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,179
You speak so coldly.

720
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,480
I have no reason to be warm to you.

721
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:23,019
So, stop teasing me in this way.

722
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,860
Even if you don't, I'm already suffering enough.

723
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,079
Yes?

724
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,379
You know I'm going to Paris today and coming back in a week, right?

725
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,050
Yes. You sent me your schedule via messenger app.

726
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:59,119
Yes. I'm leaving after breakfast. Let's eat together as a family.

727
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:01,659
Okay, then.

728
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,198
Two bunches of scallions and two sacks of rice.

729
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:15,469
Yes, that's right, sir. I'll wire the money right away.

730
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,909
Thank you, sir.

731
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:19,070
So, I'm not the owner.

732
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:21,639
My niece here is the owner.

733
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,749
I'm just a mere employee. And a very lowly...

734
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,110
Hey, Yoon Seo!

735
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,579
What? What's going on?

736
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:31,119
Why didn't you go to work and come here at this hour?

737
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,059
Yi Rae.

738
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:37,429
My stomach hurts so much.

739
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,760
What?

740
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,559
Did you leave home early...

741
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,530
or not go home at all?

742
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,500
- Go away. - Okay.

743
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,840
- Take your time and eat up. - I will.

744
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,150
What's going on?

745
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,119
Did you really drink all night and stay out?

746
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,779
Yes. I have to get going after I eat this.

747
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,489
Then why didn't you just get some soup near the office?

748
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:06,920
Just because.

749
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,159
I wanted to see you.

750
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,190
Gross.

751
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:16,630
What is going on?

752
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:23,769
It's just difficult.

753
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,510
What is?

754
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,139
Breaking up?

755
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:30,349
Yes.

756
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,920
I don't know how I feel.

757
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,449
I don't understand myself,

758
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:41,820
and it's so painful.

759
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,869
If he treats me coldly,

760
00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:58,769
it's hard to see him that way.

761
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:04,549
When I see that he still likes me as he did before,

762
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,210
it seems so childish,

763
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,179
but I feel reassured without meaning to.

764
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,400
I can't let go...

765
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,030
or cling onto him.

766
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:27,070
My heart keeps breaking apart into pieces.

767
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:45,150
What is all this?

768
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,489
Ms. Lee told us to prepare it.

769
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,459
She said we'd have breakfast together as a family.

770
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,730
This is way too fancy.

771
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,269
No way...

772
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,840
Did she fall for me after yesterday?

773
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,440
My gosh.

774
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,340
Seriously, I can't help myself.

775
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:21,659
Mother?

776
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,159
What brings you here...

777
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:26,130
Didn't you know I was coming?

778
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,599
- Didn't you tell him? - I did.

779
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:30,869
I told you we were eating together as a family.

780
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:36,469
Oh, was this what you meant by "family?"

781
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:38,570
- Have a seat. - Okay.

782
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:41,539
Well...

783
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:50,550
It feels strange that you're eating breakfast here, Mother.

784
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:56,219
It doesn't feel familiar to me either.

785
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,429
But what's going on, all of a sudden?

786
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:02,400
Just because. It's hard to make time for dinner.

787
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,170
I wanted to say goodbye before I go to Paris.

788
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,070
By the way, Ju Won ran away from home.

789
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:13,909
I thought she might feel lonely if she's in that big house alone.

790
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:15,840
It was weighing on my mind.

791
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,619
Don't you...

792
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:24,219
find me difficult?

793
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:27,019
Well, I do.

794
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,119
But I don't feel uncomfortable.

795
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,690
I want to get along with you, Mother.

796
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:34,260
You're my role model.

797
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,099
Gosh, I knew you two felt similar.

798
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,670
Sometimes, it gives me chills how similar you...

799
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,678
Can I come to you for advice now and then?

800
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:50,279
Yes, you can.

801
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,349
All right, Mother.

802
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:00,820
Also, I don't know too much about why Ju Won ran away, but...

803
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:03,659
Hey, Mi Jin...

804
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:08,459
I know this because I'm the type who must do what I want.

805
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,529
But you have to fight and butt heads until the end...

806
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:11,630
not to have any regrets.

807
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:14,469
He will figure out your intentions someday.

808
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:22,610
You should take good care of Mother until Ju Won comes home.

809
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,250
You should eat with her too.

810
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:26,448
Yes, I should.

811
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:28,150
Don't gang up on her with Ju Won.

812
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,420
Right. Of course not.

813
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,530
Give me your hands.

814
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:49,440
What's this?

815
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:51,739
What?

816
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,380
Mother, Si Won prepared this to give to you.

817
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,079
Yes, I prepared it for you.

818
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,988
It's a brand that came into our department store.

819
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,650
It'll give you an energy boost if you take it.

(Red Ginseng)

821
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:14,800
Oh, yes. I'll give you one.

822
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,429
Here you go.

823
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,780
Oh, that's nice.

824
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,380
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

825
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:55,369
What are you doing?

826
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:57,670
Getting ready for my trip. Why?

827
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,510
I mean...

828
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,510
Thank you for today.

829
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,920
I only ever thought of Mother as a strong person.

830
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,780
I never thought she'd be lonely.

831
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:10,449
Strong people get lonely too.

832
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,190
Father has been staying abroad for years.

833
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:14,659
How lonely must she be in that big house by herself?

834
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:19,559
Here.

835
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:23,030

Hey, what is it now?

838
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:46,050
You should hug this when you go to sleep.

839
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:48,219
A stuffed animal?

840
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,429
Well, a cooperative firm gave it to me as a present.

841
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:56,199
You can have it.

842
00:54:57,969 --> 00:55:00,670
It helps you fall asleep if you hug something soft.

843
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:04,469
Have a good trip.

844
00:55:15,449 --> 00:55:16,789
(Sleep well every night.)

845
00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:22,789
Hey, Hyung Jin.

846
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,759
Yes, thank you for last time.

847
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,230
You even gave me Lee Sung Min's number.

848
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,800
He suggested we have a meal together sometime.

849
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,030
Do you have time next week...

850
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:32,969
Yes.

851
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,170
What?

852
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:39,409

853
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:47,480
What's this? I told you not to come here.

854
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,519

Did you know too, Director Seo?

858
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,969
About Mr. Lee Sung Min's background?

859
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,639
I only found out recently too.

860
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,469
We went to the same university but weren't close.

861
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,179
The Vice Chairman had asked a friend for his contact information.

862
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,449
But he didn't get any special treatment. Can this become an issue?

863
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,179
I thought so too,

864
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:22,050
but this could make our group seem politically inclined.

865
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:25,190
First, you and I should take care of this.

866
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:27,460
Ms. Ha, please prepare to deal with the press.

867
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:29,089
Yes, sir.

868
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,989
And there's something I must tell you.

869
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:35,500
Goodbye, sir.

870
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:40,500
Ms. Ha.

871
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:43,300
The Vice Chairman came because of the news articles, right?

872
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:44,639
Well, yes.

873
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:46,909
Gosh, what do we do?

874
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:49,078
Is this position cursed or something?

875
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:52,010
After Artist Park Jong Seo, now even Artist Lee Sung Min?

876
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,618
Ms. Ha, take a look at this.

877
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,280
People are having a blast.

878
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,819
They're saying things like "Didn't Artist Lee Sung Min start..."

879
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,719
"the controversy about Artist Park Jong Seo?"

880
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,589
"He only got in because of his connections."

881
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,289
"His artwork wasn't great quality anyway."

882
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,260
The comments are awful.

883
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,260
First, you two should prepare the press release.

884
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,099
Please cancel the artist commentary event scheduled for today.

885
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:15,138
I'll go down to the art gallery.

886
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:16,809
What? The art gallery?

887
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,969
You'll go all the way to Yeosu yourself?

888
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,210
Yes, the reporters might be swarming there,

889
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:24,679
and I think it'll be better for me to deal with things in person.

890
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:38,929
Ms. Ha. And there's something I must tell you.

891
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,729
Actually, I believe Artist Lee Sung Min is...

892
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:41,800
estranged from his family.

893
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:45,630
So, he could take these news articles in a sensitive way.

894
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,170
I can't tell you too much more since it's his personal matter,

895
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,369
but I thought you should know.

Is he just going to go off grid or what?

899
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:19,530
Are you okay?

900
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:22,269
Did you come because you were worried I wasn't okay?

901
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,038
Of course. We've invited you as an artist,

902
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:26,709
and you came all this way.

903
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,440
But the event was cancelled,

904
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,379
and reporters might be coming in droves.

905
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,280
Of course, I should take care of you.

906
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:35,980
How reliable.

907
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,619
But things will be okay now.

908
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,018
My father has released an article denying the accusations.

909
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:42,019
What?

910
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:45,229
"It is true that Artist Lee Sung Min is the eldest son..."

911
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,928
"of Assemblyman Lee Kyung Seok,"

912
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:48,230
"but there was no special treatment."

913
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:49,658
"Artist Lee previously attended law school until suddenly switching..."

914
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:50,729
"his career path,"

915
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:51,868
"and due to these conflicts,"

916
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:53,599
"the father and son have been out of touch for years."

917
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,339
"Assemblyman Lee Kyung Seok found out about the exhibition today,"

918
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,038
"and said he was supportive of his son's decision not to give up..."

919
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,238
"on his dream before it was too late,"

920
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:01,380
"and he said he intended to attend the exhibition as well."

921
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,010
Isn't that too much information?

922
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,119
Well, I don't feel that great,

923
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,319
the commentary event was cancelled,

924
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,519
and I came all this way.

925
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,219
Do you want to go see the ocean?

926
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,009
Having something I didn't want others to know about...

927
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,210
revealed to the whole world makes me feel weird.

928
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:36,579
I get it.

929
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,980
Your wounds have been revealed involuntarily.

930
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,150
You must feel upset.

931
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,550
What?

932
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:50,630
Is that really you, Ms. Ha Yoon Seo?

933
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:54,230
Why are you being warm to me? You said you had no reason to.

934
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,940
Sorry about everything so far.

935
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:03,710
But actually, I was grateful to you about something.

936
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:06,570
About what?

937
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,679
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Seok...

938
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,710
He acts like he's pacifist,

939
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,579
but he's actually very violent.

940
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,150
Pardon?

941
01:00:17,289 --> 01:00:19,090
It's not just to his family.

942
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:22,489
He even laid hands on those around him.

943
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:27,130
He found out his aid helped me begin doing art.

944
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,599
What is this?

945
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,599
(Bareun Peace Party)

946
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,739
My father made it impossible for him to be in politics.

947
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:37,869
After that, I cut ties with my father.

948
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:41,079
But recently, I got a postcard from that aid.

949
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,679
He told me to do what I wanted and live well.

950
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,079
I wasn't even sure...

951
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:50,489
if I could apologize to him.

952
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,619
I worked up my courage and looked up his number, but it was wrong.

953
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,829
That was how I got in touch with you, Ms. Ha.

954
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:05,469
Was that why you sent those texts?

955
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,869
Still, I ruined a person's life.

956
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:10,239
I was feeling confused about whether I could begin doing art again...

957
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:13,940
and whether I could just live well by myself.

958
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,579
Then, I heard your voice that day.

959
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:46,369
(Jae Hee)

960
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,439
(Be sure to eat dinner. You skip when you're busy.)

961
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,510
(Are you well? I am if you are.)

962
01:01:58,289 --> 01:02:01,059
Hey! Who on earth drives like that?

963
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,960
You were the one who made an illegal U-turn first.

964
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:06,289
What? You're just a young brat.

965
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,959
Thank you for thinking I'm young,

966
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,400
but I'm not that young, actually.

967
01:02:10,429 --> 01:02:13,570
And you can't curse and speak down to someone because they're young.

968
01:02:13,769 --> 01:02:14,899
My life was so hard...

969
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,569
that I kept working my butt off when others were having fun.

970
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:20,678
Do you know about my hardworking DNA that goes bone deep?

971
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:23,808
So, let's stop fighting as people...

972
01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:25,479
who both have to work for a living.

973
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,610
In that moment,

974
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:29,349
I felt like I was in a different world.

975
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,219
The voice on the other side of the phone was strong.

976
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,920
She said her life was hard,

977
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,920
but she sounded full of the will to live.

978
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:44,429
(Stay Arang Special Exhibition Proposition)

979
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,099
(Ha Yoon Seo, Jae Hee)

980
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:53,010
That was why I wanted to meet you at least once.

981
01:02:55,579 --> 01:02:59,579
Anyway, I wanted to meet you in person after that phone call.

982
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:01,420
It was good to meet you.

983
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,889
And I think I considered that interest.

984
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:07,019
But I was so wrapped up in my emotions...

985
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:09,190
that I put you in a tough spot.

986
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,260
Sorry.

987
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,360
Well...

988
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:17,500
Since the articles are out, I just wanted to explain myself.

989
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,500
You seemed really angry this morning.

990
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:25,309
That is...

991
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,840
Actually, I haven't been feeling very great lately.

992
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:31,610
I want to part ways.

993
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,280
I know I should.

994
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:36,150
But it won't go as I hope.

995
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,860
So, perhaps, I took my anger out on you.

996
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,300
I'm feeling drained physically and emotionally.

997
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:50,260
Should we go and have a nice, warm bowl of gukbap?

998
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,469
How about something other than gukbap?

999
01:03:55,769 --> 01:03:57,909
There's something I do when I feel emotionally drained.

1000
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:00,269
Do you want to do that with me today?

1001
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,368
Artist Lee, when you feel emotionally drained,

1002
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:29,639
do you paint outdoors like this?

1003
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:34,809
Well, painting is nice,

1004
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:37,210
but I like the moment...

1005
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,719
I spend to look at the scenery before I start painting.

1006
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,420
If you sit still and focus on nature,

1007
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:48,519
you hear sounds you didn't hear in daily life.

1008
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:51,889
That really makes you feel relaxed.

1009
01:04:53,929 --> 01:04:55,699
That was how I ended up painting landscapes.

1010
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:10,280
This is unexpected.

1011
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,980
You're even worse at painting than I thought.

1012
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:17,989
What? Come on. Why are you laughing?

1013
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,889
I mean, it's so cute.

1014
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:24,630
Still, I'll praise you.

1015
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:27,429
You did well, considering it was your first time.

1016
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:36,170
Then, I'll praise you too.

1017
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:39,539
I think you've gone through a hard process.

1018
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:43,780
But you made your dream come true in the end. I respect you for that.

1019
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:49,079
And I thought, "I feel proud of you."

1020
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,989
Enough for me to want to pat you on the back.

1021
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:01,199
Then, why don't you go ahead and pat me on the back?

1022
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,769
Well, that's just a figure of speech.

1023
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:06,699
I can't accept just empty words.

1024
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,440
Go on and pat me on the back.

1025
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:15,840
That I've been through a lot, and that I'm doing well.

1026
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:40,940
You've been through a lot.

1027
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:46,309
You're doing well.

1028
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,960
You said you wanted me to pat you on the back.

1029
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,558
If you really want to get her back,

1030
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:09,789
let her go about this much, and then pull her back.

1031
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,328
The first thing you must do...

1032
01:08:12,329 --> 01:08:13,829
is to move to a different office.

1033
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:16,060
Things really must be over. The end!

1034
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,100
Is he really trying to get over his feelings?

1035
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,939
From now on, you will become a bad guy.

1036
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,210
The jealousy strategy.

1037
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:27,038
The jealousy that you feel. Yoon Seo should feel...

1038
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:29,439
that instinctive feeling to realize how precious you are.

1039
01:08:29,609 --> 01:08:31,549
Going through a hard time...

1040
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:33,609
keeps reminding me of him.

1041
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,850
Has something happened to Yoon Seo?
