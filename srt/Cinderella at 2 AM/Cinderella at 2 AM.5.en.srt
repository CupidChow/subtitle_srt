(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

12
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,889
So, this started while on the Yeosu business trip.

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,920
- So... - This is nice.

14
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,429
(Ji Seok)

15
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,429
Give me a glass of that.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,798
Yoon Seo, I'm studying hard,

17
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,299
so you should work hard too.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,000
Only then will you be able to provide for me.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,969
You said your brother was in 12th grade.

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,769
Did he send a photo to prove he studied?

21
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,439
Yes. His college entrance exams are just around the corner.

22
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,079
But he's not that good at studying.

23
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:12,739
I can tell.

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,010
He got this one wrong, and this one too.

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,708
Come on, what?

26
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,548
How can you tell after a quick glance?

27
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:19,619
Why wouldn't I?

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,249
I was so good at math when I was in school.

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,658
I relieve my stress by solving math problems.

30
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:28,259
You know the math Olympiad? I even won a prize there.

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,399
I made so much money tutoring kids in math during college.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,899
What do you take me for?

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,199
Then, don't just show off like that.

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,999
You should tutor Ms. Ha's brother or something.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,140
I mean, we got to receive a bonus for the Hanok Stay.

36
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,810
You owe her for so much over the years.

37
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,510
I don't owe her for that much.

38
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,449
Tell him to come by the office sometime.

39
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,980
I'll take a look at his work.

40
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,750
No, I'm grateful enough for the offer.

41
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,420
Hey, Ms. Ha!

42
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:02,188
Hey, didn't you guys go home already?

43
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,260
Oh, our meeting with the PR team ended a little late.

44
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,798
Oh, right. We're going to go have some fried chicken.

45
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,000
Do you want to come with us?

46
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,740
One second.

47
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,870
(Ji Seok)

48
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,069
Hey, Ji Seok.

49
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,639
Why are you suddenly video calling me?

50
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,638
I wanted to show you that I solved all of the questions.

51
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,650
I see.

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,119
Gosh, he got them all wrong again.

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,149
What's the use in just solving them?

54
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,150
You need to get them right.

55
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,520
Good job. I'll eat dinner before I go home.

56
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,359
I'm hungry too. Can I order...

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,889
spicy braised chicken from Yi Rae's?

58
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
Oh, sure. Bye.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,128
Spicy braised chicken?

60
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,129
Let's go.

61
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,728
One second. We were going to have chicken too anyway.

62
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,598
- Can't we come to your place? - What?

63
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,499
You said you lived right nearby.

64
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,968
We could go and have Mr. Bae tutor your brother in math.

65
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,478
- How nice! - Well, sure.

66
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,149
You said you'd have a housewarming party but you didn't.

67
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,150
- Right. - Right.

68
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,519
Let's go. Since we're on the subject...

69
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,049
- But... - Let's go.

70
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,050
Yes!

71
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:02,289
- But wait... I mean... - No, we're going.

72
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,098
- This is the bathroom, right? - Oh, yes.

73
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,370
You're dividing the line AC in a 3 to 1 ratio.

74
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:18,699
Then, what will A to the 3rd power be?

75
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,198
This is divided...

76
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,408
I was just going to talk about leaving my job.

77
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,680
What in the world is this?

78
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,349
Who is it?

79
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,360
What's this?

80
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,629
Yoon Seo.

81
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,099
I have nowhere to go.

82
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,530
I left everything and left.

83
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,569
"Left everything?"

84
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,969
Now, all I have is you.

85
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,448
Wait, Wimp?

86
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,218
I thought you broke up. Why did you come again?

87
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:06,579
Hey, brother. Do you have the answer key for this?

88
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,319
I don't think we learned stuff like this in my day...

89
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,750
Director Seo.

90
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:11,560
Is the food here?

91
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,388
Director Seo...

92
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:15,030
What, "Director Seo?"

93
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,329
Then, is Wimp...

94
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,129
a third-generation conglomerate?

95
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,430
Hey, so...

96
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,100
Delivery! I heard the whole team was here...

97
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,870
What? Are you two dating again?

98
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:27,809
- No! - What? "Dating again?"

99
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,009
Did you two date before?

100
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,149
Like that, our office romance...

101
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,750
became known...

102
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,220
after we broke up.

103
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,540
Excuse me...

104
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,509
One moment.

105
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,980
Yes, that's right.

106
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,449
We dated for a year and six months.

107
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,119
Under the decision that everyone would feel uncomfortable...

108
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,120
if our teammates found out about this,

109
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,689
we had kept it a secret so far.

110
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,829
However, we broke up about a month ago.

111
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,529
We are not getting back together.

112
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:26,229
I think we should finish today's meeting here.

113
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,230
I apologize.

114
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,999
- Director Seo? - Yes.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,170
Let's talk for a minute.

116
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Okay.

117
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,139
I'll be going.

118
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,720
What was that? A briefing?

119
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,250
I thought we were in the meeting room.

120
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,490
I know. She's good at presenting her breakup too.

121
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,789
What? "Presenting her breakup?" How could you say that?

122
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,929
All right.

123
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,160
Since the situation is rather awkward right now,

124
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,499
and you seem to know everything there is to know now,

125
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,670
how about you leave for today?

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,100
But...

127
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,410
The thing is, we haven't had dinner yet.

128
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,508
So, even if we have to leave,

129
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,379
could we do that after we eat this spicy braised chicken?

130
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:15,149
What?

131
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,949
Just one bite.

132
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,579
Just one bite.

133
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:29,730
No way.

134
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,258
I mean, we didn't even find out that Ju Won was...

135
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,899
the son of the company's owner until recently.

136
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,698
But today, we found out that those two dated!

137
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,469
I'm so shocked right now.

138
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,879
Why? I predicted there was something between those two.

139
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:47,449
I said they were flirting with each other on the Yeosu trip.

140
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,008
Gosh.

141
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,778
But then, if they dated for a year and six months,

142
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,149
did she date him knowing he was rich or not?

143
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,089
I know, right?

144
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,729
I'll use the bathroom, Ji Seok.

145
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,730
Okay.

146
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,560
By the way,

147
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,430
this is what I want to know the most.

148
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,170
Which part about Ms. Ha...

149
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,739
did Director Seo like?

150
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,870
I know!

151
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,610
What's wrong with my sister?

152
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,079
Well, you say that because you don't know.

153
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,350
Your sister is so scary at work.

154
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,119
She's super scary at home too.

155
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,850
What? Then you should know even more than us.

156
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:32,219
When Ju Won was a new recruit, Ms. Ha was his direct supervisor.

157
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,490
She was so harsh on him and acted so cold.

158
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,799
What on earth did he like about her?

159
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Why?

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,069
Hang on.

161
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,529
Is it something like this?

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,899
You call this a report?

163
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,439
Do you expect me to read something like this?

164
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,389
Be mine.

165
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,189
You're the first woman who has ever yelled at me.

166
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,839
Gosh, seriously. We're eating here.

167
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,539
What? I mean, it could be true.

168
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,438
Throughout his entire life,

169
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,838
who would've treated Ju Won like that?

170
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,849
Someone who advises, criticizes, and leads him down the right path.

171
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,449
How fresh would that have been for him?

172
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,220
Fresh, my foot.

173
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,148
But are you really sure he's the son of a conglomerate family?

174
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,219
- Yes. - Yes.

175
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,089
The two of them have been dating like high school kids...

176
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,258
who get allowances.

177
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,689
Even I thought it was ridiculous.

178
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,158
They'd always eat tteokbokki and go on walks.

179
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,329
They were such humble dates that I wondered...

180
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,870
if I should give them money.

181
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,399
But a conglomerate?

182
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,509
Then that must've been the secret.

183
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,250
So this is sundae.

184
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,519
It's chewy.

185
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,250
So excellent.

186
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,450
The sauce is even more special here.

187
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:09,850
Hurry up and eat it.

188
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:14,789
If it's a day I spend with you,

189
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,460
it's ordinary but special.

190
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,379
Gosh, seriously!

191
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,508
That gives me the creeps!

192
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,479
Stop imagining stuff about my sister.

193
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,620
Okay.

194
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:41,349
Also, from now on, watch what you say in front of my sister.

195
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,789
It must be so hard to be in the same office after breaking up.

196
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,529
I'm not sure. They didn't seem to be struggling that much.

197
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,129
You couldn't tell at all until now.

198
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,558
That's what I mean.

199
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,668
Actually, brother, this may not sound too pleasant,

200
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:57,840
but your sister is such a dogged woman.

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,199
You've heard of the phrase, "She wouldn't even bleed..."

202
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,668
"if you poked her with a needle," right?

203
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,638
If you take that phrase and turn it into a human,

204
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,808
it would be your sister.

205
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:08,079
Your sister is not the type to struggle from a breakup.

206
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,479
It looked obvious that Director Seo was trying to cling to her.

207
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,119
That means Director Seo was the one who got dumped.

208
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,449
And he's the one who's struggling.

209
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,120
So, he must be the victim in this situation.

210
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,918
It's not like that.

211
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,918
Yoon Seo broke up because of his family's opposition.

212
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,529
Yoon Seo was practically threatened by the chairwoman!

213
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,299
Are you serious?

214
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:26,529
What?

215
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,599
Well, that's...

216
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,830
Then...

217
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,899
a situation we only saw in cheesy soap operas happened in real life?

218
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,080
My goodness.

219
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,120
Look at this shabby place.

220
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:52,190
You can guess why I'm here, can't you?

221
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,059
Break up with my son.

222
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,729
No, I love Ju Won.

223
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,798
I can't break up with him.

224
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,628
How dare you lay your hand on me?

225
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,339
Do you know how much this is worth?

226
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,710
Dirty. How dirty.

227
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,439
So dirty!

228
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,508
I told you to stop it!

229
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,609
What's dirty? What's so shabby?

230
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,648
We may still be paying a mortgage, but we own this place.

231
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:18,949
How nice is your place...

232
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,820
that you're talking smack about ours, mister?

233
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,490
Sorry.

234
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,490
I actually live in a rented studio apartment.

235
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,089
Also, I'm not that much older. I'm the same age as your sister.

236
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,629
But you can... I'll stop.

237
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,929
Yes, please just give it a rest.

238
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,600
I only told you in case you got the wrong idea...

239
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,700
and spread rumours at work.

240
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,600
Please act like you don't know.

241
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,169
Please take good care of our dear Yoon Seo.

242
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,210
She may not show it, but she still has a hard time.

243
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,649
I'm sorry. I didn't know everyone was here.

244
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,788
Forget that for now.

245
00:11:57,789 --> 00:11:59,320
You said you left everything behind.

246
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:00,759
What does that mean?

247
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,330
Actually,

248
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,870
I felt awful after hearing about your resignation.

249
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,569
After you broke up with me,

250
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,840
you even made up your mind to quit a job you love so much.

251
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,408
But I'm still holding onto my position.

252
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:19,278
So? Are you saying you'll abandon your entire background and leave?

253
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,080
Then what am I supposed to do?

254
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,008
Should I just watch you leave...

255
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,250
everything you've achieved so far?

256
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,490
I won't tell the teammates about my resignation for now.

257
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,959
The ongoing project will be over soon.

258
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,230
I'll leave after handing off all of my tasks, so don't worry.

259
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,399
I'll be going now.

260
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,029
Will you be okay?

261
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,340
You said you didn't want...

262
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,638
people to know about our relationship.

263
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,740
It's not like we're dating. We're broken up.

264
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,039
What can anyone do?

265
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,450
When time passes, I'm sure things will be okay.

266
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,899
What's this? What's with the mood?

267
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,138
Were you guys still here?

268
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,409
- Oh, I'm leaving. Bye. - We should go...

269
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,379
I'll leave you to it.

270
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,678
I'll be going too.

271
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,480
Cheer up.

272
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,720
I'm rooting for you, Ms. Ha.

273
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,919
What's going on? Why is everyone acting that way?

274
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,729
Yoon Seo, don't get down on yourself.

275
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,599
The other guy may be from a conglomerate family,

276
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,460
but you know you're not lacking in any way to be treated like this.

277
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,970
What are you saying, all of a sudden?

278
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:51,970
I heard all about it.

279
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,539
That you tragically broke up because of his family's opposition.

280
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:58,340
What?

281
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,379
Darn it!

282
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,518
- Hello? - Hey, Kim Yi Rae.

283
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,819
How could you say all of that?

284
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,388
And in front of Ji Seok too!

285
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,449
Well...

286
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,089
They were going on about how you seemed fine after breaking up,

287
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,830
calling you a dogged woman and all that.

288
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:17,090
So, I was trying to stick up for you that I ended up...

289
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,000
Still, I didn't talk about how you accepted money from the chairwoman.

290
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,870
Is that right? Thanks.

291
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,999
Thanks to you, my office life will be so embarrassing and fun.

292
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,610
It won't be too embarrassing.

293
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:30,369
They're all smart people.

294
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,940
I doubt they'll let on that they know.

295
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,149
Oh, my. I'm getting a phone call.

296
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,250
I'll call you later. Bye.

297
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,919
Hey!

298
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,419
Darn it.

299
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,299
I left everything and left.

300
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,039
Things won't be too serious, right?

301
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,830
Why did you give me so much rice?

302
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,440
So you'd eat a lot and cheer up.

303
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,769
By the way, did his family disapprove because of me?

304
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,879
Because of you?

305
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,350
You have a younger brother you have to be responsible for.

306
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,820
Did Wimp's family not like that or something?

307
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,419
If it was something like that, just let me know.

308
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,788
I'll be turning 20 soon.

309
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,250
Then, I'll move out and live fine on my own.

310
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,529
Ha Ji Seok. It was nothing like that at all.

311
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,829
Don't mind that. Act like you didn't hear it.

312
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,100
But how can I do that when I have heard it?

313
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,268
You don't want to go to work, do you?

314
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,839
How annoying would it be to work in the same office as your ex?

315
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,370
Do you want to skip work and hang out with me?

316
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,740
Skip? As if.

317
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:12,080
Eat up and go to school.

318
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:13,309
Okay.

319
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,579
Oh, then, if your colleagues tease or annoy you,

320
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,950
let me know right away, okay?

321
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,049
Ji Seok.

322
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,960
The world of adults is different from yours.

323
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:26,689
Someone else's pain is...

324
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,190
something you pretend not to know or see.

325
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:33,659
That's an unspoken rule in the world of adults.

326
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,700
So, don't worry too much.

327
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,870
That was what I confidently said, but...

328
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,359
Oh, no.

329
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,970
Oh, I wasn't crying.

330
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,038
Sure, let's say that.

331
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,869
No, you don't understand. I really wasn't.

332
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:19,008
The office was really dry, so I used artificial tears.

333
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:21,950
I was using artificial tears, but I squeezed too hard so...

334
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,420
I really wasn't crying!

335
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:32,119
Gosh, seriously...

336
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,788
That was how it went.

337
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:38,200
They had no mercy in the form of ignoring someone else's pain.

338
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:41,329
No wonder people keep office romances a secret.

339
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:51,639
Director Seo, how about we get some noodles for lunch?

340
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,008
From now on, let's have lunch together,

341
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:54,180
just the two of us.

342
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,720
You should eat with me later.

343
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,048
We won't be eating as a group of four from now on.

344
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:04,559
Mr. Bae and I will each split up and tail you as defenders.

345
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,119
So,

346
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,829
you can relax.

347
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,859
Thanks.

348
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,630
It's so uncomfortable.

349
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,868
All right. Let's go to the third floor.

350
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:22,169
The vending machine on the third floor is slightly better.

351
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,170
You're right.

352
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,410
Hello.

353
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:35,349
Good.

354
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,529
Ms. Ha, I closed the door quickly so Director Seo couldn't get on.

355
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,200
It'd be so awkward for you to run into each other.

356
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,029
- Good job. - Right?

357
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,740
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

358
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:57,240
This is so uncomfortable.

359
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,179
The schedule looks good, right?

360
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,180
Yes.

361
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,318
It's the chairwoman. Ms. Ha... Ms. Ha!

362
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,529
Ms. Ha!

363
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:16,960
- Hang on. - What...

364
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,529
This way...

365
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,059
Wait...

366
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:22,828
What are you doing?

367
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,429
Open up!

368
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,298
Ms. Ha, take the stairs.

369
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,709
The chairwoman is coming in to the lobby right now.

370
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,970
What if you meet in the elevator and get yelled at?

371
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,480
Hurry up and run away!

372
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,719
I did a great deed.

373
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,348
If they had run into each other, it would've been...

374
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:43,119
What do we do? The chairwoman is headed this way!

375
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,929
That's right.

376
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,839
The VIP elevator is that way.

377
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,740
What do we do?

378
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,779
I shouldn't have been caught.

379
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:10,179
This is so stressful, both mentally and physically.

380
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,849
What is this?

381
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,190
(Cleaning)

382
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,480
My gosh, I'm so sorry.

383
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:41,180
Oh, no.

384
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:42,509
Are you all right?

385
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,049
Yes. I'm okay, but...

386
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,319
Now, let's look at the latest social media trends.

387
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,359
The world is changing rapidly these days.

388
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,118
To keep up with the trends,

389
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,960
we should be proactive with social media marketing.

390
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,259
Let's go over the latest social media trends.

391
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,199
These days, using algorithms and UI design...

392
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,028
to analyse user participation behaviour and optimize...

393
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,098
What do we do?

394
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:07,538
She must've run into the chairwoman and got slapped in the face.

395
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:08,608
Yes, I know.

396
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,508
It's all your fault. What should we do?

397
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:12,640
Then what should we do?

398
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,848
We should stay ahead of the trend...

399
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:18,048
by focusing on video content rather than text content.

400
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:20,119
We'll reshape our marketing strategy based on this.

401
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,420
Next, we'll discuss mobile customer experience.

402
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,858
The recent changes in user platforms allow users...

403
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:28,989
to focus on their experience while...

404
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,489
I feel bad that you embarrassed yourself...

405
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,528
in front of your ex because of me.

406
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,199
I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable.

407
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,669
I want to apologize, so please accept this. From Psychopath.

408
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,539
So, we need to approach this strategically.

409
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,338
Also, considering the recent AI developments,

410
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:44,710
we must pay attention to how easy it now is for users to use AI.

411
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:46,940
Let's look at the next page.

412
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,449
(So uncomfortable)

413
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,849
It makes me so uncomfortable!

414
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:12,599
Why did you suddenly want to have tea with me?

415
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,700
What's going on?

416
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:15,769
Well, just because.

417
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,578
I just wanted to see you. It's been too long.

418
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:20,410
What do you mean it's been too long?

419
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:22,180
I saw you last night.

420
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:25,778
Anyway, where's Ju Won?

421
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:29,190
He said he couldn't join us because his meeting was running late.

422
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,119
Why? Did you get into an argument with him yesterday?

423
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,630
Ju Won...

424
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,500
just up and left.

425
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,000
What are you doing?

426
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,700
I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting that.

427
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:48,509
Ju Won is so easygoing. He left home?

428
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:51,210
Did he move out with all his stuff?

429
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,039
No, he didn't.

430
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,410
But it looked like he would.

431
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,848
I already knew he and that girl broke up,

432
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:04,190
and I also knew he'd be heartbroken...

433
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,559
for a while.

434
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,190
So...

435
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:12,430
I thought we just had to overcome this crisis.

436
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:17,299
Just once.

437
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,670
Can't you be my mother and not the chairwoman?

438
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,480
Oh, no.

439
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,818
Ju Won told me he was meeting with the live commerce client,

440
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:36,089
but that meeting is tomorrow according to the schedule.

441
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,049
I guess Ju Won is...

442
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,559
avoiding you, Mother.

443
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,799
(Headquarters Director Seo Ju Won)

444
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,809
My, your office is nice.

445
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,779
Hey, your sofa is nicer than mine.

446
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:08,589
What brings you here?

447
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,789
Well, I just wanted to see you.

448
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:20,558
Let's get out of here before my team sees you.

449
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,068
What? What are you doing?

450
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:24,399
Hey, you don't want them to see me because you're embarrassed of me?

451
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,338
- Yes, you embarrass me. Come on. - What?

452
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,440
Let's get out of here.

453
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,039
I saw you yesterday. Why did you want to see me again?

454
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,639
What's up?

455
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,649
What do you think?

456
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,779
I dropped by to see you because I was worried.

457
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,779
I heard you just up and left.

458
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,380
Where did you sleep last night?

459
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,319
At a hotel.

460
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,519
My goodness.

461
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,559
What are you, a runaway youth?

462
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:50,059
I can't even have you stay with me because of your sister-in-law.

463
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,629
Hey, actually... Why don't you just stay with us?

464
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,798
It's already so awkward.

465
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,130
It might be a bit better if you stay with us.

466
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,730
Stop talking nonsense.

467
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,769
Why didn't you tell me?

468
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,940
That she was coming back, and you were joining AL Corporation.

469
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:03,868
You knew about it.

470
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,809
No, I only found out that day too.

471
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:08,679
Also, Mi Jin came back without even telling me.

472
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,250
What? The two of you don't even talk about things like that?

473
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,979
No, we don't.

474
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,048
She kept it from me...

475
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:15,789
because the company had to keep it confidential.

476
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,219
Hey. When it comes to business,

477
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,518
Mi Jin is as strict as our mom.

478
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,230
Sometimes, I feel as though I married Mom.

479
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,799
Well, anyway...

480
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,670
It's not like you didn't see it coming.

481
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,670
That you'd eventually take over my position.

482
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:34,368
Don't make your own life more difficult.

483
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:35,509
Just go back home.

484
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,539
Well...

485
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,650
Do I really have a home to go back to?

486
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,578
I'm sorry. Should I step out and pick up some ice packs?

487
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,949
Because of us, your cheek is...

488
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,088
"Us?" This time, I didn't do anything.

489
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:52,818
What? Then I didn't do anything either.

490
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:54,459
I know the cleaning lady slapped her.

491
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,059
I'm only apologizing because I feel morally responsible.

492
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,700
You two. Please, that is enough.

493
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,970
Thank you for your concern, but...

494
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,469
No. Actually, I do not appreciate this.

495
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,639
I'd be more grateful if you treated me like before,

496
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,880
so please just act like you don't know anything.

497
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,909
Well, we just feel bad for you.

498
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,778
Why would you feel bad for me?

499
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,349
We dated and broke up. That's all.

500
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,548
Have you never been in a relationship?

501
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:21,848
People break up all the time.

502
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:24,088
There are so many office couples that have broken up.

503
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:27,089
Will you get all nosy and interfere each time?

504
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,529
Let's say you two dated and broke up.

505
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:32,230
Would you be happy if I kept bothering you like this?

506
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:34,259
Gosh, seriously...

507
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,609
Well...

508
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,419
I think she's embarrassed that...

509
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,589
we've found out about your relationship.

510
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,279
I'll move my office.

511
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:28,549
I'm sorry.

512
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:31,519
It's fine. I'll quit soon anyway. Why bother moving your office?

513
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:34,119
I'd hate it if you were stressed out because of me until you quit.

514
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:37,960
I decided to use that office to be close to you.

515
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,400
Without you, it means nothing,

516
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,869
so don't worry about it.

517
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,839
This makes me so angry.

518
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,240
- What? - Why is everything so easy for you?

519
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,750
Moving your office and giving up everything you have.

520
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,380
I guess you think it's very romantic.

521
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:01,819
You're wrong.

522
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,650
I find it so obnoxious.

523
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,859
I was so angry yesterday too.

524
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,989
I think you're seriously mistaken about something.

525
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,858
A rich heir meets an ordinary girl.

526
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,700
He says it's true love and moves out of his mansion?

527
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,440
What's more selfish than that?

528
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,240
Have you imagined how the woman would feel, watching all of it?

529
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,940
The man, who has lived comfortably all his life,

530
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,380
now has to struggle financially because of her.

531
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,950
How miserable would she feel while watching him go through that?

532
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,980
He'd think to himself,

533
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,319
"I love you so much that I can give up everything I have."

534
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,859
The truth is,

535
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,259
he's doing that to get self-satisfaction.

536
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,859
- Yoon Seo. - Remember this, Seo Ju Won.

537
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,868
If you ever meet a woman who tells you to do that,

538
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:52,099
just dump her.

539
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,740
It's not true love.

540
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:00,410
Then why is it so easy for you?

541
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,789
The thought of you dating someone else.

542
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:13,390
I don't even want to think about it. How could you say that so easily?

543
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,559
What about you? Did you ever truly love me?

544
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,630
I know this isn't an easy path...

545
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,069
and that you'll be hurt.

546
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,608
But I hoped you'd hold my hand.

547
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:29,609
However...

548
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,239
You were afraid you'd get hurt...

549
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,640
and tried to let my hand go right away.

550
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,480
Ever since you found out about my family.

551
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,288
You may think I'm an immature kid who always whines for love.

552
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:45,390
And my worries...

553
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:48,190
might seem like the complaints of a spoiled child to you.

554
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,960
But I truly meant it, every single moment.

555
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:56,670
I never once thought that the things I had were rightfully mine.

556
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,839
"What can I do on my own?" I was curious and scared.

557
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:05,539
You were the first thing I'd ever achieved on my own,

558
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,150
so I couldn't give up on you when I could give up everything else.

559
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,250
I know I'm pathetic for not being able to get over you...

560
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,950
after breaking up.

561
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:20,089
But even in this moment,

562
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,819
I'm only worried about how to keep you...

563
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,890
from getting hurt.

564
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,900
So how could you do this to me?

565
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,710
What's going on?

566
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:12,910
He seems angry.

567
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:24,650
I was the one...

568
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:26,220
who was making everyone uncomfortable.

569
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,430
It'd take at least two months to find and train my replacement.

570
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,829
Is it right for me to stay here,

571
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,170
knowing I'm making everyone uncomfortable?

572
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,339
- Excuse me, Ms. Ha. - Oh, yes.

573
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:48,439
It may not be appropriate for me to bring this up now,

574
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,509
but I thought I should tell you anyway.

575
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,150
What's it about?

576
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:55,249
Well, there's a headhunter...

577
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,960
who's been really wanting to meet you.

578
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,259
A headhunter?

579
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:04,130
Yes. You see, I never do this,

580
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:05,758
but he's incredibly competent as a headhunter.

581
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,930
So, I suggest you just meet him and talk about...

582
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,869
Forget it. I shouldn't have said it.

583
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,269
I'll meet him.

584
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,240
Really?

585
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,380
He's actually in the area now. Would you like to step out now?

586
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,048
Oh! The lunch break has just started. Nice.

587
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:28,788
Why don't you step out and chat with him over a meal?

588
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:31,088
What? Now? It's too sudden.

589
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:33,058
Preparing too much for a meeting like this...

590
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,119
will only give you a headache.

591
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,588
He's been pestering me to put him in touch with you.

592
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:38,930
Talk about perfect timing!

593
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,899
All right. Get going. Hurry.

594
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,599
- But this is too... - Gosh, just go.

595
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,769
- Here's mine. - Thank you.

596
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,710
(Ha Yoon Seo)

597
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,250
It's nice to meet you.

598
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,579
Oh, it is very nice to meet you.

599
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,990
I've been pestering him to put me in touch with you.

600
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,190
Finally, we meet.

601
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,559
Thank you.

602
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:16,430
Here. I prepared it in a rush, so it's not that great.

603
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,200
(Name: Ha Yoon Seo)

604
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,569
Why are you giving me this?

605
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,170
What do you mean, why?

606
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,410
Oh, is this how people do it these days?

607
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,579
Well, how else would they do it?

608
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,279
It's just that I've never seen someone...

609
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:33,319
bring their resume to a blind date.

610
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
What?

611
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,690
A blind date?

612
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,789
A blind date, all of a sudden? How did this come about?

613
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,160
- Well, hear me out. - Okay.

614
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:46,358
Love is the best cure for a broken heart, you know.

615
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,759
That's why I arranged it.

616
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,028
But I suddenly felt bad for Director Seo...

617
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,140
and didn't think it was a good idea, so I told her to forget about it.

618
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,509
But to my surprise, she said she'd do it.

619
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,308
I was quite surprised.

620
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:58,509
My gosh.

621
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:01,410
I guess she wants to forget him as soon as possible.

622
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:04,049
I mean, she said yes to a blind date arranged today...

623
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,579
What? Why...

624
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,230
He probably heard that, right?

625
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,570
I think he did.

626
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Shoot.

627
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,679
I'm sorry. Please forget about this.

628
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,618
I didn't know this was a blind date.

629
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:45,619
It's not a problem.

630
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,429
I feel like I wasted your time. I'm sorry.

631
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:53,759
The truth is, I saw your photos on social media...

632
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,269
and have been asking him to set me up with you.

633
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,230
I guess my job...

634
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:00,900
caused the misunderstanding.

635
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:02,469
I'm sorry.

636
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:06,738
Could you please say nothing about my resume to Mr. Bae?

637
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:09,449
Well, I don't want him to know that I'm looking for another job.

638
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,010
Oh, sure thing. Don't worry about that.

639
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,420
- Thank you. - Okay.

640
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,489
- Enjoy. - Great, thank you.

641
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:26,598
I have to say, I'm grateful...

642
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,760
for the misunderstanding.

643
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,630
Without the misunderstanding, we wouldn't have met like this.

644
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Pardon?

645
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:35,570
Well, we both took time out of our busy schedules to meet like this.

646
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,239
Can we just think of this as a blind date and talk?

647
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,940
What?

648
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,409
Well, let's eat first.

649
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,280
Oh, okay.

650
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,519
Right. What kind of food do you like, Yoon Seo?

651
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,460
I like spicy food.

652
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:54,019
Oh, you like spicy food?

653
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:58,789
I can't really handle spices, so I can't eat spicy food.

654
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
My stomach gets upset.

655
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:02,369
To be honest, I don't understand...

656
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,230
why people eat those things.

657
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,738
Well...

658
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:07,070
- I see. - But you like it, so...

659
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:18,579
Do you like it?

660
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,019
Oh, what do you normally do on your days off?

661
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,690
Do you have a hobby?

662
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,289
I enjoy watching movies. Horror movies.

663
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,590
Horror movies?

664
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:34,459
My gosh. I hate disturbing, cruel stuff.

665
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,969
I really hate it,

666
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,070
so I can't watch movies like that. My gosh, you're brave.

667
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:41,469
Yes.

668
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,780
Gosh, I'm scared.

669
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,619
But if someone you love likes them,

670
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:02,590
you should be able to eat such food and watch such movies with them,

671
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,690
don't you think?

672
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,369
Well, we could just do things that we both like.

673
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,769
Why do something that one of us doesn't like?

674
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,940
I used to think that too.

675
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,710
- Right? - Yes.

676
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:40,900
I wasn't forcing myself to do things I hated because of you.

677
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,130
Thanks to you, I've grown to like a lot of things.

678
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:51,808
In every moment of my daily life, I'm reminded of Ju Won.

679
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,210
It breaks my heart.

680
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:54,939
You were afraid you'd get hurt...

681
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,380
and tried to let my hand go right away.

682
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:01,150
I always thought I was a realistic person,

683
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,320
but I was selfish.

684
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,959
In order to protect myself from getting hurt,

685
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,219
I acted like I was being realistic...

686
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,360
while avoiding him and ignoring the problem.

687
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,500
I think that will be better.

688
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,379
What should we do, Ms. Ha?

689
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,480
Director Seo knows everything.

690
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:38,320
- What are you talking about? - The thing is...

691
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:42,090
He found out about your blind date.

692
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,630
What?

693
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,869
When I first made up my mind to break up with him,

694
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,840
I'd planned to make him hate me slowly but surely.

695
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,780
Yes, don't make excuses.

696
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,250
There's no such thing as a nice breakup,

697
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,480
so this is actually good.

698
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,650
If he hates me, it might actually be good for both of us.

699
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,239
But of course,

700
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:37,480
when I see him, I keep feeling...

701
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,949
I've never seen Ms. Ha take a half day.

702
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,219
We should've just listened to her and left her be.

703
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,819
We meddled in her business...

704
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,059
because we felt bad for her and wanted to help.

705
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:53,329
I feel like we made it more difficult for her.

706
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,559
That's insane!

707
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,368
I'm not insane. Why are you swearing at me?

708
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:58,698
No, not you.

709
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:00,969
Park Jong Seo, the artist shown at Hanok Stay, has been accused...

710
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,399
of hiring a ghost painter.

711
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,909
- What? - Here, look.

712
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,939
This is insane!

713
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,849
(Artist Park Jong Seo Accused of Hiring Ghost Painter)

714
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,030
(Accept, Decline)

715
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,659
What does he want from me?

716
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:42,709
Hey! Drive properly, will you?

717
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,379
Who made an illegal U-turn first?

718
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,578
- Me! - What?

719
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:48,849
You need to be flexible with these things.

720
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,348
People who can't even drive are out driving.

721
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,219
All sorts of riff-raff drive their own cars.

722
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,420
Must be nice.

723
00:40:54,421 --> 00:40:55,718
What? "Riff-raff?"

724
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,729
Do I know you?

725
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,689
Have we met before? Why are you talking so casually to me?

726
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,829
You little... You still look like a kid.

727
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,529
Thanks for telling me that I look young,

728
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,198
but I'm not that young.

729
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,999
And just because I look young, it doesn't mean...

730
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,598
you can swear and talk so casually to me.

731
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,610
Oh, dear.

732
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,209
No one's hurt,

733
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,380
so let's calm down and go our own ways.

734
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,279
You're out and about when everyone else is working. Lucky you.

735
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,250
I'm a busy man. You ruined my day.

736
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:29,690
I am not exactly lucky. My life is so tough.

737
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:31,360
I'm struggling to make ends meet.

738
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,860
I've always worked when everyone else was playing.

739
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:36,828
I'm a natural-born hard worker. Do you have any idea?

740
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:39,368
I forced myself to go to work and put up with all sorts of insults.

741
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:42,609
I'm taking a half day for the very first time in my career.

742
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,808
Do you even know how I feel?

743
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:48,780
We're both struggling, so let's stop fighting!

744
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,110
Goodness.

745
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,460
Hon... Hello?

746
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:08,760
"Hon?" I'm not your honey.

747
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,800
Are you kidding me?

748
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,469
What is this? Why did I accept this call?

749
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,400
I have no idea.

750
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,809
You accepted the call by mistake,

751
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,638
and I heard you shout and fight.

752
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,610
It was so entertaining I couldn't hang up.

753
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:25,880
What a psycho.

754
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,459
Listen. Delete my number...

755
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,090
and don't text or call ever again.

756
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,860
(The call has ended.)

757
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,230
(Power off)

758
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,279
The call cannot be connected. Transferring to voicemail.

759
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,678
She's not picking up. I think she turned off her phone.

760
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,018
What should we do, then?

761
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:02,219
The grand opening is next week.

762
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,488
Right.

763
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:05,888
Do you remember where Ms. Ha lives?

764
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:07,459
Should we visit her at home?

765
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,190
Will she be at home?

766
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:11,629
Since we told the director,

767
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,658
won't he sort it out for us somehow?

768
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:16,329
How could he sort out something like this?

769
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,428
He was our team rookie who worked...

770
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,539
for us just a few months ago.

771
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:21,039
Right.

772
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:26,780
I took care of the urgent issues.

773
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,110
I told AL Hanok Stay to take down the exhibition,

774
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:34,078
and Park Jong Seo's name was deleted from all press releases.

775
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,578
We knew nothing of the problem,

776
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,690
so PR will do damage control.

777
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:41,018
Legal is going over the contract to decide the scope of damage.

778
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:44,090
We should find another artist who can exhibit right away.

779
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,999
What? Yes, sure.

780
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,499
We can't leave an art gallery empty on opening day.

781
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,769
The next exhibition is three months away, right?

782
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:54,440
Can I have a list of upcoming exhibitions?

783
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
Yes, sir.

784
00:43:56,869 --> 00:44:00,178
The works for the exhibition three months later...

785
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,249
are currently in the UK, so we can't bring them in right now.

786
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,979
The works for the one after that are also in another gallery.

787
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,949
We can't use them either.

788
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:10,919
How about we call Korean painting artist...

789
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,460
Lee Sung Min who was our first pick?

790
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:14,820
Ms. Ha asked him...

791
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,029
for months to work with us, and he refused.

792
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,829
Would he say yes if we asked him to fill in days before the opening?

793
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,198
Could you please think a bit before you speak?

794
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:26,800
I'll give the artist a call.

795
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:28,699
See?

796
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,010
How will you do that?

797
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:34,408
We barely talked just to his agent after months of trying.

798
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:36,179
I have a feeling I can get a number.

799
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,650
I see.

800
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,550
Goodbye.

801
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,328
How does he think he can get his number?

802
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:52,328
Will he go to a private investigator?

803
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:54,229
Whether he goes to a private investigator or not,

804
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,230
I just wish this gets sorted out.

805
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:58,499
Where is Ms. Ha,

806
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,300
and what is she doing at this crucial time?

807
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,840
Oh, gosh...

808
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:20,219
If I go home now, Ji Seok will worry.

809
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,130
If I go to Yi Rae's, I'll drink myself silly.

810
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,829
The sky is so pretty for no good reason.

811
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,010
What?

812
00:45:39,011 --> 00:45:41,078
You got Lee Sung Min to say yes?

813
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:44,480
Yes. We'll go to his studio now to pick out the artwork.

814
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,018
You never showed us these skills when you were a rookie,

815
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:52,050
and you're showing off now as a director?

816
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,389
We had mutual acquaintances,

817
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,828
and I heard that he went from being unable...

818
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:59,659
to exhibit to being willing recently.

819
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:02,130
Shall we get ready to leave now?

820
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,469
What should we do about Ms. Ha?

821
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,500
She's in charge of AL Hanok Stay.

822
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:11,109
Handling such a huge issue without talking to her...

823
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,239
It can't be helped.

824
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,010
She's absent,

825
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,909
so she must pay the price.

826
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,599
You don't talk to your wife even about that?

827
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:45,070
(Husband)

828
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:47,779
Hey, hello?

829
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,279
Hi. What?

830
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,349
What do you do this evening?

831
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,709
I'll eat dinner.

832
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,779
Let's eat together.

833
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,819
Together? Okay. See you at 7pm.

834
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,018
Okay. I'd like Chinese.

835
00:46:58,019 --> 00:46:59,819
We're having steak. I'll text the address.

836
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,190
(Senior Managing Director Lee Mi Jin)

837
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,329
What? Did she hang up on me?

838
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:09,129
My gosh. How can she be like this?

839
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:11,169
She comes and goes as she pleases,

840
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,670
and picks the menu too.

841
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:18,469
No. This kind of life is just not right.

842
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:20,480
I'll deal with it...

843
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,809
once and for all today.

844
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:34,259
Ms. Lee is here already.

845
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,989
I'll show you the way.

846
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,650
- You're here. - What?

847
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,590
- Hello. - Hello.

848
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,289
Yes. Hello.

849
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,069
What kind of situation is this?

850
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,509
I want to ask you that.

851
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,509
You wanted to eat together, so why are you so startled?

852
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,408
I meant you and me, just us.

853
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:29,138
You should've said so, then.

854
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,879
I said I'd be having dinner, and you wanted in.

855
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,948
I thought you'd join my party.

856
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,348
I'd never do that.

857
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:37,089
If you had dinner plans, you should've told me so.

858
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,919
I told you I'd be having dinner.

859
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,219
If I didn't have plans, I'd have said I'd go home.

860
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:44,030
Our communication is this broken down?

861
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,459
We never talked, so we never got to learn...

862
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,030
how each other speaks.

863
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,730
I showed up and said hi, so I'll pay for your dinner.

864
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:54,570
We can talk at home later.

865
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,138
You'll just leave?

866
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:57,969
You come all the way here, and you won't eat?

867
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:01,539
You wouldn't know,

868
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:04,449
but I'm shy.

869
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:18,889
I'm Seo Ju Won, Director of Marketing at AL Card.

870
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,460
Hello.

871
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,328
Mr. Lee says you can look around as you wait.

872
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,629
Is that okay with you?

873
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,670
Yes, of course.

874
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,268
A vibration-free truck will be at the studio...

875
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:31,638
by 9am tomorrow morning.

876
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:33,178
Professional packers will come too.

877
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,550
My team will help too, so you don't have to worry.

878
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,009
Okay. But Mr. Lee...

879
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,320
He has a thing about lighting.

880
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:42,578
I know.

881
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,718
A lighting company is available for a meeting at 11am.

882
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:46,760
Will he be free then?

883
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,260
How did you arrange everything so quickly?

884
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:55,900
This is incredible.

885
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,569
Do you need our help with anything, sir?

886
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:06,879
Shall we get you some wine?

887
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,939
No, it's fine. I can manage.

888
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,309
You don't have to worry.

889
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,710
Okay, then.

890
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,320
I preferred being alone.

891
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,730
You're home early.

892
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,000
Yes. We just had dinner.

893
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:33,340
You should've joined us instead of coming home to eat this.

894
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,639
What did you want to talk about at home?

895
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:48,079
I think we have some organizing to do.

896
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:49,480
Organizing? What organizing?

897
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:52,218
We had an excuse when we lived apart,

898
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:55,218
but now we must live together and sometimes work together.

899
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,559
It's silly that we can't communicate about simple issues like today.

900
00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:00,999
True.

901
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,469
As family, roommates, and business partners,

902
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,329
I'd like us to decide on some rules.

903
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:10,739
Okay. I admit that's necessary.

904
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:19,178
What I want the most...

905
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:21,349
is that you don't just give notifications.

906
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:23,719
Notifications...

907
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,820
We weren't in touch often,

908
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,718
but you could've told me in advance...

909
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:29,460
that you'd be moving back from France.

910
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:30,829
Oh, that?

911
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:34,000
My father notified me about that only after I flew in.

912
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,329
- Really? - Yes.

913
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:41,268
You could've alerted me about the situation.

914
00:51:41,269 --> 00:51:43,000
I'd have been less flustered.

915
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,038
It's not just a business issue.

916
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:47,980
We share a living space. How could I not know about that?

917
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:51,079
Okay. That was inconsiderate on my part.

918
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,250
I only told you what was official in case you were busy.

919
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,090
It would've been a notification on your part.

920
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,320
And actually...

921
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,889
I thought you didn't like being in touch.

922
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,669
Well, I don't enjoy being in constant contact with someone,

923
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,639
but that doesn't mean I dislike it.

924
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:16,139
Then...

925
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,110
should we be in touch?

926
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:20,409
Well...

927
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,880
Sometimes?

928
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:25,949
How about once a day, either a call, text, or DM?

929
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,919
To discuss our schedules...

930
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,320
or relay certain changes to our personal lives.

931
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,119
Sounds good.

932
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:37,760
Do you have any agendas you wish to discuss?

933
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,900
I won't have a baby for at least three years.

934
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,130
Okay.

935
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:48,839
That's easily solved...

936
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,440
by sleeping separately as we do right now.

937
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:55,078
Parts of this house can appear on my social media.

938
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:58,308
You know everything I wear and use is part of my business, right?

939
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,320
Yes. We agreed on that when we got married.

940
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:03,349
Oh, and we agreed not to post my face.

941
00:53:03,489 --> 00:53:04,689
Yes.

942
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,919
I'm well aware you're banned from using social media...

943
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,760
after the crying selfie.

944
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,460
Did you have to bring that up? It's embarrassing.

945
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,659
I assume we have a deal.

946
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,300
Let's shake on it.

947
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,300
Okay.

948
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,880
We didn't marry for love,

949
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:36,849
but I hope things don't get uncomfortable.

950
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:40,019
Even though we had to get married because our families promised.

951
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,488
That's not true.

952
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:44,159
I married you because you weren't too bad.

953
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:48,829
On the plane. I liked what you did.

954
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,940
Can I get you anything?

955
00:53:57,769 --> 00:53:58,909
I'm fine.

956
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,179
Then...

957
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,908
you fell for my sweet, gentle nature?

958
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:13,920
What?

959
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:17,050
What do you mean I fell for you?

960
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:19,489
I just appreciated what you did.

961
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,659
Don't be mistaken.

962
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:26,590
That woman.

963
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,130
She has a good eye.

964
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,769
I'm amazing.

965
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,739
What a successful deal.

966
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,880
Yes!

967
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,599
What time is it?

968
00:56:11,139 --> 00:56:12,340
(No Ye Young, Bae Jang Hee)

969
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,209
Where are you, Ms. Ha? It's bad over here.

970
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:17,579
We must take down all the artwork at AL Hanok Stay.

971
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,079
Ms. Ha, did you see the news? Call me right away.

972
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:29,289
Sorry. Was there a lot to do?

973
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,058
Ms. Ha. We just did as we were told.

974
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:34,000
- Director Seo did the hard work. - Yes.

975
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,529
He handled the media, found an artist, chose the pieces,

976
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,269
and even hired a packaging and moving company.

977
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,968
I see he learned a great deal from me.

978
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:45,309
He took care of everything so fast and without hesitation.

979
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:48,309
Seriously.

980
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:02,119
Let's get back to work.

981
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:06,289
I'm sorry.

982
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,159
I didn't imagine anything like this would happen.

983
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:13,369
You told me not to worry that you'd hand over your duties.

984
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:17,039
Then you suddenly took a half day and turned off your phone.

985
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:22,940
I didn't know you were so irresponsible.

986
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,650
I'm disappointed.

987
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:57,679
I thought I wouldn't mind if he was displeased with me.

988
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:02,550
It feels unfamiliar and saddening.

989
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:07,190
Let's all have a coffee break.

990
00:58:39,289 --> 00:58:40,559
Enjoy yourselves.

991
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,030
I never thought...

992
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,000
his displeasure would hurt so bad.

993
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:22,500
Since we're done eating, shall we get back to work?

994
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,929
- Yes. - Yes.

995
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,170
Hello, Mr. Lee.

996
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:39,710
Hello.

997
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,320
I'm Seo Ju Won. I heard a lot about you.

998
00:59:45,889 --> 00:59:47,059
It's nice to meet you.

999
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:50,659
Thanks so much for accepting our sudden offer.

1000
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:52,929
It wasn't sudden.

1001
00:59:53,429 --> 00:59:56,429
I'd been reading the proposals you'd sent over the past few months.

1002
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,399
It seemed like a good idea,

1003
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,939
but I was unable to put on an exhibition then.

1004
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,400
I was unable to accept it before.

1005
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,939
I'm sorry for refusing back then,

1006
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,179
Ms. Ha Yoon Seo.

1007
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:14,119
Not at all. I'm honoured to work with you.

1008
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,980
The honour is mine.

1009
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:19,289
We work to make a living.

1010
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,760
We should help each other out.

1011
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:38,408
A member of staff will assist you when you arrive.

1012
01:00:38,409 --> 01:00:39,570
Please do your best.

1013
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,210
Do help us out, please.

1014
01:00:41,409 --> 01:00:43,539
We'll be on our way, then.

1015
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,409
Take care.

1016
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:53,888
You worked hard all night.

1017
01:00:53,889 --> 01:00:55,860
Rest up over the weekend. I'll see you on Monday.

1018
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:59,158
Ms. Ha, you left your car by the river, right?

1019
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:00,899
You must take a taxi.

1020
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,829
- Come with me. - Okay.

1021
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:08,469
Goodbye, then.

1022
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:10,469
See you on Monday.

1023
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:16,309
Shall we leave too?

1024
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,210
Yes. Director Seo.

1025
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:22,879
Don't berate Ms. Ha for not taking your calls.

1026
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,348
She must've been so stressed out if she took a half day...

1027
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,849
and turned off her phone too.

1028
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:30,218
The truth is, the two of us went overboard...

1029
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:32,190
after finding out about you.

1030
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:34,599
- How do you mean? - Well...

1031
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:38,869
We happened to hear the chairwoman disapproved of her.

1032
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,638
We pushed her into the stairwell...

1033
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:43,238
so she wouldn't run into the chairwoman,

1034
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:45,408
and she ended up getting slapped by a cleaner.

1035
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:48,809
That's why I set her up on a blind date.

1036
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:53,678
Anyway, I feel partially responsible for Ms. Ha's half-day fiasco.

1037
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:56,250
I feel guilty and all that.

1038
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,559
You seemed to be having an important conversation.

1039
01:02:10,429 --> 01:02:11,429
Bye.

1040
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:30,419
It's all very sudden.

1041
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,420
Thanks so much for saying yes.

1042
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:34,919
I promise to sponsor the young artist program...

1043
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,460
you mentioned.

1044
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,229
I'll see you at your studio.

1045
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:40,230
Then, is Ms. Ha Yoon Seo coming later too?

1046
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:41,630
Pardon?

1047
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:43,699
She seems pretty interesting.

1048
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:53,569
I'm sorry for refusing back then,

1049
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:54,710
Ms. Ha Yoon Seo.

1050
01:03:29,179 --> 01:03:31,209
I didn't know you were so irresponsible.

1051
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,210
I'm disappointed.

1052
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:58,940
Why are you so down?

1053
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,010
You seemed fired up and spunky.

1054
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:05,280
I sent too many emails, didn't I?

1055
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,650
I'll see you again soon.

1056
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,320
Aren't you hungry?

1057
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,050
What?

1058
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:13,719
How about gukbap and soju?

1059
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,059
Oh, is it too early for soju?

1060
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:21,800
It's not that it's too early for soju.

1061
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:25,630
I don't think it would be right to drink alone with you.

1062
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,170
I'm honoured to work with you,

1063
01:04:30,139 --> 01:04:31,809
but I don't want things to be too personal.

1064
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,889
Not this psycho again.

1065
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:49,218
I should register the number as spam.

1066
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,860
(Menu: Report as spam)

1067
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,869
It would hurt if you were to report my number in my presence.

1068
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:05,239
You knew who I was from the start?

1069
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,880
How did you know that number was...

1070
01:05:08,539 --> 01:05:10,710
No. How did you know who I was?

1071
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:14,619
Let's get breakfast. I'll explain.

1072
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,150
Yes?

1073
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,400
Sorry.

1074
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:41,739
Listen.

1075
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,739
Will it get okay with time?

1076
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:45,610
Will that day even come?

1077
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:48,550
Yoon Seo.

1078
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:51,849
I can't stand seeing you with someone else.

1079
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:56,889
There will be no one else for me.

1080
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:01,300
Not even as an "if."

1081
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,300
Not even in the future.

1082
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:06,429
I can't love anyone else.

1083
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:10,739
As long as there's you.

1084
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,550
She seems cold, but she's interesting too.

1085
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,179
I'm interested.

1086
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:57,750
Don't cling to someone from the past and focus on work.

1087
01:06:58,289 --> 01:07:00,690
I really don't believe in destiny,

1088
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,719
but I almost did this time.

1089
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:04,288
I'll help you.

1090
01:07:04,289 --> 01:07:05,590
Go to the dinner...

1091
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,190
and get the girl.

1092
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,698
If Mr. Lee doesn't like me,

1093
01:07:09,699 --> 01:07:13,630
why would he come all the way from Jeju Island and go overboard?

1094
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,468
Are you awake, you darlings?

1095
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:19,469
What's this?

1096
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:21,110
What on earth happened?
