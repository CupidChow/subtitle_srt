With only one hope of leaving home,

21
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,489
I endured those times.

22
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,259

that nightmare...

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,370
had gone to sleep forever.

28
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,719
I felt deep sorrow.

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,549
Couldn't we have been happy like other families?

30
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,060

31

I don't know how much you heard,

45
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,080
but not all families are alike.

46
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,520
And I don't think of that woman...

47
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,060
as my mom.

48
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,389
I'm not sad at all.

49

Leave!

51
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,879
Then, why are you crying?

52
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:31,979
You say you're not sad.

53
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:37,860
I don't know.

54
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,289
I don't know.

55
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,680

56
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,310
But,

57
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,520
as he held me in his arms,

58
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,689
I suddenly felt...

59
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,719
like I was so pitiful.

60
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,029
That was why I cried.

61
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,670
It wasn't because my mother's death was sad.

62
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,110
I pitied myself so much.

63
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:48,189
I'm embarrassed.

64
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
What?

65
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,730
I said I was embarrassed...

66
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:55,600
for crying like that.

67

If you heard, you must know.

71
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:20,490
I didn't live a very stable life.

72
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,629
So, I think that was why...

73
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,930
I was so obsessed with having a happy family.

74
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,339
My childhood...

75
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,870
was always so pitiful.

"Pitiful?"

77
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,750
It must've been so hard, more than I could ever imagine.

78
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,850
You endured that life.

79
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,389
And you're so amazing for being so strong.

80
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,529
I've always thought that way.

81

111
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,580
I'm not saying this out of the blue.

112

It's something I've been thinking of every single day.

113

What's wrong with Yoon Seo?

118
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:48,788
You said before that when she was struggling with something,

119
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:51,490
she would work herself physically to get rid of that thought.

120
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,960
Is that what's going on now?

121
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,529
Maybe.

Let's talk.

126
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,370
- Why? I have to do this now. - Give me that.

It doesn't seem like something ordinary.

130

Have you decided to really end things with him?

131
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,829
He asked me to marry him.

132
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,870
What?

133
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,129
Seriously?

134
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,840
I just can't figure you guys out.

135
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,939
You say he's rich out of nowhere, you're breaking up suddenly,

136
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,979
and he suddenly comes to your house.

137
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,039
And now, you're suddenly getting married?

138
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,620
So? What did you say?

139
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,450
I said I'd think about it.

140
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,288
Ha Yoon Seo. I get that his family is a big deal,

141
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,490
but you two love each other so much.

142
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,460
But you can't get married just out of love.

143
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,230
If our marriage becomes known,

144
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:10,899
there will be news articles.

145
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,898
Then, people will wonder,

146
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,970
"Who's that regular woman that married the conglomerate son?"

147
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:17,440
They'll look into my personal life and talk about me.

148
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,409
Then,

149
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,820
Ji Seok might get hurt.

150
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,720
I'm scared too.

151
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,019
You've thought about all sorts of things, haven't you?

152
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,470
If you're lacking in some ways, you support each other.

153
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,799
If you're in pain, you caress the other.

154
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,539
I thought marriage was when you relied on each other like that.

155
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,580
But I don't know what I can do...

156
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,350
for Ju Won.

157
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,049
So,

158
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,990
I couldn't answer him right away.

159
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,928
What? You proposed to her?

160
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,029
- Yes. - Gosh, you're incredible, brother.

161
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,940
You got through Mother's opposition. You're actually getting married.

162
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,008
I'm not getting married. I just asked her to marry me.

163
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,710
Hey, that's the same thing.

164
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,278
I don't think I can leave Yoon Seo alone anymore.

165
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,350
Why, this little...

166
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,379
You left Mother all alone and left home.

167
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,519
I'll go back home soon.

168
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,789
I shouldn't avoid her anymore and try to convince her.

169
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,789
Gosh, but will she be convinced?

170
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,419
Don't you have anything good to say to me?

171
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,259
Oh, I'm sorry.

172
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:46,100
So? When will Yoon Seo give you her answer?

173
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,330
I'm not sure.

174
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,500
But I'm not going to rush her.

175
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,940
Until she takes plenty of time to think it over and answers me.

176
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,179
I'm going to wait for her for as long as it takes.

177
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,090
She doesn't look too happy.

178
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,620
She's not thinking negatively about our marriage, is she?

179
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,529
No, let's not do this.

180
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,629
Let's give her plenty of time. Yes.

181
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,299
But how long has it been?

182
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,929
It's only been an hour since I got to work?

183
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,669
Why is the time going by so slowly?

184
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,210
Si Won, do you like drinking during the day?

185
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,579
Do you want to take the afternoon off...

186
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,610
and go have some drinks?

187
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,049
Have you already had a drink?

188
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
What are you talking about?

189
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,989
I mean, it's because the time is going by so slowly.

190
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,289
I want to sleep, at least, but I can't.

191
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,190
Let's have some drinks. Okay?

192
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,789
Get out, punk. I have to work.

193
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,360
Si Won, please hit me with this once.

194
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:55,699
What?

195
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,428
I'll be knocked out for a while.

196
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,100
Please wake me when Yoon Seo messages me.

197
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
No.

198
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,440
(Vice Chairman Seo Si Won)

199
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,409
Would this be enough to knock me out?

200
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,980
Gosh, you must be out of your mind.

201
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,549
Gosh, seriously.

202
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,850
Si Won.

203
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:11,919
Go away!

204
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:13,879
Go away!

205
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,619
- Good work, everyone. - Good work.

206
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,528
- Good work. - Good work.

207
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:23,629
Shall we go now?

208
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,638
Si Won, can you go camping with me over the weekend?

209
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,169
Seo Ju Won, seriously...

210
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,210
He said he was going to wait after his proposal. Goodness.

211
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,840
Well, sure. I bet it's not easy.

212
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:42,649
(Wife)

213
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:49,019
Hello?

214
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,918
Hey, my meeting just ended.

215
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,960
What's up?

216
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,428
I'm in the lobby of your office.

217
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:56,028
I came for an urgent meeting.

218
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,230
"An urgent meeting?"

219
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:00,058
What urgent meeting would you have at my office?

220
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,869
The secretary's office is on alert...

221
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,500
because your photo was posted on social media.

222
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:04,870
Mother is coming up too.

223
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,370
What?

224
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,440
You. Have you started using social media?

225
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,079
Well, it was on my wife's social media.

226
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,219
So, it was just a tiny picture, Mother.

227
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,159
I looked like a piece of furniture in the background in that photo.

228
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:28,528
So, I know what you're worried about, Mother,

229
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,859
but the reaction isn't negative like it was before.

230
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,428
The reactions say things like, "It's heartwarming,"

231
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:34,969
"You look approachable," and "Everyone's lives are similar."

232
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,100
Something along those lines.

233
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,809
I will make sure not to be in photos even if it's just in the background.

234
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,269
There's no need for that.

235
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,609
From now on, don't be in the background.

236
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,350
Be in the forefront.

237
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,210
What?

238
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,579
Thanks to that photo,

239
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,518
all the rumors about our marriage have disappeared.

240
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,549
The rumors about our marriage being fake or about us getting divorced.

241
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,019
What...

242
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,359
There are even tabloid rumors...

243
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,230
that AL Corporation will be expanding with our reunion.

244
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,200
AL Corporation and the department store's stock prices have gone up.

245
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,170
- Really? - Yes.

246
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,369
Congratulations.

247
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,200
Your social media ban has been lifted as of today.

248
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,640
Right, Mother?

249
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,450
Gosh, you don't have to do this.

250
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,950
I'm off.

251
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:25,650
- Yes, Mother. - Bye.

252
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:30,490
- Are you that happy? - A bit.

253
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,059
You look super happy.

254
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,089
Well, hearing that the company is doing well, thanks to me,

255
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:37,959
makes me feel a stronger sense of responsibility.

256
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,258
Oh, you're happy as the vice chairman?

257
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,700
I do everything for their sakes in the end.

258
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,440
But that brat, Ju Won...

259
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:48,440
You're keeping a close eye on Ju Won, right?

260
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:52,339
Well, ma'am, that is...

261
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,809
Is something the matter?

262
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,219
Director Seo, I enjoyed lunch so much.

263
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,220
Sure.

264
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:02,489
You get along with us so easily...

265
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,319
that I keep forgetting that you're the chairwoman's son.

266
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,119
Let's talk for a minute.

267
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,740
Gosh. No way.

268
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:54,869
I've never seen the chairwoman so up close.

269
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,740
She's so charismatic, isn't she?

270
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,549
I was so shocked.

271
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,859
What on earth are you doing?

272
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,459
I'm going to get married.

273
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,729
Is that something you can decide on your own and notify me about?

274
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,099
You always did that too.

275
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:23,900
I was going to tell you once everything became clear.

276
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,799
I'll come home tonight.

277
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,670
I'll tell you in detail then.

278
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,140
You don't have to come.

279
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,380
Go to Spain.

280
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,179
- What? - You said you wanted to go.

281
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,609
You said you wouldn't allow it.

282
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:39,079
That girl.

283
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,390
I heard she handed in her letter of resignation.

284
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,389
I don't want to be so childish either,

285
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,460
but if you keep doing this, Ha Yoon Seo...

286
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,660
will never work here or anywhere else.

287
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,269
Here are the materials on financial policies in Spain.

288
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,569
Good job.

289
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,098
By the way, why Spain, all of a sudden?

290
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,108
And why is Director Seo going himself?

291
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:04,640
Oh, Director Seo going abroad has come up a few times before.

292
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,980
Is that all?

293
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,719
The chairwoman wanted an arranged marriage,

294
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,949
but it's not going her own way.

295
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,118
Really? Is Director Seo Ju Won going to Spain for good?

296
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,288
That's right.

297
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:19,758
The chairwoman tried to arrange his marriage,

298
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,558
but I guess Director Seo had a girlfriend.

299
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,328
So, I think he's being sent to Spain as if he's being exiled.

300
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:25,430
No way.

301
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,598
But that girlfriend is probably not someone in the company, right?

302
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,369
Come on. How could she be?

303
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,009
No way.

304
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,650
Big news!

305
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,409
Is there something bigger than seeing the chairwoman...

306
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,419
from 50cm away?

307
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,589
Director Seo has been appointed to the Spain office.

308
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,118
What? Why, all of a sudden?

309
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,489
The chairwoman called Ms. Ha and told them to break up.

310
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,758
But since they weren't able to break it off neatly,

311
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,259
I think the chairwoman is trying to send him off to Spain out of anger.

312
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,970
- Seriously? - Yes.

313
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:04,368
Figures. The chairwoman must be pressuring him,

314
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,298
and Ms. Ha is only going back and forth...

315
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,338
with how she feels about him.

316
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:09,440
Even I would want to leave the country.

317
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,680
As his senior in life, I felt so bad for him...

318
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,529
Is it true that you're going to...

319
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,299
the Spain office?

320
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,710
And what will you do if he says it is true?

321
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,579
Do you have the courage to hold onto him?

322
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,618
Okay, then, I'll make up a list of candidate artists...

323
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,819
for the support project and share it with you.

324
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,589
- Okay. - Good.

325
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,559
Thank you for that day.

326
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,599
For listening to my story.

327
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,630
You listened to my story too.

328
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,599
Let's call it even.

329
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,839
Okay.

330
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:14,839
By the way,

331
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,970
did you know it was me who called Seo Ju Won that day?

332
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,039
Really? I thought I had called him.

333
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,338
It was me.

334
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,450
You missed him so much that you kept asking for him.

335
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,119
You were struggling a lot, so I called him for you.

336
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:28,049
I was?

337
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:30,950
So, what happened to you two?

338
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:37,430
Seo Ju Won...

339
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,660
He's transferring to the branch office in Spain.

340
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:41,329
What?

341
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:44,400
Well, I'll be off then.

342
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,269
What is the problem?

343
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,440
I can totally see that you two love each other,

344
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,849
so I can't even butt in.

345
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:56,910
Why would you guys break up?

346
00:22:57,349 --> 00:22:58,650
Mr. Lee.

347
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:02,889
Do you know why Cinderella ran off...

348
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,119
with all her might before midnight?

349
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:06,859
Do you know the reason?

350
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,789
What are you talking about?

351
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,029
It was because she didn't want...

352
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,400
to look ugly in front of the man she loved.

353
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,268
Without the beautiful dress...

354
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:19,868
and the cool pumpkin carriage,

355
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:21,609
she knew she'd feel so small.

356
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,710
I know she ran away,

357
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,778
but the prince visited her with the shoe the next day,

358
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,180
and that totally changed her life.

359
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,578
What kinds of thoughts do you think...

360
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,720
were running through her head until the prince showed up?

361
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,259
From about 2am to the moment...

362
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,329
when she saw the prince at her door in the morning.

363
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:48,099
I bet they were the most difficult moments in Cinderella's life.

364
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,529
And for me,

365
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,338
such difficult moments will go on...

366
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:55,609
for a very long time.

367
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,279
Here's what I think.

368
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,909
If you were Cinderella,

369
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,650
you wouldn't just sit there and agonize yourself at 2am.

370
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:11,190
You kept sending the proposal even though I kept turning it down.

371
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,460
When someone provoked you while driving,

372
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:19,329
you shouted this. "Let's not do this since we're both struggling."

373
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,700
So knowing you,

374
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,670
I'd say you're different from the Cinderella we know.

375
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:30,308
If you wanted to see him, you wouldn't hesitate...

376
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:31,809
to go to his castle.

377
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,619
A choice where your happiness is guaranteed...

378
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,750
It doesn't exist, Ms. Ha Yoon Seo.

379
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,930
Well, I've done my job.

380
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:01,609
Gosh, I thought I was the prince.

381
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,640
Turns out, I'm the fairy.

382
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,859
I suddenly have to go to Spain. I'm leaving now.

383
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:29,930
I'll call you once I get things sorted out. Take care.

384
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,900
He's leaving today?

385
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,740
(I suddenly have to go to Spain. I'm leaving now.)

386
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:42,650
The moment...

387
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:46,420
I started thinking that I may no longer have him by my side,

388
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,150
I was reminded of how hard he tried...

389
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,319
to achieve the happiness that was never guaranteed.

390
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,359
From now on, I'll cling to you.

391
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,660
Will you really break up with me?

392
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,730
Do you not like me anymore?

393
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,970
I thought...

394
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:08,940
you'd also need someone to turn to on stressful days.

395
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,009
Now,

396
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,980
all I have is you.

397
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,150
Let's get married.

398
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:24,990
The truth is, I wanted to give him my answer over and over again.

399
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,960
Even though I knew he was waiting for my answer,

400
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,160
I couldn't say anything.

401
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,759
It frustrated me, and I resented myself for it.

402
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,529
But...

403
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:40,170
if this really is my last chance...

404
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,579
Seo Ju Won!

405
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
What...

406
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,819
What are you doing here?

407
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,160
I'd never get to say this if I didn't do it now, so I'm here.

408
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,559
I might want to run away again if I lost this chance.

409
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,569
I've been pushing you away...

410
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,769
because I was scared,

411
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,140
thinking I might not be the right answer for you.

412
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,150
- Yoon Seo. - But...

413
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,750
I won't run away anymore.

414
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,759
I like you.

415
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,000
I can't live without you.

416
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,079
Am I too late?

417
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,210
Then it's my turn to cling to you.

418
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,079
From now on,

419
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,680
I'll cling to you.

420
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,980
Mr. Seo, what are you doing here?

421
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:11,490
I didn't mean to watch you. I'm here to see Ju Won off.

422
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,990
Anyway, that was amusing... No, I mean...

423
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,829
I'm glad I got to witness such a touching moment.

424
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,169
You can leave now, you know?

425
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,599
Okay, I'm leaving.

426
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,170
Here.

427
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:31,439
And you. Just hang in there for the next five days.

428
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,539
Ju Won will be back soon.

429
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:34,309
Pardon me?

430
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:42,920
Five days?

431
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,160
Yes. It's too long, isn't it?

432
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,759
Wait. I thought you'd be there for a long time.

433
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
No.

434
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:53,900
What? What is going on...

435
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,969
But if you keep doing this, Ha Yoon Seo...

436
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,000
will never work here or anywhere else.

437
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:04,538
Would you be happy if she had nowhere to go because of you?

438
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:05,980
Why would Yoon Seo have nowhere to go?

439
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,509
She can come to me.

440
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,549
The contract with that Spanish company.

441
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,519
I know it's very important to you,

442
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,920
so I'll go.

443
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,920
We can talk again once I'm back.

444
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:31,329
Have a safe trip, you sad fool.

445
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:35,940
You have to get on the plane without winning her back.

446
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,940
I feel so bad for you.

447
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:41,639
Whatever.

448
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,348
Get going. I'll head in now.

449
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:44,849
Wait. I brought you something.

450
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,019
You'll have a lot on your plate, so I brought you some supplements.

451
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,259
Here.

452
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,420
This too.

453
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,130
Here.

454
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,289
Just hand them all over.

455
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Shoot.

456
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:05,599
Goodness. Oh, no!

457
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,410
Seo Ju Won!

458
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:14,609
What?

459
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,118
All passengers for KE 213 to Madrid, Spain,

460
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:26,558
please make your way to Gate Five now.

461
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,559
Oh, you should head in now.

462
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,890
I'll be off now.

463
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,930
You came here thinking I'd be there for a while?

464
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,430
Yes.

465
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,799
Do things change now that you know I'll be back in five days?

466
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,669
No, of course not.

467
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,240
All right, then. Do not take back what you said.

468
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,108
I won't.

469
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:48,380
Then promise me.

470
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,150
Yes, I promise.

471
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,519
No, not like this.

472
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,859
I'll have the legal team draft up a contract and make you sign it.

473
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,029
Do not take back what you said. You can't go back on your word.

474
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,430
Okay, I won't.

475
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,359
Do you love me?

476
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,430
Of course, I do.

477
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,480
You'll miss your flight. You should head in now.

478
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:23,950
I don't want to go.

479
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,920
Why do I have to be away for work at this important time?

480
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,049
This is the moment I've been waiting for.

481
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,460
I finally heard your answer.

482
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:36,559
Why do I have to leave today, of all days?

483
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,690
I just arrived at the hotel.

484
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,259
What are you up to?

485
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,259
Working, of course.

486
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,829
I can't wait to go back.

487
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,869
I really miss you.

488
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,369
(I can't wait to go back. I really miss you.)

489
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,140
I miss you too.

490
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,079
You haven't sent me a heart emoji in so long.

491
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:29,549
I'm sending you more hearts.

492
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,950
(I'm sending you more hearts.)

493
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,049
(I'm sending you more hearts.)

494
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,660
(4 days before Ju Won's return)

495
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:41,819
(Seo Ju Won)

496
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,259
Ye Young, look at this.

497
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,399
- Yes. - This card is...

498
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,129
- Hello? - My meeting just ended.

499
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,130
What are you up to?

500
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:51,900
Oh, I'm about to go into a meeting now.

501
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,039
I guess you're with people now.

502
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:56,470
I wish I could go into the meeting with you.

503
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,640
I really miss you so much.

504
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,380
I had to leave as soon as we got back together.

505
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,680
It's so awful, isn't it?

506
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,980
Yes, I agree.

507
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,889
By the way, you won't leave the company, right?

508
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:11,448
Oh, that's already been decided,

509
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,759
so I can't change my mind about it.

510
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,919
Why not?

511
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,829
Keep working with me. Please?

512
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,959
All right, then. I'll be in touch.

513
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,999
Gosh, seriously. You're so mean.

514
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,199
(3 days before Ju Won's return)

515
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,539
Hi, babe.

516
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,739
Me? I'm eating.

517
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:31,610
Ji Seok made me a rolled omelet.

518
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,940
Actually, you must miss Korean food.

519
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,820
A love shot? Oh, come on!

520
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:40,849
Yes.

521
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,489
My gosh, whatever. Stop it!

522
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,420
I hate to see her cry,

523
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,659
but this is worse.

524
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,268
(2 days before Ju Won's return)

525
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:02,038
(Day of Ju Won's return)

526
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,939
- Good luck! - Best of luck!

527
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,979
- Good luck on your exam! - Good luck on your exam!

528
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,010
(Best of luck on your CSAT! No second chance!)

529
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,749
- Good luck! - Best of luck!

530
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,049
- Good luck! - You got this!

531
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,249
(15th District, Examination Site 3)

532
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,119
Ha Ji Seok, don't be intimidated.

533
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,760
By the way, Yoon Seo,

534
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,889
I have to go to college, right?

535
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,659
Do you have to ask me this 30 minutes before your CSAT?

536
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,928
If I asked you after the exam,

537
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:30,530
you'd think it's because I bombed the exam.

538
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,999
It's been weighing on my mind for a while.

539
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,098
The tuition fees are very expensive, you know.

540
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,768
I don't want to waste your hard-earned money...

541
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:39,440
on something I'm not even passionate about.

542
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,780
Then what do you want to do?

543
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,949
I want to take some time off. Say, about a year.

544
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:50,488
I want to use that time to try out some part-time jobs...

545
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:53,260
and experience this and that to find what I really want to do.

546
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
You're all grown up now.

547
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,999
Yes, you don't have to feel anxious and run aimlessly...

548
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,469
just because everyone else is doing it.

549
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,839
I forced you to study...

550
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,340
because you were a student.

551
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,780
I just wanted you to do your best.

552
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Right.

553
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,509
Yoon Seo, I promise you I'll become successful...

554
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,980
and make sure you can live comfortably.

555
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,780
So, you have to live a long life. Okay?

556
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:25,119
I'll live to be 1,000 years old. You'd better be ready for that.

557
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,189
Go on in. Call me as soon as you're done.

558
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,659
Okay, bye.

559
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,000
When did he grow up so much?

560
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,739
Should I come with you when Ji Seok has his CSAT?

561
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,239
What?

562
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,010
Why would you come when Ji Seok has his CSAT?

563
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,848
Just because. It's always just the two of you,

564
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:51,909
so I wanted to tag along.

565
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,150
Don't worry about it.

566
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:57,320
It might make him uncomfortable before his exam.

567
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,260
I suddenly miss him.

568
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:33,590
What is this? What are you doing here?

569
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,030
I told you I'd be here on the day of his CSAT.

570
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,499
I didn't want to make him uncomfortable,

571
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,699
so I waited until he went inside.

572
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,369
I didn't want you to be alone on a day like this.

573
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:47,940
I had to work very hard...

574
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,239
to come here in secret and surprise you.

575
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,678
Really?

576
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:54,579
Yoon Seo, let's not go to work today.

577
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,809
- What? - I've been waiting for this day.

578
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,619
The day we can be together like this.

579
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:07,590
I missed you so much when I was in Spain.

580
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,530
I almost lost my mind because I really wanted to see you.

581
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:14,328
Director Seo. Snap out of it, please.

582
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:16,799
At a time like this, you must work even harder...

583
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,599
and never do anything others might disapprove of. You know that.

584
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,709
Why are you smiling?

585
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,609
Well, it's been so long since the last time...

586
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,679
you lectured me like this.

587
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,280
Can you keep going?

588
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,880
What are you saying?

589
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Let's go.

590
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:37,949
Okay.

591
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,690
Then I guess I can't skip work today.

592
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,900
I'll go over the things from the trip and come to you.

593
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,039
Are you all right?

594
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,610
Don't be so upset.

595
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,109
How could I not be upset?

596
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,219
Everyone got promoted except for me.

597
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,960
I swear, they said I'd get promoted this time!

598
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,519
I'm so depressed.

599
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,329
I mean...

600
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,198
When you were the only one who was promoted,

601
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,469
I understood the decision because you were more experienced than me.

602
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,239
But this time,

603
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:30,169
even Ye Young has been promoted to assistant manager.

604
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,179
Why did I get left out? Why?

605
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,109
That rich jerk.

606
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,110
He looked like he had a lot on his mind,

607
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:39,118
so I even took him to the octopus restaurant.

608
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,618
How could he betray me like this?

609
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:43,549
You know, Director Seo doesn't have the authority to...

610
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,848
Yes, he does!

611
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,489
I'm sure 50 percent of the decision came from him!

612
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,090
Ms. Ha, I'm so glad you broke up with him.

613
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,730
Why would you date a two-faced jerk like him?

614
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,169
No, go.

615
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,909
What? Why?

616
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,538
Just get out.

617
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:06,539
Get out?

618
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:23,590
It's very tense here right now.

619
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:26,230
(It's very tense here right now.)

620
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,500
Why? What happened?

621
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,499
Mr. Bae is really upset that he didn't get promoted.

622
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,340
Don't come here today.

623
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:38,939
Hang in there. Let's have something nice for dinner.

624
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,279
Ji Seok is having dinner with his friend,

625
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,610
so I'm free this evening.

626
00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:45,349
Okay.

627
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,360
(Vice Chairman Seo Si Won)

628
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:02,429
Vice Chairman, why don't we have lunch...

629
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,170
Hey, you.

630
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:06,500
What's going on? What's with that outfit?

631
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,469
Oh, I'm going to play tennis with Mi Jin in a bit.

632
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:14,210
She wants to take some pictures for her social media.

633
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,749
Right, you're now allowed to show your face on social media.

634
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,250
Well, it's no big deal.

635
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,349
You have to play tennis just to take some pictures?

636
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:22,320
Right? My point, exactly.

637
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:27,119
Maybe it's just an excuse to get a date with me.

638
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:29,888
Hey, she had Secretary Kim drop off this outfit for me...

639
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:31,289
so we'd show up in matching outfits.

640
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:35,329
My gosh. Matching outfits? How childish.

641
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,669
Anyway, have lunch with Yoon Seo.

642
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,940
I've got a date.

643
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,309
See you!

644
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,940
What is this?

645
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:50,449
Is something going on between them?

646
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:06,558
We could just meet there, but she insisted on meeting me here.

647
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,429
She kept saying we should go together.

648
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,070
She's so persistent.

649
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,639
- Hey, you. - Hi.

650
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,139
My gosh. It looks great on you.

651
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,578
Is this better?

652
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:23,980
No, this looks better.

653
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:28,949
Let's go.

654
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:35,929
Here, sir.

655
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,230
Why are you giving me this?

656
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,730
What do you think? You should drive, husband.

657
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,570
Oh, she wants to go alone with me.

658
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:51,468
I should get some pictures of you driving the car.

659
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:53,239
We're doing this to promote the new car.

660
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,280
Promote the new car?

661
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:58,309
That's right.

662
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,119
I'll see you later.

663
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,650
Wait.

664
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,489
This is...

665
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:20,868
Today, we'll promote this new car model first.

666
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:23,768
These clothes are from a new brand at the department store, so...

667
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,639
Do we really have to do this though?

668
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:28,440
We'll get bashed for promoting these things so obviously.

669
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,050
- We won't make it obvious. - Goodness.

670
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,379
You're a pro marketer.

671
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,249
What? Did you say I'm professional?

672
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,320
What?

673
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:39,889
Thanks. I hope I can teach you a few things.

674
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,190
You can do it, Seo Si Won!

675
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,610
Nice!

676
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,280
How much longer must I do this for?

677
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:09,919
Turn your head a little to the left.

678
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,149
To the left? Like this?

679
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,959
Not that much. Back to the right.

680
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,459
- Like this? - Yes.

681
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,820
Oh, my gosh.

682
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,800
Do it again.

683
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:21,559
Again?

684
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:28,099
Bounce the ball.

685
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,909
Here goes.

686
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,280
That's nice.

687
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:42,449
Stop!

688
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,090
The photos taken in the other court look much nicer.

689
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:49,659
Let's go back there.

690
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,429
She got crazy artistic today.

691
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,500
You'd think she thinks she's Bong Joon Ho.

692
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,730
Hurry up.

693
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,400
You're right. It's much prettier over there.

694
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,610
(This Year's CSAT, Easier Than Last Year)

695
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,150
Is the atmosphere still dark over there?

696
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:32,630
(Ji Seok)

697
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:37,739
Hi, Ji Seok.

698
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,980
I was looking up the CSAT in the news.

699
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,479
It was easier this year. Did you do well?

700
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,649
Yes, I did.

701
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:45,849
Marking the answers, I mean.

702
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:47,619
The paper was pretty fancy.

703
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,549
Oh, right. I was going to meet Seok Hyun for dinner,

704
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:54,288
but his nerves made him ill and he took a rain check.

705
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:56,888
- What? - Are you that pleased?

706
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:59,828
You got upset I was meeting a friend on such an important day.

707
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:01,829
Are you excited my plans fell through?

708
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,829
I want meat for dinner. Where shall we go?

709
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,739
Oh, well...

710
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:10,969
Here. It's nicely cooked.

711
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,308
My goodness.

712
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:16,579
You've been through so much, and I'm so proud of you.

713
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:17,710
Thanks.

714
00:46:17,711 --> 00:46:19,719
Here. Open wide.

715
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,989
I didn't study that much.

716
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,829
- Me? - Yes. Come on.

717
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,499
Good job, friend.

718
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,468
It must've been hard looking after a kid when you were a kid yourself.

719
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:41,538
Yoon Seo, have a drink. Well done, seriously.

720
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:43,738
Now that Ji Seok is grown up,

721
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,439
you can do whatever you want.

722
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,939
Yes, Yoon Seo. Stop worrying about me...

723
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,009
and spend all the time you want with Wimp.

724
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,050
Wait. Does Ji Seok know he proposed to you?

725
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,519
- He proposed? - For real?

726
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,488
What happened was...

727
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:01,589
You're cowering again.

728
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:04,460
Do you feel like cringing whenever his name comes up?

729
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,329
What's wrong?

730
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,070
Well...

731
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,799
I thought you'd need someone to lean on that day,

732
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,399
and that's why I called Wimp.

733
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,510
I'm okay with you getting back with him,

734
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,739
but I didn't think you'd discuss marriage already.

735
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:23,150
Thinking of how intimidated you'd feel in that house...

736
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,150
Did you give an answer?

737
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,689
I'm sure Seo Ju Won will be a good go-between.

738
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,518
Hey, bring him over one day.

739
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:35,589
I'll put him in his place so no one looks down on you.

740
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,629
Yes, that's right.

741
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:38,988
To be honest, I'm as good as family to you.

742
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,759
That makes me his mother-in-law.

743
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,860
- What? - I'll be the father-in-law, then.

744
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:44,268
I'll make him pay.

745
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:47,598
You're the brother-in-law. I'm the father-in-law.

746
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,308
Let's work on putting the rich heir in his place.

747
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:52,609
- We can do this. - Yes, we can!

748
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,909
What are you talking about? Who will you put in his place?

749
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,409
Goodness.

750
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,178
I'm the father-in-law.

751
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,690
Are you enjoying the party?

752
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:05,019
Can I join you?

753
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,689
- Let's not shy away. - Uncle.

754
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,888
Sorry. The atmosphere's a bit off today.

755
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:12,029
(Director Seo Ju Won)

756
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:14,059
The atmosphere there is off too?

757
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,500
Hey.

758
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,539
Seok Hyun feels better now. Can we go to an Internet cafe?

759
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,170
For real? Seok Hyun's okay?

760
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:26,639
That's great.

761
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:29,479
Were you that worried about him?

762
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,880
You bet I was. He's your friend.

763
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,579
- Go ahead. - Okay.

764
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:38,219
Shall we wrap up the party?

765
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:41,590
Yes, honey. I'm about to hail a taxi.

766
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:43,959
The party ended sooner than I thought.

767
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,960
Yes. Where shall we meet?

768
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,029
Shall we meet there for spicy braised monkfish?

769
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,058
Okay.

770
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,800
Let's mix soju and beer today.

771
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,070
Hang on.

772
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:55,840
(Chief No Ye Young)

773
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,839
Ye Young's calling.

774
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,010
I'll call you right back. Bye.

775
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,979
Hello, Ye Young. What's up?

776
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,078
Ms. Ha, I need your help.

777
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:09,518
Mr. Bae's saying he wants to quit.

778
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:11,250
- What? - Stay!

779
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,658
He's so upset that he didn't get promoted.

780
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:17,230
He won't even let me go home.

781
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:19,730
Oh, no, you don't. Are you insane?

782
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,698
He's saying he'll post all about you and the director...

783
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:23,799
- on our company website. - Seo Ju Won.

784
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,999
He wants to get back at Seo Ju Won and go down too.

785
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
What?

786
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:28,698
What's wrong with you?

787
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,038
Why are you climbing a tree?

788
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:33,139
Okay. I'll be right there.

789
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:37,779
The response is much better than we thought.

790
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,250
People are asking what you wore and what camera you used.

791
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,090
Good.

792
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,989
Aren't you hungry?

793
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,589
I want some hot soup.

794
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,459
How about kalguksu with Manila clams and geotjeori?

795
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,400
No. We're having dinner at your hotel.

796
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,399
You hired a Michelin chef from Italy and opened a new restaurant.

797
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,170
Your PR Team asked me to eat there.

798
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,309
Did they?

799
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:08,340
Okay. Let's go.

800
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:09,809
Okay.

801
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,280
What's the matter? Is he tired?

802
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:22,760
I could drive.

803
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,530
No, it's fine.

804
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,400
Okay. Thanks.

805
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:44,250
(On left-turn signal)

806
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:55,190
What got into you?

807
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,690
Let's eat kalguksu.

808
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,428
You need to take photos at the hotel.

809
00:50:58,429 --> 00:50:59,589
I changed my mind.

810
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,098
There's a famous kalguksu place at the market nearby.

811
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:04,399
I think I posted enough for the day.

812
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,469
Let's eat in peace.

813
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:08,840
Shall we drink makgeolli too?

814
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:12,239
Well, I guess we could.

815
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,519
What's the point in working like mad?

816
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:27,690
- I can't reach the next level. - Goodness...

817
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:30,460
Ms. Ha.

818
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,729
- Why did you drink so much? - Hello.

819
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,299
Hey, did you call for a driver?

820
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,428
Yes, I did.

821
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:38,369
Do you need my help?

822
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,499
I can drive.

823
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,999
- And I'll never get promoted. - I apologize.

824
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,268
- I'm sorry. - Let's go. He's drunk.

825
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:48,110
What is the matter with you?

826
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,808
You don't get me, do you?

827
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:54,119
Because Ye Young... You got promoted!

828
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,549
Ms. Ha. Does this even make sense?

829
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:01,460
She never works and always shops, and she got promoted!

830
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,129
What? I don't always shop.

831
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,299
I worked really hard and shopped in my free time.

832
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,328
I was good at spotting trends and came up with all the ideas.

833
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:11,968
I got acknowledged for that.

834
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:12,969
I know that.

835
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,799
Darn it! I can't take it anymore!

836
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,968
I'm a skilled worker that even the Planning Team wants.

837
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,809
Is that my fault? Is it?

838
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,940
(Seo Ju Won)

839
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:29,719
I need to take the call. Sorry.

840
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:31,789
(Ox tripe, Pork Belly)

841
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:32,789
Hi.

842
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,529
Mr. Bae's very drunk.

843
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:37,929
He must be very distressed.

844
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,859
Why wasn't he promoted when he was eligible?

845
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,400
I didn't sign off on it.

846
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:45,868
Why? Mr. Bae seems like a slacker,

847
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:47,570
but you know how hard he works.

848
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:48,839
I know.

849
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,340
So I recommended him for the manager position.

850
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:51,739
What?

851
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,480
You insisted on leaving...

852
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,109
and that leaves a vacancy.

853
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,809
I was going to give him your job.

854
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,280
But no one knows you resigned.

855
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,849
I thought it would be okay if I told him a few days later.

856
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,650
So that's what happened. That's good to know.

857
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:09,789
I'll sort things out here. Don't worry too much.

858
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:11,030
Okay.

859
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:14,329
We can meet today, right?

860
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:18,070
You bet. Hang in there for me.

861
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I will.

862
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,239
Enjoy your meal.

863
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,610
Gosh.

864
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:29,678
This is delicious. How do you know this place?

865
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:32,809
I'm in distribution and logistics and market research is a must.

866
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,820
Yes, that's right.

867
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:37,690
This is the first time I can relax and eat.

868
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,289
And it's my first time...

869
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:43,328
drinking makgeolli from a kettle like this.

870
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:45,230
It's so much fun. It's cute.

871
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,400
Then...

872
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,440
Take a photo.

873
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:55,769
Forget it.

874
00:53:57,539 --> 00:53:59,710
Did you notice I haven't taken a photo here?

875
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
Didn't you?

876
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,209
I didn't. I want to so bad, but I'm holding back.

877
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,550
Because you look sick of taking photos.

878
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,349
I wasn't sick of it. Just hurt.

879
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:14,190
I'd gotten excited about our first date outdoors.

880
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:17,760
But you seemed to think of it only as work.

881
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,960
What? Do you like me?

882
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,340
What are you talking about?

883
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:35,039
You say all sorts of darned things.

884
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:38,050
Yes, I do. Am I drunk already?

885
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,018
Do you want another drink?

886
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,460
Yes, why not?

887
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,468
To tell the truth, I took lots of photos today...

888
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:06,440
because I thought you were enjoying it.

889
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:08,079
What?

890
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,650
You seemed to like posting on social media.

891
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,618
Our stock prices went up, and your mother seemed pleased too.

892
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:18,550
So I did all that thinking I was doing you a favor.

893
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,989
I went too far.

894
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,510
I must've had too much to drink.

895
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:48,650
Let's go home.

896
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:53,619
Wait up.

897
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,360
Excuse me. Coming through.

898
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:25,849
What do I do?

899
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,429
It sounds weird to say this when we're already married but...

900
00:56:32,659 --> 00:56:33,659
I think...

901
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,570
I fell for you.

902
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,320
Hi, Mom.

903
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,760
Was I promoted?

904
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,360
Yes.

905
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:06,829
Of course.

906
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:08,999
I'll get a raise too.

907
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,768
Right now, I'm with...

908
00:57:11,769 --> 00:57:14,638
my teammates who are celebrating with me.

909
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,670
I'll call you tomorrow.

910
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,440
Should I just tell him?

911
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,178
No, this is a personnel issue.

912
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:23,409
Ju Won should tell him.

913
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:24,750
Here you go.

914
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:27,849
Oh. Thank you.

915
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,460
What the heck?

916
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,690
Don't.

917
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:44,369
Darn you!

918
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,199
How dare you come here?

919
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:49,069
Did you come to laugh at my tear-stained face?

920
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:51,268
No. I came because I was concerned.

921
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:53,239
Concerned? You?

922
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:54,710
- I will... - Stop him.

923
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:56,738
give you some final advice.

924
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,150
You punk.

925
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,018
Don't mistreat people who work for you!

926
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,078
Stop it! That's enough!

927
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,549
I'm leaving soon,

928
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:07,190
and you'll replace me as manager.

929
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:08,989
What?

930
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:12,260
You tell him, sir.

931
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,158
I should've told you sooner,

932
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,929
but it was tied to Ms. Ha's resignation.

933
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:20,900
I didn't promote you so you could replace Ms. Ha after she left.

934
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,000
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

935
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:31,780
I'm sorry.

936
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:38,889
We're alone at last.

937
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,989
It was such a long, rough day.

938
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,360
It was.

939
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,159
I'd never waited for someone for this long in my life.

940
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:53,369
I think I spent the last few days doing nothing but wait.

941
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:55,968
I waited for an answer from you,

942
00:58:55,969 --> 00:58:57,539
and for the day to see you again.

943
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,280
And for us to go on a date.

944
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:06,280
What shall we do?

945
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,849
I don't mind. Let's do what you want.

946
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:16,260
(Secretary Seo Dong Hwa)

947
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:20,329
We won't be disturbed again, will we?

948
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,730
I hope not?

949
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,328
Forget it. I just won't pick up.

950
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:29,469
What if something urgent came up at work?

951
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,039
Pick up.

952
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:37,550
Hello?

953
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,519
Oh, really?

954
00:59:57,829 --> 00:59:59,369
Sorry for making you wait.

955
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:02,400
I'm done. Shall we go?

956
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,150
Is this where you've been staying?

957
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,190
Yes.

958
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:20,489
I'll move back home.

959
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:22,489
Don't worry.

960
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:25,530
I'm not worried.

961
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:28,929
I just feel bad.

962
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:38,510
I see...

963
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:42,710
you put up with a lot of things...

964
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,250
and struggled through stuff to be with me.

965
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:57,230
Thank you...

966
01:00:58,659 --> 01:00:59,659
for waiting.

967
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,530
I thank you more...

968
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,300
for coming back.

969
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:45,340
I missed you.

970
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,158
I came to return the money you gave me.

971
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:11,659
You seem to be mistaken.

972
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,059
Now that I'm back with you, I'll go straight ahead.

973
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,598
- Ta-da. - My goodness.

974
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,730
Dear...

975
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:20,269
Who's calling you "dear?"

976
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:24,369
Are you sure this is for and about me?

977
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,808
I feel so very uncomfortable.

978
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:29,109
Do you have a first love? Well, so do I.

979
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:30,880
Someone I loved so deeply.

980
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,179
Isn't this jealousy?

981
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:35,719
Can't you just approve of us?

982
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,449
I want to be happy now.
