[White Cat Legend]

3
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,080
[Episode 31]

4
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,670
Li Bing?

5
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,540
Take him down!

6
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,950
Arrow!

7
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,860
After him!

8
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,610
This...

9
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,430
A cat?

10
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,510
Chen Shi.

11
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,430
This is our vice minister?

12
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,630
Vice Minister is so cool.

13
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,200
So Vice Minister is the demon cat?

14
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,210
What demon cat?

15
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,650
He's the Cat Hero.

16
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,790
So cool.

17
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,829
He actually...

18
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,630
Could our vice minister

19
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,630
be in danger?

20
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,390
Mr. Li?

21
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,290
He's fine.

22
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,530
So cool!

23
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,480
-Vice Minister!
-Vice Minister!

24
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,750
So Vice Minister

25
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,830
is not human.

26
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,140
He's half-human and half-cat.

27
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,170
No wonder.

28
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,950
I was wondering why his sense of smell

29
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,870
was so sharp.

30
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,110
So Zixu State's myth

31
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,400
about the Fengsheng Beast

32
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,070
is true.

33
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,490
Are there really such fantasies?

34
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,090
Vice Minister

35
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,250
only became like this after

36
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,690
the former Minister of Judicial Review died.

37
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,650
Everything

38
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,350
is related to the killer

39
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,790
who likes to take people's teeth,

40
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,390
right?

41
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,310
After he killed the mason,

42
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,360
he left a note

43
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,090
with Zixu State's characters.

44
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,110
Previously,

45
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,550
the Jinwu Guard who showed up

46
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,409
in Chen Village

47
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,810
is him, right?

48
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,480
What

49
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,130
Xu Hu and I encountered

50
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,480
in Huangsha Valley of Zixu State

51
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,510
seems to be related

52
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,710
to this beast as well.

53
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,280
Vice Minister

54
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,350
didn't want us to know

55
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,660
the secret that he is a cat

56
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,180
because he didn't want to endanger us.

57
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,710
That's why he chased us out.

58
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,490
I didn't say anything.

59
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,180
You said it yourselves.

60
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,740
Let's wait

61
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,220
until Mr. Li wakes up to talk about it.

62
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,470
Don't move.

63
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,620
Did you escape from the slave camp?

64
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,630
Father.

65
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,830
Are you hiding here

66
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,650
to secretly read the dossiers again?

67
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,370
You specially took it home

68
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,630
and put it on the table.

69
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,110
It must be

70
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,350
a difficult case.

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,400
I figured out something.

72
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,320
Let me hear it.

73
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,590
Father.

74
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,909
This man's statement is a bit strange.

75
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,320
The two places are not far apart.

76
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,750
It doesn't match his time needed to travel on foot.

77
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,390
So when the incident happened,

78
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,390
he should have been somewhere else.

79
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,850
Father, what do you think?

80
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,170
Just as you think.

81
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,810
I'll send someone to check it.

82
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,180
Li Fu told me you want to

83
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,470
visit the Zixu Embassy.

84
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,150
Don't mind that, Father.

85
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,070
It was just a spur-of-the-moment

86
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,210
decision.

87
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,670
I think it's better to stay at home.

88
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,270
You should read more.

89
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,590
You can read the stuff in my study

90
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,370
that you haven't read.

91
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,970
Thank you, Father.

92
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,440
I have work to do tonight.

93
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,909
Don't wait for me for dinner.

94
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,740
Yes, Father.

95
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,690
[Be cautious and remember the past]

96
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,440
These are Zixu characters.

97
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,380
Could it be the envoy's notes?

98
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,410
Li Fu told me you want to

99
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,690
visit the Zixu Embassy.

100
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,160
Don't mind that, Father.

101
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,270
It was just a spur-of-the-moment

102
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,380
decision.

103
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,680
I think it's better to stay at home.

104
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,230
Don't tell me

105
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,830
you stole it?

106
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,640
No, I didn't steal it.

107
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,120
I ate your pastries.

108
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,570
So this is to repay you.

109
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,970
Don't go.

110
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,690
I didn't expect you to come again.

111
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,110
I don't like to owe others.

112
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,790
The pastries you ate last time

113
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,350
were made by

114
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,550
a foreign chef.

115
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,790
Do you think you can call it quits

116
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,510
with just this tattered piece of sheepskin?

117
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,310
This is obviously what you want.

118
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,350
My name is Li Bing.

119
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,350
What's your name?

120
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,600
Qiu Qingzhi.

121
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,790
Anything else?

122
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,180
How's business?

123
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,830
Not bad.

124
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,770
This is for you.

125
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,250
You're sensible.

126
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,090
Here.

127
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,560
Here.

128
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,590
Here you go.

129
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,750
Nice. Sit down.

130
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,250
Okay.

131
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,490
Are you a seller?

132
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,660
I've never seen you before.

133
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,040
What are you selling?

134
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,510
Lingzhi.

135
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,590
Lingzhi?

136
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,430
30 yuan.

137
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,430
Don't touch it if you're not buying it.

138
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,290
Don't touch it?

139
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,840
In this place,

140
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,550
there's nothing I can't touch.

141
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,080
In the future, watch out.

142
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,330
Pay me!

143
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,510
Pay for what?

144
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,520
Pay me!

145
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,690
-You are...
-Stop!

146
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,290
He's bullying others again.

147
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,430
I'm afraid

148
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,950
you're going to lose your hands.

149
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,790
What's going on?

150
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,030
You hurt me!

151
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,420
You can

152
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,750
only blame yourself.

153
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,400
This lingzhi is unique.

154
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,640
This kind of lingzhi

155
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,510
usually

156
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,810
has poisonous insects accompanying it.

157
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,230
Look.

158
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,310
I read it in a book.

159
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,870
This kind of insect hibernates in the lingzhi

160
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,980
all year round.

161
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,730
It will only emerge out

162
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,310
after three springs.

163
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,630
This spring insect is also known as the stupid insect.

164
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,040
If ordinary people get infected,

165
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,660
their skin will first ulcerate

166
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,750
and then their limbs will become numb.

167
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,910
There's no cure.

168
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,590
I presume

169
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,150
he already reminded you

170
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,010
not to touch it.

171
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,490
Unfortunately,

172
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,210
you didn't listen.

173
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,390
What should I do?

174
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,860
How can I get rid of the poison?

175
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,710
Tell me now!

176
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,960
Chop off your hands,

177
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,470
lest the poisonous energy rushes up

178
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,950
and invades the heart meridian.

179
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,670
Otherwise,

180
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,190
no medicine can cure you.

181
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,210
If you don't want to chop them off,

182
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,070
it's fine too.

183
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,840
What solution is there?

184
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,120
How much did you say the lingzhi is?

185
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,130
It's three...

186
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,300
300 taels, right?

187
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,120
Three...

188
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,740
300 taels.

189
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,560
You're extorting me!

190
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,830
You destroyed his lingzhi first.

191
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,870
If you don't want to give it to him,

192
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,810
then I'm leaving.

193
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,530
Wait!

194
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,190
I'll pay.

195
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,400
That's all I have.

196
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,190
Take these crushed lingzhi back.

197
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,350
Take them every eight hours.

198
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,360
You'll be fine after drinking it three times.

199
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,190
That's it?

200
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,150
Letting the lingzhi and insects be together is the antidote.

201
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,350
I've given you the solution. Leave now.

202
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,150
Wait.

203
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,790
I only wanted 30 yuan.

204
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,950
I don't want more.

205
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,200
Thank you.

206
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,870
Thank you.

207
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Thank you so much.

208
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,630
Thank you.

209
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,620
You're welcome.

210
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,150
Don't you think I came here

211
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,170
just in time?

212
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,050
What's up with that stupid insect?

213
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,410
I lied to him.

214
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,850
There's no stupid insect.

215
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,430
That insect was a tiger beetle.

216
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,670
It was hiding in the lingzhi.

217
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,270
It sprays juice when stimulated

218
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,950
and causes the skin to become red and swollen.

219
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,150
It actually doesn't need to be treated.

220
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,510
Young Master.

221
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,100
Young Master.

222
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,870
It's almost time for Master to return home.

223
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,670
I got it.

224
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,830
I sneaked out today.

225
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,210
I have to go back now.

226
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,960
Come and find me when you have time.

227
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,710
Young Master.

228
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,420
Don't think about going out.

229
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,970
Master has someone guarding the door.

230
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,340
Just give up.

231
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,210
Take the medicine and focus on reading,

232
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,190
so that Master won't worry.

233
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,930
This is your new hand warmer.

234
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,740
All right.

235
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,610
You may leave.

236
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,050
Okay.

237
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,510
Come on.

238
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,840
Let's go.

239
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,930
Young Master.

240
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,750
You're finally back.

241
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,960
You scared me.

242
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,970
It's you again.

243
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,750
It's indeed you who coerced my young master

244
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,750
to run away from home.

245
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,550
It wasn't him.

246
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,170
I went out on my own accord.

247
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,600
Young Master, you have no idea.

248
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,670
After I met him last time,

249
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,000
I've been watching him.

250
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,370
He is not a good person.

251
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,730
He's a fugitive slave.

252
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,310
Run!

253
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,470
Young Master!

254
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,510
If you'd come back an hour later,

255
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,260
you'd be past your curfew.

256
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,310
You can't stay in contact with him

257
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,150
anymore.

258
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,369
You have to promise me!

259
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,589
He is my friend.

260
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,160
He's a fugitive.

261
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:13,990
So what?

262
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,109
He has no parents and doesn't own any land,

263
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,300
but he was forced to do hard labor

264
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,180
for one and a half years.

265
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,150
If it were me, I would have run away too.

266
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,280
That's what I think.

267
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,190
He doesn't steal or rob.

268
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,510
He makes a living through his own labor.

269
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,740
What's wrong with that?

270
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,200
I...

271
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,660
What's more, isn't it ridiculous to judge people

272
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,590
based on their backgrounds

273
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,650
without looking at

274
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,510
their character?

275
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,870
But...

276
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,010
I will help him.

277
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,710
Go

278
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,830
get the court law book for me.

279
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,960
Yes.

280
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,390
Wait.

281
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,360
Not just the court law book,

282
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,740
but also the dossiers

283
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,670
of fugitives

284
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,330
in the previous and current dynasties.

285
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,130
Young Master.

286
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,260
There are none in this mansion.

287
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,520
They are in the Court of Judicial Review.

288
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,380
Kid.

289
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,290
You're good at hiding.

290
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,440
I've been looking for you everywhere.

291
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,890
You don't dare to show your face

292
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,290
in the market now, do you?

293
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,630
Give me back the money you cheated me last time.

294
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,270
Otherwise,

295
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,550
I'll bring you to court

296
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,580
and have you sentenced to be a slave!

297
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,750
You still want to escape?

298
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,950
Do you really think I'm stupid?

299
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,150
Pay me the money back.

300
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,370
I don't have money.

301
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,830
You don't have money?

302
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,870
Then you can use this to offset your debt.

303
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,870
Give it back to me.

304
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,030
Give it back to me!

305
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,110
-Give it to me.
-Give it back!

306
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,030
Murder! Murder!

307
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,510
Murder! Murder!

308
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,460
Young Master.

309
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,950
Something happened to your friend.

310
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,790
Do you plead guilty?

311
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,390
Who are you?

312
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,510
My Lord.

313
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,080
Please listen to me.

314
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,910
He served in the slave camp.

315
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,640
According to the law, he's free once he becomes an adult.

316
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,000
When he left the slave camp last year,

317
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,140
he was already 15 years old.

318
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,300
It's not really considered an escape.

319
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,140
Even so,

320
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,670
he seriously injured Wang Ma.

321
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,870
I'm afraid Wang Ma

322
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,520
wouldn't be able to work anymore.

323
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,950
It'd be hard for him to go work in the farms either.

324
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,210
Wang Ma is a scoundrel.

325
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,610
If you investigate it, you will know.

326
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,160
Is there a difference between those

327
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,620
who cause serious injury?

328
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,470
I'm not talking about some difference,

329
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,390
but that everything has a cause.

330
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,390
Wang Ma

331
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,270
habitually bullied the weak

332
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,850
and bullied everyone in the neighborhood.

333
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,070
Someone reported it to the government.

334
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,310
But your department didn't accept it.

335
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,910
That's why he was able to keep being tyrannical

336
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,270
and causing trouble blatantly.

337
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,310
I'm curious.

338
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,650
My Lord, what bribery did you accept from him

339
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,250
for you to ignore this matter before?

340
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,010
How dare you!

341
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,300
How about

342
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,610
you investigate it again?

343
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,450
Leave. Leave.

344
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,910
Don't bother.

345
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,930
How do you suggest we handle this case?

346
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,150
Young Master, please be frank.

347
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,870
In my opinion,

348
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,550
Wang Ma deserved it.

349
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,650
And there are indeed extenuating circumstances in his case.

350
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,390
I believe

351
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,660
you didn't mean it.

352
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,090
But it's impossible

353
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,520
for him to be acquitted.

354
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,850
Why don't you make him a slave again?

355
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,080
Are you willing?

356
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,070
That's great.

357
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,100
Great.

358
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,010
Wait for me here.

359
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,910
Okay.

360
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,510
Father!

361
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,580
Father.

362
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,170
There are indeed extenuating circumstances in his case.

363
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,150
It's my fault for taking the official seal without permission.

364
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,010
I won't complain if you punish me.

365
00:22:59,500 --> 00:22:59,940
But

366
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,270
if you want me to ignore him,

367
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,490
I can't do it.

368
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,080
This does not justify you abandoning your principles for private matters.

369
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,790
Come in.

370
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,850
I hurt the man.

371
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,620
I'll do whatever you ask of me.

372
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,760
What are you doing?

373
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,230
Fine.

374
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,910
Send him to the government office.

375
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,420
Since you've hurt someone,

376
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,890
you should be punished.

377
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:31,820
Father.

378
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,130
You don't have to defend me.

379
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:33,580
You...

380
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,000
Li Bing.

381
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,590
You stole my seal.

382
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,140
You'll be grounded for three months

00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,440
that you...

574
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,310
Yes.

575
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,440
Then did you

576
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,590
want us to leave Shendu

577
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,880
so that you can take the risk

578
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,840
to show up in front of Her Majesty as the cat

579
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,330
to attract her attention,

580
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,510
so that you can investigate the case thoroughly?

581
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,110
Yes.

582
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,810
Vice Minister.

583
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,760
Do you think

584
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
this matter has nothing to do with us

585
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,110
so we should ignore it,

586
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:23,830
or

587
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,370
are you worried about our safety?

588
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,430
My Lord.

589
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,960
As soon as you came to the Court of Judicial Review,

590
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,960
you asked us to revive Mingjing Hall

591
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,590
and told us that the Court of Judicial Review's

592
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,530
purpose is

593
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,350
to uphold the law and distinguish right and wrong.

594
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,190
Such a big case

595
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,150
is the case of the Court of Judicial Review.

596
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,190
Even if you don't allow us

597
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,590
to investigate with you,

598
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,700
we won't give up.

599
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,310
Yes, Mr. Li.

600
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,420
Even with just one person missing,

601
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,980
Mingjing Hall will no longer be Mingjing Hall.

602
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,840
Vice Minister.

603
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,790
In the past, I had only one brother,

604
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,430
Hu.

605
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,350
But now you are all

606
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,080
my brothers.

607
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,910
You also have to treat us

608
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,910
as your brothers.

609
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,700
We're willing to risk our lives for you.

610
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,190
No need.

611
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:49,870
Leave.

612
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:50,960
Yes.

613
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,340
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

614
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,910
I pleaded guilty

615
00:38:58,730 --> 00:38:59,990
and the case is closed.

616
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,090
I just want to ask you

617
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,650
when I can leave.

618
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,820
The ship is ready.

619
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,440
My Lord.

620
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,630
Please don't be anxious.

621
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,570
You said the same thing the other day.

622
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,400
Qiu Qingzhi.

623
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,610
Don't treat me like a fool.

624
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,920
I dare not.

625
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,020
Everything is going

626
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,450
according to the Pavilion's arrangement.

627
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,590
They want to burn the bridge after crossing it.

628
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,210
People in Yong'an Pavilion think

629
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,920
that as long as you lock me up,

630
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,320
everything will be fine.

631
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,540
Or

632
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,770
if they just let me die,

633
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,420
they can rest assured.

634
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,070
But you...

635
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,980
had better not think like that.

636
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,450
My Lord, what else do you want to ask?

637
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,790
I know something else

638
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,840
related to you.

639
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,270
For example,

640
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,130
what Yi Zhi Hua is.

641
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,550
I also know that.

642
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,380
That's why I said

643
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,830
I was waiting for you.

644
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,700
[Court of Judicial Review]
