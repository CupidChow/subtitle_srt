[Episode 32]

4
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:51,950
My Lord.

5
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,350
As soon as you came to the Court of Judicial Review,

6
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,350
you asked us to revive Mingjing Hall

7
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,590
and told us that

8
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,190
the Court of Judicial Review's purpose is

9
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,870
to uphold the law and distinguish right and wrong.

10
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,780
Such a big case

11
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,670
is the case of the Court of Judicial Review.

12
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,660
Even if you don't allow us

13
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,060
to investigate with you,

14
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,350
we won't give up.

15
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,710
Yes, Mr. Li.

16
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,830
Even with just one person missing,

17
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,470
Mingjing Hall will no longer be Mingjing Hall.

18
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,329
Vice Minister.

19
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,230
In the past, I had only one brother,

20
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,950
Hu.

21
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,510
But now

22
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,880
you are all my brothers.

23
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,829
You also have to treat us

24
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:26,829
as your brothers.

25
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,670
We are willing to

26
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,930
risk our lives for you.

27
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,310
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,320
Thank you for saving me.

29
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,550
In a while,

30
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,250
let's talk about the case.

31
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,910
Okay.

32
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,370
Let's talk about the case.

33
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,720
Talk about the case.

34
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,970
Does it still hurt?

35
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,190
No.

36
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,720
Don't record it.

37
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,740
Vice Minister.

38
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,180
Here.

39
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,930
Thanks.

40
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,180
Hang on.

41
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,230
Wait.

42
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,590
Why is mine

43
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,890
different from yours?

44
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,829
Sun Bao caught

45
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,890
this mouse for you,

46
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,590
no,

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,030
this rat.

48
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,950
Yes, Vice Minister.

49
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:32,710
Eat it while it's hot.

50
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,970
I only caught this one.

51
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,870
I think you have some misunderstandings

52
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,910
about me.

53
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,290
I'll eat it.

54
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,610
I'll eat it.

55
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,550
Eat up.

56
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,230
During this time,

57
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,710
let me tell you

58
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,210
what happened in Shendu these past few days.

59
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,510
I'd already gained

60
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,710
Her Majesty's attention,

61
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,230
so I could re-investigate the Demon Cat Case.

62
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:12,950
But Lai Zhongshu

63
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,990
suddenly took over the case

64
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,470
at this time

65
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,400
and even insisted that

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,130
I am the suspect of the old case.

67
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,550
Her Majesty is shaken up by that.

68
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,670
Lai Zhongshu isn't

69
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,570
someone who keeps his composure.

70
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,950
He must have suddenly attacked us

71
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,830
because he found

72
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,670
some other conclusive evidence

73
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,870
from somewhere else.

74
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,820
That means...

75
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,260
someone knew who I was long ago

76
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,710
but kept it a secret.

77
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,350
My Lord.

78
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,710
Could it be

79
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,550
a Jinwu Guard?

80
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,870
Someone who can do this

81
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,690
should have a higher rank than the Jinwu Guards.

82
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,780
Yong'an Pavilion?

83
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,690
Yong'an Pavilion is full of senior officials from several dynasties.

84
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,600
They're controlling the court secretly.

85
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,750
Few people have been in contact with them.

86
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,270
Then

87
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,600
your assassination to silence you

88
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,040
was also ordered by Yong'an Pavilion?

89
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,520
The person who shot me was Qiu Qingzhi.

90
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,670
As the general

91
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,600
of Jinwu Guards,

92
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,640
he is working for Yong'an Pavilion.

93
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,220
How convenient.

94
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,350
Vice Minister, have you known Qiu Qingzhi

95
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,620
for a long time?

96
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,860
When I got acquainted with him,

97
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,670
I was still a teenager.

98
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,409
Vice Minister!

[Jinwu Guards]

100
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,710
A Jinwu Guard?

101
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,590
Are you Qiu Qingzhi's man?

102
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,300
Tell me!

103
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,550
Where did Qiu Qingzhi

104
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,550
station his men?

105
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,570
Sun Bao.

106
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,360
Wait, you...

107
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,010
Vice Minister.

108
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,320
Weren't you asking me to knock him out?

109
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,710
He was asking you to interrogate him.

110
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,640
Interrogate...

111
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,600
Let's hurry and go somewhere else.

112

It's me!

116
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,750
My Lord.

117
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,910
Untie me!

118
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,270
Yes.

119
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,990
Where are they now?

120
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,910
They were hiding in a shabby temple just now.

121
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,110
We have no idea where they are right now.

122
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,110
Pass my order.

123
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,150
Seal off the area around the shabby temple

124
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,190
within a radius of 3 miles

125
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,720
and interrogate everyone.

126
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,440
Yes, sir.

127
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,950
Alibaba.

128
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,550
The clothes you got

129
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,310
don't fit at all.

130
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,000
They all belong to others.

131
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,530
Don't be picky.

132
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,070
Yeah.

133
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,790
It's good enough that we have stuff to wear.

134
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,240
They are all regular clothes

135
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,750
that don’t look like

136
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,550
stuff from a wedding sedan shop.

137
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,190
I borrowed them from another shop.

138
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,490
You borrowed them?

139
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,430
Don't tell me you stole them?

140
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,490
Stealing is wrong.

141
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,830
I left some money there

142
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,030
that's more than enough to pay for these clothes.

143
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,140
When we get out,

144
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,510
I'll visit them to apologize in person.

145
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,430
Forget it.

146
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,250
After this matter is over,

147
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,070
if you want to apologize,

148
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,130
let's go together.

149
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,950
Everyone,

150
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,910
I have something

151
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,390
to discuss with you.

152
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,230
At this rate,

153
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,200
this won't work.

154
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,710
We need to find out

155
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,270
the connection between these cases.

156
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,110
Maybe then could we overturn the verdict.

157
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,110
The truths that the Minister of Defense

158
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,950
want to hide

159
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,950
are more than we thought.

160
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,310
I want to look for

161
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,110
Lord Shangguan again

162
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,909
to see if I can find out anything.

163
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,200
My Lord, please.

164
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,990
I

165
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
won't see you off.

166
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,270
Slow down.

167
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,860
Yes.

168
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,610
I told you to slow down. Can't you hear me?

169
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,600
This is not the way to the wharf.

170
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,080
Where are you taking me?

171
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,550
Lord Shangguan.

172
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,110
Don’t struggle in vain.

173
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,030
Why don't you go down and accompany your daughter?

174
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,080
Qin?

175
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,270
Come back!

176
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,950
Let's leave now.

177
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,410
This is not a place to talk.

178
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,670
They all ran away with you?

179
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,050
They didn't run away with me.

180
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,510
They saved me.

181
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,110
Where is Qin?

182
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,770
She went out to sea

183
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,270
and headed to my country.

184
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,590
Then I'm relieved.

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,460
You hypocrite.

186
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,470
Now you act like

187
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,400
a loving father.

188
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,290
Why didn't you show mercy

189
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,390
when you sent someone to kill her?

190
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,190
Cut it out.

191
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,520
He's just taking the blame for someone.

192
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,700
Li Bing.

193
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,130
Have you ever thought that

194
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,340
since I was willing to plead guilty,

195
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,840
why would I

196
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,070
tell the truth now?

197
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,460
It's for the same reason

198
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,790
that you took the blame.

199
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,040
It's for Vice Minister Shangguan.

200
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,970
If I tell you,

201
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,160
you have to send me out.

202
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,810
I have my plans when I get to the wharf.

203
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,430
Okay.

204
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,930
One more thing. You'll ask the questions

205
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,160
and I'll answer you alone.

206
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,440
Lord Shangguan.

207
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,470
Can you tell me now?

208
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,120
Actually, during the interrogation,

209
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,590
what I said

210
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,720
was not all fake.

211
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,110
I know.

212
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,320
What I want to ask

213
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,410
is those things that were hidden.

214
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,590
Du Zixu was not just an alchemist, right?

215
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,270
Yes.

216
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,670
He was a spy.

217
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,520
The prescription offered was not fake

218
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,630
but actually has another purpose.

219
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,440
There was a treasure

220
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,310
of Zixu State that ended up in Shendu.

221
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,690
Five years ago,

222
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,690
it coincided with the transition of royal power in Zixu.

223
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,530
That was the king's token.

224
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,420
So he was sent to Shendu

225
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,510
to look for it.

226
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,090
The prescription and medicine

227
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,990
were just stepping stones.

228
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,150
If my guess is right,

229
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,030
Zixu State's invasion of our court

230
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,070
three years ago

231
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,110
is a lie.

232
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,790
It's related to the medicine, isn't it?

233
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,350
The key to the prescription

234
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,630
is the guiding drug that can only be found in Zixu,

235
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,360
the bones of Fengsheng Beasts.

236
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,170
The beast bones brought by Du Zixu

237
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,970
would be used up sooner or later.

238
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,960
That's why there was

239
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,150
a war against Zixu.

240
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,060
I see.

241
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,430
Then my father was...

242
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,190
Your father found out

243
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,320
the truth of the war.

244
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,390
So about what you said before,

245
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,990
who asked you to make that up?

246
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,230
Since the medicine is effective,

247
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,360
there should be many people taking it.

248
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,220
[Yong]

249
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:45,830
Yong...

250
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,710
Yong'an Pavilion?

251
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,510
Chen Shi.

252
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,670
What are you doing?

253
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,710
I want to ask him

254
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,830
about my brother.

255
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,440
Chen Shi.

256
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,080
That old man Shangguan

257
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,840
can’t run away since he’s here.

258
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,340
You can ask him later.

259
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,720
Why are you exclaiming all of a sudden?

260
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,710
I think something just

261
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,470
flew past.

262
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,510
Didn't you see it?

263
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,670
No.

264
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,110
Could it be...

265
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,020
the Jinwu Guards found their way here again?

266
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,150
I think it was...

267
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,430
a cat?

268
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,040
If I knew

269
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,070
things would turn out like this,

270
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,550
I'm afraid

271
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,050
I wouldn't have conspired with them.

272
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,510
There is not much room for regret

273
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,350
in this world.

274
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,990
But if you admit to your mistake,

275
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,960
I'll give you some respect.

276
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,780
Vice Minister Li.

277
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,630
When Qiu Qingzhi

278
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,930
was searching the streets to arrest you,

279
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,270
have you ever regretted

280
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,360
saving him

281
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,990
when he was a slave?

282
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,230
I have another question

283
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,760
that I've asked you before.

284
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,270
Who exactly is Yi Zhi Hua?

285
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,130
Don't move.

286
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,070
Vice Minister!

287
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,640
Go check on Lord Shangguan.

288
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,190
Yi Zhi Hua.

289
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,500
Mr. Li.

290
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,190
What's going on? This...

291
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,830
Yi Zhi Hua did it.

292
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,630
Yi Zhi Hua?

293
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,350
Yi Zhi Hua?

294
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:46,950
When?

295
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,520
That cat just now...

296
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,990
I just saw a cat,

297
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,950
but I thought

298
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,620
it was just an ordinary cat.

299
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,190
I'm afraid Yi Zhi Hua has been stalking us

300
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,120
this whole time.

301
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,560
It won't be hard

302
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
for him to find us.

303
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,010
That's not right.

304
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,070
Yi Zhi Hua is targeting us.

305
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,390
Why did he kill Shangguan Lian?

306
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,160
Lord Shangguan knew of his existence.

307
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,310
Maybe...

308
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,160
he also knew about

309
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,819
the relationship between us.

310
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:15,670
So,

311
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,130
he was killed before

312
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,050
he could say anything?

313
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,740
Yes.

314
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,150
He escaped again.

315
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,470
I did find out something though.

316
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,790
Lord Shangguan

317
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,270
almost retracted all his statements.

318
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,910
To figure out the situation,

319
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,220
we must find Yi Zhi Hua.

320
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,880
He has been guiding us in secret.

321
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,340
He must be up to something.

322
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,190
This Yi Zhi Hua

323
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,320
is very strange.

324
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,550
He comes and goes without a trace.

325
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,750
Only he can come to us.

326
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,590
So how

327
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,200
are we going to find him?

328
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,030
Haven't you already

329
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,910
answered your own question?

330
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,470
To find him, we can lure him into

331
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,470
coming to us.

332
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,020
I don't know

333
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,200
what his plan is yet.

334
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,980
Wu also investigated it.

335
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,840
But he didn't have time to tell me.

336
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,030
I think

337
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,930
some of Wu's clues are still

338
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,630
around.

339
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,630
Alibaba!

340
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,780
Alibaba!

341
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,470
I'm fine.

342
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,430
Don't worry.

343
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,550
Where did

344
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,020
Vice Minister Shangguan hide the thing?

345
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,750
I don't know.

346
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,400
She said she put it away.

347
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,530
She didn't tell me the exact location.

348
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,550
You didn't ask where it is?

349
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,460
I think

350
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,390
it should be in the study.

351
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,140
I'm fine. I'm fine.

352
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,930
Don't worry, Vice Minister.

353
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,260
Be quiet.

354
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,510
Are you okay?

355
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,680
I'm fine. I'm fine.

356
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Don't worry.

357
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
The flowers are dead.

358
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,390
I didn’t expect Vice Minister Shangguan

359
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,850
to have still kept the pot.

360
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,500
How sentimental.

361
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,430
Mr. Li!

362
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,790
I think I found it!

363
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,150
How do we open this?

364
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,270
This...

365
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,110
These are

366
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,630
letters from Wu and Hu Ji.

367
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,040
Gosh. It was a waste of effort.

368
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,010
Not everything

369
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,860
is illegible.

370
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,370
How about this?

371
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,310
Take them all out

372
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,040
and dry them.

373
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,810
We'll take whatever we can.

374
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,200
Okay.

375
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,670
Okay?

376
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,260
This one.

377
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,590
Where did you find it?

378
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,790
At our front gate.

379
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,150
Those clothes

380
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,190
were the ones that were stolen

381
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,590
from one of our comrades.

382
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,250
They sent it to our doorstep, yeah?

383
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,120
My Lord, do you mean...

384
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,090
The person who kidnapped Shangguan

385
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:46,910
was Li Bing.

386
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,530
How is Lord Shangguan now?

387
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,260
Lord Shangguan is dead.

388
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,720
How did you know?

389
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,670
General.

390
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,470
How should we report

391
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,140
Lord Shangguan's death?

392
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,950
Just write

393
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,190
that he fled on the way

394
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,310
and was killed by forest beasts.

395
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,390
I'll handle it.

396
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,970
You don't have to write it.

397
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,080
About Li Bing and his men,

398
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,470
should I pass down the order

399
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,330
to send more men

400
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,210
to interrogate the pedestrians?

401
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,690
I have other arrangements.

402
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,070
I need you to find someone for me.

403
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:29,780
Go.

404
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,680
Yes.

405
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,790
These are all the words

406
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,650
we can make out.

407
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,600
[Nothing was found from the interrogation of the two death-row prisoners last month.]

408
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,600
[The Du family has dealings with Lyu Shangguan and the others.]

409
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,310
We can't discern the rest.

410
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,550
We all tried our best.

411
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,150
Don't blame yourselves.

412
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,600
The coachman's body

413
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,290
was sent back to Jinwu Guards.

414
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,930
Qiu Qingzhi must have noticed

415
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,530
that we were the kidnappers.

416
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,490
I'm afraid

417
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,500
they'll only intensify the search for us.

418
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,560
So we have to hurry.

419
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,040
Let's split up to investigate.

420
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,840
Three things.

421
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,500
First,

422
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,150
find out what happened

423
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,270
during the war three years ago,

424
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,950
especially at Huangsha Valley.

425
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,540
Second,

426
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,390
find out who retrieved

427
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,650
Du Zixu's sunken ship.

428
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,790
It's very likely that person

429
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,320
has the relic of Zixu State.

430
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,230
Third,

431
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,230
what exactly is the relic of Zixu State

432
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,550
that Du Zixu and Yi Zhi Hua

433
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,630
are looking for?

434
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,110
This...

435
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,590
I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to find

436
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,450
people who know

437
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,890
the truth about the war at Huangsha Valley.

438
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,910
But are the Zixu people

439
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,640
still alive?

440
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,290
They had first-hand experience too.

441
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,550
The prisoners of war?

442
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,630
It's easier to find out about how the sunken ship was retrieved.

443
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,090
After all, it was not a small matter.

444
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,390
There must be traces.

445
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,670
The ship owners at the wharf

446
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,730
should have clues.

447
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,510
Also,

448
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,480
since they were going to

449
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,830
transport the stuff in the sunken ship to Shendu,

450
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,250
there must have been escorts.

451
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,470
If we find the escorts,

452
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,500
maybe we can find out who the client is.

453
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,030
Okay.

454
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,060
Let's start from the wharf and the escorts.

455
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,430
It'd probably be the hardest

456
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,140
to find out the thing Du Zixu and Yi Zhi Hua

457
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,070
are looking for.

458
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,710
Not necessarily.

459
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,790
[Nothing was found from the interrogation of the two death-row prisoners last month.]

460
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,790
[The Du family has dealings with Lyu Shangguan and the others.]

461
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,710
Since that thing ended up in Shendu

462
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,990
five years ago

463
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,590
and it belongs to Zixu State,

464
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,070
there must have been people who have come across it.

465
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,800
For example,

466
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,270
a merchant collecting foreign treasures.

467
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,470
Seeing is believing.

468
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,670
Mr. Li, then...

469
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,830
Let's start the investigation at dawn.

470
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,560
-Okay.
-Yes.

471
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,400
Pavilion Elder.

472
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,950
This is...

473
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,750
These are the crucial cases that Li Bing has dealt with,

474
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,470
starting from the Demon Cat Case,

475
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,070
since he returned to Shendu.

476
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,460
Qiu Qingzhi.

477
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,660
What's your aim of making us

478
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,200
look at these cases?

479
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,710
Among all these cases,

480
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,310
there seems to always be

481
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,470
a mysterious man

482
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,690
who is leading Li Bing in his investigations.

483
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,950
Just get to the point.

484
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,230
This person

485
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,090
is the man hidden in

486
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,440
the stone coffin at Huangsha Valley

487
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,370
three years ago.

488
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,990
He is the real demon cat,

489
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,360
Yi Zhi Hua.

490
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,630
How do you know Yi Zhi Hua?

491
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,150
Because three years ago,

492
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,670
I was also in Zixu.

493
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,410
At that time, I was already suspicious

494
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,820
of the motive

495
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,350
of that war.

496
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,380
It was because of him.

497
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,340
You've all been looking for him, right?

498
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,640
He is the real medicine,

499
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,990
the medicine that all of you

500
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,970
are so desperate to find.

501
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,130
You all asked me to keep an eye on Li Bing.

502
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,970
This is the truth he found.

503
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,770
Now I know it too.

504
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,440
Qiu Qingzhi.

505
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,950
What do you want?

506
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,960
It's simple.

507
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,470
A deal.

508
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,720
If you trust me,

509
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,270
I can help you catch Yi Zhi Hua.

510
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,350
But I have one condition.

511
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,430
I want to enter Yong'an Pavilion.

512
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,910
Qiu Qingzhi.

513
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,960
Can you really catch Yi Zhi Hua?

514
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,030
As you all know,

515
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,070
I was a slave.

516
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,770
I won't miss such an opportunity.

517
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,690
I will stand above everyone

518
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,350
just like you all.

519
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,790
Fine.

520
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,830
If you can really

521
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,300
capture Yi Zhi Hua alive,

522
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,350
I will

523
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,430
ask Her Majesty

524
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,060
to give you permission to join the pavilion.

525
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,830
That's a deal.

526
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,440
Thank you, Pavilion Elder.

527
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,210
[Sun Bao]

528
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,400
[Alibaba]

529
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,920
[Li Bing]

530
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,350
We've always been the ones pursuing those on the wanted list.

531
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,390
It's the first time we're on the wanted list.

532
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:42,940
Besides,

533
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,880
this portrait is too ugly.

534
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,180
Cui Bei sure is extremely skilled.

535
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,390
The less it looks like you, the better.

536
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,630
It'll be troublesome if someone recognizes you.

537
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:49,990
You're right.

538
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,520
Let's go.

539
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,020
There are Jinwu Guards.

540
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,270
W-Where are they?

541
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,820
In the southeast direction.

542
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,070
The one who's selling paper umbrellas

543
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,430
and the one at the tea stall across the street.

544
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,190
Those who ordered just one pot of tea.

545
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,920
Both of them.

546
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,070
Follow me.

547
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:14,990
Boss.

548
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,490
Sirs.

549
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,350
I'll have a pig's trotter.

550
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:16,750
Okay.

551
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,670
Here, take it.

552
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,130
Take it.

553
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:26,830
Okay.

554
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,990
It's safe now.

555
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,850
They didn't follow us.

556
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,190
That scared me to death.

557
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,910
But according to the current situation,

558
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,950
the Court of Judicial Review must already

559
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,750
be under Qiu Qingzhi's control.

560
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,670
Boss.

561
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,550
Boss.

562
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,520
Liu Sheng.

563
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,740
I've fixed the damages

564
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,830
on this painting.

565
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,610
Take a look.

566
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,390
Really? Let me see.

567
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,270
How is it? Are you satisfied?

568
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,350
It's beautiful.

569
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,320
Very beautiful.

570
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,310
Liu Sheng.

571
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,710
Your skills are amazing.

572
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,990
Is the vendor here?

573
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,430
You have customers.

574
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,710
Is the vendor here?

575
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,590
I'll go first.

576
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,950
Coming.

577
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,320
I've never seen you two before.

578
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,570
What do you want to write?

579
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,030
A letter to send back home?

580
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,190
Are you Liu Sheng?

581
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,390
Yes, I am.

582
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,790
We don't need to write anything.

583
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,160
We're looking for you

584
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,880
for something else.

585
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,320
Let's go.

586
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,150
Men and women shouldn't make physical contact.

587
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,200
What are you doing

588
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,490
dragging me in public?

589
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,130
What are you doing?

590
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,710
Bro, give me a hand.

591
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,390
Move along! Hurry up!

592
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,190
Here, with this box,

593
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,190
don't knock on it.

594
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,150
Hurry up!

595
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:00,990
Is it here?

596
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,710
Don't block the way.

597
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,350
Especially

598
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,630
the boxes with the fur edges.

599
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,630
Watch them carefully.

600
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,760
Don't scratch them.

601
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,400
What can I do for you?

602
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,330
My client

603
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,530
has a batch of goods,

604
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,870
where all the goods were purchased carefully.

605
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,420
[Xintan Wharf]

606
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,340
We want to transport them overseas,

607
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,200
so we're looking for a large ship.

608
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:19,790
May I ask

609
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,830
how much stuff you want to transport?

610
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,890
More than 50 cases.

611
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,380
My client's wondering

612
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,590
if your ship

613
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,430
is big enough.

614
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:34,730
[Xintan Wharf]

615
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,950
Of course it is.

616
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,190
Apart from these at the back,

617
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,280
we have even bigger ones in the shipyard.

618
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,140
Let me tell you.

619
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,910
We own all the best and biggest ships

620
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,630
in Shendu.

621
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,910
If our ships are not big enough,

622
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,710
I'm afraid there's no other ship that would be big enough.

623
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,600
May I ask

624
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,910
what goods you are transporting?

625
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:45,630
Porcelain,

626
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,790
medicinal ingredients,

627
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,750
silk, and...

628
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,910
I can't tell you the details.

629
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,840
Don't worry. You don't have to tell me.

630
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,340
As long as the price is right,

631
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,110
we can talk about anything.

632
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,040
Here, come here.

633
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,190
This price is

634
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,160
not for nothing.

635
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,990
You have to find some people

636
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,050
to watch the goods.

637
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:12,940
Don't worry.

638
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,390
I'll get you a few more

639
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,230
sailors then.

640
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,580
Ordinary sailors won't do.

641
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,710
I need the experienced ones

642
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,040
who've transported goods by ship before.

643
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,870
Those

644
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,970
who've survived shipwrecks.

645
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,830
Those are the most trustworthy.

646
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,100
We do have someone like that.

647
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,540
But it's hard to say whether he will

648
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,670
accept the job or not.

649
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,910
You're so late again.

650
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,660
To wait for you,

651
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,790
I was scolded a lot.

652
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,510
You aren't from Shendu, are you?

653
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,610
You smell like smoked cypress branches.

654
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,920
It's the old custom of Zixu, right?

655
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,570
Stop there!

656
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,410
Is there the smell?

657
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,120
Let's go.

658
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,250
Don't move!

659
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,280
Kids!

660
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,530
Mr. Li! Mr. Li!

661
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,360
Why can't you let us off?

662
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,390
We...

663
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,700
We just have some questions

664
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,390
to ask you.

665
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,670
We mean no harm.

666
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,870
Mr. Li!

667
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,260
Mr. Li! Say something, Mr. Li!

668
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,070
You people

669
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,520
took us to a foreign country

670
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,750
to make us slaves

671
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,990
and work us like animals.

672
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,050
Isn't that enough?

673
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,700
Do you even want to kill us?

674
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,690
You're hiding here

675
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,470
and supporting

676
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,180
these women and children alone.

677
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,960
How long do you think you can last?

678
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,490
We're in this predicament because of you lot!

679
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,650
But it doesn't matter.

680
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,070
We'll take it one day at a time.

681
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,070
It's better than

682
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,000
living under someone else's roof.

683
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,600
The Jinwu Guards are here

684
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,730
to check the household registration.

685
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,230
Don't lie to us.

686
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,210
Why didn't I hear about it?

687
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,030
If you prisoners of war

688
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,190
are caught,

689
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,920
you'll be sentenced to death.

690
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:11,870
Yes.

691
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,180
Trust us.

692
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,830
We can help you.

693
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,520
How?

694
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,430
Open the door!

695
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,310
Open the door!

696
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,770
Where are they?

697
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,230
Open the door!

698
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,710
Open the door!

699
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,170
Where are they?

700
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,210
Open the door now!

701
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,660
Open the door!

702
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,640
Hurry up! Anyone there?

703
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:41,810
Hurry!

704
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,890
Where are they?

705
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,320
Is anyone there? Open the door!

706
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,350
Open the door!

707
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,440
Is anyone there? Open the door!

708
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,020
Open the door now!

709
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,270
Coming.

710
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,070
Open the door!

711
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,710
What were you doing?

712
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,910
What took you so long?

713
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,280
Is that poop?

714
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,430
The poop bucket was spilled.

715
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,990
So I was cleaning it up.

716
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,790
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

717
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,310
I was afraid it'd get smelly. I'm sorry.

718
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,710
I was just cleaning it up.

719
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,950
You...

720
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,270
How can we get in?

721
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:14,900
Officer.

722
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,470
Why don't you come again in a few days?

723
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,400
A few days later?

724
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,840
Fine.

725
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,990
I'll come back tomorrow.

726
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:21,630
What bad luck.

727
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,270
Let me see you off.

728
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,070
No need! Don't send us off.

729
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,880
Don't send us off.

730
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,410
Let's go.

731
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,880
Take care, officers.

732
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,480
Take care.

733
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,430
They're gone.

734
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,100
Come out now.

735
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,390
It's fine now.

736
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,390
They're gone.

737
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,510
It's fine now.

738
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,790
You're getting so close. Aren't you bothered by the smell?

739
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,720
I smell it every day. I'm used to it.

740
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,470
Are you

741
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,590
really not Jinwu Guards?

742
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,840
Of course not.

743
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,530
You still don't believe us?

744
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,760
To be exact,

745
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,470
we are enemies

746
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,560
with Jinwu Guards.

747
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,430
Then why are you

748
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,830
looking for Zixu people?

749
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,470
I have something to ask.

750
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,110
What is it?

751
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,850
What happened

752
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,490
in the battle at Huangsha Valley?

753
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,180
When I first arrived in Shendu,

754
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,510
when I was still a slave,

755
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,270
I told people about the battle at Huangsha Valley.

756
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,870
But none of them believed me.

757
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
They even said I was lying on purpose

758
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,130
and threatened to kill me if I kept talking.

759
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,310
You're the first one to ask me about it.

760
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,180
That battle was sudden.

761
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,670
Everyone

762
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,390
who was capable enough went to the battlefield.

763
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,390
But there were still not enough people.

764
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,760
So as the war went on,

765
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,030
the king sent all the commoners

766
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,160
to the battlefield.

767
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,840
Just in the span of a day,

768
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,220
those people

769
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,400
who we were chatting and laughing with

770
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,380
were all gone.

771
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,010
Only some of the old, weak, and young

772
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,950
were saved

773
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,070
by a young man.

774
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:02,570
Who?

775
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,070
I don't know.

776
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,470
If it weren't for him

777
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,110
killing the king with an arrow,

778
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,570
we'd have had to keep guarding until we died.

779
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,480
Later,

780
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,330
we were abducted to Shendu

781
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,980
and tossed around as we were being sold.

782
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,100
The number of people

783
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,310
kept decreasing.

784
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,180
Only a few of us were left.

785
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,570
So I took them to escape.

786
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,860
There was a god with a cat head and a human body.

787
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,920
What does it have to do with you?

788
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,480
That is our god.

789
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,850
According to our ancestors,

790
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,050
a hero defeated the mythical beast

791
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,690
and gained divine power

792
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,350
such that it is immortal.

793
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,550
He's the god.

794
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,580
Immortal?

795
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,410
Who knows if it's true?

796
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,190
If there really were a god,

797
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,750
why didn't he show up

798
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,430
when Zixu needed him?

799
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,800
