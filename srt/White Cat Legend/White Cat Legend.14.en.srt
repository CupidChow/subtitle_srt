74
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,950
there are too many ways to sell the stolen goods.

from doing anything funny,

86
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,510
The goods yard usually does checks

even if the workers do steal a lot normally,

91
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:48,110
it's hard for them to transport the stolen goods.

Do you think

93
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,270
they might have accomplices

94
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,530

we don't have clues for this case

98
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,670
is because the workers at the goods yard

99
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,670
are covering it up.

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,710
They can't just sit and watch.

387
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,550
They will definitely make a move.

388
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,350
As long as they

389
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,150
attack Alibaba's ship tonight,

390
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,150
they would've fallen into the trap.

391
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,950
But...

392
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,590
What if they attack us?

393
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,550
What are you afraid of?

394
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,810
No matter what they do,

395
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,870
do you think they can

396
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,270
do better than me?

397
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,980
Don't you think there are mosquitoes here?

398
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,830
I-

399
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,050
I don't think so.

400
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,660
I think I got bitten...

401
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:20,910
Where?

402
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,750
This is...

403
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,270
Oh no!

404
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,000
Why did you do this to yourself?

405
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,470
You're awake.

406
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,700
You little punks.

407
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,190
Release your me!

408
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,349
Do you know we are–

409
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,030
Officials?

410
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,390
You're trying to set us up.

411
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,430
You think of us

412
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,270
too simply.

413
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,510
This kind of trick

414
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,440
to lure the enemy

415
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,069
is so petty.

416
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,490
Don't move!

417
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,369
You can't move either.

418
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,329
Have you ever been a soldier?

419
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,290
How do you know?

420
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,349
The way you tie people up

421
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,410
is how soldiers do.

422
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,150
The more you know,

423
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,350
the sooner you die.

424
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,470
You killed Liu Fu.

425
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,830
You killed a beggar named Zhao Huazi.

426
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,590
Now you even dare to kill officials?

427
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,800
Killing one is murder.

428
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,150
Killing more than one is still murder.

429
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,990
During the war,

430
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,060
we killed a lot.

431
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,630
We

432
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,670
barely survived.

433
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,590
What difference are you going to make?

434
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,270
You...

435
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,710
You are all

436
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,520
a fair face hiding a foul heart!

437
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,710
Since you can see through

438
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,110
our counterfeit method,

439
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,390
it shows that what you look at

440
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,580
is not the boat token

441
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,830
or not just only that.

442
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,960
You have other ways of contacting.

443
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,350
You guessed it wrong from the beginning.

444
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,820
How so?

445
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,790
Do you want to die knowing the truth?

446
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,690
Spill it!

447
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,910
It's better to know less.

448
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,200
Let's go.

449
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,270
Block it

450
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,270
Wang Qi, what should we do?

451
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,160
Come back!

452
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,520
Come back!

453
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,390
Come back! Come back!

454
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,410
Hurry! Block it!

455
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,400
Block it!

456
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,260
Get out of the way!

457
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,370
Jinwu Guards are investigating!

458
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,360
Sir!

459
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,350
Sir.

460
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,920
Chen Shi.

461
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,070
Just a few more steps

462
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,750
and we will be there soon.

463
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,510
No.

464
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,680
I'm sorry, sir.

465
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,480
Why don't...

466
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,430
Why don't we go next time

467
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,110
or in the future?

468
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,570
I have to go and have a look.

469
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,550
Excuse me.

470
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,670
Excuse me.

471
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,790
Sir.

472
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,560
Our wire rope

473
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,270
was cut.

474
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,510
The ship drifted away.

475
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,160
Oh no!

476
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,020
Get out of the way!

477
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,910
Jinwu Guards are investigating!

478
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,910
Get out of the way!

479
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,360
Pull them up.

480
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,790
Excuse me.

481
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,830
Excuse me.

482
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,470
Hey!

483
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,520
Chen Shi.

484
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,270
What took you so long?

485
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:18,870
Well...

486
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,990
If there were someone to receive us on the shore,

487
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,470
I...

488
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,650
I wouldn't be in such a miserable state.

489
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,360
I-It's useless for me to come here too.

490
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,670
It's better than nothing.

491
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,710
Better than nothing.

492
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,440
Don't listen to them.

493
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,710
They are in a bad mood

494
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,850
and venting their anger on you.

495
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,680
[Xintan Wharf]

496
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,750
How did you support them?

497
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,460
That even the

498
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,480
Jinwu Guards are here?

499
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,330
No, Madam.

500
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,710
There were many Jinwu Guards

501
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,150
who have been guarding here in plain clothes.

502
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,270
As soon as there was a movement here,

503
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,550
they lit all the fire.

504
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,390
General Qiu... arrived in... a blink of an eye.

505
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,950
Now that this has happened,

506
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,560
we can

507
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,400
only see what Vice Minister says.

508
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,070
Vice Minister Li.

509
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,290
At this point, this goods yard case

510
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,430
should be handed over to

511
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,270
Jinwu Guards.

512
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,270
We managed to save

513
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,710
people from Mingjing Hall this time

514
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,790
easily.

515
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,300
There's no need to thank me.

516
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,760
You were waiting for this.

517
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,010
General, you have a good plan.

518
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,710
That's because I trust that

519
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,680
you won't let any case

520
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,240
go unsolved for a long time.

521
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,450
Of course,

522
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,830
this was also for the safety

523
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,630
of the wharf.

524
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,130
So I sent someone to patrol in secret.

525
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,260
In that case,

526
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,630
I shall take

527
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,890
these criminals away.

528
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,810
Take them away.

529
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,070
Let's go.

530
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,800
What are you doing here?

531
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,110
Didn't you go looking for your brother?

532
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,090
I saw there was light at the wharf

533
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,610
so I came to have a look.

534
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,630
Mr. Li.

535
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,550
I...

536
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,630
I found my brother.

537
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,320
You found him?

538
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,710
Yes.

539
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,550
A sir who pulls a water cart

540
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,970
selling water

541
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,310
left a message

542
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,220
with Mr. Yuan.

543
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,030
His surname is Lu. He knows my brother.

544
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,090
He also knows where my brother lives.

545
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,060
It's in the nearby alley.

546
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,000
Are you planning to...

547
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,590
leave the Court of Judicial Review?

548
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,090
I...

549
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,430
My brother is doing business outside the city.

550
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,400
I will discuss it

551
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,110
after he comes back.

552
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,060
Okay.

553
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,360
Since you've found your brother,

554
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,910
you should discuss

555
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,840
everything with him in the future.

556
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,950
Maybe the Court of Judicial Review has been

557
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,280
too strict towards you.

558
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,230
After all, I was the one who insisted

559
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,270
on keeping you.

560
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,550
Because I think

561
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,720
we are destined.

562
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,350
I do need someone like you

563
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,150
around me too.

564
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,070
But I can't

565
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,270
be too arbitrary.

566
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,120
The mistake of Mingjing Hall today

567
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,830
is my fault.

568
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,610
Since you found your brother,

569
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,590
leave if you want.

570
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,230
Mr. Li.

571
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,820
Are you chasing me away?

572
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,490
What are you doing?

573
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,040
You guys too.

574
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,730
Take care of yourselves.

575
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,110
Interrogate.

576
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,470
Ask them where are the items.

577
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,910
Yes.

578
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,570
Speak.

579
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,080
Where are the items?

580
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,750
-Sir. -Sir.

581
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,230
Sir.

582
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,350
Sir.

583
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,950
Sir.

584
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,630
I thought about it.

585
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,050
It was something wrong with my idea

586
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,830
that dragged everyone down.

587
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,110
It's not your fault

588
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,350
nor Chen Shi's.

589
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,150
Me too.

590
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,970
I trained him too hard.

591
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,430
The incense stick was too thick.

592
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,390
The chicken and rabbit problem

593
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,590
is my hobby.

594
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,230
Maybe it’s not useful

595
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,190
to Chen Shi.

596
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,820
The dangers I said

597
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,310
was just to scare him.

598
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,910
I made a big fuss out of it.

599
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,060
Sir.

600
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,300
Let's go talk to Chen Shi.

601
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,200
It's not your fault.

602
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,010
Chen Shi came to Shendu

603
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,410
to look for his relative.

604
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,820
He accidentally got involved

605
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,390
in all kinds of accidents

606
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,660
that brought him to the Court of Judicial Review.

607
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,260
I think he is a capable man.

608
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,860
But we did more harm than good.

609
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,990
Just let him

610
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,890
do what he wants to.

611
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,710
Sir...

612
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,390

616
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,470
I have already

617
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,710
cleaned your booths.

618
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,190
I left it there.

619
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,340

620
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,270

your martial arts outfit.

622
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,080
I placed it there too.

623
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,790
Mr. Cui.

624
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,620
I'm sorry.

625
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,670
I still haven't figured out the

626
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,910
chicken and rabbit problem.

627
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,870
Let me think about it.

628
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,190
But

629
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,780
I've left that

630
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,440

631
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,310

632
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,070
I'm bringing the calligraphy practice book.

633
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,930
It's right here. I'm bringing it.

634
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,360
By the way,

635
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,830
I also gave the recipe for the buns

636
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,670
to Uncle Cai.

637
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,380
Mr. Li,

638
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,420
take care.

639
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,260
I put the gum

640
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,020
in your room.

641
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,320
Chen Shi.

642
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,390
Are you really leaving?

643
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,690
I've made up my mind.

644
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,950
If I find my brother

645
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,870
I'll tell him.

646
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,590
I'll take the exam and join again

647
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,350
with my own abilities!

648
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,750
With my own abilities...

649
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,880
Oh right.

650
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,280
When I was at the wharf,

651
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,230
I saw this

652
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,200
and picked it up.

653
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,710
I'm illiterate.

654
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,470
I think it might help solve the case.

656
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,670

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,340
At the shore of the wharf.

658
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,340
On a wire rope.

[Qiu]

660
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,660
I didn't expect

661
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,590
Vice Minister to be so sentimental.

662
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,990
He probably doesn't want you

663
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,890
to see the tears on his face.

664
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,070
Yes.

665

00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,500

667
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,430
Come back soon.

668
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,750
I'm leaving.

669
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,240
General Qiu, how have you been?

670
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,960
So this is how it feels

671
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,360
to come uninvited.

672
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,670
Did the two of you

673
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,570
come together

674
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,090
to thank me for what happened yesterday?

675
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,110
We are all officials. It's nothing worth mentioning.

676
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,510
We just did what we could.

677
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,190
Thank you for yesterday.

678
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,380
I'm here today

679
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,070
to ask you about something.

680
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,350
This broken arrow

681
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,990
was found by the shore yesterday.

682
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,920
I was wondering,

683
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,710
even if they can

684
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,840
see through Wang Qi’s disguise,

685
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,390
how could they predict

686
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,710
and cut off the wire rope

687
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,400
of the Court of Judicial Review's boat ahead of time.

688
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,860
If they are so capable,

689
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,690
why would they be thieves?

690
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,680
What do you mean, Vice Minister Li?

691
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,970
How dare you, Qiu Qingzhi!

692
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,390
How dare you join hands with thieves

693
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,110
to kidnap the Court of Judicial Review's officials

694
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,000
and stop the Ministry of Justice and the Court of Judicial Review to investigate our case?

695
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,110
You broke the law while knowing it and abused your power.

696
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,910
What punishment do you deserve?

697
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,750

698
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,850
That's t-too much.

699

Shut up!

700
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,670
Did I talk to you?

701
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,800
What do you mean, Vice Minister Shangguan?

702
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,220
Of course I won't

703
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,880
talk to General Qiu like this.

704
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,790
I believe

705
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,120
you are just afraid

706
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,970
of losing the authority to investigate this case

707
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,370
so you decided to do this.

708
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,910
To backstab.

709
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,780
I'm just afraid that there'd be people

710
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,680
who make up stories in front of

711
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,870
the Minister of Defense

712
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,400
and the Ministry of Justice

713
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,230

714

on General Qiu.

715
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,040

Since Jinwu Guards

721
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,950
have been interrogating for the whole night,

722
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,630
after this

723
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,820
let the Court of Judicial Review interrogate them

724
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,150
and we will call it even.

725
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,570
How does that sound?

726
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,280
I will be honest.

are already dead.

729
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,590
What?

731
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,360
to theft and murder.

733
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,670
and died.

735
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,430

00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,390
Just right.

After returning to the Shendu,

749
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,659
they didn't have anything to do for a living,

750
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,230
so they tried to seek opportunities in the goods yard.

751

are afraid that someone would tamper with the goods,

831
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,320
so they investigated strictly.

832
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,270

837
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,790
They have to be someone who can appear in the goods yard

but they can't be someone from the goods yard.

839

the marking on the boat token
