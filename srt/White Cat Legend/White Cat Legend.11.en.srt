we didn't want to delay something urgent.

575
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,790
So we rushed to send it over

576
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,830
this morning.

577
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,750
You rushed to send it over

578
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,170
this morning?

579
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,710
I didn't pay you.

580
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,990
Why did you send it out?

581
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,230
We all recognized the paper that the letter was written on

582
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,260
last night.

583
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,820
It's the paper that Alibaba,

584
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,390
the judge from the Court of Judicial Review,

585
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,390
uses.

586
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,630
He often writes letters

587
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,370
to his foreign relatives here.

588
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,550
He also tips us a lot

589
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,550
for our hard work.

590
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,230
It's our pleasure to help

591
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,150
with this.

592
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,950
You guys are so kind.

593
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,590
What's wrong?

594
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,430
Great.

595
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,260
Mr. Sun,

596
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,420
that's why you brought

597
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,370
his mother in?

598
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,600
I was once a scout in the army

599
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,350
who had to think on my feet.

600
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,370
I had to go along with what was being said.

601
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,550
Judging from the situation,

602
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,030
I took your mother away.

603
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,790
I didn't expect your father to come too.

604
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,670
I wanted to delay it

605
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,160
and explain to my parents

606
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,090
after the Holy Birthday Festival.

607
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,680
Unexpectedly,

608
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,930
once my parents heard that

609
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,620
I became the vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review,

610
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,950
they came here to celebrate the festival.

611
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,350
At this point,

612
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,910
you should just repent

613
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,640
and be absolved of your crimes.

614
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,190
You have no idea

615
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,720
that I'm the youngest son in my family.

616
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,790
And my father is

617
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,830
very strict with me.

618
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,890
Did you burn yourself?

619
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,970
Well, no...

620
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,130
Don't talk while watching a chess game.

621
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,100
You don't say anything when you should.

622
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,030
I'm now surrounded with no way out!

623
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,950
Look at my father.

624
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,730
He is only submissive to my mother

625
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,790
because my mother

626
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,540
was old and weak when she gave birth

627
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,740
to me.

628
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,310
So my father always gives in to her.

629
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,680
He is not

630
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,130
like this to me.

631
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,570
I wanted to learn martial arts since I was young.

632
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,770
But the master he got for me

633
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,620
attacked me

634
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,950
without warning.

635
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,700
Screw you!

637
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,940
[Ah]

638
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,710
He was over-anxious for me to make progress

639
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,970
without caring for me.

640
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,720
There was something even more ridiculous.

641
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,140
What are you doing?

642
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,780
How dare you run away!

643
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,360
How dare you!

644
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,730
How dare you!

[Whack]

647
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,360
Besides,

648
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,710
every time I made a little progress,

649
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,340
my father would forbid me from doing it.

650
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,330
He said I'm not suitable for martial arts.

651
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,860
Be it studying, writing,

652
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,490
or even doing business,

653
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,200
he never supported me once.

654
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,000
When I took the exam to join the Court of Judicial Review,

655
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,400
he said I'd never pass it.

656
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,110
Now, if I tell him

657
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,230
I was expelled from the Court of Judicial Review

658
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,110
and that

659
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,140
me being a vice minister was just drunken talk,

660
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,620
he...

661
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,370
he would beat me to death.

662
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,320
But if you don't tell the truth now,

663
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,550
you'd be making more mistakes

664
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,790
and making the best of a mistake without correcting it.

665
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,990
Making more mistakes

666
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,510
and making the best of a mistake without correcting it.

667
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,990

668
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,470
Make the best of a mistake without correcting it?

669
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,870
Today is the Holy Birthday Festival.

670
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,390
The Court of Judicial Review

671
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,850
is resting for three days.

672
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,190
Where did our vice minister go?

673
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,950
Mr. Li went to the palace.

674
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,320
When will he come back?

675
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:56,990
He said

676
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,190
it should be after dinner.

677
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,310

they look like a ghost,
