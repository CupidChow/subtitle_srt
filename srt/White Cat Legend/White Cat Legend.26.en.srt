[Episode 26]

4
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,150
The foreigner Wu Yiren has been looking for

5
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,150
should be a woman.

6
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,009
I didn't tell you this before.

7
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,810
She's Hu Ji, my informant.

8
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,270
Qiu Qingzhi took her away.

9
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,630
Wu Yiren

10
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,350
has been guiding me by giving me clues.

11
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,610
It should be because he wants to save her.

12
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,020
Since he once worked at the Court of Judicial Review,

13
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,110
it must have something to do

14
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,970
with my father.

15
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,110
That's why he keeps giving me information

16
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,460
about Du Zixu.

17
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,260
With Jinwu Guards watching us outside,

18
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,580
we don't have too much time.

19
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,390
I'll go alone.

20
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,040
Chen Shi.

21
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,710
Tell them the details.

22
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:19,310
Okay.

23
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,630
Vice Minister Li.

24
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,590
No matter what case you're investigating,

25
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,190
you don't have to do it alone.

26
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,670
We can help you.

27
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,630
After I come back,

28
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,470
I'll apologize and thank you

29
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,630
in person.

30
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,990
Alibaba.

31
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,320
Come out with me.

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,990
Me?

33
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,790
Go.

34
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,000
Go.

35
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,190
Go, go.

36
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,990
Vice Minister Shangguan.

37
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,120
What can I do for you?

38
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,070
What can you do for me?

39
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,870
Something's wrong with you.

40
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,800
I…

41
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,510
Vice Minister Shangguan.

42
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,110
I'm innocent. God is my witness.

43
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,100
I've never been to a brothel

44
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,190
or anywhere like that.

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,720
I'm not talking about that.

46
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,630
In the case about the Five Minerals Powder,

47
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,440
the loan shark, Liu Yaoshi,

48
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,560
was rude and arrogant at first,

49
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,000
but he suddenly changed his attitude.

50
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,070
Then in the case at the wharf,

51
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,690
I read in Cui Bei's records

52
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,030
that you talked

53
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,160
with that foreigner

54
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,950
and found something new.

55
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,910
And today.

56
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,230
What on earth did you do?

57
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,670
Every clue you got

58
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,550
was very important to the cases.

59
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,020
Could it be that

60
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,920
you're hiding something?

61
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,430
Are you

62
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,070
the accomplice of that Hu Ji?

63
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,880
That's why they

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,070
told you everything they knew.

65
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,390
I… I…

66
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,470
You're indeed hiding something.

67
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,200
You'd better be honest with me.

68
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,890
Otherwise,

69
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,710
I'd lock you up and grill you.

70
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,870
No, no.

71
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,470
Quiet.

72
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,070
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

73
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,070
I…

74
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,790
Actually, I…

75
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,870
I'm…

76
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,269
Actually, I'm a prince.

77
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,430
Prince?

78
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,110
Are you okay, Your Highness?

79
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,560
Are you okay, Your Highness?

80
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,420
Your Highness.

81
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,520
Are you okay?

82
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,420
Are you okay?

83
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,870
Are you hurt?

84
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,550
Beyond the mountains

85
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,120
[Mountains]

86
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,920
and the sea

87
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,970
[Mountains] [Sea]

88
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,080
lies my motherland.

89
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,870
I'm the 123rd child

90
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,350
of the king.

91
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,710
[Mountains] [Sea] [No. 123]

92
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,670
-What?
-Lucky you.

93
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,060
The 123rd child?

94
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,300
Then your dad…

95
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,470
Sorry, your king…

96
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,040
Your king is so fertile.

97
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,990
He…

98
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,630
He indeed likes to have children.

99
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,390
But because he has too many children,

100
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,430
he can't remember

101
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,380
every one of us.

102
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,790
I have more than 100 siblings before me,

103
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,490
so I'm not of much importance.

104
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,680
I started living in my fief

105
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,310
when I was very young.

106
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,510
You have a fief?

107
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,190
Every prince

108
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,630
has his own fief.

109
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,990
Where is your fief?

110
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,170
It's an island.

111
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,630
A-An island?

112
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,150
[Alibaba's fief]

113
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,550
An island?

114
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,380
Because I like the sea.

115
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,710
The island is not big.

116
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,830
Only Mother, I,

117
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,150
and some servants lived there.

118
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,830
We planted flowers everywhere on the island

119
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,430
because

120
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,790
we had nothing else to do.

121
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,830
T-That…

122
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,200
That was wonderful.

123
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,350
What an amazing life.

124
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,560
The island is so small

125
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,790
that I could go around it three or four times

126
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,670
in a day.

127
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,310
So,

128
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,190
I got on a merchant ship

129
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,630
when my mother wasn't looking.

130
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,730
Then…

131
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,200
Then you came to Shendu?

132
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,909
Then you came to the Court of Judicial Review?

133
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:41,500
Then

134
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,190
how did those foreigners

135
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,950
know you were a prince?

136
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,790
This is proof of my identity.

137
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,550
After I revealed my real identity,

138
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,310
they feared and respected me.

139
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,590
Also,

140
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,470
the foreigners we met today,

141
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,430
on the family tree,

142
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,870
I'm from the same generation as their grandfathers' grandfathers.

143
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,990
Grandfathers' grandfathers?

144
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,270
Grandfathers' grandfathers?

145
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,470
Are you serious?

146
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,060
Vice Minister Shangguan.

147
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,470
Your Highness. Your Highness.

148
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,950
Be careful.

149
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,520
If possible,

150
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,230
I can take you

151
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,310
to visit my island.

152
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,890
No, thanks.

153
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,840
Since you're not a mole,

154
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,830
I'm relieved.

155
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,150
You guys,

156
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,880
go back to your work.

157
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,550
Yes.

158
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,710
Prince?

159
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,750
The 123rd son.

160
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,190
Prince.

161
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,350
Prince Baba.

162
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,870
Are you planning

163
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,190
to bring Vice Minister Shangguan back

164
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,590
to be your wife?

165
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,070
See no evil.

166
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,470
Speak no evil.

167
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,070
This…

168
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,390
What's this? What's this?

169
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,110
This looks good.

170
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,070
It's shining.

171
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,600
Vice Minister Shangguan, help me!

172
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,150
My name is Alibaba.

173
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,010
I have a secret.

174
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,440
Actually, I'm a prince.

175
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,730
What are you mumbling?

176
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,440
[Bump]

177
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,510
There seems to be a phrase

178
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,070
that Alibaba likes very much.

179
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,000
What's it?

180
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,290
It's Shuidao Qucheng.

181
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,940
[Shocked]

182
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,670
Shuidao.

183
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,510
Qucheng.

184
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,270
Oh no.

185
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,670
No wonder you could find clues so quickly.

186
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,070
You have two assistants.

187
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,140
Well, I…

188
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,870
My mother insisted

189
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,110
that they come with me.

190
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,790
They take care of me in my daily life

191
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,270
and help me solve small problems.

192
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,910
As a prince, you're indeed different from us.

193
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,370
Do you speak Mandarin too?

194
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,910
They speak fluent Mandarin.

195
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,910
When I fell asleep in the exam

196
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,990
the year before last,

197
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,550
they both passed the Mandarin Level 8 Exam.

198
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,310
Your Highness.

199
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,630
Vanity makes one blind to his true aspirations.

200
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,590
You need to be patient.

201
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,450
Your Highness.

202
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,710
Only through tranquility can one achieve something lasting.

203
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,430
Please let us go.

204
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,190
You may leave.

205
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,550
Yes.

206
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,120
No wonder

207
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,950
you wouldn't let us

208
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,830
see them.

209
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,550
Their Mandarin is better than yours.

210
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,030
What?

211
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,550
Yes.

212
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,950
What's this?

213
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,070
You can't take it.

214
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,750
If you take it,

215
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,870
I won't be a prince.

216
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,409
Shuidao, Qucheng.

217
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,310
Are there any other interesting things?

218
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,940
[Help!]

219
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,510
No, no.

220
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,590
There's nothing else.

221
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,760
[Ahh]

222
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,260
Help!

223
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,070
I'm here to help you.

224
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,560
Careful.

225
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,160
Let's go.

226
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:58,790
Get up.

227
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,150
Be careful.

228
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,960
There's nothing there.

229
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:31,990
Come in.

230
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,210
Have a seat.

231
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,560
It's really you.

232
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,550
You know me?

233
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,430
When I sent my father's coffin back to my hometown,

234
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,630
you came to see us off.

235
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,770
[Tablet of Late Father Li]

236
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,010
[Tablet of Late Father Li]

237
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,380
I didn't expect you

238
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,670
to remember me.

239
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,290
Thank you, Vice Minister.

240
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
What's your name?

241
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,990
Just call me Wu.

242
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,180
Okay.

243
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,710
Wu,

244
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,620
I need to ask you a few questions.

245
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,220
The fact that you've found me

246
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,190
means that you've known the information

247
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,070
I left you.

248
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,470
But there are still things

249
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,400
that confuse me.

250
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,330
How did you end up on death row?

251
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,250
I was there to dig into Du Zixu's past.

252
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,110
You investigated the Demon Cat Case.

253
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,950
You must know

254
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,750
that three years ago,

255
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,750
many people went missing in Shendu.

256
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,230
The investigation into their disappearances

257
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,750
led me to Du Zixu.

258
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,160
I wasn't sure about it at that time,

259
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,330
but the truth is clear now.

260
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,470
Du Zixu

261
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,990
offered the minister a drug

262
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,390
that could purportedly make him immortal.

263
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,150
But that drug

264
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,710
had to be taken with human blood.

265
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,670
Human blood?

266
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,110
Yes.

267
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,750
It's very likely that those missing people

268
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,270
have been made into drugs.

269
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,150
Besides,

270
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,110
the minister might not be

271
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,440
the only one who took that drug.

272
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,200
There were other users?

273
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,990
So many people went missing.

274
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,790
How could the Minister of Rites

275
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,830
smooth things out alone?

276
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,710
As I attempted to dig deeper,

277
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,510
your father

278
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,990
fired me from the Court of Judicial Review.

279
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,750
Why?

280
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,750
He needed an inconspicuous person

281
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,480
to continue the investigation

282
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,110
in a different way.

283
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,990
So you were sent to death row

284
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,820
as his spy.

285
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,910
Your father wished

286
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,470
I could find a way

287
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,870
to bring Du Zixu out.

288
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,100
[Three years ago, in the prison camp]

289
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,450
What are you looking at? Move!

290
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,640
Unfortunately,

291
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,020
I failed to bring Du Zixu out.

292
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,040
Before I could take action,

293
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,950
someone beat me to it.

294
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,190
That night,

295
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,330
a riot broke out

296
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,630
in the prison.

297
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,790
I didn't know

298
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,790
how the riot started.

299
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,070
All the criminals

300
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,000
scrambled to escape.

301
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,830
Even death row, the most heavily guarded section,

302
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,470
went out of control.

303
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,610
I tried to find Du Zixu,

304
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,050
but he was nowhere to be found.

305
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,950
I had no choice but to escape first.

306
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,210
Later, I realized that

307
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,310
the riot that night

308
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,120
was started by someone deliberately.

309
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,450
When you were on death row,

310
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,420
did you see Yi Zhi Hua?

311
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,360
Yes.

312
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,200
At that time,

313
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,110
I only knew

314
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,610
he was a strange prisoner.

315
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,380
He got his name

316
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,670
because the scar on his forearm

317
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,950
looked like a flower.

318
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,520
After I escaped,

319
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,710
I kept trying

320
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,750
to find Du Zixu.

321
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,870
I found that

322
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,830
he left on a boat

323
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,120
called Taixing.

324
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,310
But it was too late.

325
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,270
Not only

326
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,820
was Du Zixu dead,

327
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,880
but the boatman was also killed.

328
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,020
Their teeth

329
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,750
were all pulled out.

330
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,190
The boatman had a daughter.

331
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,760
She ended up in a village on the shore.

332
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:30,960
At that time,

333
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,640
she was about to be sold.

334
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,430
That girl was me.

335
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,110
That's why you joined hands

336
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,310
to look into Yi Zhi Hua

337
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,850
and are still doing it now.

338
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,270
Then why was the butcher killed too?

339
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,870
Because he was once

340
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,130
your father's spy too.

341
00:14:59,190 --> 00:14:59,550
But

342
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,500
he also sold information to Jinwu Guards.

343
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,630
It was because of him

344
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,080
that I was arrested.

345
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,840
I think your father

346
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,150
must have found something

347
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,190
back then.

348
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,600
Unfortunately, he…

349
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,030
But I know the evidence

350
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,950
your father found

351
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,800
was kept in the Secret Chamber.

352
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,390
I don't know the exact location,

353
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,070
but I think you

354
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,240
can definitely figure out a way to find it.

355
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,470
I found something

356
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,120
really important

357
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,930
about your father as well.

358
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,030
That's why

359
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,550
I caught the butcher's attention.

360
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,950
The murderer who killed your father

361
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,510
was once on death row

362
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,070
with Du Zixu and Yi Zhi Hua.

363
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,790
His nickname

364
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,710
is Black Rakshasa.

365
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,950
Stay put.

366
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,510
I'll check it out.

367
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,190
Okay.

368
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,720
[Criminal… sentenced for mass murder]

369
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,160
You're Black Rakshasa?

370
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,930
You killed Minister Li back then.

371
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,120
What do you want now?

372
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,390
I want to kill you, of course.

373
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,870
And you.

374
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,030
I'll bring you to justice today!

375
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,310
Send up a flare!

376
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,910
Now!

377
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,070
Wu!

378
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,480
You are all bait.

379
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,270
Mr. Li.

380
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,290
Vice Minister.

381
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,510
-Mr. Li.
-Vice Minister.

382
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,300
How are you feeling?

383
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,670
Mr. Li. Mr. Li.

384
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,750
Vice Minister, you're awake.

385
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,310
When

386
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,270
we saw the flare and rushed over,

387
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,000
they were already dead.

388
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,150
You and General Qiu

389
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,930
were unconscious in the yard.

390
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,230
Qiu Qingzhi?

391
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:19,990
Yes.

392
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,270
It was him.

393
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,230
How is he now?

394
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,520
He's badly injured.

395
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,830
Jinwu Guards

396
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,040
have taken him away.

397
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,960
They also wanted to take these two bodies.

398
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,110
We stopped them.

399
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,690
Vice Minister,

400
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,150
what happened last night?

401
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,230
General Qiu…

402
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,160
Did you get into a fight

403
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,230
with him?

404
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,310
Who

405
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,950
killed them?

406
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,390
I think Qiu Qingzhi saved me.

407
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,470
He wasn't there…

408
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,950
He wasn't there for Wu Yiren.

409
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,680
He was there for the murderer.

410
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,450
Vice Minister.

411
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,230
I've examined the crime scene.

412
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,290
The murderer is good at martial arts.

413
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,210
It appears that the bodies

414
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,240
have been moved.

415
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,920
Look here.

416
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,850
They were placed here with a purpose.

417
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,550
Did Jinwu Guards

418
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,230
move the bodies or the items in the room?

419
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,910
No.

420
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,310
When we arrived last night,

421
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,910
you lay unconscious on the floor,

422
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,750
and General Qiu was badly injured.

423
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,610
Everything else is the way it was.

424
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,010
So is that incense?

425
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,220
When we came in,

426
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,350
it had burned out.

427
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,290
There are words written in ashes.

428
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,870
June 7th.

429
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,770
Vice Minister.

430
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,670
The dead man

431
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,270
is holding something in his hand.

432
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,110
Take a look.

433
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,950
It's…

434
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,310
A-A stone?

435
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,550
Why is he holding a stone?

436
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,930
Move the bodies back to the Court of Judicial Review first.

437
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,550
I have something to tell you.

438
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,510
Yes.

439
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,030
Yes.

440
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:19,960
[Li's Residence]

441
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,460
[The Court of Judicial Review]

442
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,000
The person who killed Wu Yiren and Hu Ji

443
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,250
and badly wounded Qiu Qingzhi

444
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,720
is very likely to be the same person

445
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,680
who killed my father.

446
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,800
My father died three years ago.

447
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,200
The Court of Judicial Review caught the murderer.

448
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,580
He was an escaped death row inmate

449
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,350
who was put on death row

450
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,550
by my father.

451
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,070
So the Ministry of Justice concluded

452
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,630
that he harbored resentment against my father

453
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,430
and escaped from death row

454
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,690
to take revenge on him.

455
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,030
It made sense.

456
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,580
Naturally, that case was closed.

457
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,740
But I knew

458
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,590
they probably caught the wrong person.

459
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,920
The murderer that night

460
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,740
was ruthless

461
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,800
and well-trained.

462
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,510
How could he be a reckless fool

463
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,240
who acted on a whim for revenge?

464
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,030
Wu Yiren was my father's spy.

465
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,790
He was ordered by my father

466
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,270
to go undercover on death row

467
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,790
to look into Du Zixu.

468
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,870
After Du Zixu died,

469
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,230
he started going after

470
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,630
Yi Zhi Hua who killed him.

471
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,750
He once also thought it was Yi Zhi Hua

472
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,110
who killed my father.

473
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,510
Then,

474
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,030
Hu Ji found out that the murderer was someone else.

475
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,830
The murderer who killed your father

476
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,630
was once on death row

477
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,170
with Du Zixu and Yi Zhi Hua.

478
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,830
His nickname

479
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,960
is Black Rakshasa.

480
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,270
Unfortunately, Hu Ji

481
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,590
was attacked soon after saying that

482
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,070
and stabbed to death.

483
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,350
The former Minister of Judicial Review's case

484
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,150
was considered open-and-shut.

485
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,870
Who could be so powerful to fabricate…

486
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,830
To fabricate

487
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,960
the case file about my father's death.

488
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,390
Other than those

489
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,630
who clung to

490
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,720
Du Zixu's formula

491
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,070
for immortality,

492
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,960
who else could it be?

493
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,270
Now that the Minister of Rites

494
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,190
is dead,

495
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,230
I'm afraid it's harder

496
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,160
to find the mastermind.

497
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,830
If we can't find the mastermind,

498
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,150
we can try to find that killer first.

499
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,110
Hu Ji said

500
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,310
that man's nickname is Black Rakshasa.

501
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,550
Did that killer

502
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,430
escape from death row

503
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,920
three years ago as well?

504
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,390
We must find Black Rakshasa.

505
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,220
Okay.

506
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,920
Since you've made up your mind,

507
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,390
I'll help you.

508
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,070
We're a team after all.

509
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,510
Vice Minister,

510
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,950
since you decided to tell us,

511
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,910
you must have known

512
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,030
this would happen.

513
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,280
But this case

514
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,340
is too dangerous.

515
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,270
It is.

516
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,710
We don't know

517
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,480
who's behind all these crimes.

518
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,740
Actually,

519
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,910
I've noticed

520
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,590
that the forces in the court

521
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,300
are paying unusual attention to the Court of Judicial Review.

522
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,190
There aren't many people around me

523
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,190
who I can trust.

524
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,790
Vice Minister Shangguan.

525
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,510
My buddies and I

526
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,750
are trustworthy.

527
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,790
Vice Minister, don't worry.

528
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,270
We know what to do.

529
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,770
Then where should we start?

530
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,110
You didn't touch anything

531
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,990
at the crime scene, did you?

532
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,790
Then it should be

533
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,150
Black Rakshasa's doing.

534
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,550
If I remember correctly,

535
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,510
the positions of the bodies were changed.

536
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,150
Vice Minister,

537
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,540
it appears that the bodies

538
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,440
were moved.

539
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,430
And…

540
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,760
The incense.

541
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,350
June 7th.

542
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,910
[June 7th]

543
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,070
The stone.

544
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,150
Chen Shi.

545
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,260
Mr. Li.

546
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,230
The Court of Judicial Review

547
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,760
will hold the entrance exam tomorrow, right?

548
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,990
This case is extremely dangerous.

549
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,590
We can't afford any mishaps.

550
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,820
You haven't been officially admitted

551
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,870
to the Court of Judicial Review yet.

552
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,470
You'll stay out of this case.

553
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,430
Focus on the exam.

554
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,630
But…

555
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,110
Chen Shi.

556
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,940
I want to work with…

557
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,220
This is a complicated case.

558
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,880
It can't be solved overnight.

559
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,160
Focus on the exam now.

560
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,870
You can come back to us

561
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,200
after you pass the exam.

562
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,830
We gave you lessons

563
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,630
for so many days.

564
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,270
Make our effort worth it.

565
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,670
Fine.

566
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,830
You must be careful.

567
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,440
Be careful.

568
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,960
Watch your step.

569
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:27,790
Why didn't you go with

570
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,950
Wang Qi and the others?

571
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,670
There are many of them. They can do it without me.

572
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,870
So I came out with you.

573
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,670
Besides,

574
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,030
many incense shops

575
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,110
are run by foreign merchants.

576
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,310
I can be of great help.

577
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,150
Also, you and I

I'm Li Bing from the Court of Judicial Review.

767
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,590
Mr. Li.

768
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,670
How are my hands?

769
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,140
Your fingers are scratched.

770
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,190
It's not serious.

771
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,230
They told me to keep playing.

772
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,000
If I stopped,

773
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,110
they'd smash Wan's qin.

774
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,190
They're gone.

775
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,310
No one will smash your qin.

776
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,750
Grab the rail tightly.

777
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,680
I'm going to remove the blindfold.

778
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,230
You may be shocked,

779
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,160
but don't be afraid.

780
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,510
There's a chain around your waist.

781
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,770
I'm going to untie you.

782
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,250
Let's get you in.

783
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,550
Slowly.

784
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,610
Hold tight.

786
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,350
I've asked Ms. Kou's jailer.

787
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,430
He said

788
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,700
this morning,

789
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,230
an official took Ms. Kou away for interrogation.

790
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:49,910
After that,

791
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,710
she wasn't sent back.

792
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,630
What does that man look like?

793
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,910
Do we have a portrait of him?

794
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,040
The jailer only said

795
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,430
that man was in an official uniform and had a token in his hand.

796
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,750
That's all he can remember.

797
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,280
It's useless to know what that man looks like.

798
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,590
Black Rakshasa could have changed his appearance

799
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,190
or sent someone else to do it.

800
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,560

00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,070
He wants us to follow the clues.

804
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:21,990
Do we have to do

805
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,190
what he wants us to do?

to leave me alone!
