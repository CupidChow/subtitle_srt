[Episode 33]

4
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,750
Sirs.

5
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,900
What exactly do you want?

6
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,350
Be gentle. It hurts.

7
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,960
Selling favors in the name of repairing them,

8
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,450
you borrow the paintings to copy them

9
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,360
so that you can switch them out.

10
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,030
So what?

11
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,090
I'm just leaving the good stuff

12
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,960
to those

13
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,750
who truly appreciate them.

14
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,030
Stealing is stealing.

15
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,050
Enough with the absurd reasoning.

16
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,670
Do you really think you're being logical,

17
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,230
huh?

18
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,510
Report me to the government if you want.

19
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,829
Take the paintings if you want.

20
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,790
Don't lecture me.

21
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,450
What if we don't do any of that?

22
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,880
Let me ask you one thing.

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,590
Five years ago,

24
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,710
there was a treasure of Zixu State

25
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,400
that ended up in Shendu. You...

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,460
I've never seen it.

27
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,590
You're lying through your teeth.

28
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,680
Get this clear.

29
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,950
You're the ones who need my help.

30
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,000
Even if I keep it from you,

31
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,670
what can you do to me?

32
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,990
Then we can only

33
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,310
offend you.

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,870
Your treasures

35
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,270
look nice.

36
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,920
What's going on?

37
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,079
You haven't seen it, right?

38
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,930
Stop. Stop.

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,420
I've seen it before.

40
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,670
Let me ask you.

41
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,320
What is that treasure?

42
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,470
Tell us the truth.

43
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,270
If there's even a single lie,

44
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,150
don't think about keeping a single thing

45
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,630
in your house.

46
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,870
It's

47
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,190
an armor.

48
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,630
An armor?

49
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,000
What's so special about an armor?

50
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,370
You really don't know.

51
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,890
That's not an ordinary armor.

52
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:29,680
Then

53
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,310
could it be the king's armor?

54
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,190
If it belongs to King Zixu,

55
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,430
it's no big deal.

56
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,590
Do you know of

57
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,490
the legend of a mythical beast in Zixu State?

58
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,750
The Fengsheng Beast?

59
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,360
That armor

60
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,590
belongs to the hero who killed the mythical beast.

61
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,310
It's Alibaba and the others.

62
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,830
They're still investigating at the wharf.

63
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,360
Do you need weapons?

64
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,290
No.

65
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,320
I need an escort.

66
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,960
An escort?

67
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,010
Who told you that?

68
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,100
Hou's men.

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,570
They said you transported goods for the government

70
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,370
and even escaped from a sunken ship.

71
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,430
You sure have heard

72
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,150
a lot.

73
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,110
With money,

74
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,610
you can find out anything.

75
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,480
That's true.

76
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,000
But

77
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,190
don't tell me you are working together

78
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,110
to cheat us?

79
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,180
Everyone knows how to brag.

80
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,230
Portraits have been put up

81
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,110
at the city gate and various neighborhoods.

82
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,720
We've also sent double the manpower

83
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,510
to investigate it.

84
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,790
But we haven't found

85
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,920
Li Bing and his gang.

86
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,680
If we can find them in a few days,

87
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,250
it wouldn't be Li Bing.

88
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,770

89
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,420
There is a worker from a blacksmith shop

90

who insists on meeting you.

91
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,030

93
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,000
Follow them.

94
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,430

95
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,390

-Yes.
-Yes.

Hiding in plain sight in the city

111
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,870
is a good idea.

112
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,470

Yes, sir.

135
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,030
What's wrong?

136
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,840
Just say it.

137
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,760
Don't hesitate while speaking.

138
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,860
It's annoying.

139
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,790
Your Majesty, you should consider carefully

140
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,050
before you approve it.

141
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,740
Then how do you suggest

142
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,230
I consider it?

143
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,750
I remember

144
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,130
they sent a message

145
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,160
that mentioned this memorial.

146

They are so nosy!

147
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,310
Nice decoration.

148
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,530
I found you.

149
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,550
What is that?

150
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,510
Let me see.

151
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,110
If you want to know...

152
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,670
come and get it yourself.

153
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,390
You tricked me into coming here?

154
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,490

[Hidden in the palace's treasury]

156
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,180
Since we can

157
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,110
analyze these information,

158
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,090
Qiu Qingzhi can definitely do it too.

159
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,430
So not only do we have to

160
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,760
be faster than Yi Zhi Hua

161
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,640
but also deal with Qiu Qingzhi.

162
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,500
Showcasing weakness

163
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,790
is a good strategy.

164
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,750
In other words,

165
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,350
you already knew that what I want

166
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,360
is not in here,

167
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,030
right?

168
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,430
A thief broke into the treasury!

169
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:22,950
Arrest them immediately

170
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,750
without delay!

171
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,350
Yes.

172
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,730
Why don't we talk somewhere else?

173
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,190
You're teasing me.

174
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,300
Interesting.

175
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,750
Isn't this the same as how

176
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,550
you teased us?

177
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,230
No.

178
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,150
I was helping you before.

179

If nothing goes wrong,

180
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,740
my partners would have

181
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,800
found the thing you want.

182
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,370
But I'm not planning to give it to you.

183
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,350
I see.

184
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,420
You mean

185
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,240
you want me to get it myself?

186
00:14:59,050 --> 00:14:59,830
Try it.

187
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,470
Interesting.

188
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,460

Why isn't it

192
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,910
as grand as I imagined?

193
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,470
It's even a bit spooky.

194
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,670
It's the place where they serve the dynasty founders.

195
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,990
They are all dead.

196
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,190
How strong can their yang energy be?

197
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:43,990
You're right.

198
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,740
Vice Minister's father

199
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,470
is really...

200
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,630
This map is drawn too simply.

201
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,020
We are not vice ministers.

202
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,750
How can we understand all this?

203
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,830
Yes.

204
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,860
I'm afraid

205
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,970
these were the Pavilion Elders' private collections.

206
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,830
Each room is different.

207
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,710
Each Pavilion Elder's preferences during their lifetime

208
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,640
were different.

209
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,860
Enough talking.

210
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,900
Find the armor.

211
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,150
This room is full of books

212
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,250
and writing tools.

213
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,310
The owner of this room

214
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,110
was a general.

215
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,910
However,

216
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,550
there are only weapons and paintings of galloping horses in the room.

217
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,550
These are all rough cloth and linen.

218
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,490
Is it possible that

219
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,910
the armor is not in the pavilion?

220
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,670
This doesn't look like a place hiding treasure.

221
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,930
I trust Vice Minister.

222
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,069
Let's keep looking.

223
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,750
Is it this one?

224
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,780
Not that one.

225
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,030
What?

226
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,370
The one on it

227
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,970
is what we are looking for.

228
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,270
Stop talking nonsense.

229
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,950
This is a chainmail armor.

230
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,230
This is too shabby.

231
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,470
The Zixu Army is far inferior to ours.

232
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,510
Maybe it's true.

233
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,350
Oh no! Run!

234
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,070
Run!

235
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,430
You go first.

236
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,220
I'll deal with them.

237
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,970
Be careful.

238
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,630
Okay.

239
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:44,790
Who are you?

240
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:45,770
Stop there!

241
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,070
[God will bestow blessings on those who are filial]

242
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,690
Get out of the way!

243
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,920
Don't worry.

244
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,610
I can catch up with you.

245
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,280
How is it?

246
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,030
It's familiar, isn't it?

247
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,240
You actually found this place.

248
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,150
What a pain.

249
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,140
Tell me, Li Bing.

250
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,910
How did you find this place?

251
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,970
Surprised, right?

252
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,350
On the night you killed Shangguan,

253
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,230
you had cat hair on you.

254
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,960
I see.

255
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,940
But you should know

256
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,470
that what I hate the most

257
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,800
is people inquiring about my background.

258
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,230
It was not easy

259
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,310
to find a satisfactory

260
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,230
place.

261
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,970
Nice one.

262
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,270
You set a trap for me in my home.

263
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,310
This time,

264
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,270
I managed to be ahead of you.

265
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,270
It's you.

266
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,900
I told you

267
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,310
we will catch you.

268
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,540
Don't waste your energy.

269
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,850
I've tested this cage.

270
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,230
If I couldn't escape it,

271
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,490
neither could you.

272
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:56,850
Fine.

273
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,680
You won

274
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,690
this round.

275
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,440
Yi Zhi Hua.

276
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,590
You...

277
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,110
It's me.

278
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:11,830
I made you

279
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,590
like this.

280
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,050
Isn't that what you want to know?

281
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,990
At this point,

282
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,490
there's no need to hide it.

283
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,470
You still want to know why,

284
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,950
right?

285
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,150
Don't be anxious.

286
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,510
What are you doing?

287
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,440
It's time to eat.

288
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,950
Feed them.

289
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,350
The food is under the plank.

290
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,350
There's a bag.

291
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,550
Done.

292
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,930
Give me some.

293
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,240
From where I came from,

294
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,670
Zixu State,

295
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,470
there appeared

296
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,750
a very strange animal.

297
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,150
It's similar to them

298
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,030
but it's much bigger.

299
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,310
We call it Kekechir.

300
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,230
It means immortal being.

301
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,460
In your book,

302
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,790
it's called the Fengsheng Beast.

303
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,070
It eats humans

304
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,850
and can't be killed.

305
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,510
We could only worship it.

306
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,880
Back then, the king used humans as its food.

307
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,910
Every day,

308
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,470
one person from the slave camp

309
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,630
was chosen for it

310
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,550
to feed on.

311
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,210
They were afraid it'd go out to eat people.

312
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,790
One day, I was chosen.

313
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,750
I was sent to that cave.

314
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,170
Stop!

315
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,190
It's your honor

316
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,290
to serve Kekechir.

317
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,470
Go in.

318
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,240
Sir!

319
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,280
-Sir!
-Go in.

320
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,020
I'll lend this to you.

321
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,350
It might save your life.

322
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,190
Let's go.

323
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,050
Unexpectedly, I was lucky.

324
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,600
Not only did that beast not eat me

325
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,850
but it was also killed by me.

326
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,390
I killed it.

327
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,030
But...

328
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,220
Mother!

329
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,850
Mother!

330
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,640
I... I'm back alive.

331
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,670
I'm back alive!

332
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,310
Mother.

333
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,190
I...

334
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,470
Demon! Demon! Demon!

335
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,480
Demon!

336
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,190
My mother

337
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,620
called me a demon.

338
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,570
That felt so strange.

339
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,710
At that moment,

340
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,110
I saw how I looked.

341
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,950
I was neither a human nor a cat.

342
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,190
I was just like a demon.

343
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,440
But I barely managed

344
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,470
to survive.

345
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,540
How did I become a demon?

346
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,010
I didn't know where to go

347
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,590
and dared not go anywhere.

348
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,930
I only dared to wander in the forest.

349
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,280
One day.

350
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,330
Two days.

351
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,840
Three days.

352
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,810
I didn't remember how long

353
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,940
I'd been starving.

354
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,270
Who are you?

355
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,550
So this is

356
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,830
the food I need.

357
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
The taste of human blood

358
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,540
was not only sweet but also had miraculous effects.

359
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,820
I'd decided to figure out

360
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,670
why I became

361
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,910
like this.

362
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,880
At that time,

363
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,430
I also heard that a mysterious man

364
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,660
appeared

365
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,200
and gave the king

366
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,380
a kind of magical medicine.

367
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,300
That magical medicine

368
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,250
could help him regain his youth.

369
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,670
That person

370
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,730
was the one who gave me the dagger.

371
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,110
I saw

372
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,640
that the Fengsheng Beast's corpse

373
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,370
had already become a skeleton.

374
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,070
The bones of the Fengsheng Beast

375
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,590
are the guiding drug

376
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,590
of the so-called magical medicine.

377
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,390
I'd clarified

378
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,190
everything.

379
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,950
He is a hunter who specializes

380
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,310
in hunting Fengsheng Beasts.

381
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,140
Fengsheng Beasts are extremely rare.

382
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,270
Their flesh and bones

383
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,610
can help people prolong their lives.

384
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,470
And the dagger made of special material

385
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,710
is the only thing

386
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,850
that can kill them.

387
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,710
He heard that a Fengsheng Beast

388
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,500
appeared in Zixu State.

389
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,660
He gave me that dagger.

390
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,940
If I'd really killed the Fengsheng Beast,

391
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,200
he could have used it to seek wealth.

392
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,740
Those who were hurt by Fengsheng Beasts

393
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,590
didn't survive.

394
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,310
I...

395
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,760
am the only one who survived.

396
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,080
He didn't know why either.

397
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,770
I killed him.

398
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,020
I also ate him.

399
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,620
I killed throughout my journey.

400
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,100
The king was the last one to die in my hands.

401
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,200
With just one finger,

402
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,600
I slit his neck open.

403
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,620
And I became a god.

404
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,680
Then why did you come to Shendu?

405
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,910
Of course I'm here

406
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,010
to find the dagger.

407
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,880
I heard it ended up here,

408
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,030
in Shendu.

409
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,550
This doesn't explain it.

410
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,340
This doesn't explain your motive.

411
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,000
You asked the wrong question.

412
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,910
Why

413
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,870
did you become

414
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,190
a monster like me?

415
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,790
Shouldn't this be

416
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,220
your utmost concern?

417
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,320
Why?

418
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,540
I can only tell you...

419
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,520
that someone

420
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,470
made a deal with me.

421
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,870
They asked me

422
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,100
to turn you into this.

423
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,780
Who?

424
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,830
This is the most interesting part

425
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,780
in this game.

426
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,010
I can't tell you now.

427
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,860
Who?

428
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,920
Who?

429
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,050
Who?

430
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,190
Ask yourself.

431
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,510
Are you a human

432
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,730
or a monster?

433
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,430
Even if you find out the truth,

434
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,470
will others believe you?

435
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,240
If one day

436
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,120
the world sees you

437
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,410
as a half-human and half-cat,

438
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,350
would they still let you

439
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,280
be the vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review?

440
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,550
That's ridiculous.

441
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,130
What are you doing?

442
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:28,690
Let's go.

443
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,390
Mr. Li!

444
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:31,870
Mr. Li!

445
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,400
What should come will come.

446
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,270
Mr. Li! Mr. Li!

447
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,560
What are you doing?

448
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,350
What are you doing?

449
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,060
In the future, you will have to behave yourselves

450
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,490
and fend for yourselves.

451
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,430
I don't think I'll be able to

452
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,830
take care of you anymore.

453
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,990
The thing that Du Zixu and Yi Zhi Hua are looking for

454
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,930
is that dagger.

455
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,070
Du Zixu is also a descendant

456
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,400
of the clan that hunted Fengsheng Beasts.

457
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,540
He wants to find that dagger

458
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,010
to kill Yi Zhi Hua.

459
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,310
And Yi Zhi Hua wants to find

460
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,070
that dagger

461
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,700
to wipe out the threat forever.

462
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,330
Where is that dagger?

463
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,100
Only Li Bing knows.

464
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,000
Pavilion Elder, please excuse us.

465
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,130
I want to interrogate Li Bing alone.

466
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,790
I didn't expect

467
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,190
that you've been using me

468
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,420
to find Yi Zhi Hua.

469
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,590
The people of Yong'an Pavilion aspire to become gods.

470
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,920
That's why they're looking for Yi Zhi Hua.

471
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,820
So they are looking for the dagger

472
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,070
that can control him.

473
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,440
Qiu Qingzhi!

474
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,930
Why are you doing this?

475
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,870
What do you want?

476
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,040
It's simple.

477
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,610
I don't want to be a slave anymore.

478
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,570
I want to enter Yong'an Pavilion.

479
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,390
I didn't expect

480
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,690
you to be such a person.

481
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,530
That means you don't know me well.

482
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,470
Where is the dagger?

483
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,480
I don't know.

484
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,200
You know it.

485
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,710
It's that dagger.

486
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,320
Is the dagger in your house?

487
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,690
I don't know.

488
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,990
I didn't expect that

489
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,590
everything was determined by fate.

490
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,640
When I was in Zixu,

491
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,400
I was also surprised when I saw

492
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,970
the picture of the dagger.

493
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,910
Li Bing, let me ask you again.

494
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,830
Is the dagger in the Court of Judicial Review?

495
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,350
I don't know.

496
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,470
Do you think I can't guess

497
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,660
where the dagger is

498
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,720
just because you won't say anything?

499
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,030
I know you better

500
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,540
than you think.

501
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,949
Got it.

502
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,330
What about those people in Mingjing Hall?

503
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,870
Kill them.

504
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,429
How could Vice Minister be arrested?

505
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,360
I don't know.

506
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,159
We had caught

507
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,830
Yi Zhi Hua

508
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,739
and were about to interrogate him.

509
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,139
Then Qiu Qingzhi came in.

510
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,909
Let's not talk about this.

511
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:30,030
We need to find a way out.

512
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,389
We have to save Mr. Li.

513
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,949
Do you think it's easy

514
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,670
to escape this place?

515
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,719
You're right.

516
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,830
I wonder how

517
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:40,909
Sun Bao is now.

518
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,010
Sun Bao is dead.

519
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,190
-Impossible!
-Impossible!

520
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:46,510
This...

521
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,969
You'll be joining him too.

522
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,389
You...

523
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,949
What are you doing?

524
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,850
I haven't had my last meal!

525
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,920
-What are you doing?
-Wait.

526
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,190
Go!

527
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,870
What do you want?

528
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,930
What are you doing?

529
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,310
We meet again.

530
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,830
I didn't expect this game to be played

531
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,450
at this scale.

532
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,960
I told you

533
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,810
I'd catch you again.

534
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,600
Qiu Qingzhi.

535
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,060
Have you never thought

536
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,440
that I was waiting for you?

537
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,360
Yi Zhi Hua, you lost.

538
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,240
You think that since you've caught me

539
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,040
and sent me to Yong'an Pavilion,

540
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,030
you've won?

541
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:42,780
Or

542
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,090
do you want me all to yourself?

543
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,690
I don't want longevity,

544
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,470
but something else.

545
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,280
About that dagger,

546
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,710
I already know where it is.

547
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:01,790
You do?

548
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,710
I do.

549
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,110
What do you want to exchange it for?

550
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,510
Power?

551
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,750
Qiu Qingzhi.

552
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,860
You're just like you were three years ago.

553
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,840
You haven't improved at all!

554
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,490
You made no progress at all!

555
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,430
Don't miscalculate the number of heads.

556
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,510
-They're all our achievements.
-Yes.

557
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,060
Yes.

558
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:35,990
My Lord.

559
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,310
Come in.

560
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,710
It's you? What's the matter?

561
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:43,990
My Lord.

562
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,200
I was the main contributor

563
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,120
in us breaking the formation today.

564
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Qiu Qingzhi.

565
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,260
You were just a slave.

566
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,520
You want to take credit too?

567
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,750
Do you think you are different

568
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,390
now that you're at Zixu?

569
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,810
One's social status doesn't matter in fighting the enemy.

570
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,440
If it's my contribution,

571
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,160
I should take credit for it.

572
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,340
You've made a lot of contributions.

573
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,560
Do you want to be freed from your slave status with military merits?

574
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,940
But after this war,

575
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,670
you don't need to fight anymore.

576
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,350
You should still die in honor

577
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,460
as a slave.

578
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,490
Guards!

579
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,010
Yes.

580
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,190
Tie him up!

581
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,850
-Yes.
-Yes.

582
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,350
Go!

583
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,220
Hurry up!

584
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,270
Hurry up!

585
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,520
Walk faster!

586
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,910
You weren't afraid when fighting for credit.

587
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,190
Yet now your legs are weak.

588
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,350
Get up!

589
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,580
Zixu is remote and desolate.

590
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,350
What do you think

591
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,590
this war is for?

592
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,270
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

593
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,240
Take care of what I asked you to do first.

594
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,810
Someone important is coming tonight.

595
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,690
Be vigilant.

596
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,230
Also,

597
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,530
all the slave soldiers who participated in this battle

598
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,620
should be disarmed and disposed of

599
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,460
together.

600
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,740
The one who escaped just now...

601
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,430
You don't have to rush to find him.

602
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,810
He's just a slave soldier.

603
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,030
I don't think he can cause

604
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,960
any big trouble.

605
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,270
You may leave.

606
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,480
Yes.

607
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,430
The two of you.

608
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,190
Go take a look.

609
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:40,850
-Yes.
-Yes.

610
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,000
Tell me.

611
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,830
What is inside the stone coffin?

612
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,550
Why are you using

613
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,680
our lives to fill it?

614
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,120
Bad news!

615
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,180
Bad news!

616
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,390
What happened?

617
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,270
Two lords just asked me to report

618
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,180
that our camp is being raided!

619
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,950
Where?

620
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,020
A mile ahead.

621
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,510
The few of you, stand guard here.

622
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:28,950
Yes.

623
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,830
The rest, follow me.

624
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:30,270
Yes.
