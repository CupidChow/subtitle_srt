[Episode 28]

4
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,670
Alibaba,

5
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,670
you're quite brave now.

6
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,750
How dare you

7
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,680
break into the Shangguan Mansion?

8
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,480
Do you think I’m stupid?

9
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,230
Do you really think

10
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,490
I can't recognize you?

11
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,670
Speak.

12
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,110
I...

13
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,630
What are you doing here?

14
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,230
I need to talk to

15
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,710
Vice Minister Shangguan about something.

16
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,669
Something?

17
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,310
What thing is it?

18
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,360
Is it about the case?

19
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,030
Alibaba,

20
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,630
I'll say it again.

21
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,440
I know you don't trust me

22
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,430
and the Young Miss doesn't trust me either.

23
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,790
I'm part of the Court of Judicial Review now.

24
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,030
I'm the judicial commissioner of the Court of Judicial Review first

25
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,070
and the Young Miss's servant second.

26
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,660
So, you have to tell me.

27
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,630
Really?

28
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:49,590
Young Miss.

29
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,190
Oh no.

30
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,650
This is troubling.

31
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,440
Come on!

32
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,340
What should I do?

33
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,550
Paper.

34
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,180
Hurry up.

35
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,950
Tongue.

36
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,160
Baba,

37
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,950
you just kept babbling.

38
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,270
Why didn't you say this earlier?

39
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,190
This is the room.

40
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,750
It's the one with carvings on the window frame.

41
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,829
You must find the correct one.

42
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,070
Don't go to the wrong place.

43
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,750
Got it.

44
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,030
Come on.

45
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,130
Tie me up.

46
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,070
Otherwise, I'd be the unlucky one

47
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,390
if you're discovered.

48
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,630
That makes sense.

49
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,670
Belt.

50
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,150
My belt.

51
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,910
Thank you.

52
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,770
Be careful.

53
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,360
Are you okay?

54
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,560
I’m fine. Don’t worry.

55
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,470
After receiving your letter,

56
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,190
I was afraid you might be in danger, so—

57
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,270
I'm not in danger.

58
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,750
Li Bing is in danger.

59
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,230
The Black Rakshasa set a trap for him,

60
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,890
waiting for him to fall for it.

61
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,190
Vice Minister Shangguan,

62
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,990
how do you know

63
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,970
the Black Rakshasa arranged this?

64
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,580
You suspect me?

65
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,990
No, no, no.

66
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,790
I'm worried about your safety.

67
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,390
So...

68
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,390
So...

69
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,660
Don't worry.

70
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,510
Wang Qi and the others are on their way.

71
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,310
Wang Qi?

72
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,350
They are not enough.

73
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,080
Let's go too.

74
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,390
Give me a hand.

75
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,120
Young Miss, Master is here.

76
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,110
I...

77
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:32,800
Hide.

78
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,030
Be quiet.

79
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,580
Qin,

80
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,710
can't you understand

81
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,070
my difficulties?

82
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,190
Father,

83
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,110
I'm tired.

84
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,270
I want to be alone.

85
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,110
Don't be angry at me.

86
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,190
I'll answer

87
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,110
whatever questions you have.

88
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,430
I have no questions.

89
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,870
Qin.

90
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,310
My Lord!

91
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,550
Come out!

92
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,600
You are from the Court of Judicial Review.

93
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,950
Was he the one who

94
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,360
tied you up?

95
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,270
My Lord,

96
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,310
I...

97
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,150
I'm afraid you won't be able to return.

98
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:01,920
Father.

99
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,330
If you want to kill him,

100
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,190
kill me first.

101
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,310
Vice Minister Shangguan.

102
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,950
Shut up!

103
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,240
I called for him to come,

104
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,950
in order to expose your actions

105
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,990
to the public.

106
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:22,830
Father,

107
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,230
you've taught me since I was a child

108
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,070
that a gentleman should be tolerant and not fight,

109
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,070
and get along with others but not take sides.

110
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,600
I've always kept it in mind.

111
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,450
I also thought that

112
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,630
since you're older now,

113
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,390
it's inevitable that you're more scheming

114
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,750
and that's why you are

115
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,280
strategizing in the court.

116
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,990
I didn't expect

117
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,830
you would really

118
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,630
be corrupt

119
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,270
and disregard human lives.

120
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,840
Qin.

121
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,430
Father,

122
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,870
have you forgotten

123
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,000
that you taught me to

124
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,200
be kind and magnanimous to all?

125
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,000
You—

126
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,030
Minister.

127
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,950
Minister,

128
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,500
don't be angry with Young Miss.

129
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,380
She's just speaking

130
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,190
childishly.

131
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,260
She's just upset.

132
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,590
My Lord,

133
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,110
you kept her

134
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,230
from these cases

135
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,550
because you feared she'd be implicated.

136
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,750
If it were in the past,

137
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,280
she would understand your difficulties,

138
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,240
but now,

139
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,550
I'm afraid it's hard.

140
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,590
Young Miss

141
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,990
might have feelings for him.

142
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,990
He is from the Mingjing Hall.

143
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,710
As long as he is there,

144
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,470
the Young Miss will naturally help them.

145
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,470
She can't ignore

146
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,830
these cases, My Lord.

147
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,760
Lord Shangguan.

148
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,960
Lord Shangguan.

149
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,780
I am

150
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,830
sincerely and deeply

151
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,960
in love with Vice Minister Shangguan.

152
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,660
I really don’t want to investigate any cases.

153
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,030
I just want to

154
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,130
elope with Vice Minister Shangguan.

155
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,310
I'm a foreigner.

156
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,470
I don't care about

157
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,910
the conflicts in Shendu.

158
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,240
Leave.

159
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,040
Don't mind my business anymore

160
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,030
and I won't mind yours either.

161
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,150
Leave Shendu.

162
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,750
Once everything settles down,

163
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,540
you can do

164
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,200
whatever you want.

165
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,590
Father.

166
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,790
Your luggage and money are in the carriage.

167
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,000
I've prepared them for you.

168
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,430
After you arrive at the wharf,

169
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,360
the ship will set off immediately.

170
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,470
It can take you

171
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,110
out of this troubled place.

172
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,750
I've finally settled one of

173
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,950
my worries.

174
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,950
Go on.

175
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,350
Father.

176
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,870
Vice Minister.

177
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,270
Stop talking.

178
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,990
You were right.

179
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,420
My father is an accomplice of the Black Rakshasa.

180
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,230
I...

181
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,860
Vice Minister, I...

182
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,710
Stop talking.

183
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,170
Let me cry a little longer.

184
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,790
Vice Minister,

185
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,150
I know you don't want to go far.

186
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,430
I've arranged my men already.

187
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,780
They are in Zhuxie Alley.

188
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,710
What did you say?

189
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,710
Zhuxie Alley.

190
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,750
Don't worry.

191
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,550
It'll be fine.

192
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,100
Zhuxie Alley?

193
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,510
Zhuxie Alley.

194
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,870
You know me well.

195
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,950
I took the most myself!

But it's so big.

388
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,750
Which way should we go?

389
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,070
If only the Vice Minister were here.

390
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,590
He could follow the smell.

391
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,310
Wait.

392
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,700
Listen.

393
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,550
I think I hear something.

394
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,310
Let's go.

395
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:40,470
Let's go.

396
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,400
Mr. Li!

397
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,310
Brother, stop!

398
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,150
Watch out!

399
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,270
Brother!

400
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:33,830
Mr. Li!

401
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,590
Stop fighting!

402
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,820
Sun Bao,

403
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,870
quick.

404
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,590
Get the fire stick.

405
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,190
Wait.

406
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,070
What are you waiting for?

407
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,470
It's scary to walk in the dark.

408
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,230
Have you forgotten

409
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,630
the Black Rakshasa's kerosene last time?

410
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,690
Yes.

411
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,880
Cui Bei is still here

412
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,440
and you dare to light a fire?

413
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,190
Quick, put it away.

414
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,630
It seems

415
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,360
that it's a dead end.

416
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,350
There's a door.

417
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,750
Alibaba?

418
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,550
How did you...

419
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,230
Where did you come from?

420
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,430
Where is Vice Minister Shangguan?

421
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,590
Don’t worry. She's safe.

422
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,950
Let's go. Hurry.

423
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,070
I can't open it.

424
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,830
Let me try.

425
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,750
Let me try.

426
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,950
Brother.

427
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,830
Brother!

428
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,070
Brother!

429
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,950
Brother!

430
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,230
How is it?

431
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,320
I feel like it's getting loose.

432
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,630
Do you feel

433
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,030
a little hot suddenly?

434
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,270
The door grew hotter.

435
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,910
You're right.

436
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,030
Hurry!

437
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,310
Brother!

438
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,720
Sir.

439
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,030
Brother!

440
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,070
Chen Shi!

441
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,360
Chen Shi!

442
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:17,990
Chen Shi!

443
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:19,950
Hurry!

444
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,830
Come on.

445
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:24,950
Chen Shi!

446
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,510
Chen Shi!

447
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:27,910
Brother!

448
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,440
Chen Shi!

449
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:30,750
Brother!

450
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,520
Chen Shi!

451
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,470
Brother!

452
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,150
Brother.

453
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,680
Chen Shi!

454
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,470
Brother.

455
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,590
Brother.

456
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,510
Brother!.

457
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,990
Chen Shi!

458
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,680
Brother.

459
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,790
Chen Shi, calm down.

460
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,710
Chen Shi!

461
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:05,950
Chen Shi!

462
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,430
Calm down.

463
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,699
Brother.

464
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,270
Minister Li,

465
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,830
since I made you

466
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,350
the Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review,

467
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,280
you've solved many strange cases.

468
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,620
However, these cases

469
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,100
are too shocking.

470
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,000
The people of Shendu are growing more anxious.

471
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,080
This time,

472
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,070
this assassin named Black Rakshasa

473
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,909
killed many people in one day

474
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,790
and even involved

475
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,960
the Minister of Defense.

476
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,429
The court and civilians are shocked.

477
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:33,750
The Court of Judicial Review cannot escape blame.

478
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,230
Your Majesty, I have let you down.

479
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,030
The Black Rakshasa had a brother

480
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,830
who worked under you.

481
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,050
Is he related to this case?

482
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,790
I can guarantee with my life

483
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,750
that he has nothing to do

484
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,800
with the Black Rakshasa's crimes.

485
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,010
All of the mistakes

486
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,260
are my fault.

487
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,630
Your Majesty, please show mercy

488
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,870
and not hold the Court of Judicial Review accountable.

489
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,750
Minister Li,

490
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,520
you've worked hard.

491
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,350
For the time being,

492
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,330
you can rest from your duties.

493
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,910
Some senior officials

494
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,990
strongly recommended

495
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,270
Lai Zhongshu, the consultant of the Jinwu Guard,

496
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,800
to take Vice Minister Shangguan Qin's place.

497
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,000
I

498
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,270
have approved it.

499
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,690
Minister Li.

501
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,470
Remember,

502
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:18,710
you must

503
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,950
be more careful.

504
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,110
I understand.

505
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,050
I'll take my leave.

506
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,390
Open the door.

507
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,490
Do you have tea?

508
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,680
Lord Shangguan,

509
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,790
the most important thing now

510
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,950
is to save your life.

511
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,190
Guards!

512
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,370
Serve tea for Lord Shangguan.

513
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,110
Lai Zhongshu.

514
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,680
Qiu Qingzhi has not recovered yet,

515
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,710
so he can't suppress you.

516
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,990
As the new Vice Minister

517
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,550
of the Court of Judicial Review,

518
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,870
you're enjoying your power.

519
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,030
I dare not.

520
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,550
Vice Minister Li,

521
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,560
I know what you want to hear.

522
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,310
Let me tell you.

523
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,890
Four or five years ago,

524
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:44,010
the Minister of Rites was about to die of old age.

525
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,750
A sorcerer from the Western Regions

526
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,710
named Du Zixu

527
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,830
used a strange medicine

528
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,960
to cure his illness.

529
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,760
However, this medicine

530
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,070
needed human blood.

531
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,690
He had to keep killing people.

532
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,950
It was hard to keep it hidden.

533
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,270
I found the person

534
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,340
in the Ministry of Justice who found blood for him.

535
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,710
It was Wang Zhi.

536
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,910
I used this to threaten him

537
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,070
to help me become

538
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,630
the Minister of Defense.

539
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,590
To be safe,

540
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,190
I threw Du Zixu and Wang Zhi

541
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,180
into death row.

542
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,270
Then, why must you kill

543
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,350
the former Minister of Judicial Review?

544
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,480
Du Zixu's prescription

545
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,470
spread to the civilians.

546
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,100
It was the Five Minerals Powder.

547
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,190
After the war,

548
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,430
the people of Shendu were all fearful

549
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,090
and there was a drug epidemic.

550
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,020
Your father worked to purge it.

551
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,310
At the same time,

552
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,610
he discovered Du Zixu.

553
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,090
I feared that he would find out the truth,

554
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,630
so I asked the assassin I trained myself,

555
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,870
the Black Rakshasa,

556
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,400
to kill him and silence him.

557
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,510
Both your father

558
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,230
and Du Zixu

559
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,870
were killed by him.

560
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,800
After your father died,

561
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:57,630
the Minister of Rites continued to make medicine and kill people.

562
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,990
In order to give an explanation

563
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,510
for those who disappeared,

564
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,630
I joined hands with him

565
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,580
and fabricated the Demon Cat Case.

566
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,150
Alright.

567
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,160
Lord Shangguan,

568
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,830
are you done?

569
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,470
Vice Minister Li,

570
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,390
I think

571
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,630
things are clear now.

572
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
What do you think?

573
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,710
Who is Yi Zhi Hua?

574
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,070
Yi Zhi Hua

575
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,310
is not anyone else.

576
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,790
It's just another name

577
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,950
of the Black Rakshasa.

578
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,150
Lord Shangguan.

579
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,550
Vice Minister Li,

580
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,880
I forgot to tell you one more thing.

581
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,140
Her Majesty

582
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,470
ordered me to lead the Court of Judicial Review.

583
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,230
You're not in charge for the time being.

584
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,960
Why don't you

585
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,550
hand over the seal?

586
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,710
This is also Her Majesty's request.

587
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,350
Of course.

588
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,390
Thank you.

589
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,470
Vice Minister Li.

590
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,350
Please

591
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,550
take care of my daughter.

592
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,880
Understood.

593
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,840
Vice Minister Li, this way.

595
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:30,000
[Tomb of Ms. Dong Junkou]

596
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,510
Uncle Yuan,

597
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,430
Ms. Kou,

598
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,230
rest in peace.

599
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,750
The Mingjing Hall

600
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,510
is sorry to you two.

601
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,150
The murderer is dead.

602
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,350
You don't have to be like this.

603
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,990
The Black Rakshasa is dead,

604
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,670
but who is the real criminal?

605
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,800
If it was Shangguan Qin's father,

606
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,470
what was his purpose?

607
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,100
Why did he make the Black Rakshasa

608
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,310
kill so many people?

609
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,360
Did he think that it wasn't big enough of a case

610
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,510
and we wouldn't investigate?

611
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,070
If it was to hide something,

612
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,070
he could've just killed us all.

613
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,040
Does this make sense?

614
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,150
It doesn't!

615
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,610
If this case was investigated incorrectly,

616
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,030
we would have

617
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,830
let them down.
