There are two priorities for this trip.

First,

78
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,550
we must find that dagger.

79
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,320
Second,

80
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,550
Her Majesty must escape

81
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,230
and not become the puppet of Yong'an Pavilion.

82
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,390
I'll go find the dagger.

83
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,830
You all ensure Her Majesty's safety.

84
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,360
Yes.

85
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,250
Vice Minister,

86
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,950
if we go save Her Majesty,

87
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,270
we have to put on a disguise, right?

88
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,390
Your house and the Court of Judicial Review

89
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,590
are definitely not safe now

90
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,050
and there are so many of us.

91
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,709
There is a place.

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,030
Mr. Li.

93
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,550
Are you thinking

94
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,680
about the veterans?

95
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,990
I wonder

96
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,390
who is behind them.

97
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,909
Yong'an Pavilion could be said

98
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,310

99
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,990
There's no need for such a backup plan.

100
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,710
So,

101
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,990
you suspect

102
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,870
it might be General Qiu?

103
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,390
If it really is him,

104
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,790
I'm afraid he wants to

105
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,470
replace everyone.

106
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,070
But Mr. Li,

107
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,350
you don't believe that General Qiu

108
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,430
is that kind of person

109
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,890
and would do those things,

110
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,610
right?

111
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,410
Mr. Li, I trust you.

112
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,950
If you trust him,

113
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,170
I trust him too.

114
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,390
Will it work?

115
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,390
Why are you laughing?

116
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,990

117
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,590
He really looks like one.

118

125
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,640
I think we should dress up as eunuchs.

126
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,470
But there are no foreign eunuchs here.

127
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,110
If we want to enter the palace,

128
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,230
do we have any options

129
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,190
besides being eunuchs?

130
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,550
But I don't look like one no matter what.

131
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,480
What else can we do?

132
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,409

No matter what,

140
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,909
we must get close to Her Majesty.

00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,890
How dare you!

194
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,910
The Pavilion Elders are here.

195
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,750
Who let you in?

196
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,610
Get out!

197
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,110
Pavilion Elders?

198
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,870
It was the Pavilion Elders who ordered us

199
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,990
to urge Her Majesty to depart

200
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,790
and capture the crooks from the Court of Judicial Review.

201
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,670
The Pavilion Elders already knew

202
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,710
that you lot from the Court of Judicial Review

203
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,770
would take action.

204
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,310
Your Majesty,

205
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,430
these people are fugitives.

206
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,710
The ceremony is soon.

207
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,000
You must not be fooled by them.

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,470
Who are you calling fugitives?

209
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,150
You are the ones with evil intentions.

210
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,590
The Court of Judicial Review

211
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,550
put on disguises to enter the palace

212
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,430
with rebellious intentions.

213
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,310
Arrest them

214
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,030
under the Pavilion Elders' order.

215
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,670
Yes.

216
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,590
Her Majesty is here.

217
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,520
How dare you!

218
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,430
General Qiu ordered us

219
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,860
to protect Her Majesty.

220
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,880
Hu,

221
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,040
I knew you would come out alive.

222
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,150
The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.

223
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,270
Do you dare to

224
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,910
force Her Majesty to abdicate before her?

225
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,630
Your Majesty.

226
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,030
Call the Pavilion Elders over.

227
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,980
I want to ask them

228
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,230
what the matter is.

229
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,790
Your Majesty.

230
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,340
Vice Minister.

231
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,300
Mr. Li.

232
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,670
Take them out

233
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,830
and await for the punishment.

234
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,390
Yes.

235
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,590
The rest of you go out.

236
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,650
Li Bing, stay here.

237
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,470
You all may leave too.

238
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,500
I saw the color of your eyes

239
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,380
very clearly just now.

240
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,550
So,

241
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,840
Minister Li, you are the demon cat.

242
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,240
Your Majesty,

243
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,990
before this...

244
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,110
No need to panic.

245
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,470
I already know

246
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,510
that the Yong'an Pavilion

247
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,710
is behind all of this.

248
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,730
The current situation

249
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
would've happened sooner or later.

250
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,790
Fortunately, you and the Court of Judicial Review

251
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,990
were here today.

252
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,410
Otherwise,

253
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,230
I'm afraid

254
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,310
I would be in danger at the ceremony.

255
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,580
As for General Qiu,

256
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,250
he is still lacking when compared to you.

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,800
Your Majesty.

258
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,960
General Qiu,

259
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,060
he...

260
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,300
This is

261
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,470
what Qiu Qingzhi submitted

262
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,830
in the name of the Auspicious Ceremony.

263
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,760
It contained

264
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,190
a hidden letter.

265
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,750
You'll understand after looking at it.

266
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,910
The palace can still cope now.

267
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,310
No matter how bold the Yong'an Pavilion is,

268
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,240
they dare not force me to abdicate.

269
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,680
If the ceremony isn't held,

270
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,280
they have no choice either.

271
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,270
Now,

272
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,670
I also need evidence

273
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,770
to give the people

274
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,550
and the officials an explanation.

275
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,270
Only this way can the Yong'an Pavilion be punished.

276
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,330
Vice Minister Li Bing of the Court of Judicial Review, accept the decree.

277
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

278
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,470
I order you

279
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,500
to investigate the case of the Yong'an Pavilion

280
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,780
in the civil war three years ago.

281
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,780
Purge the imperial court of wrongs.

282
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

283
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,350
Hu,

284
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,350
why did you show up suddenly?

285
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,210
You brought so many veterans too.

286
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,020
Actually, I was already working for General Qiu

287
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,190
when I was a constable

288
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,740
a few years ago.

289
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,230
It was General Qiu

290
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:20,990
who gave me the idea

291
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,850
to fake my death to avoid trouble.

292
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,470
However, I was not reconciled.

293
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,030
That's why I privately conspired with Zhao Ruyi

294
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,560
to lure Lu Huangchong out.

295
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,870
No wonder

296
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,430
he seemed to have predicted everything

297
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,430
and went to you as soon as the case happened.

298
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,590
After Lu Huangchong died,

299
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,140
I returned to General Qiu.

300
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,670
The cave you found

301
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,030
that connected to death row

302
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,230
was where General Qiu

303
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,510
has kept soldiers for the past three years.

304
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,150
General Qiu genuinely

305
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,030
wants to vindicate the veterans

306
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,190
and get justice

307
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,590
for the innocent soldiers

308
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,190
who died on the battlefield.

309
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,430
General Qiu was also the one

310
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,650
who found Yi Zhi Hua first.

311
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,050
Whose blood is this?

312
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,400
Whose is it?

313
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,690
Whose is it?

314
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,230
Not you.

315
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,900
Not you.

316
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,460
It's you.

317
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,570
How dare you!

318
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,850
How dare you!

319
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,470
I'm going to eat you!

320
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,670
I'm going to eat you!

321
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,550
I must eat you!

322
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,450
What are you?

323
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,070
I'm not just anyone.

324
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,630
I am the god here.

325
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,470
God?

326
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,410
It's been a long time

327
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,210
since someone has dared to treat me like this.

328
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,760
I must eat you today.

329
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,830
You'll be my first meal

330
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,510
after waking up.

331
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,710
Here.

332
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,780
No matter what you are,

333
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,060
I'll catch you today.

334
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,470
What?

335
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,460
Catch me?

336
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,990
Did you forget

337
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,030
that you got here

338
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,260
by being chased the entire way?

339
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,330
You talk

340
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,730
quite shamelessly.

341
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,290
Come and kill me if you can.

342
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,580
Don't you want to catch me?

343
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,710
Why are you running?

344
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,680
Run faster!

345
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,150
Run faster!

346
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,470
Hurry up!

347
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,470
I told you to run first.

348
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,630
The more you run, the more excited I get.

349
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,290
Do you know what this place is?

350
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,670
Huangsha Valley.

351
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,530
This is quicksand.

352
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,390
Quicksand?

353
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,150
I remember

354
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,130
there was indeed quicksand in Huangsha Valley.

355
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,710
Anyone who encountered it would be done for.

356
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,089
We bumped into the stone coffin transporters

357
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,030
because we tried to

358
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,230
avoid the quicksand.

359
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,040
Yes.

360
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,210
General Qiu had fought

361
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,070
for a long time.

362
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,240
He must've already surveyed the terrain by then.

363
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,770
This place

364
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,880
was prepared for those people,

365
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,750
but it's not a bad choice to deal with you now.

366
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,220
I conquered this mountain.

367
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,270
If it's mine,

368
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,130
I must get it back.

369
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,640
You tricked me to come here.

370
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,230
Bastard!

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,470
You're despicable.

372
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,430
It hurts.

373
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,190
It hurts.

374
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,530
It hurts.

375
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,830
It hurts.

376
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,670
It hurts.

377
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,390
What a monster.

378
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,360
You can stay alive

379
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,900
no matter how much you bleed.

380
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,920
I told you I'm not a monster.

381
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,400
I'm a god.

382
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,990
I am the god here.

383
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,130
God!

384
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,580
I will drink all of your blood.

385
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,930
I will eat you.

386
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,970
I will eat you.

387
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,690
Eat you!

388
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,790
You have good teeth.

389
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,800
What are you doing?

390
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,950
Scream again

391
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,910
and I'll yank out

392
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,770
all your teeth.

393
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,010
My teeth.

394
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,910
My teeth!

395
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,750
My teeth.

396
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,030
Take it back.

397
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,400
My teeth!

398
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,910
What's your name?

399
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,790
This is the first time

400
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,870
I've been caught by an ordinary person.

401
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,550
Tell me.

402
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,970
What do you want?

403
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,340
Do you want my beast bone

404
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,340
or my blood?

405
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,390
I'm not interested in any of that.

406
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,560
My beast bone

407
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,830
can help you live for a long time.

408
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,520
You'll have eternal youth.

409
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,040
My blood can extend your life

410
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,310
so that you won't die.

411
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
What do you think?

412
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,050
Are you tempted?

413
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,840
No one can resist the temptation.

414
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,160
It's eternal life.

415
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,170
How about it?

416
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,030
Do you want to

417
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,460
release me?

418
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,670
Release me.

419
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,000
I told you

420
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,270
I'm not interested.

421
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,070
Anything can be negotiated.

422
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,680
If you keep being noisy,

423
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,240
I'll pull out all your teeth.

424
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,110
I will eat you!

425
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,280
I will drink your blood dry!

426
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,710
Where are you taking me?

427
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,880
I'll take you back to Shendu

428
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,390
in the Central Plain.

429
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,630
Central Plain?

430
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,720
Someone started

431
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,180
a baffling war for you

432
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,030
and lied to everyone.

433
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,760
I'm going to bring you back.

434
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,630
You

435
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,090
are the most important evidence.

436
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,030
I can't believe I can be taken as evidence.

437
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,070
That sounds interesting,

438
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,430
but are you

439
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,970
capable?

440
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,090
I have a very powerful friend.

441
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,430
You're so annoying.

442
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,890
Your friend can't be any better than you.

443
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,590
You're not allowed to talk about him like that.

444
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,780
What are you doing?

445
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,250
I'm shutting you up.

446
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,510
Why did you stop?

447
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,820
What's wrong?

448
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,010
You slave soldiers

449
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,630
retreated from the battlefield

450
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,870
and deserted willingly.

451
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,940
In that case,

452
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,160
we must follow the military law.

453
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Dig deeper.

454
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,880
If you're buried too shallowly,

455
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,500
you'll be eaten by dogs.

456
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,630
Interesting.

457
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,790
He wants to kill them,

458
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,850
but he makes them dig their own grave?

459
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,210
Are you part of them?

460
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,160
You want to save them?

461
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,360
You're just an ordinary person.

462
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,120
You can't save anyone.

463
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,790
Besides,

464
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,120
you don't have much strength left, right?

465
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,090
I can help you save them.

466
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,650
Give me some of your blood.

467
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,290
I'm badly injured

468
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,920
and have no strength either.

469
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,450
I need to replenish myself.

470
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,870
Trust me.

471
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,910
I can definitely

472
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,790
save them.

473
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,060
Almost there.

474
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,710
Get ready.

475
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,090
Can you fulfill the promise

476
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,800
you just said?

477
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,530
I've lived for hundreds of years.

478
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,950
I never lie.

479
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,870
I'm going to kill now.

480
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,860
Monster!

481
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,380
Monster!

482
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,830
Qiu Qingzhi.

483
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,750
Your name is Qiu Qingzhi?

484
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,730
Does it matter?

485
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,710
This guy

486
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,350
pissed me off today.

487
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,210
I'm going to take it out on you all.

488
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,940
Aren't you going to thank me?

489
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,630
What?

490
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,330
You still want to catch me?

491
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,340
You released me once.

492
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,540
I won't let you

493
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,400
catch me again.

494
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,580
If I can catch you once,

495
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,990
I can catch you twice.

496
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,870
Okay.

497
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,740
I'll wait for you.

498
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,390
Qiu Qingzhi.

499
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,510
I find you to be

500
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,640
quite interesting.

501
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,390
I thought of a game

502
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,320
to play with you.

503
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,190
As for how to play,

504
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,450
I haven't decided yet.

505
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,510
Just wait.

506
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,050
By the way,

507
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,030
I forgot to tell you

508
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,110
what my name is.

509
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,550
My name is...

510
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,830
My name is...

511
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,510
What's my name again?

512
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,950
This flower is beautiful.

513
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,310
Well,

514
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,310
my name is Yi Zhi Hua, meaning "one flower."

515
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,420
We'll meet again,

516
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,630
Qiu Qingzhi.

517
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,290
Vice Minister Li,

518
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,600
what is

519
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,570
your next plan?

520
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,460
Now Yong'an Pavilion

521
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,360
seems to be in charge of Shendu,

522
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,710
but all the officials

523
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,870
and the public sentiment

524
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,530
can't be concealed so easily.

525
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,870
They put in all this effort

526
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,390
just to use Yi Zhi Hua

527
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,790
to attain immortality.

528
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,230
Then, we must find

529
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,270
the dagger that can

530
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,990
suppress Yi Zhi Hua before them

531
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,260
and kill Yi Zhi Hua,

532
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,890
so that they can't succeed.

533
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,200
By then, Her Majesty will issue an initiative

534
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,860
and the world will be enraged.

535
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:41,860
By the way,

536
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,870
this is the incriminating evidence of Yong'an Pavilion

537
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,170
collected by Qiu Qingzhi.

538
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,260
It states that

539
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,260
they used Yi Zhi Hua to start a war.

540
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,730
[Qiu Qingzhi presents to Your Majesty]

541
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,140
All of these

542
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,210
were thanks to Vice Minister Li Bing

543
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,230
of the Court of Judicial Review.

544
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,080
I am guilty

545
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,790
and deeply ashamed.

546
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,130
This...

547
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,880
General Qiu

548
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,910
wanted to publicly expose the Yong'an Pavilion

549
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,830
at the Auspicious Ceremony today,

550
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,970
but somehow,

551
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,310
word of it leaked out.

552
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,710
I wonder

553
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,010
how General Qiu is now.

554
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,930
No wonder he secretly transferred veterans

555
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,820
back to Shendu.

556
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,950
So,

557
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,710
the one who saved us

558
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,390
from death row

559
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,800
was also General Qiu?

560
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,870
I insulted him

561
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,270
so much behind his back.

562
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,400
I shouldn't have done that.

563
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,570
Soldiers

564
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,960
must be cunning.

565
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,150
He kept a low profile.

566
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,250
No matter what,

567
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,290
we must find the dagger first.

568
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,470
I'll go by myself.

569
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,360
You all recuperate here

570
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,980
and wait for me to return.

571
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,510
Okay.

572
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,700
[Court of Judicial Review]

573
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,930
Qiu Qingzhi.

574
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,370
Li Bing,

575
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,240
we meet again.

576
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,250
Yi Zhi Hua.

577
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,530
Shouldn't you be

578
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,060
curious

579
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,440
as to why I'm here?

580
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,080
Qiu Qingzhi

581
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,540
isn't enough

582
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,240
to trap me alone.

583
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:19,820
Besides,

584
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,870
those people from the Yong'an Pavilion

585
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,390
don't trust him anymore.

586
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,430
By the way,

587
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,510
this game has come to

588
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,720
the most exciting part.

589
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,990
I had to come

590
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,800
because I must be the one

591
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,570
to reveal the answer of this game.

592
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,230
Why did I—

593
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,200
Why you became this like me, right?

594
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,500
Let me tell you now.

595
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,830
Yi Zhi Hua!

596
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,900
Li Bing,

597
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,620
you were turned into a demon

598
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,080
because of him.

599
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,700
Qiu Qingzhi

600
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,530
begged me to do that!

601
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,270
[Tablet of Late Father Li]

602
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,750
Qiu Qingzhi said

603
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,630
those people wouldn't stop

604
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,270
until they killed you.

605
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,790
So he begged me for a favor.

606
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,210
It was you?

607
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,270
Li Bing...

608
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,390
At that time,

609
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,950
for the sake of

610
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,110
the slave soldiers,

611
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,990
Qiu Qingzhi dared not to antagonize those guys

612
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,010
to protect you.

613
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,430
He asked me to revive you,

614
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,510
and I said yes.

615
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,150
He knew my capability.

616
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,950
Where is Li Bing?

617
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,590
Look no further!

618
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,350
He's right here!

619
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,760
I'm not only able to resuscitate someone,

620
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,440
but can also turn a person

621
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,560
into a monster like me

622
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,310
in the same way

623
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,640
that the Fengsheng Beast transformed me.

624
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,350
Li Bing?

625
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,970
How interesting!

626
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,500
This is the first time I've seen

627
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,260
such a look on your face!

628
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,780
See you later!

629
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,380
See you!

630
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,960
The game has started!

631
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,830
That day, I had to return

632
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,430
to Yong'an Pavilion promptly,

633
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,350
and I couldn't let you know

634
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,750
what I had done in secret.

635
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,960
Seeing that you were about to wake up,

636
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,370
I had to leave.

637
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,080
I...

638
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,630
I didn't know he would

639
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,230
turn you into such a creature.

640
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,000
Of course he didn't know that,

641
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,180
because he's too stupid!

642
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,450
If I were him,

643
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,940
I would've killed

644
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,460
all those people!

645
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,030
But thanks to him,

646
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,270
I finally developed an idea

647
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,179
of how to play this game.

648
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,830
It's silly of him

649
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,620
not to think about

650
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,070
why I'd save your life for no reason.

651
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,270
There was certainly a condition attached!

652
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,170
And that was,

653
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,460
this thing!

654
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,150
Though he had become like this,

655
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,470
he insisted on crawling back to this place.

656
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,870
As long as I followed him,

657
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,240
I could get everything.

658
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,280
With this dagger,

659
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,350
I'll be a man with no weakness!

660
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,950
By the way, there's something

661
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,200
I've forgotten to tell you.

662
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,640
Even Qiu Qingzhi doesn't know

663
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,560
that your father was actually a great investigator.

664
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,870
After all that hard work he had done,

665
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,120
all he needed was a bit more imagination.

666
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,910
I managed to

667
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,590
give him hints about the truth

668
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,870
as to why those guys would join the war in Zixu.

669
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,310
But I just accidentally

670
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,050
let Black Rakshasa divulge the information to Yong'an Pavilion!

671
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,110
It was you?

672
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,230
Of course it's me!

673
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,080
The whole thing is a game designed by me!

674
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,070
Everything you guys have done

675
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,010
has backfired on you.

676
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,920
Isn't it fun?

677
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,560
Oh, right,

678
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,370
do you remember?

679
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,110
There was a time when Qiu Qingzhi

680
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,730
was nearly killed by Black Rakshasa.

681
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,340
Don't you find it odd?

682
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,870
Why would he appear

683
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,270
at an impeccable timing,

684
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,050
and help you out of trouble?

685
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,350
How did he recover so quickly?

686
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,400
You also

687
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,490
ate the Fengsheng Beast's bones.

688
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,630
Qiu Qingzhi,

689
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,390
come on.

690
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,150
Stop suppressing your urge.

691
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,880
Drink a little human blood,

692
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,950
and you'll be well again.

693
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,020
Qiu Qingzhi!

694
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:25,950
Come on.

695
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,560
Come on!

696
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,900
Drink it! Drink it!

697
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,470
Lots of things are weighing on your mind every day.

698
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,540
Why do you have to treat yourself like that?

699
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,820
Aren't you tired?

700
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:36,910
Oh, right.

701
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,880
You can choose

702
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,120
to kill him.

703
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,420
If you kill Li Bing,

704
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,370
me,

705
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,260
and everyone else,

706
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,750
you'll feel much better, won't you?

707
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,630
Come on.

708
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,320
Do it!

Look!

That's the direction of the Court of Judicial Review.

713
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,660
Mr. Li must be sending a signal.

714
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,730
Something must have gone wrong!

715
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,190
Hold on!

716
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,370
What are you doing?

717
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,900
You must stay calm in the face of an emergency.

718
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,510
Xu Hu,

719
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,140
where are the veterans?

720
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,190
We agreed

721
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,130
to meet outside Zhuque Gate.

722
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,910
Anything to prove our identities?

724
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,600
Here you are.

725
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,390
Listen,

726
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:28,910
Cui Bei,

727
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,390
Alibaba, Chen Shi,

728
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,990
you guys take this thing,

729
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,310
and get in contact with the veterans.

730
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,590
I, Sun Bao and Xu Hu,

731
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,670
will go help Vice Minister Li.

732
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,390
Why?

733
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:36,930
It...

734
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,400
If Vice Minister Li is truly in trouble,

735
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,470
you'll probably end up dead there

736
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,890
since you're too weak to help him.

737
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,230
Sun Bao and Xu Hu are great fighters.

738
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,680
I'll go with them to help Vice Minister Li,

739
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,150
while you'll bring the veterans to back us up.

740
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,950
But are you able to put up a fight?

741
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,690
I have my brain and wits.

742
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,460
Without further ado, let's get started.

743
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,110
Time to set off!

744
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,900
Okay. Let's go.

745
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,270
Go!

746
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:52,960
Go!

747
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,350
Yi Zhi Hua,

00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,630
you're pulling all these stunts

749
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,240
just to win.

750
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,430
What makes you think I'd give you that satisfaction?

751
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,590
I've finished everything

752
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,750
I need to do.

753
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,410
I've outlived my usefulness.
