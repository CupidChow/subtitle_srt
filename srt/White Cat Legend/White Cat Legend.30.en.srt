[Episode 30]

4
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,710
Brother.

5
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,350
You're awake.

6
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,800
This wild cat

7
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,300
tried to run away after getting injured.

8
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,430
I got it back for you.

9
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,590
Brother.

10
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,660
Don't go to Shendu.

11
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,150
Let's stay in Chen Village

12
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,430
for the rest of our lives.

13
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,590
Chen Shi!

14
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,910
Brother! Brother!

15
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,380
-Chen Shi!
-Chen Shi! You...

16
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,550
Mr. Wang.

17
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,030
Mr. Cui.

18
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,910
Listen.

19
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,550
It's that way.

20
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,970
Let's go! Let's go!

21
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,030
It's a tiger!

22
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,720
Let's go! Hurry!

23
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,510
Hurry up! Get down!

24
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,190
Jump in?

25
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,910
Jump in!

26
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,480
It's too high!

27
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,470
-Be careful!
-Chen Shi.

28
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,110
Chen Shi, be careful.

29
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,910
Chen Shi!

30
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,150
This way.

31
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,630
Okay. Come on.

32
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,560
Run!

33
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,590
Hurry up!

34
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,310
Hurry up!

35
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,710
Hurry up! Go!

36
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,040
-Be careful.
-Let’s go.

37
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,190
Run!

38
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,870
Follow me!

39
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,230
Run!

40
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,390
Okay. Hurry up, Chen Shi.

41
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,510
Wang Qi!

42
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,410
Mr. Wang! Mr. Wang!

43
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,170
Mr. Wang! Mr. Wang!

44
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,950
Mr. Wang! Mr. Wang!

45
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,910
It's a person?

46
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,829
It's a person.

47
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:58,950
Wang Qi!

48
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,270
Chen Shi.

49
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,190
Why are you still so useless?

50
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:08,870
Chen Qi.

51
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,150
Nonsense!

52
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,810
Mr. Wang.

53
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,830
Stop pretending.

54
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,029
Wake up.

55
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,470
Your Majesty.

56
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,770
You must have misunderstood.

57
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,320
In this world,

58
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,270
there's no such thing as a demon cat.

59
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,010
My personal maids saw it with their own eyes.

60
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,210
Are you saying

61
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,860
my people are lying?

62
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,710
I dare not.

63
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,680
I...

64
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,310
My apologies.

65
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,180
From the Minister of Rites' case

66
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,710
to the Black Rakshasa's case,

67
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,659
all the cases

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,550
stemmed from the Demon Cat Case.

69
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,950
Didn't you claim

70
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,480
to have found out the truth?

71
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,560
Now both the Court of Judicial Review

72
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,550
and the Jinwu Guards

73
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,210
are under your jurisdiction.

74
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,120
If anything goes wrong,

75
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,220
it's all your fault.

76
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,430
If you're not up to the job,

77
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,190
why don't you resign

78
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,320
and let Minister Li come back as soon as possible?

79
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:17,010
[Jinwu Guards]

80
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,550
My Lord, you suddenly want to use a horse.

81
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,390
Where are you going?

82
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,380
Don't ask anything you shouldn't ask.

83
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:24,950
Yes.

84
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,590
By the way,

85
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,270
have Li Bing's men

86
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,110
left the city?

87
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,970
Except Li Bing,

88
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,520
they have all left the city.

89
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,570
Is anyone following them?

90
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,140
Our people

91
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,190
have been sending news back.

92
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,310
Nothing has gone wrong.

93
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,240
Where's Li Bing?

94
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,170
He has been in his old mansion.

95
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,930
Another Demon Cat Case has occurred.

96
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,870
Li Bing can't go back to the Court of Judicial Review anymore.

97
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,470
Tell the people following Chen Shi

98
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,310
to take action.

99
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:51,630
Yes.

100
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,250
Who are you?

101
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,630
I'm the consulting officer of Jinwu Guards

102
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,950
and the vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review, Lai Zhongshu.

103
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,550
I have something important to discuss with the lords.

104
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,409
Get on the boat.

105
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:02,750
Here.

106
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,830
Here.

107
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,110
I wonder how Chen Shi and the others

108
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,710
are doing.

109
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,130
Why do you think

110
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,750
the vice minister chased us all

111
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,550
away?

112
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,270
Isn't this making trouble out of nothing?

113
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,950
It's definitely not because

114
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,080
we hit Lai Zhongshu.

115
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,730
One more thing.

116
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,630
In the blood-sucking case,

117
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,740
there was a destroyed statue

118
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,990
in the secret room.

119
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,510
I thought that statue is very special.

120
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,430
It didn't look like something from the Central Plain.

121
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,110
So I asked Shuidao and Qucheng

122
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,230
to check

123
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,260
all the rare ancient books of the foreigners.

124
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,110
This statue

125
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,630
should be from Zixu State.

126
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,590
Zixu State?

127
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,670
Isn't that the small state

128
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,909
we destroyed in the previous battle?

129
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,310
Why haven't I heard of it?

130
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,630
This belief is very ancient.

131
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,160
Even among the Zixu people,

132
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,820
very few people know about it.

133
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,590
They believe in

134
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,760
a god with a cat's head and a human body.

135
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,390
Its original form is an animal

136
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,790
called Fengsheng Beast.

137
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,590
It is also recorded in the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

138
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,950
It is said that the Fengsheng Beast

139
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,150
can live forever.

140
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,640
It looks a lot like a cat.

141
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,430
A cat?

142
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,670
Fengsheng Beast is immortal?

143
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,990
Doesn't it feel familiar?

144
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,270
The signs of damage

145
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,870
on this statue were very new.

146
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,270
In the secret room back then,

147
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,670
there were only Vice Minister and Wang Zhi.

148
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,870
Is it possible that

149
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,990
the statue

150
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,110
was destroyed by Vice Minister?

151
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,730
Maybe he has a reason

152
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,870
for not wanting us to see the statue.

153
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,710
Just like how he

154
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,390
chased us out of the Court of Judicial Review.

155
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,950
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

156
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,870
It's a myth. It's just a rumor.

157
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,550
I hear horses galloping.

158
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,390
A Jinwu Guard?

159
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,440
There's a reply.

160
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's go.

161
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,350
Who are you, foreigner?

162
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,290
I...

163
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,960
What is it?

164
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,720
[Do it now. Kill them all. Be thorough.]

165
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,730
Lai Zhongshu wants to kill us.

166
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,900
How dare he?

167
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,190
If he dares to hurt us,

168
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,310
Vice Minister must be in danger.

169
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,670
We need to hurry back to Shendu.

170
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,200
Let's go.

171
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,920
Are you really from the Court of Judicial Review?

172
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,590
Then Chen Shi

173
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,560
is also from the Court of Judicial Review?

174
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,910
Him?

175
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,550
Is he up to it?

176
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,630
-Yes.
-Yes.

177
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,430
Chen Shiyi.

178
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,220
I brought you this medicine.

179
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,660
It's for your hand wound.

180
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,440
It is better than our village's medicine.

181
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,360
Chen Shi'er.

182
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,300
This is for you.

183
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,600
Isn't your bow tightly drawn?

184
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,620
This is made of horse tendons.

185
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,830
Datang.

186
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,430
Datang.

187
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,040
I brought you some wine.

188
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,950
Try it.

189
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
Didn't I ask you lot to leave?

190
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,290
Why are you still here?

191
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,100
Didn't we say

192
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,100
we're here

193
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,390
for Chen Jiu's letter?

194
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,590
The Court of Judicial Review needs that letter

195
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,920
for our investigation.

196
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,390
And didn't I tell you?

197
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,180
That letter is gone.

198
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,800
Who says it's gone?

199
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,010
I have the letter.

200
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,440
And the things

201
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,450
your brother sent you

202
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,390
are also with me.

203
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,110
Chen Qi.

204
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,950
Chen Qi.

205
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,430
Are you done?

206
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,310
Qi?

207
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,040
You toyed with officials of the Court of Judicial Review

208
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,700
and obstructed our investigation.

209
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,500
You are...

210
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,030
You are breaking the law

211
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,310
and being very unkind.

212
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,060
If you tell me

213
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,320
where the letter is,

214
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,010
I

215
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,830
won't hold you accountable for it.

216
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,760
How can I just take your word for it?

217
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,470
What evidence do you have?

218
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,550
I don’t believe someone like Chen Shi

219
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,010
can be an official.

220
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,710
You...

221
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,630
Wait.

222
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,350
I've handed in my token.

223
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,030
Mr. Cui.

224
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,410
An investigation of the Court of Judicial Review.

225
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,670
Not bad, Chen Shi! You made it!

226
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,390
You sure live up to the expectations

227
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,350
of someone trained by

228
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,210
Mingjing Hall.

229
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,310
It is really the Court of Judicial Review.

230
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,710
Who do you want to arrest?

231
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,790
Why do you want Chen Jiu's letter?

232
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,590
My brother...

233
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,470
killed...

234
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,890
killed people.

235
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,310
Killed people?

236
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,270
Many people.

237
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,710
It's not surprising

238
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,430
he has come to this stage.

239
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,960
What about Chen Shi?

240
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,350
Why aren't you investigating him?

241
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,190
He might be an accomplice who is coordinating things

242
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,650
on the inside and outside.

243
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,910
How could you say that?

244
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,510
Yes.

245
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,030
Have you investigated it properly?

246
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,910
They did all the bad things back then

247
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,070
together.

248
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,870
Chen Qi.

249
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,870
For the current case,

250
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,070
without that letter,

251
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,410
we can't continue investigating.

252
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,270
Did he send

253
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,400
anything else back?

254
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,700
To be honest,

255
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,610
I have the letters and things.

256
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,630
But I won't give them to you.

257
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,670
If you have the guts, detain me back

258
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,470
to the Court of Judicial Review.

259
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,150
Chen Qi.

260
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,510
I know

261
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,990
how you feel about my brother...

262
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,470
But this matter

263
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,930
is really unusual.

264
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,270
There is a way

265
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,750
for you to get the letter.

266
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,470
Recently, there's been a beast

267
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,000
in the Ten-Colored Forest.

268
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,490
Although it's not big,

269
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,750
it's very evil.

270
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,290
How about this?

271
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,390
If you catch it,

272
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,870
I'll give you the letter.

273
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:04,990
Chen Qi!

274
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,710
He and Chen Jiu owe me!

275
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,600
I used to be a good hunter!

276
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,250
Why?

277
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,080
Are you scared?

278
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,110
Who's scared?

279
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,510
Who's scared?

280
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,330
Will the people of the Court of Judicial Review be scared of you?

281
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,380
It's just a beast!

282
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,070
Chen Shi!

283
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,170
Wang Qi!

284
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,160
Chen Shi.

285
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,420
Didn't you say

286
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,310
you grew up begging for food?

287
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,390
The whole village is your family.

288
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,790
Why are you so unpopular?

289
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,190
Chen Shi.

290
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,910
Did something happen?

291
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,470
Are there any grudges?

292
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,860
Yes.

293
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,110
He also said

294
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,190
you and your brother did bad things.

295
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,950
Chen Qi's eye

296
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,490
was damaged by my brother.

297
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,010
It had something to do with me.

298
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,420
Chen Qi was a good hunter.

299
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,940
But my brother was the best hunter.

300
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,240
Because

301
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,240
his hunting method was different.

302
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,030
A hunter's level is distinguished by the type of preys they catch.

303
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,540
When dealing with fierce prey,

304
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,500
especially the bloodthirsty ones who eat humans,

305
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,160
traps and clamps are useless.

306
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,320
They require bait.

307
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,990
My brother's bait was different from others.

308
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,120
His bait was a human,

309
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,240
which was me.

310
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,070
What?

311
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,750
Your brother used you as bait?

312
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,590
I didn't know how to hunt.

313
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,350
Besides,

314
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,710
I often

315
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,830
unravelled the traps set by others.

316
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,620
Those bunnies,

317
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,320
wild cats, and whatnot;

318
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,950
I was the one who released them.

319
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,110
So he had to pay for them.

320
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,240
My brother would pay them back with wolves and leopards.

321
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,110
I caused the problems.

322
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,150
Every time my brother went hunting,

323
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,190
he would bring me along.

324
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,790
Then,

325
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,120
your brother used you as bait?

326
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,080
He used his brother as bait.

327
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,450
Where's his humanity?

328
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,630
Actually, my brother did it

329
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,470
to protect me.

330
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,710
Chen Shi, are you stupid?

331
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,750
He used his brother as bait.

332
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,080
How is that protection?

333
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,020
You have no idea

334
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,770
that in this mountain,

335
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,770
ferocious beasts

336
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,390
like bears

337
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,390
and leopards

338
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,550
can't be caught by one person.

339
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,750
They can't be hunted.

340
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,070
If my brother weren't determined

341
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,310
to protect me,

342
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,310
he wouldn't have defeated them.

343
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,030
On the one hand, your brother used you as bait

344
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,310
to attract ferocious beasts.

345
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,310
On the other hand,

346
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,710
it was because he wanted to protect you

347
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,870
that he was able to unleash

348
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,070
his greatest potential

349
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,350
to fight the beasts.

350
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,170
Four years ago,

351
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,950
a fierce tiger

352
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,270
appeared around here.

353
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,510
Many people were hurt.

354
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,670
Also,

355
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,910
the government issued a reward notice.

356
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,869
If anyone could catch

357
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,800
that evil tiger,

358
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,250
they could be a constable in the government office.

359
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,750
Your brother wanted to hunt this tiger?

360
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,569
Chen Qi wanted to, too.

361
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,010
They both didn't want to stay in the village.

362
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,670
Then my brother

363
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,670
took me to hunt the tiger.

364
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,430
Who knew

365
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,320
that I'd walk into a trap

366
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,290
and fall into it.

367
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,080
I even sprained my ankle.

368
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,390
My brother took care of me for many days.

369
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,000
It was also in those few days

370
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,870
that Chen Qi led a group of people

371
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,070
and caught the tiger.

372
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,030
So...

373
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,910
Chen Qi set that trap?

374
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,860
He realized

375
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,280
the secret that Chen Jiu

376
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,430
couldn't hunt alone without you.

377
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,710
Then,

378
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,630
Chen Qi's eye...

379
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,760
My brother damaged it.

380
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,770
My brother set a trap to blind him.

381
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,300
Since then,

382
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,950
the Chen Village

383
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,870
doesn't acknowledge us as one of their own anymore.

384
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,200
Because in our village,

385
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,000
one should never hurt another,

386
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,750
especially when it's an elder.

387
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,350
This is the most important rule in the village.

388
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,500
Later one day,

389
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,860
Datang told me

390
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,820
my brother sent me a letter

391
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,280
to ask me to come to Shendu.

392
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,280
Your brother and you are enemies with Chen Qi.

393
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,830
But according to Chen Qi,

394
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,100
Chen Jiu's letter and things

395
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,040
are in his hands.

396
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,650
Could Chen Qi be lying to you?

397
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,510
Yes.

398
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,320
I don't know either.

399
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,910
Hunting?

400
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,830
How?

401
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,600
I've never hunted before.

402
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,430
I wish Sun Bao were here.

403
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,840
It was a misstep.

404
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,990
Just now,

405
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,270
weren't you the one

406
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,150
who agreed immediately to do it?

407
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,470
Things had gotten to this point.

408
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,350
I had to support Chen Shi.

409
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,480
Wait.

410
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:13,970
I have an idea.

411
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,270
Come on.

412
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,350
Get up.

413
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,190
Follow me.

414
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,030
Come on.

415
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,720
Be careful.

416
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,240
Come on.

417
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,480
This was where

418
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,520
my brother left his hunting tools.

419
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
I'll get the rope.

420
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,950
You... you get the rope.

421
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,810
I’ll take this.

422
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,200
Mr. Wang.

423
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,330
Why did you hurt yourself?

424
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,470
The forest with the ferocious beast

425
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,270
that Chen Qi mentioned is ahead.

426
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,510
As I used to,

427
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,770
I'll be the bait

428
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,840
and lure them here.

429
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,030
It's too risky.

430
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,830
Don't worry about it.

431
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,750
Leave it to me.

432
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,400
I'll lure that ferocious beast

433
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,510
out.

434
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,000
Chen Shi!

435
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:49,750
Chen Shi!

436
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,350
Chen Shi!

437
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,030
Mr. Li.

438
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,230
Mr. Li, is that you?

439
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,430
See you later.

440
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,790
Mr. Li!

441
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,810
-Mr. Li!
-Chen Shi!

442
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,080
-Chen...
-Chen Shi!

443
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,920
Chen Shi!

444
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,310
-Chen Shi!
-Chen Shi!

445
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,110
Are you okay?

446
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,620
What's wrong?

447
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,710
Well...

448
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,790
Well...

449
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,920
Where's the beast? Did it run away?

450
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,390
This...

451
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,270
Chen Shi.

452
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,590
You know who did it,

453
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,270
right?

454
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,080
This job was meant for Sun Bao.

455
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,770
I miss Sun Bao so much.

456
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,700
Chen Shi!

457
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,360
Why are you here?

458
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,510
We've been looking for you this whole time.

459
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,270
Don't we have to catch

460
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,190
that beast?

461
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,510
Chen Qi is at odds with Chen Shi.

462
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,640
Can you take his word seriously?

463
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,390
What happened between them was in the past.

464
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,190
After I scolded Chen Qi a little,

465
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,670
I immediately went out to look for you guys.

466
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,950
Unexpectedly, you guys only left a while ago

467
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,550
but were nowhere to be found.

468
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,480
Chen Shi.

469
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,200
Why are you doing this?

470
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,300
Just go.

471
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,550
I threw away the letter long ago.

472
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,030
Chen Qi was deceiving you.

473
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,460
I'll go find him now!

474
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,150
-Chen Shi!
-He was lying to you!

475
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,710
Chen Shi, you...

476
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,240
Chen Shi!

477
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,870
You came so fast.

478
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,640
I haven't gotten anything yet.

479
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,240
You look a lot like Black Rakshasa.

480
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,310
Chen Shi.

481
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,030
Chen Shi!

482
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,820
Chen Shi!

483
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,950
Chen...

484
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,510
Chen Qi!

485
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,960
Don't come over.

486
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,390
If his head falls off,

487
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,590
it's not my business.

488
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,470
Who are you?

489
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,150
I...

490
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,790
I work for Jinwu Guards.

491
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,120
What do you want?

492
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,840
I'm here for the same reason

493
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,910
that you are.

494
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,910
I followed you here.

495
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,530
You want Black Rakshasa's thing.

496
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,920
So do I.

497
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,880
Give me the letter.

498
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,890
Otherwise,

499
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,830
I'll really snap his head off!

500
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,110
Jinwu Guards are ruthless

501
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,630
when handling business.

502
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,950
We're unreasonable.

503
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,070
You...

504
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,020
Calm down.

505
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,220
Before my brother died,

506
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,480
he told me your secret.

507
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,010
I know who you are.

508
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,640
My brother found...

509
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,830
what you want.

510
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,590
He gave it to me before he died.

511
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,700
My brother didn't tell anyone.

512
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,920
If you let Chen Qi go,

513
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,200
I'll tell you

514
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,990
where it is.

515
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,660
Chen Shi!

516
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,910
You sure are impressive, Chen Shi!

517
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,080
Let him go?

518
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,210
You should be thankful if I don't kill him.

519
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,560
Why should I let him go?

520
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,220
In that case,

521
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,630
this person

522
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,580
is useless to me.

523
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,160
Chen Qi!

524
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,440
Chen Qi!

525
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,000
This...

526
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,980
seems to be

527
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,510
the thing that almost clamped my foot.

528
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,830
Mr. Wang, save me!

529
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,510
-Chen Shi!
-Chen Shi!

530
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,390
Chen Shi!

531
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,350
Tell me.

532
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,510
You're Yi Zhi Hua?

533
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,380
It's been a long time

534
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,630
since someone called my name

535
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,670
in front of me.

536
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,950
You're interesting.

537
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,430
You're much more interesting

538
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,630
than killing a few people.

539
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,870
So I'm willing to spend my time

540
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,510
on you.

541
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,810
No one is here. Tell me.

542
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,710
What did

543
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,030
Black Rakshasa tell you

544
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,100
before he died?

545
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,550
Where is the thing I want?

546
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,030
You're just like Mr. Li?

547
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,550
You should say

548
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,620
Li Bing...

549
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,220
is just like me.

550
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,320
H-How did Mr. Li become like that?

551
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,080
What does it have to do with you?

552
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,210
You killed so many people.

553
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,500
What exactly do you want?

554
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,310
So annoying.

555
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,410
So annoying.

556
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,950
If I answer all your questions,

557
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,830
where's the fun in this game?

558
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,890
No more questions.

559
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,810
Where is...

560
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,490
the thing Black Rakshasa

561
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,370
left for you?

562
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,430
Where?

563
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,930
Where?

564
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,030
I'll give it to you.

565
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,440
Come on. Okay. Come on.

566
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,820
That is the Court of Judicial Review's flare.

567
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,080
Chen Shi must be there.

568
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,340
You go with them to look for him.

569
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,220
I'll go back to the village to get more people.

570
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,950
I'll be right back.

571
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,280
Okay.

572
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,910
Let's go first.

573
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,590
You are not familiar with the road.

574
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,350
You may step on the clamps.

575
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,110
I'll take you there.

576
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,550
Let's go.

577
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,410
Okay, let's go.

578
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,680
How dare you lie to me?

579
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,150
Aren't you afraid...

580
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,000
I'd pull out your teeth

581
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,640
one

582
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,300
by

583
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,660
one?

584
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,390
It seems Mr. Li was right.

585
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,190
You're looking for something.

586
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,020
You want us to investigate the case

587
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,390
and have Mr. Li find it for you,

588
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,960
right?

589
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,200
Are you really not afraid of me?

590
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,350
Don't you think I'm a demon?

591
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,070
Fine.

592
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,940
You asked me so many questions.

593
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,540
Let me ask you a question too.

594
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,390
Deep down,

595
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,830
do you think

596
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,110
Li Bing is a human

597
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,030
or a demon?

598
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,330
He is Mr. Li.

599
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,830
He is the vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review.

600
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,230
He is different from you.

601
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,400
He's not a demon!

602
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:10,940
You...

603
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,580
Interesting. Interesting.

604
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,690
I don't want to kill you.

605
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,940
I must wait until that day.

606
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,390
I want to see

607
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,390
how you'd react

608
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,430
when you see him in that form.

609
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,590
Do you know who asked you

610
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,450
to go to Shendu?

611
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,190
What else do you know?

612
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,830
The person who told you to go to Shendu through the letter

613
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,030
was not your brother.

614
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,440
It was me.

615
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,030
You don't have to look for the letter.

616
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,020
What I wrote was simple.

617
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,870
I just wanted you to come to Shendu as soon as possible.

618
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,000
I saw Black Rakshasa

619
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,110
in death row.

620
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,950
At that time, he was just Chen Jiu.

621
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,430
Everyone in the prison

622
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,360
was afraid of me.

623
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,580
Only he dared to talk to me...

624
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,830
and look me in the eyes.

625
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,390
He said

626
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,430
there's something about me

627
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,960
that feels familiar to him.

628
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,630
Like the aura of a beast.

629
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,590
I told him we should have a fight.

630
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,190
Come on.

631
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,050
He said if his brother were here, he would dare to fight.

632
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,990
After I left the prison,

633
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,790
I wrote you a letter

634
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,790
asking you to come to Shendu as soon as possible.

635
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,460
Not only did you come

636
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,270
but you're also doing quite well.

637
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,470
You're much luckier than your brother.

638
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,350
Of course, it's possible...

639
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,080
it's your misfortune.

640
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,040
Nice to meet you.

641
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,890
I won't take away what Black Rakshasa

642
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,770
left for you.

643
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,310
You can have it.

644
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,180
I feel

645
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,260
there's nothing in there

646
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,320
that I really want.

647
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,050
They didn't find it either.

648
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,570
One more thing.

649
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,280
Chen Shi.

650
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,320
Remember.

651
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,720
Li Bing

652
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,550
is not far from becoming a demon.

653
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,750
Because he has to risk himself to continue

654
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,390
the investigation.

655
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,490
Do you understand?

656
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,900
The fun has just begun!

657
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,150
See you.

658
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,910
I'll be waiting for you to catch me!

659
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,230
-Chen Shi!
-Chen Shi!

660
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,110
Chen Shi!

661
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,720
Chen Shi!

662
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,720
Let me see.

663
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,920
Are you okay?

664
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,190
I'm fine. I'm fine.

665
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,720
What about the Jinwu Guard?

666
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,580
He left too.

667
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,910
Is he

668
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,290
really a Jinwu Guard?

669
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,990
Mr. Cui.

670
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,510
Mr. Wang.

671
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,830
We have to go back to the Court of Judicial Review.

672
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,890
Mr. Li is in danger.

673
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,670
What?

674
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,150
Here.

675
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,470
Chen Qi.

676
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,270
I've always hated your brother

677
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,660
and wanted to take revenge on him.

678
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,500
I've been paying attention

679
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,290
to you and your brother's matters.

680
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,550
Not long ago, Chen Jiu sent something back.

681
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,390
This is it.

682
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,120
I don't recognize many words.

683
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,370
But I think it says he is dying.

684
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,670
I didn't believe it

685
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,800
until you came back.

686
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,310
I didn't expect

687
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,440
you to save me today.

688
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,680
Today, I'm returning your brother's thing

689
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,470
to you.

690
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,000
This...

691
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,380
This is still your home.

692
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,450
Come back whenever you want.

693
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,720
[Letter to my brother, Chen Shi]

694
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,230
Chen Shi.

695
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,380
When you see this letter

696
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,870
and find someone who can

697
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,830
read it to you,

698
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,240
I must be dead.

699
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,620
You must live on well.

700
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,640
You mustn't come to Shendu.

701
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,280
There are no beasts in Shendu.

702
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,450
They don't need good hunters.

703
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,850
In Shendu,

704
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,350
humans are the beasts.

705
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,480
How dare you go against Lu Chenghuang's men?

706
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,210
I think you're tired of living.

707
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,110
Everyone is born a prey.

708
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,110
If you don't want to become someone's prey,

709
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,070
you can only become

710
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,480
a scarier beast.

711
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,020
I have a new name.

712
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,340
I'm no longer Chen Jiu.

713
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,480
From now on,

714
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,230
you are Black Rakshasa.

715
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,060
Chen Shi.

716
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,550
If one day

717
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,990
you must come to Shendu,

718
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,720
when someone bullies you,

719
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,540
take this

720
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,230
death-row prisoner's serial number

721
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:25,990
and find someone

722
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,710
with this pattern on their clothes

723
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,370
and tell them you are Black Rakshasa's brother.

724
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,010
I'm no longer Chen Jiu,

725
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,540
but I'm still your brother.

726
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,130
[Court of Judicial Review's scribe: Chen Shi]

727
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,190
Chen Shi?

728
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,070
What's wrong?

729
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,430
Mr. Wang.

730
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,050
You haven't slept?

731
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,930
This is everything

732
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,960
Black Rakshasa told me.

733
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,100
Mr. Wang.

734
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,440
Mr. Cui.

735
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,670
Have a look.

736
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Vice Minister Li.

737
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,850
There's a verbal decree.

738
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,190
Her Majesty has an important matter

739
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,199
and summons you to the palace.

740
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,679
I accept the decree.

741
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,460
Please.

742
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,070
Li Bing.

743
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,870
The demon cat has reappeared

744
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,330
in my immediate vicinity.

745
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,790
What do you think?

746
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,880
Could it be

747
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,190
the case of Shangguan

748
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,889
still has some loose ends?

749
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,429
I...

750
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,210
What's wrong?

751
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,110
Tell me.

752
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,770
The case of Shangguan,

753
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,199
since the Demon Cat Case

754
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,840
to the Black Rakshasa Case,

755
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,080
has been a complete lie.

756
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,909
What?

757
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,060
Why?

758
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,780
The core of this lie is...

759
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,590
is...

760
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,800
What's wrong?

761
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,570
Don't hesitate when speaking.

762
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,300
This matter is too unbelievable.

763
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,060
I...

764
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,350
Your Majesty.

765
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,230
In fact, I am the...

766
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,070
Your Majesty.

767
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,210
Lai Zhongshu?

768
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,890
I didn't summon you.

769
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,200
Your Majesty.

770
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,150
How dare you visit

771
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,360
without notice?

772
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,470
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

773
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,470
Your Majesty.

774
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,910
I need Vice Minister Li's help

775
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,760
in handling an important case.

776
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,200
There's no time to lose.

777
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,670
What important case is it

778
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,800
that it's so urgent?

779
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:39,940
Your Majesty.

780
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,460
It's about the suspect of the Demon Cat Case.

781
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,630
What?

782
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,950
Li Bing, just now...

783
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,750
Your Majesty.

784
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,070
What do you want?

785
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,790
Since the court's old officials

786
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,520
are vouching for Minister Lai,

787
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,040
Minister Li, please follow him

788
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,320
to assist in the Demon Cat Case's investigation.

789
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,950
Yes,

790
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,630
Your Majesty.

791
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,710
Vice Minister Li.

792
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

793
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,510
Vice Minister Li.

794
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:34,580
Please.

795
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,000
Where is the suspect?

796
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
He's right ahead.

797
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:03,950
Open the door.

798
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,510
Minister Lai.

799
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,710
Where is the suspect?

800
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,310
Lai Zhongshu, what are you doing?

801
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,910
Because you're the suspect,

802
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:18,670
Li Bing!

803
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,720
What are you talking about?

804
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,920
Since I said it's you,

805
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,910
I'll make it clear to you.

806
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,230
Three years ago, you went home to send the deceased off.

807
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,910
But it was only one year ago

808
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,230
that you showed up in your hometown.

809
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,460
Where have you been during those two years?

810
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,390
The journey was long and difficult.

811
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,510
The journey was long and difficult?

812
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,720
That's a good reason.

813
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,510
But not long after you left the capital,

814
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,110
someone discovered the carriage and luggage

815
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,400
belonging to your Li family in the valley

816
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,980
beside the post road.

817
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,840
But you were nowhere to be found.

818
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,080
How do you explain that?

819
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,150
After I left the capital,

820
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,390
I was robbed by bandits

821
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,670
and lucky to escape.

822
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,000
You were robbed by bandits and lucky to escape?

823
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,180
Why didn't you report it to the government?

824
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,470
Why didn't you mention anything

825
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,870
after returning to the Court of Judicial Review?

826
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,350
Circumstances had changed with time.

827
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,280
Was it necessary

828
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,540
to mention it?

829
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Vice Minister Li!

830
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,640
You're still making up excuses.

831
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,910
I don't know what you mean

832
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,990
by excuses.

833
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,350
What does all this

834
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,300
have to do with the Demon Cat Case?

835
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,250
What does it have to do with it?

836
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,910
I'll tell you

837
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,110
how it's related.

838
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,670
One year ago,

839
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,710
about 7 miles outside of the capital,

840
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,020
someone once saw a demon cat.

841
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,870
Also, there were people who saw

842
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,550
the demon cat shapeshifting into a human

843
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,880
and left this painting.

844
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,550
Li Bing.

845
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,070
Isn't this you?

846
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,540
Lai Zhongshu.

847
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,730
If you want to frame me,

848
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,470
isn't this too crude?

849
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,270
Are you trying to frame me

850
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,270
with a random painting as evidence?

851
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,270
I knew you would say that.

852
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,270
After all, all the witnesses

853
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,350
were killed.

854
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,190
And they were

855
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,090
all killed by wild beasts.

856
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,620
Vice Minister Li.

857
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,190
I didn't believe in

858
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,850
supernatural powers or gods.

859
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,190
But before you appeared in Shendu,

860
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,910
those people in Mingjing Hall

861
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,740
happened to have solved the Duo Robbery Case.

862
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,310
They kept saying

863
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,310
that a cat

864
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,030
was helping them solve the case.

865
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,790
And this cat

866
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,350
was locked up by them

867
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,350
in the Court of Judicial Review's prison.

868
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,030
Then Chen Shi and the cat

869
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,550
disappeared together.

870
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,670
At that time, you appeared again.

871
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,880
And you and Chen Shi

872
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,460
cracked the so-called Demon Cat Case.

873
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,590
So what?

874
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:26,700
You...

875
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,060
What are you doing?

876
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,630
This is the confusion powder used by

877
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,870
those notorious bandits.

878
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,630
But

879
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,200
I added something to it.

880
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:34,870
Li Bing.

881
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,160
I want to see

882
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,270
what you really are.

883
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,200
You...

884
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,480
Who dares to break into the secret prison?

885
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,550
General?

886
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,150
No!

887
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,350
No!

888
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,270
No! No!

889
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,310
No!

890
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,190
No!

891
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
No!

892
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,670
No!

893
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:23,950
No!

894
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,710
You are indeed a demon.

895
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,570
Li Bing!

896
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,910
You want to kill again?

897
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,550
Do you dare to kill me?

898
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,030
Guards!

899
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,400
Li Bing?

900
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,040
[Court of Judicial Review]
