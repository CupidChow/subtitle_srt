Stop crowing!

All right, hurry up.

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,760
The buns are waiting for you to taste them.

8
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:46,590
Okay.

9
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,870
Stop crowing.

10
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,070
Come on. Hurry.

11
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,750
Stop crowing.

12
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,600
Mr. Wang.

13
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,590
Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang.

14
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,650
Mr. Wang, don’t go.

15
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,950
I made it in time.

16
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,620
Here, a hot bun.

17
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,180
If it's not enough,

18
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,640
there's more. Take these.

19
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,290
This...

20
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,630
This is too much. I can't finish them.

21
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,090
It's okay. Take your time.

22
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,660
How is it?

23
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,590
The bun tastes so good.

24
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,750

Mr. Wang.

41
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,390
Are you really leaving?

42
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,230
It is Vice Minister's order.

43
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,910

don’t call me Mr. Wang.

49
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,300
Call me Wang Qi.

50
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,390
Qi is fine too.

51
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,430
Hope to see you again.

58
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,860
Why didn't you say something?

59
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,720
You scared me.

60
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm incoherent and speechless.

61
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,010
I don't know what to say.

63
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,760

65
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,670
It's bad luck.

66
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,040
Nevertheless,

67
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,800
Mr. Wang has left. In this vast world,

68
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,340
you don't even know if you'd ever see him again.

69
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,070
How could you not say anything?

70
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,980
Isn't he just across the street?

71
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:32,909
Yeah.

72
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,680
Wang Qi doesn't know where to live.

73
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,470
So he's temporarily staying at

74
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,930
Alibaba's private house.

75
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,300
He's just a few steps away

76
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,070
from the Court of Judicial Review.

77
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,330
We're going there later.

78
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,500
Come to us if you need anything.

79
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,630
There's something!

80
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,190
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

81
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,740
I used up all my money

82
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,590
to buy meat stuffing

83
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,680
for Uncle Cai to make buns for him!

84
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,380
I gave them all to him!

85
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,590
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

86
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,750
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

87
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,470
That's all the money I had.

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,750
Here.

89
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,120
No!

90
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,550
I just want my buns.

91
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,340
Can't you get it with money?

92
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,250
What?

93
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,280
I'll take the small one.

94
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,750
Thank you.

95
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,440
By the way,

96
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,230
Cui Bei said yesterday

97
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,560
that he would be with us.

98
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,610
Did you see him?

99
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:18,680
No.

100
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,230

103
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,440
Here are all the books from Councilor's place

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,980
you asked me to bring.

105
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,950
Except for the case files of the Ministry of Justice,

106
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,210
even the siblings' ledgers

107
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,409

108
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,630

109
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,240
poetry books for initiating education;

110
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,150
I've brought them all here.

111
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,780
Thank you.

112
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,159
Forgo the formalities.

113
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,159
Leave them here.

114
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,350
Yes.

118
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:12,970
I'm sorry!

119
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,470
Don't bother.

120
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,990
I'll do it myself.

121
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,710
Yes.

122
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,460
Vice Minister.

123
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,210
It's fine.

124
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,170
Just now,

125
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,300
I saw Wang Qi's dismissal letter.

126
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,720
Logically,

127
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,590
the dismissal letter should have

128
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,020
the official seal of the vice minister.

129
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,590
Could it be

130
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,840
you're still undecided on

131
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,030
the dismissal of Wang Qi?

132
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,570
You have something to say about that too?

133
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,730
Vice Minister.

134
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,370
Wang Qi did make a mistake,

135
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,780
but since he entered Mingjing Hall,

136
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,870
he has done everything conscientiously.

137
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,070
He has always been impartial and selfless with his work.

138
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,470
This oversight was a case

139
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,640
where the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

140
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,030
Mingjing Hall has a lot of work to do.

141
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,550
If we suddenly lose Wang Qi,

142
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,390
the few of us

143
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,240
might have a tough time.

144
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,310
Please think twice

145
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,950
about Wang Qi's dismissal.

146
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,950
I have my own thoughts on this matter.

147
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,270
Stop asking so much.

148
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,680
Get back to work.

149
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,790

Have some water.

154

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,040

156
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,950

157
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,130
Why have I never seen you before?

158
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,250
I'm new here.

159
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,950
My surname is Hua.

I'm Hua Zhi Yi. Got it?

161
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,700
-Yes, Hua Zhi Yi.

163

164

I want to go to the toilet.

165
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,430
Go on.

166
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,350
Wait.

167
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,350
The keys.

168
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,670
Go on.

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,130
Who are you?

170
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,230
Are you here

171
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,880
to save me or kill me?

172
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,560
I'm here to play games.

173
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,830
But I realized you are no fun.

174
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,120
So I don't want to play with you.

175
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:50,910
But...

176
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,310
you are quite suitable

177
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,510
to be a toy.

178
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,990

194
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,400
getting along with them these days?

195
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,370
Pretty good.

196
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,630
Mr. Cui, Mr. Sun,

197
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,940
and Baba.

198
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,140
Everyone is nice.

199
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,970
They teach me how to attend classes

200
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,830
and how to read.

201
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,150
They also hope

202
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,610
I can join the Court of Judicial Review soon.

203
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,550
Also, today...

204
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,930
I just sent Mr. Wang off.

205
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,750
I knew you would say that.

206
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,950
Actually, the case of Councilor

207
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,810
is not over yet.

208
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,510
Logically,

209
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,750
I should take people from Mingjing Hall

210
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,080
to investigate with me.

211
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,470
But I haven't decided

212
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,110
if I want to let them join.

213
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,870
But didn't everyone

214
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,350
catch the mason

215
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,270
together?

216
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,390
But we haven't figured out his motive

217
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,070
for murder.

218
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,390
We don't know what he's looking for

219
00:12:59,390 --> 00:12:59,980
either.

220
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,710
I'm thinking

221
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,640
if it's related to those dossiers.

222
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,830
The dossiers?

223
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,070
Before Councilor died,

224
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,110
he brought back a batch of dossiers

225
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,810
he was organizing from the Ministry of Justice.

226
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,670
[Openness and Justice]

227
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,850
When Cui Bei reviewed the case,

228
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,360
he retrieved the physical evidence again.

229
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,470
But there were no wet dossiers

230
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,550
in his house.

231
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,850
Is it possible that

232
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,770
it just so happened

233
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,870
that no other dossier got wet?

234
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,280
I don't think so.

235
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,590
Do you remember

236
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,630
when the Councilor's sister

237
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,710
was about to have her coming-of-age ceremony?

238
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,480
Look at this.

239
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,580
These are the handwritten poems the Councilor prepared

240
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,310
for his sister's

241
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,430
coming-of-age ceremony,

242
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,960
which were also by his hand.

243
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,970
There was a leak at that time

244
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,900
and rainwater fell on the dossier.

245
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,350
The Councilor is very strict

246
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,680
with business affairs.

247
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,960
The dossier got wet,

248
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,230
so he immediately used the poems

249
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,610
to remove the water stains.

250
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,510
That's why three words

251
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,310
are left on it.

252
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,310
On the back.

253
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,310
And these words

254
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,070
are similar to

255
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,300
[Yi Zhi Hua]

256
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,670
the clues I've found before.

257
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,630
Yi...

258
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,590
Mu...

259
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,630
Yi Mu... something... Hua?

260
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,910
Yi Zhi Hua.

261
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,110
He is that

262
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,570
Jiazitou behind the mask.

263
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,540
A death-row inmate

264
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,510
whose traces were deliberately erased.

265
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,350
So,

266
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,350
that mason

267
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,100
killed someone

268
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,240
for the dossier in Councilor's hands?

269
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,400
His motive is to get

270
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,960
the dossier of Yi Zhi Hua?

271
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,430
Was it to get it

272
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,630
or to destroy it?

273
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,180
Someone doesn't want this case

274
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,340
to be investigated.

275
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,310
And I found the clues about Yi Zhi Hua

276
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:51,870
from

277
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,710
the Minister of Rites' Mansion.

278
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,630
It means Yi Zhi Hua

279
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,450
is also related to

280
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,780
the demon cat murder case three years ago.

281
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,590
This case

282
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,690
is more complicated than we thought.

283
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,830
It might also

284
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,160
be related to my secret.

285
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800
So I haven't decided

286
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,480
if I should let them join.

287
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,940
What's that sound?

288
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,750
Mr. Li!

289
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,510
Mr. Li!

290
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,460
Mr. Li.

291
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,130
This...

292
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,260
[My slave]

293
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,610
This...

294
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,140
[My slave]

295
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,820
This...

296
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,950
Oh no.

297
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:42,830
Mr. Li!

298
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,640
[Self-discipline and Self-respect]

299
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,510
Mr. Li!

300
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,890
Vice Minister Li! Vice Minister Li!

301
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,430
Well...

302
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,100
General Qiu of Jinwu Guards wants to see you.

303
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,300
What is he doing here?

304
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,400
[Self-discipline and Self-respect]

305
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,070
Vice Minister Li.

306
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,190
General Qiu, you're at our Court of Judicial Review

307
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,720
to take someone away again.

308
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,840
Vice Minister Shangguan, you are wrong.

309
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
I just want to solve the case too.

310
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,700
What exactly brings you here, General Qiu?

311
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,840
About the criminal

312
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,230
your Court of Judicial Review caught when you reviewed the case

313
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,440
of the Ministry of Justice's Councilor,

314
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,210
I'm afraid

315
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,970
the Jinwu Guards needs to borrow them for a while.

316
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,310
Why?

317
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Isn't it obvious?

318
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,140
He is either a death-row inmate

319
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,070
who escaped from Jinwu Guards' prison

320
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,630
or is related to some case

321
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,330
the Jinwu Guards is investigating.

322
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,330
To take someone away

323
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,590
from the Court of Judicial Review,

324
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,650
General Qiu would make up any reason.

325
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,380
Do I need a reason?

326
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,310
I just want to do my best

327
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,910
to maintain the long-term peace

328
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,030
of Shendu.

329
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,110
Of course.

330
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,680
General Qiu, you are

331
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,720
in charge of tens of thousands of Jinwu Guards

332
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,270
and responsible for the security of Shendu.

333
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,690
Even if it’s just empty talk

334
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,950
without any evidence,

335
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,990
you're still a man of your words.

336
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,550
A man of my words?

337
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,660
How can I compare to your father,

338
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,570
Minister of Defense, Shangguan Lian,

339
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,670
Lord Shangguan?

340
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,440
In a war of thousands of miles,

341
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,820
how many soldiers can narrowly escape death?

342
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,070
It's all just contingent on

343
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,070
his words.

344
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,839
What are you trying to say?

345
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,470
General Qiu.

346
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,650
Even in front of His Majesty,

347
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,990
the Court of Judicial Review is where the law lies.

348
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,589
There is no reason why prisoners who have not been tried in the Court of Judicial Review

349
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,740
should be handed over to others,

350
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,480
right?

351
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,810
Vice Minister!

352
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,810
[Self-discipline and Self-respect]

353
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,650
Bad news.

354
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,960
What happened? Why are you so flustered?

355
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,710
That mason is dead.

356
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:44,830
Madam.

357
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,870
This person just died

358
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,870
due to excessive bleeding.

359
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,060
The criminal stabbed his chest with a sharp weapon,

360
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,990
leaving dozens of scars

361
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,480
which are deep and visible.

362
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,110
It's an extremely cruel method.

363
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,000
Prison guard!

364
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,840
What happened?

365
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,690
Vice Minister.

366
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,670
Well...

367
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,600
I have no idea.

368
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,630
He was fine just now.

369
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,500
I just went to the toilet.

370
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,710
After I came back,

371
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,130
he was dead.

372
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,470
By the way,

373
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,510
when I left,

374
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,910
someone from the court

375
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,350
said he would take care of him for me.

376
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,630
Madam, you can just ask around.

377
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,690
Where is that man who took your place?

378
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,470
He said

379
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,090
his surname is Hua.

380
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,960
He's called Hua Zhi Yi!

381
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,510
Well...

382
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,790
The Court of Judicial Review

383
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,110
hasn't had any newcomers recently.

384
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,870
Chen Shi is the only newcomer.

385
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,790
I’ve never heard of

386
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,270
Hua... Hua Zhi Yi.

387
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,910
Hua Zhi Yi...

388
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,390
Yi Zhi Hua?

389
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,090
What did he look like?

390
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,060
Vice Minister.

391
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,830
I...

392
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,710
I don't remember either.

393
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,270
It's strange.

394
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,750
He suddenly appeared.

395
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,550
Also...

396
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,630
Also,

397
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,790
since he gave me

398
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,750
a bowl of water,

399
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,950
I became confused

400
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,150
and agreed to whatever he said.

401
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,850
The Court of Judicial Review is indeed where the law lies.

402
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,710
Their prisoner

403
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,510
actually died in prison.

404
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,190
What a coincidence.

405
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,750
Whenever I visit the Court of Judicial Review

406
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,750
to get a criminal,

407
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,240
[Camp waiting for you]

408
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,350
they had either run away

409
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,670
or were killed.

410
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,530
If the criminal was killed,

411
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,940
we just need to do our best to catch the murderer.

412
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,110
General Qiu, you don't have to

413
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,980
be sarcastic

414
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,700
and beat around the bush.

415
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,980
It's as if you have something against

416
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,640
the Court of Judicial Review.

417
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,990
Vice Minister Shangguan, you're too paranoid.

418
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,670
I'm just stating the facts.

419
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,000
Whether it's the culprit or whomever,

420
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,670
since they died in the Court of Judicial Review,

421
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,590
the Court of Judicial Review is naturally suspicious.

422
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,280
Even if I say the whole Court of Judicial Review,

423
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,010
including you all here, is guilty of killing him,

424
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,970
it is not entire implausible.

425
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,730
General Qiu, your deduction is possible.

426
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,890
But without evidence,

427
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,560
this is just a frame-up.

428
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,930
When the prisoner was killed,

429
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,740
you and the Jinwu Guards

430
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,560
were here too, right?

431
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,710
In that case,

432
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,970
all the more is this case

433
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:17,870
related to me.

434
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,590
Before the investigation results come out,

435
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,380
my Jinwu Guards and I

436
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,810
can't leave the Court of Judicial Review.

437
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,260
If I'm right,

438
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,950
the words written in blood are the clue.

439
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,310
Vice Minister Li,

440
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,010
also known as Yao Bing,

441
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,440
you are the best at investigating cases.

442
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,300
Why don't you broaden my horizons

443
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,060
and show me how you find the murderer?

444
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,550
I'm afraid not.

445
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,350
Vice Minister Li.

446
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,660
So there are times when you are afraid of difficulties too.

447
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,950
Because what you have

448
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,190
is half of the clue.

449
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,870
When you led your men

450
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,070
to my Court of Judicial Review just now,

451
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,930
someone left the other half

452
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,070
by my door.

453
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,510
The two pieces can be

454
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,570
matched together.

455
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,470
What is this?

456
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,830
They look like foreign characters.

457
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,240
[I'll wait for you at the slave camp]

458
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,860
They seem to be Zixu characters.

459
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,670
General Qiu, three years ago,

460
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,200
you once fought in Zixu.

461
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,760
You should know a thing or two.

462
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:38,830
No.

463
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Vice ministers.

464
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,420
If it's a foreign language,

465
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,070
our Court of Judicial Review has a judge.

466
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,470
Maybe he can decipher it.

467
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,470
Chen Shi.

468
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,150
Go get Alibaba.

469
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,840
Get Alibaba.

470
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,700
Yes, Mr. Li.

471
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,860
This talisman seems familiar.

472
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,000
What's your plan?

473
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,830
What plan can I have?

474
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,350
Staying at Shendu,

475
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,770
I don't know what I should do

476
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,770
right now.

477
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,430
I should at least inform them if I'm going back to Yangzhou.

478
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,210
My father said long ago

479
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,400
that I couldn't make a name for myself in Shendu.

480
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,030
It'd be embarrassing to go back now

481
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,020
with my tail between my legs.

482
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,070
But

483
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,030
it's not a long-term plan.

484
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,000
Not a long-term plan.

485
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,040
You are full of strategies.

486
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,950
But I didn't see you

487
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,210
put in a good word for me

488
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,730
in front of Vice Minister.

489
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,430
You can run,

490
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,410
but you can't hide.

491
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,310
The monk can run away,

492
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,150
but the temple won't run with him.

493
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,420
Alibaba.

494
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,590
We were colleagues after all.

495
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,600
Don't tell me you're trying to kick me out?

496
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,750
I know.

497
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,790
Why don't you take the Mandarin Level 8 Exam with me?

498
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,430
I'm not a foreigner.

499
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,370
Why should I take the Mandarin Level 8 Exam?

500
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,750
Right.

501
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,160
Go ask the master for good fortune

502
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,640
and find a place to go.

503
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,910
Mr. Wang!

504
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,590
Guys.

505
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,510
Everyone!

506
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,950
Chen Shi.

507
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,180
You're here.

508
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,190
I didn't expect

509
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,350
to meet you so soon.

510
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,860
By the way,

511
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,190
the two vice ministers asked me to find...

512
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,240
Did Vice Minister regret his decision?

513
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,790
Is he rehiring me again?

514
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,110
I knew it. Mingjing Hall can't crack a case

515
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,070
without me.

516
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,910
No.

517
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,390
The two vice ministers asked me to get...

518
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,270
get Alibaba.

519
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,430
Me?

520
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,800
The vice ministers?

521
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,030
Vice Minister Shangguan is looking for me too?

522
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,160
Well, that’s right.

523
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,180
Let's go. Come on.

524
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,830
There's no time to lose.

525
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,350
Let's go.

526
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,680
There's no time to lose.

527
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,540
There's a case.

528
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,780
You...

529
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,230
should go.

530
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,670
[I'll wait for you at the slave camp]

531
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,730
These are Zixu characters.

532
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,500
But they're a little different from those I've seen

533
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,700
in my country before.

534
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,000
Can you understand it?

535
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:50,750
Yes.

536
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,310
I can understand most of it, I guess.

537
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,020
This indicates a location.

538
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,010
But I've never heard of it.

539
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,270
Where?

540
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,990
It's a... slave camp?

541
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,830
Nonsense!

542
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,930
The mason's death is very important.

543
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,330
How can you let a foreigner

544
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,590
decipher it casually?

545
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,520
General Qiu.

546
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,990
Although he hasn't

547
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,270
officially joined the Court of Judicial Review,

548
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,220
he is still the judge of Mingjing Hall

549
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,730
of the Court of Judicial Review.

550
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,700
You first planned to take the criminal away

551
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,500
today,

552
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,810
then framed the Court of Judicial Review

553
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,470
for the death of the criminal.

554
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,140
Now you're openly questioning the judge

555
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,580
of Mingjing Hall of the Court of Judicial Review

556
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,630
and insinuating that how we handle cases is nonsense.

557
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,960
I doubt the Jinwu Guards

558
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:29,950
are this powerful

559
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,830
in Shendu.

560
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,240
Or

561
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,580
did some minister promise you

562
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,180
some vice minister position

563
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,410
again?

564
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,240
General Qiu.

565
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,870
Don't you think you've gone too far?

566
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,150
Since the criminal that

567
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,540
the Jinwu Guards is looking for is dead

568
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,750
and the Court of Judicial Review can't solve this case,

569
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,750
I don't have to

570
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,520
waste my time here any further.

571
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,560
What kind of temper is that?

572
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,360
I didn’t say anything special.

573
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,390
Vice Minister Shangguan, thank you for your parental love.

574
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,510
Choose your words properly.

575
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,550
Whose your parent?

576
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,410
Your flattery is inappropriate!

577
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,360
Let me tell you.

578
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,990
Just now, our vice minister's

579
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,750
righteous and stern words

580
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,350
caused General Qiu to leave in embarrassment.

581
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,690
Vice Minister Shangguan.

582
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,990
There is still something fishy about this case.

583
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,920
I think this clue

584
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,190
is related to the Councilor's case.

585
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,430
Please leave it entirely to Mingjing Hall

586
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,270
to handle it.

587
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,390
Vice Minister Li, do as you wish.

588
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,150
Mr. Li.

589
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:27,890
Thank you.

590
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,590
Mr. Li.

591
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,670
These red characters...

592
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,070
Let's talk when I'm back.

593
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:31,630
Mr. Li.

594
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,830
I wanted to say that those red characters

595
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,290
have...

596
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,710
This is now a case of Mingjing Hall.

597
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,310
Let’s talk at Mingjing Hall.

598
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,630
Vice Minister Shangguan.

599
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,830
We'll take our leave.

600
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,770
Those red characters

601
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,780
are really...

602
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,510
Vice Minister.

603
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,710
This case

604
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,130
might be a huge case.

605
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,030
Are we giving it to Mingjing Hall

606
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,890
just like that?

607
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,760
The Councilor's case

608
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,710
was assigned to Mingjing Hall anyway.

609
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,080
It was also someone from Mingjing Hall

610
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,870
who recognized those characters.

611
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,790
General Qiu

612
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,190
was so devoted to this matter,

613
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,070
but now he's avoiding it.

614
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,350
It must be a hot potato.

615
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,010
Li Bing is indeed extraordinary.

616
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,990
Let him handle it then.

617
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,560
Impressive, Vice Minister.

618
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,030
You have great foresight.

619
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,720
Don't think I don't know

620
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,910
my father asked you to follow me

621
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,850
to the Court of Judicial Review

622
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,030
to support me

623
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,620
and to keep an eye on me.

624
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,310
About the conversation between General Qiu and me today,

625
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,030
don't say anything you shouldn't.

626
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,640
Vice Minister.

627
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,270
Young Miss... Young Miss, don't worry.

628
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:30,900
I got it.

629
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,310
I-In the Court of Judicial Review,

630
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,110
I'm always

631
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,420
y-your judicial commissioner first

632
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,900
and your servant second.

633
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,290
Good that you know.

634
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,150
Young Miss!

635
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,190
Vice Minister Li?

636
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,030
General Qiu.

637
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,550
Why are you here?

638
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,710
Why do you ask when you already know?

639
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,480
That's right.

640
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,790
With your wisdom,

641
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,950
it's not surprising

642
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,350
that you can guess it's this place

643
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,590
just through those few characters.

644
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,650
It's not just that.

645
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,660
After Councilor and Minister of Rites died,

646
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,820
there were traces of the murderer behind them.

647
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,150
This person is eccentric

648
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,680
and enjoys teasing others.

649
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,590
You really came just in time.

650
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,260
When the mason died, you came to pick him up.

651
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,630
Also, you didn't find these characters written in blood

652
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,700
from the deceased victim's clothes,

653
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,590
right?

654
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,960
There was blood on all the victims' chests.

655
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,820
But the paper

656
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,550
is untainted with blood.

657
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,670
Vice Minister Li.

658
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,450
I'm just investigating the case to arrest him.

659
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,630
If it's just a case,

660
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,790
why did you come here

661
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,670
alone?

662
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,990
If I remember correctly,

663
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,870
this is the slave camp

664
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,530
you escaped back then, right?

665
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,250
Don't move!

666
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,070
W-Who are you?

667
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,970
You escaped from the slave camp?

668
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,440
How did you know?

669
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,710
You smell like paint

670
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,150
and you have paint in your nails.

671
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,480
Only the slave camp

672
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,920
in the Southern City is still involved with jobs

673
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,250
that handle such paint.

674
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,540
Besides,

675
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,010
you have so many calluses on your hands.

676
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,670
You must have been working there for many years.

677
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,840
When I came in,

678
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,700
I heard a patrol guard shouting outside.

679
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,240
Are they looking to arrest you?

680
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,170
Don't report me.

681
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,070
I'll leave after hiding here for a while.

682
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,790
Report you?

683
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,910
Do you know who my father is?

684
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,980
Eat up.

685
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,180
It's delicious.

686
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:20,970
How is it?

687
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,740
That's my father,

688
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,470
not a bad guy.

689
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,070
Hide here.

690
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,800
Don't make a sound.

691
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,710
Come on.

692
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,390
Regarding the case of Minister of Rites,

693
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,680
you obey him

694
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,280
and protect him at all costs.

695
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,510
After the minister was arrested,

696
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,470
you took away the murderer's clue

697
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,590
from him.

698
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,720
How did you know?

699
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,070
I have my own way.

700
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,470
What do you have

701
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,350
in their hands

702
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,950
for you to disregard the law,

703
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,420
to obey the Minister of Rites,

704
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,670
and to go against the Court of Judicial Review

705
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,670
for such a killer?

706
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,780
When I escaped from the slave camp,

707
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,000
your father took me in

708
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,570
and I studied with you.

709
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,350
It was you and your father who promised

710
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,230
that after returning from the battlefield,

711
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,820
I would be free

712
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,940
and emancipated from my slave status.

713
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,990
After coming back from the battlefield,

714
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,590
you pretended not to know us.

715
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,950
Besides, you were the Left General.

716
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,630
Why would you mind...

717
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,490
No matter what,

718
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,720
you and your father failed to keep your promise.

719
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,910
Everyone is afraid of being taken advantage of

720
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,390
by someone with ulterior motives.

721
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,990
I want to make more progress.

722
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,910
This is my obstacle.

723
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,910
So the minister threatened you with this.

724
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,310
Now the killer has something on you?

725
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,270
You are...

726
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,620
Jiazitou?

727
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,070
Yi Zhi Hua?

728
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,930
It doesn't matter who I am.

729
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,720
As long as you can catch up with me,

730
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:54,670
my secret will be yours.

731
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,510
Come on!

732
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,370
Who exactly are you?

733
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,350
I knew you would ask

734
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,770
such a mundane question.

735
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,790
Boring.

736
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,060
Fine.

737
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,360
If you want to know who I am,

738
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,110
let's fight.

739
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,270
I'll tell you if you win.

740
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,170
You're weak!

741
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,230
You can't defeat me.

742
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,659
How can I answer your question?

743
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,380
What a headache.

744
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,190
I remember.

745
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:56,770
I remember.

746
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,470
I remember.

747
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,030
You didn't fight me with all your strength.

748
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,160
What did you say?

749
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,240
Li Bing.

750
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,040
Why don't you shapeshift

751
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,110
to fight me?

752
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,710
You can shapeshift.

753
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,830
I know that.

754
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,530
Shapeshift!

755
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,810
Shapeshift!

756
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,880
Shapeshift!

757
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,610
Shapeshift!

758
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:33,680
Shapeshift!

759
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,030
You should shapeshift.

760
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,510
What do you know?

761
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,910
What do I know?

762
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,550
I know everything.

763
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,160
But if you can't defeat me,

764
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,450
you won't find out anything.

765
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,380
You're not the minister's killer.

766
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,320
Who?

767
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,130
I'm a killer.

768
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,560
But I'm not someone's killer.

769
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,800
I kill whomever

770
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,970
makes me unhappy...

771
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,090
or

772
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,030
whomever makes me happy.

773
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,360
What about Qiu Qingzhi?

774
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,570
Do you have something on him

775
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,910
to make him obey you?

776
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,750
Qiu Qingzhi?

777
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,000
I have something on

778
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,740
many people.

779
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,880
Qiu Qingzhi

780
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,470
is nothing.

781
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,150
Then why are you

782
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,940
doing all this?

783
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,870
Aren't you tired of asking so many questions,

784
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,550
Li Bing?

785
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,790
All this

786
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,300
is just a game.

787
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,620
What's the most important thing in a game?

788
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,950
It must be interesting.

789
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,510
And what is

790
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,350
the most interesting aspect in this game?

791
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,510
No one knows

792
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,350
if they are the players

793
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,630
or just being played

794
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,950
in the game.

795
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:04,750
Judging from the current situation,

796
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,150
you can't play this game.

797
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,570
You can only be played.

798
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,700
Do you know why?

799
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,350
You're so stupid.

800
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,640
What?

801
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,480
You're stupid because you think

802
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,950
no one knows your secret.

803
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,030
Right?

804
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,830
And I

805
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,530
have prepared all the clues

806
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,190
for the people...

807
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,450
who should know!

808
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,500
[Sun, moon, wood, behind, cat]

809
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,430
i saw this on the table

810
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,390
upon waking up.

811
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,970
I don't know what it is.

812
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,400
They do look like Zixu characters.

813
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,460
But I think they're written wrongly.

814
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,030
I think

815
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,880
this is a talisman.

816
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,420
This may have nothing to do

817
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,320
with the case.

818
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,710
Maybe I was too sleepy

819
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,790
and drew nonsense when I was writing.

820
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,630
The ink on it

821
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,020
clearly doesn't come from the Court of Judicial Review.

822
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,680
You couldn't have written it.

823
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,550
If only Wang Qi were here.

824
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,790
Maybe

825
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,650
he might come up with some tricks.

826
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,910
Why don't we secretly

827
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,900
let Wang Qi see it?

828
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,600
I think that works.

829
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,840
It's inappropriate.

830
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,170
Then what should we do?

831
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,680
Can we only wait for Mr. Li to come back?

832
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,850
You want to run away?

833
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,690
It's too late.

834
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,790
What do you think?

835
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,280
Either you let them know

836
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,150
your secret

837
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,630
or you can reveal your secret

838
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,690
to me.

839
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
What do you think?

840
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,290
Do you still think this game

841
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,370
is interesting?

842
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,760
It's interesting.

843
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,940
There's another way.

844
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,670
Either

845
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,880
kill me to silence me

846
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,870
or you can

847
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,640
kill them all.

848
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,790
What do you think?

849
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,130
[Sun, moon, wood, behind, cat]

850
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,990

851
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,960
Yeah?

852
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,050
What did you practice writing last night?

853
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:57,630
I...

854
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,300
The simple ones...

855
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,040
They're still here.

856
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:01,780
Here.

857
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,410
These simple words

858
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,280
and strokes.

859
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,190
Why?

860
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:09,790
Alibaba.

861
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,720
Hold this for me.

862
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,590
What's going on?

863
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,030
Sun Bao.

864
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,830
Help me hold the candle.

865
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,630
Okay.

866
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,870
Where should I shine it?

867
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,470
Here?

869
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,030

870
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,500
Let me see. Hang on.

[Sun, moon, wood, behind, cat]

872
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,130
Sun, moon, wood, behind, cat...

873
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,000
It's on fire! It's on fire!

874
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,150
Go get some water.

875
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:34,830
Hurry up.

876
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:35,350
Water.

877
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,160
It's you?

878
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,880
It's you again!

879
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,440
Don't kill him! Keep him alive!

880
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,740
You didn't ask him anything

881
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,060
and just killed him?

882
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,640
It was inconvenient to arrest him.

883
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,410
Seeing that you were in danger,

884
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,810
I helped you out.

885
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,830
It was urgent, so I had no choice

886
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,480
but to kill the murderer.

887
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,310
Are you so afraid

888
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,440
of what he has on you?

889
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:51,890
Fine.
