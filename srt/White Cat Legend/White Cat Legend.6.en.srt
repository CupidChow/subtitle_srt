Vice Minister,

6
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,720
did you see Her Majesty today?

7
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,340
Yes.

8
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,789
Her Majesty wants to see Li Bing too.

9
00:01:59,509 --> 00:01:59,870
I wonder

10
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,470
what she wants to do with him.

11
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,750
Madam,

12
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,910
I heard

13
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,510
Her Majesty—

14
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,570
You're very alert.

15
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,150
You even dare to inquire about the palace's matter.

16
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,990
I dare not.

17
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,020
I'm just afraid

18
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,900
I'll embarrass you,

19
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,760
Vice Minister.

20
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,720
I can tell you.

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,860
Her Majesty is already past 60 years old.

22
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,400
However, not only is she aging,

23
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,310
but she's even getting younger.

24
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,120
At first glance, she looks like a child.

There is a rumor in the court

28
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,510
that Her Majesty has a strange disease.

29
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,740
People's hearts are wavering.

30
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,870
Her Majesty has been living in seclusion more and more.

31
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,590
Many officials

32
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,030
also disappear from time to time.

33
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,290
It's very mysterious.

00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,020
Commoner Li Bing?

35
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,120
From what I know,

36
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,300
haven't you been

37
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,980
acting under the name of Court of Judicial Review?

38
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,410
I have sinned.

39
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,210
You've committed

40
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,270
more than one sin.

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,310
Let me ask you.

42
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,630
What is with the seal

43
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,370
of the Minister of Judicial Review?

44
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,170
It has been lost for three years.

45
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,830
Why do you have it?

46
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,090
I returned to my hometown as a pallbearer three years ago.

47
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,270
Not long ago, I found this seal

48
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,800
in my late father's coffin.

49
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,490
I knew it was a serious matter,

50
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,370
so I returned to Shendu with the seal

51
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,920
to return it to the Court of Judicial Review,

52
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,079
but I encountered the Demon Cat Case

53
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,480
just as I entered Shendu.

54
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,720
I thought it was very strange,

55
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,670
so I made my own decision.

56
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,060
I decided not to return the seal

57
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,630
to investigate the case myself.

58
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,530
I have sinned.

59
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,510
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

60
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,510
You know

61
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,950
I won't punish you, right?

62
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,110
I dare not,

63
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,079
but Your Majesty,

64
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,270
please don't punish

65
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,270
the families of the missing people.

66
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,010
I have already pardoned them.

67
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,670
Thank you, Your Majesty.

68
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,710
Li Bing,

69
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,720
did you keep the seal

70
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,350
because you don't trust

71
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,480
the current Court of Judicial Review?

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,500
That is not so.

73
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,920
If not for the assistance from the Court of Judicial Review,

74
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,470
the case would still be unresolved.

75
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,130
You're quite good with words.

76
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,150
After Minister Li passed away,

77
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,280
the Court of Judicial Review no longer has anyone of use.

78
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,149
The Mingjing Hall that your father

79
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,230
established himself

80
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,029
is now...

81
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,589
I don't blame you

82
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,990
for not trusting others.

83
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,200
You did a good job

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,850
with the Demon Cat Case.

85
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,910
Thank you, Your Majesty.

86
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,910
The Demon Cat Case is solved,

87
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,750
but we still haven't found

88
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,390
the missing ones from before.

89
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,909
Li Bing,

90
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,650
since you're back,

91
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,680
return to the Court of Judicial Review.

92
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,770
I don't dare.

93
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,560
Being too modest makes one arrogant.

94
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,540
You should know

95
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,909
to do your duty.

96
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,670
Yes.

97
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,790
The Minister of Rites is the only person

98
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,840
knowledgeable about the missing case.

99
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,510
May I ask

100
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,020
to start with investigating the minister?

101
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,990
Of course.

102
00:04:58,409 --> 00:04:59,870
You brought back the old seal,

103
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,800
but the new seal has been forged.

104
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,310
I need to think about

105
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,040
which seal holds a heavier weight.

106
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,240
With your qualifications,

107
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,110
I will appoint you as the Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review

108
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,570
and manage Mingjing Hall.

109
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,870
A conclusion will be made

110
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,870
after some time.

111
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,360
Do you understand?

112
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,150
Yes.

113
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,310
Good.

114
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,000
I hope the Court of Judicial Review

115
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,050
will do well in your hands.

116
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,270
I

117
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,850
will obey Your Majesty's decree.

118

119

120
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,350
Why are you here?

121
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,270
I heard from Mr. Wang

122
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,190
that you entered the palace to talk about the Demon Cat Case,

123
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,710
so I came here to wait for you.

124
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,770
I wanted to tell you

125
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,910
Xiaohuan is well.

126
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,750
Gu too.

127
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,890
People from the government office said

128
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,260
Gu's case is not a big deal.

129
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,390
He'll be home soon.

130
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,020
By the way,

131
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,570
I also want to say goodbye.

132
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,050
Where are you going?

133
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,030
I'm going to look for my brother.

134
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,870
Have you found a place to stay?

135
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,670
Not yet,

136
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,210
but Shendu is big.

137
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,590
It won't be hard

138
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,030
to find food and shelter.

139
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,740
By the way,

140
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,430
this is

141
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,170
wood...

142
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,410
What's the thing you chew on?

143
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,190
G...

145
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,460
I exchanged my hometown's specialties

146
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,750
for this small bottle.

147
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,130
The seller said

148
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,340
anything put in this

149
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,390
can last for years

150
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,490
without going bad.

151
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,950
Just take it.

152
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,760
It's beautiful.

153
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,870
Thank you.

154
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,900
No problem.

155
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,730
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

156
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,740
Take care, Mr. Li.

157
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,590
Wait.

There's no rush in finding your brother.

159
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,910
This case is not over yet.

160
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,750
Why don't you go back to the Court of Judicial Review with me?

161
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,350
We need a witness to testify.

162
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,550
Witness?

163
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,710

165
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,930
you won't get thrown in jail again.

166
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,590
Really?

167
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,190
Okay then.

168
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,710
Let's go.

169
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,240

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,990
You... It's okay.

388
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,830
I'll look for something.

389
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,830
I'll find something and go up there.

390
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,310
It's okay.

391
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,130
I can get up.

392
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,550
Why is it so high?

393
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,870
It's kinda scary.

394
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,190
You noticed long ago, right?

395
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,030
I kept running into danger these past few days.

396
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,150
I didn't have the time to cover it up.

397
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,430
Notice what?

398
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,350
I just thought

399
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,040
you went from...

400
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:54,920
From this

401
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,550
and turned into this.

402
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,570
Turned into...

403
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,700
You're too amazing.

404
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,370
You know...

405
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:00,950
You know?

406
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,120
I thought

407
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,410
it's such a handsome

408
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,950
and beautiful wild cat

409
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,550
with

410
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,870
bright and fluffy fur.

411
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,790
I wanted to bring it home

412
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,520
and raise it.

413
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,510
I could comb its hair and stuff.

414
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,550
Who knew

415
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,100
it would turn into

416
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,190
you, Mr. Cat.

417
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,550
Just call me Mr. Li.

418
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,950
Okay, Mr. Cat.

419
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,190
Mr. Li.

420
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,290
You haven't

421
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,450
told others about this, right?

422
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,510
No, no, no.

423
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,470
How can I tell others?

424
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,840
If I tell others,

425
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,550
you'll be treated as a demon.

426
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,430
You don't think

427
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,150
I'm a demon?

428
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,880
I don't think so.

429
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,030
If you were a demon,

430
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,760
you would've eaten me already.

431
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,270
Other than me,

432
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,590
only you

433
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,570
know about this right now.

434
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,240
I got it.

435
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,430
Don't worry.

436
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,270
I definitely

437
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,330
won’t tell anyone,

438
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:00,870
Mr. Cat.

439
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,230
I definitely won't tell anyone,

440
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,790
Mr. Li.

441
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,630
I just wonder

442
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,510
how you became like this.

443
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,500
Well...

444
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,880
Are you looking for gum?

445
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,030
You should have told me earlier.

446
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,750
I had some,

447
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,990
but I left it in the Court of Judicial Review.

448
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,630
How about this?

449
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,630
I'll go down there

450
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,070
and get you some new ones.

451
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100
I'll get new ones.

452
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,010
I'll go now.

453
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,590
Thanks.

454
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,310
No problem.

455
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,250
I still want to ask.

456
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,900
How did you become like this?

457
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,590
It's a long story.

458
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,010
I don't actually know either.

459
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,870
You don't know? It's okay.

460
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,470
It's okay.

461
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,470
I won't ask anymore.

462
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,130
I'll go down

463
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,190
to get the stuff.

464
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,030
It's okay.

465
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,940
I can do it myself.

466
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,940
I can do it myself.

467
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:01,950
What?

468
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,270
I just...

469
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,390
Came down?

470
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,430
I'm okay.

471
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,550
Coming.

472
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,270
Finally.

473
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:25,950
Hurry up.

474
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,480
Hurry up.

475
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,710
Thanks for the treat.

476
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,590
It's nothing.

477
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,390
Thank you.

478
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,510
Say,

479
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,960
where did Chen Shi go

480
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,550
after he gave his statement

481
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,070
and the Demon Cat Case ended?

482
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,830
Anyway,

483
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,910
he ran away after the case was solved.

484
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,710
If it were me

485
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,510
and I ran into this problem

486
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,230
as soon as I

487
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,750
came to Shendu,

488
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,590
I'd have run away long ago.

489
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,670
How do you have the time to worry about others?

490
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,270
I think

491
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,270
the new vice minister today

492
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,990
is eccentric.

493
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,310
He must be hard to get along with.

494
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,670
Our future

495
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,240
will be hard.

496
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,270
Mr. Cui.

497
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,510
Mr. Know-It-All Cui.

498
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,970
Someone being nice for no reason must have an ulterior motive.

499
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,510
Speak.

500
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,560
Well,

501
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,540
you've been in Shendu the longest

502
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,190
and you

503
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,270
surround yourself with these files every day.

504
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,110
Do you know anything else

505
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,310
about this Mr. Li?

506
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,710
They're just rumors.

507
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,930
You do know things?

508
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,670
It's better to share with everyone than enjoy it alone.

509
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,150
Li Bing

510
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,350
is the son of the Minister of Judicial Review.

511
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,750
He used to have a nickname

512
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,270
called Yao Bing.

513
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,550
Yao Bing?

514
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,670
Yao Bing?

515
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,630
"Yao" as in "the youngest"

516
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,890
but also as in "demon."

517
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,480
For example,

518
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,450
there was a judicial commissioner

519
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,910
who must solve a cold case.

520
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,430
He thought hard

521
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,080
and it kept him up at night.

522
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,930
The case is solved!

523
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,930
The case is solved!

524
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,670
The case is solved!

525
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,880
An annotation

526
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,970
had suddenly appeared in the dossier,

527
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,470
pointing out a critical part.

528
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,470
It solved the case

529
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,270
in just a few words.

530
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,890
The case is solved.

531
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,470
Really?

532
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,760
You can solve cases?

533
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,590
Really! Look.

534
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,070
It really is solved?

535
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,230
How did you solve it?

536
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,290
Let me tell you.

537
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,870
The case has been around for a while.

538
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,790
It matured

539
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,270
and solved itself.

540
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,750
Congratulations.

541
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,540
At first,

542
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,470
the ignorant thought it was a god's doing.

543
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,430
In reality,

544
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,610
it was all done by Yao Bing.

545
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,670
Here's another example.

546
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,070
When a worker was on duty,

547
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,400
he could always hear

548
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,070
the Dengwen Drum

549
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,470
sound at midnight without anyone beating it.

550
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,000
Who is it?

551
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,910
In reality,

552
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,550
it was the suspects that Yao Bing brought back.

553
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,550
This Mr. Li

554
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,830
tied Chen Shi up at night to scare us.

555
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,650
His style hasn't changed.

556
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,560
He's still pretty chaotic.

557
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,470
However,

558
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,150
those in the know didn't see him as defiant

559
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,750
because...

560
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,790
Because his father

561
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,510
was the Minister of Judicial Review.

562
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,670
The Minister of Judicial Review was very strict

563
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,510
to him.

564
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,850
The reason they tolerated him

565
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,150
was because

566
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,870
he was seriously ill.

567
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,790
The doctors of Shendu

568
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,460
all said he wouldn't have a long life.

569
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,190
But I think

570
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,010
he looks youthful and strong.

571
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,950
Or it's because

572
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,640
he had miraculous experiences

573
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,310
in the three years that he was gone for.

574
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,110
Then why did he leave the Shendu?

575
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,390
This is related to

576
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,860
the Minister of Judicial Review's

577
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,660
assassination three years ago.

578
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,490
[Li's Residence]

579

616
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,490
After that,

617
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,710
Li Bing requested

618
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,260
to escort his father's coffin back to his hometown.

619
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,070

I thought I was doomed,

but I survived.

628
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,590
However, when I woke up,

629
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,110
I was in this

630
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,770
half-human, half-cat state.

631
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,590
As for my father's death,

632
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,960
the Ministry of Justice gave an explanation,

633
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,560
but I don't believe it at all.

634
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,510
I even feel that

635
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,310
my ambush

636
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,670

Everyone says I'm a genius detective

00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,990
but I don't even know

644
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,390
who is behind all of this.

645
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,590
Mr. Li, I trust

646
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,110
you can definitely

647
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,040
solve this case,

648
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,670
whether it's about your father

649
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,070
or that wild cat.

650
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,830
It took me three years

651
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,230
to organize everything.

652
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,210
I returned to Shendu this time

653
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,950
to find out the truth.

654
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,190
So the really hard

655
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,320
and super weird case

656
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,790
that you told me about

657
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,550
in the beginning

658
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,750
is this?

659
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,950
I investigated a lot

660
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,110
in the three years after my father's death,

661
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,450
but nothing was found.

662
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,550
Nothing.

663
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,940
That's the most suspicious point.

664
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,270
Now, the only clue

665
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,390
is that

666
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
I can become a cat.

667
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,950
It's weird.

668
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,610
You can become a cat

669
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,330
and then you ran into the Demon Cat Case.

670
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:44,910
This...

671
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,020
This is too much of a coincidence.

672
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,990
This Mr. Li

673
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,190
came back at the right time.

674
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,440
He ran into a big case

675
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,480
like a murderous demon cat as soon as he came back.

676
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,670
He even took care of it for us.

677
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:00,640
It turns out

678
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,830
that the new vice minister is our benefactor.

679
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,030
I need to find a master to look into this.

680
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,100
This is called fate.

681
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,910
Besides, Mingjing Hall

682
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,230
was founded

683
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,380
by Mr. Li's father.

684
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,150
I don't care if he's hard to get along with or not.

685
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,830
Anyway, from now on,

686
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,950
we will have someone backing us up.

687
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,150
One's life and death are predestined by the heavens.

688
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,010
This is not a coincidence.

689
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,310
Countless disappearances

690
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,670
occurred in Shendu in the past three years.

691
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,150
After that,

692
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,750
the legend of the demon cat started spreading.

693
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,070
I was sensitive

694
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,350
to the words "demon cat,"

695
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,630
so I started investigating along the way

696
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,580
and found Xiaohuan's tavern.

697
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,550
Take care.

698
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,510
Come again.

699
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,670
Then I met you.

700
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,030
Wild cat,

701
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,520
what are you doing here?

702
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,800
The demon cat legend

703
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,510
was made by the minister,

704
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,070
but with his power,

705
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,870
if he wanted to perfunctorily close the case,

706
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,130
there was no need to put in so much effort.

707
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,950
There must be something else

708
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,950
behind this case.

709
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,120
That's why he needed to cover it up.

710
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,870
Sir, you are so confident

711
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,910
because you think the both the witness and evidence

712
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,870
have been completely erased.

713
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,860
But now, the minister

714
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,190
has died mysteriously.

715
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,630
This lead has reached a dead end.

716
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,790
Could there be

717
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,970
anyone else like me in this world?

718
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:37,870
What's wrong?

719
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,670
Does it hurt here?

720
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,190
Come.

721
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,620
Are you hurt?

722
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,620
Let me take a look.

723
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,480
It doesn't matter.

724
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,350
That won't do.

725
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,070
This is

726
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,630
ointment from my hometown.

727
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,030
Look.

728
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,160
Apply this and you'll be fine.

729
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:52,870
Take it.

730
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,310
Take it.

731
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,430
Thank you.

732
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,630
No problem.

733
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,330
Here.

734
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,630
What is this?

735
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,870
It's pretty.

736
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,030
It's...

737
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,150
A talisman?

738
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,100
This is not a talisman.

739
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,760
This is a foreign language.

740
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,510
Well...

741
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,720
What does this mean?

742
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,080
I don't know either.

743
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,270
This is

744
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,350
a clue I got

745
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,350
from the Jinwu Guard's office tonight.

746
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,110
I got it.

747
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,190
You got injured

748
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,070
when you stole this.

749
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,060
I received this.

750
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,630
You received this thing.

751
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,280
Chen Shi,

752
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,520
have you ever thought about

753
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,990
returning to the Court of Judicial Review with me?

754
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,270
Me?

755
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,490
You came to Shendu find your brother,

756
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,640
but Shendu is so big.

757
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,220
Where would you even start looking?

758
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,440
The Court of Judicial Review is in charge of criminal cases,

759
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,270
including household registration records.

760
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,630
If you go to the Court of Judicial Review,

761
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,710
it'll be easier.

762
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,750
How about

763
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,800
you start as a worker of the Court of Judicial Review?

764
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,330
How about being my attendant scribe?

765
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:23,500
Really?

766
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,070
But

767
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,160
I don't know how to do anything.

768
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,810
You can do it, Chen Shi.

769
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,430
If it weren't for you,

770
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,880
the Demon Cat Case wouldn't have been solved so soon.

771
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,190
You're the only one

772
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,320
who knows my secret.

773
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,180
I need someone

774
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,650
who knows everything about me

775
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,250
to solve this case in Shendu.

776
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,330
You have to believe

777
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,470
that you are really

778
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,390
a kind person.

779
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,280
A place that manages law

780
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,080
needs someone like you.

781
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,390
I'm not that—

782
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,730
So you don't trust me?

783
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,670
No.

784
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:03,650
I trust you,

785
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,190
but...

786
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,490
There are no buts then.

787
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,320
Let's go.

788
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,650
Where are we going?

789
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,090
Back to the Court of Judicial Review.

790
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,190
Wait a minute.

791
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:25,550
Coming.

792
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,470
Remember to apply the ointment.

793
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,470
It'll heal faster with the ointment.

794
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,270
Got it.

795
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,070
After applying this,

796
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,130
your leg will be recovered tomorrow.

797
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,040
