not to follow me.

How dare you stop the Jinwu Guards

from getting involved in such an important case?

16

97
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,910

99
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,910
The sound of the qin we heard that day was hinting that

100
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,670
he wouldn't choose places

Are you still cold?

118
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,170
Have a drink to warm yourself up.

119
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,420
Luckily, we arrived in time.

120
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,820
Otherwise, you would have deserved to die.

121
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,600
Why were you hiding in the lotus pond?

122
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,910
Someone wanted to kill me.

123
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,200
I was running all the way

124
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,830
and fell into the lotus pond.

125
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,830
He even jumped into the lotus pond to look for me.

126
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,360
I was hiding in the mud

127
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,000
and didn't dare to breathe.

128
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,940
Fortunately, the lotus leaves covered me.

129
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,350
Otherwise...

130
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,890
If that's the case,

131
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,730
that person couldn't find him

132
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,430
so he returned to the tavern.

133
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,720
Did you see that person's face?

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,909
What are you doing?

135
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,909
He just saved you!

136
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,820
No one can save me.

137
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,590
Unless he dies.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,950

139
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,840
There seems to be something around his chest.

140
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,710
Black Rakshasa planned it all along.

141
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,770
Even if we find him,

142
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
we can't save him.

143
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,250
But he wanted the boss to kill you.

144
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,720
He probably isn't counting on him.

145
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,550
Otherwise, he could have done it

146
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,670
when I was unconscious the day before yesterday.

147
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,470
But he didn't.

148
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,700
Then why did he threaten the boss

149
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,900
to take the medicine?

150
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:05,870
Right.

151
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,070
There's no need for him to go to such lengths

152
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,110
just to tease me.

153
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,890
There must be someone behind the scenes

154
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,590
who wants to confuse the public.

155
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,390
It's already the second person.

156
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,500
He's also someone we've come into contact with.

157
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,430
He wants to...

158
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,350
He wants to kill

159
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,550
all the people we save

160
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,210
so that we're completely defeated.

Avoid exchanges?

164
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,690
The next one is Mao.

165
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,470
"Mao" means

166
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,040
someone born in the Year of the Rabbit?

167
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Zhao Ruyi's wife?

168
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,710
Doesn't she live in the west?

169
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,150
After Zhao Ruyi died,

170
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,210
she accepted a job.

171
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,510
Every mid-month,

172
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,310
she delivers medicine to Songqing Pharmacy in the East Market.

173
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,800
Right now, she's in the east.

174
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,350
Hurry.

175
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,450

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
I want to visit Councilor's sister.

177

go back to the Court of Judicial Review immediately.

184

You're looking for Zhao Ruyi?

188
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,080
Unfortunately,

189
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,990
she just left.

190
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,400
But

191
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,840
she should still be at the East Market.

192
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,510
Why?

193
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,110
She said

194
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,350
she wanted to buy something before going back.

195
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,010
What stuff?

196
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,910
Fish, meat, and the sort.

197
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,350
She seems to be planning

198
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,510
to cook today.

199
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,030

200
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,990
does she usually buy her groceries?

201
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,720
The pepper bamboo shoots shop.

202
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,480
Is Zhao Ruyi here?

203
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,640
She just crossed the bridge.

204
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,830
Take it.

205
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,990
We can't search for her like this.

206
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,030
Why don't we wait for her at the East Market's entrance?

207

208
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,630
may appear anywhere.

209
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,590
I'll go search the second floor.

210
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,270
You two, cross the bridge.

211
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,020

223
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,230
He ran away.

224
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,250
Tell me.

225
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,120
Who ordered you to kill?

226
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,910
I-I'm just involved in

227

228
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,110

232
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,350
it wasn't him.

234

235
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,340
It's possible that

236
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,200
they're working together.

237
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,960

He's just a thief. An ordinary thief.

242

I found it on that thief.

This is Zhao Ruyi’s purse.

Black Rakshasa

245
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,750

252
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,530
Yesterday,

253
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,230
I took her to hold a memorial service for her brother,

254
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,290
but we lost each other on our way back.

255
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,110
It was not far from our temple,

256
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,950
so I thought

257
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,470
maybe she'd gone back first

258
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,840
and I went back directly.

259
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,270

00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,450

264
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,050
It was already past curfew last night.

265
00:13:59,050 --> 00:13:59,930
I couldn't go out.

266
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,790
I went to look for her this morning.

267
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,320
But everyone I asked said they didn't see her.

268
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,190
When did you separate yesterday?

269
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,930
After sunset, before curfew.

270
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,920
That's strange.

271
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,030
You're thinking about that too?

272
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,930
If Councilor's sister

273
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,270
were abducted by Black Rakshasa,

274
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,070

275

kill Zhao Ruyi first

277

killing Councilor's sister first?

278

The East Market is bustling with people and carriages.

279
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,200
It's more dangerous to kill on the street.

280

Could there be a mistake

281

in Black Rakshasa's plan?

282
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,150

with Councilor's sister on the first day of next month.

378
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,460
The market would be open that day.

379
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,590
He said he wanted to read more fortunes

380
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,070
to buy candy

381
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,040
for Councilor's sister.

382
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,790
Mr. Yuan.

383
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,280
Chen Shi, come here.

384
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,070
Come here.

385
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,190
What's the matter?

386
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,990
Put this talisman

387
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,920
under your pillow.

388
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,830
It is better than scissors.

389
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,910
I guarantee this will help rid your home of the night-crying kid.

390
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,530
Thank you.

391
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,990
What's the matter?

392
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,340
The Court of Judicial Review's exam is coming up.

393
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,820
Are you confident?

394
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,630
Just so-so.

395
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
How do you know I have an exam?

396
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,990
I...

397
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,140
The exam takes place at this time every year.

398
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,670
Relax.

399
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,310
It doesn't matter if you pass or not.

400
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,840
Exams don't mean anything.

401
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,630
Right?

402
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,370
You can't rely on exams for investigations.

403
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,960
You have a skill.

404
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,030
Look at me.

405
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,790

come and go,

408
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,520
I'd encounter fortune and misfortune.

409
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,030
The Court of Judicial Review still needs my advice

410
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,560
for their investigations.

411
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,440
Mr. Yuan.

412
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,940
I have something to do. I'll get going.

413
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,100
A few days ago,

414
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,580
I found that many children

415
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,350
were singing nursery rhymes.

416
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,540
It was weird.

417
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,670
Look.

418
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,710
I figured it out.

419
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,910
They said, "The cat ate people.

420
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,150
Thieves left empty-handed."

421
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,990
Mr. Yuan,

422
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,220
we’ve already solved that case.

423
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,710
Also,

424
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,620
once I saw a judicial commissioner

425
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,350
of the Court of Judicial Review

426
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,830
with a huge beard.

427
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,080
He looked unfamiliar.

428
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,110
I wonder who he is.

429
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,930
You have to be careful.

430
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,590
If someone were committing crimes by pretending to be

431
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,870
the Court of Judicial Review's official,

432
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,110
that would be bad.

433
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,160
That's not good.

434
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,910
I got it.

435
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,950
Well, I have something to do.

436
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,940
I have to go.

437
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,550
Good luck with the exam.

438
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,720
No matter how it turns out,

439
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,690
on the first day of the next month,

440
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,790
come here with Councilor's sister

441
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,720
to have fun here.

442
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,950
If my business does well on that day,

443
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,590
I'll buy you some candy.

444
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,920
Nice.

445
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,390
Okay, I'm leaving.

446
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,670
Listen to your vice minister.

447
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,470
Don't cause trouble.

448
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,110
You'd be able to stay in the Court of Judicial Review!

449
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,190
Okay. Got it.

450
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,350
Just do good deeds

451
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,990
and do not worry about the future.

452
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,710
Guys.

453
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,870
What we can do now

454
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,420
is not to let Mr. Yuan down

455
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,850
and protect Councilor's sister

456
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,450
to the best of our abilities.

457
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,390
According to the almanac

458
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,470
he left last time,

459
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,000
if he comes again,

460
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,820
it should be

461
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,910
within two hours.

462
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,310
We need

463
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,140
a safe place.

464
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,410
No.

465
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,680
We need two.

466
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,000
A crafty rabbit has three burrows!

467
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,030
Mr. Yuan

468
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,890
earned this chance with his life.

469
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,830
Maybe we can finally

470
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,670
meet this

471
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,630

[Court of Judicial Review]

473
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,590
You...

474
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,950
What's with that look?

475
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,310
You can fool others by dressing up as a woman,

476
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,790
but as a young lady,

477
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,350
it's not quite believable.

478
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,630
Actually,

479
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,870
if you don't talk,

480
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,470
your figure does seem

481
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,470
a little similar.

482
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,630
Most importantly, the hair is similar.

483
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,230
Don't give any suggestions.

484
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,550
If you have more suggestions,

485
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,150
you can dress up and sit here.

486
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,440
Regardless of whether he looks similar or not,

487
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,640
we have no choice now.

488
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,870
It's my turn to catch you.

Nine.

Eight.

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,190
Four.

Three.

Did she go out?

00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,590
It's...

511
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,390
It's been two hours.

512
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,710
Is he coming or not?

513
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,590
Could it be

Let's go.

519
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,000
Hurry up.

520
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,210
I went to the toilet just now

521
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,410
and Chen Shi disappeared when I came back.

522
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,180
I searched the yard

523
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,670
three times,

524
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,590
but I couldn't find him.

525
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,510
So I came to you.

526
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,960
Did Chen Shi say where he was going?

527
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,830
Did you

528
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,270
see anyone else just now?

529
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,480
If anything happens to Chen Shi,

530
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,110
I will never

531
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,110
forgive myself.

532
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,390
Why did Black Rakshasa capture

533
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,480
Chen Shi?

534
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:15,900
One.

535
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:16,940
Two.

536
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,070
Three.

537
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,550
First, you played hide-and-seek

538
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,180
here.

539
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,000
Just now, Councilor's sister

540
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,110
nodded and then shook her head.

541
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,240
What does that mean?

542
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,970
Her mind is like that of a child

543
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,230
and she is also in shock.

544
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,760
We can't take it seriously.

545
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,000
When Sun Bao came to Chen Shi,

546
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,470
he could have even taken the child away.

547
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,510
But he didn't.

548
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,080
He disappeared on the count of ten.

549
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,590
At this time, Vice Minister

550
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,990
can still remain calm

551
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,070
and indifferent?

552
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,630
Vice Minister is not indifferent.

553
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,690
He's trying to figure out a solution.

554
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:09,790

555
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,030
Did you go to see Qiu Qingzhi?

556
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,260
Yes.

557
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,160
He might...

558
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,680
He might be busy celebrating his rewards.

559
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,920
I didn't see him.

560
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,920
It's just human nature.

561
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,210
Is something troubling you, Father?

562
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,030
Is there a case?

563
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,790
I want you

564
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,150
to leave Shendu for a while.

565
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,560
Someone is here.

00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,440
how long it's been since Vice Minister

570
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,370
ate or drank anything?

571
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,270
There are no signs of fighting or blood

572
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:00,950
in the room.

573
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,610
Chen Shi should be fine.

574
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,550
Send her back to the Court of Judicial Review.

575
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,750
I’ll go find Chen Shi.

576
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,440
-Yes.
-Yes.

577
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,760
-Young Miss.
-Young Miss.

578
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,880
Young Miss.

579
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,630
Master doesn't allow you...

580
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,260
I know.

581
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,830
He doesn't allow me to leave the house.

582
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,430
But he didn't say

583
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,150
I couldn't even

584
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,150
leave my own room.

585
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,030
That's true.

586
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,640
Or do you think

587
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,150
I can't even wander around

588
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,280
in my own house?

589
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,620
Of course not.

590
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,550
I'm sorry.

591
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,740
Please forgive me.

592
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:13,950
That's good.

593
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,030
Go

594
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,330
and get back to work.

595
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,230
-Yes.
-Yes.

596
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,070
How dare you

597
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,150
come directly to my house?

598
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,610
I did everything you told me to do.

599
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,469
You have to do your job too.

600
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,230
You're just a prisoner

601
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,630

602
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,550
How dare you threaten an imperial court official?

603
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,070
I'm just doing my job.

604
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,210
Everything has been laid out.

605
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,710
Only one finishing step is left.

606
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,190
What place did you pick?

607
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,179
Under the former Minister's Mansion.

608
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:39,230
You sure know how to pick a place.

609
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,190
Follow me.

610
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,070
You found out everything?

611
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,100
You know Black Rakshasa?

612
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,310
So what?

613
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,260
One almanac for one person.

614
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,620
He's still taking action these days.

615
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,540
You know that too?

616
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,270
I told you

617
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,920
not to touch anything you shouldn't touch.

619
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,350
I have my reasons.

620
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,390
It's about taking people's lives.

621
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,990
What reasons could you have?

622
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,350
Li Bing's father

623
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,800
was also killed by him three years ago.

624
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,070
Don't tell me

625
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
this matter was also ordered by you?

626
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,150
Father.

627
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,390
If you don't say anything,

628
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,320
it means you're acknowledging it.

629
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,790
Father.

630
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,590
What exactly are you doing?

631
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,070
It's none of your business.

634
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,510
Send her back to her room.

635
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,910
She needs to rest.

636
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,150
Father.

637
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,120
Take her away.

Sit here.

642
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,950
Wait for us.

643
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,000
We'll be back soon.

644
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,430
Don't wander around.

645
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,070
Where is Vice Minister?

646
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,130
Have you found him?

647
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,840
Where is the almanac?

648
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,950
Where did you put it?

649
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,230
On the shelf.

650
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,110
Come with me.

651
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,990
I've gathered Black Rakshasa's stuff

652
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,070
all in one place.

653
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,310
I clearly put it in there.

654
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,240
This can't be it!

655
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,030
Give it to me.

656
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,070
Stop looking.

657
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,450
Vice Minister must have taken it.

658
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,350
I think

659
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,030
he went to look for Black Rakshasa

660
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,180
alone.

661
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,150
Why didn’t he

662
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,280
get us to go with him?

663
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,390
Maybe he's afraid that we'll get implicated.

664
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,920
Vice Minister is always like this.

665
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,490
This is not just his own responsibility.

666
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,840
Maybe he has his reasons

667
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,770
and he's afraid we'll be in danger.

668
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:46,990
Let's go.

669
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,270

00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,350
It looks like a bird.

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,780
It looks like a pigeon.

672
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,680
There are words inside.

673
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,470

00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,270
Vice Minister Shangguan asked us to go to

Minister of Rites' Mansion.

687
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,670
How did you know it was Vice Minister Shangguan?

688
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,390
And how could you tell it's the Minister's Mansion?

you used your idioms

with us too.

696
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,590
I made mistakes with these few idioms

697
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,710
and she corrected them.

698
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,150
Then how did you figure out

699
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,810
it's the Minister's Mansion?

Then tell us

706
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,690
what Minister's Mansion means.

00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,480
She knows we're after Black Rakshasa.

708
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,170
It must be related to this.

709
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,720
Black Rakshasa?

is she referring to?

align with Vice Minister Shangguan's temperament.

Since Vice Minister is not here

720
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,230

Why?

728
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,950
She didn't convey such an important message
