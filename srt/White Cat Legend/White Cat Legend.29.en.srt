The murderer is Chen Shi's brother.

194
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,050
Vice Minister has also handed over his seal.

195
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,470
Lai Zhongshu has become the new vice minister.

196
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,470
The Court of Judicial Review was turned upside down

197
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,950
overnight.

198
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,470
I think there's a huge pit that

199
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,670
had already been dug.

200
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,550
Wait, you...

201
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,310
Who are you?

202
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,230
I was ordered by Vice Minister Lai

203
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,750
to ask you to leave the dorm as soon as possible

204
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,830
so that others can use it.

205
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,470
What?

206
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,950
As soon as possible!

207
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,800
Wait!

208
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,750
Aren't you the guy

209
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,210
who helped Lai Zhongshu handle his work?

210
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,030
Why?

211
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,430
Are you here to make a scene at the Court of Judicial Review?

212
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,360
What did you say?

213
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,110
I'm the Court of Judicial Review's judicial commissioner now.

214
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,630
Why should I bother about a mere scribe

215
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,310
like you?

216
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,470
Let me tell you.

217
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,990
The Court of Judicial Review

218
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,920
has a new leader!

219
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,430
Stay if you can

220
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,900
or get lost!

221
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,710
You...

222
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,070
I'm so angry.

223
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,630
The Court of Judicial Review has become his home!

224
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,470
I really want to punch his face

225
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,390
flat!

226
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,710
There's no rush.

227
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,480
These guys...

228
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,670
Mr. Li.

229
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,030
This case is not over yet, right?

230
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,710
Yi Zhi Hua is not my brother.

231
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,410
You still don't know why you became a cat.

232
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,340
They're all lying.

233
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,320
This case is not over indeed.

234
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,910
But you've all become too involved.

235
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,090
We can't do this anymore.

236
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,230
Back then, if

237
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,560
I didn't meet you during the Demon Cat Case

238
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,310
and get acquainted with

239
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,040
the brothers of Mingjing Hall,

240
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,830
I might still be

241
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,630
investigating this case alone.

242
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,510
Then there wouldn't have been so many

243
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,440
repercussions.

244
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,510
It's my fault, Chen Shi.

245
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,150
No.

246
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,990
It's not just

247
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,590
your personal case anymore.

248
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,190
My brother wasn't like this before.

249
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,120
Really.

250
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,110
He wouldn't have become a murderer

251
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,950
for no reason.

252
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,110
That's impossible.

253
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,510
I must find out the truth.

254
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,350
I must!

255
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,750
Chen Shi.

256
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,310
This...

257
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,310
Vice Minister Li.

258
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,030
Li Bing.

259
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,620
Vice Minister Lai.

260
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,480
What happened?

261
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,670
Vice Minister Li.

262
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,150
If you have any prejudice against me,

263
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,150
you can discuss it with Her Majesty.

264
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,350
Why did you ask your men

265
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,590
to do these petty things?

266
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,470
You're crossing the line.

267
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,530
What petty things?

268
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,590
Lai Zhongshu.

269
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,750
Why did you arrest us

270
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,080
when you were beaten up?

271
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,780
Are we the kind who would do something like that?

272
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,950
Do you have evidence?

273
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,430
Also,

274
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,910
why are you involving our vice minister?

275
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,910
Vice Minister Li,

276
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
you should discipline your people.

277
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,930
I don't know anything.

278
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,890
How should I discipline them?

279
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,310
Fine.

280
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,740
By the way, Vice Minister Li,

281
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,350
I remember the Black Rakshasa case

282
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,170
still has some loose ends.

283
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,670
In the Black Rakshasa case,

284
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,530
the first two victims who died...

285
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,330
That foreign woman.

286
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,830
She used to work in Jinwu Guards' prison.

287
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,350
No one knows how she escaped from

288
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,030
Jinwu Guards'

289
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,840
prison.

290
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,160
But at that time,

291
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,870
the two of them

292
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,590
appeared outside the government office

293
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,510
of Jinwu Guards.

294
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,470
And my case file

295
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,670
even went missing.

296
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,300
If we look into it,

297
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,690
the two of them

298
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,830
are very suspicious.

299
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,550
Lai Zhongshu.

300
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,870
You're slandering us!

301
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,790
How dare you!

302
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,590
Wang Qi.

303
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,670
I’ve been very patient with you.

304
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,990
I'm slandering you?

305
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,270
But I have witnesses.

306
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,589
By the way, Vice Minister Li,

307
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,510
I remember the former vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review,

308
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,390
Shangguan Qin,

309
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,430
is also involved in the case

310
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,510
and should have been punished.

311
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,339
But now,

312
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,230
no one knows where she is.

313
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,000
But as far as I know,

314
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,390
they are close.

315
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,550
Is he guilty of

316
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,910
helping her escape?

317
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:27,950
You...

318
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,160
Your imagination is running wild!

319
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Vice Minister Li.

320
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,470
As I said,

321
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,250
I have no evidence.

322
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,950
But I can investigate it.

323
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,990
I am now in charge of Jinwu Guards

324
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,870
and the Court of Judicial Review.

325
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,400
If I keep investigating...

326
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,950
You're a smart man.

327
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,970
Take them away.

328
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,250
Wait.

329
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,530
Vice Minister Lai.

330
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,760
Don't stoop to their level.

331
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,870
Vice Minister Li.

332
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,790
What should I do then?

333
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,900
You guys

334
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,070
didn't consider the big picture

335
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,150
and disobeyed your superior.

336
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,080
How despicable!

337
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,550
From now on,

338
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,950
you are expelled from the Court of Judicial Review!

339
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,590
Vice Minister!

340
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,230
Shut up!

341
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,150
Take off your tokens.

342
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,490
Fine!

343
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,560
I've had enough.

344
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,740
It's not the first time

345
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,870
I've been expelled.

346
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,750
This job is no big deal anyway!

347
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,650
Vice Minister.

348
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,030
Just do good deeds and do not worry about the future.

349
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,230
You told me that.

350
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,470
Now it seems you've forgotten that too.

351
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:33,990
Wait.

352
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,190
Mr. Wang!

353
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,710
Wait, Mr. Li!

354
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,410
Vice Minister Lai.

355
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,470
How did I handle that?

356
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,550
Forget it.

357
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,830
Vice Minister Li,

358
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,920
for your sake,

359
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,080
I'll let them off easy.

360
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,870
But Vice Minister Li,

361
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,410
take care of yourself.

362
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,590
Mr. Li. Mr. Li.

363
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,590
Why did you drive them

364
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,270
away?

365
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,470
I'm doing this for their own good...

366
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,670
and for your own good.

367
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,470
But...

368
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,990
-You...
-You should go too.

369
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,910
Go now.

370
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,550
From tomorrow onwards,

371
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,080
don't show up at the Court of Judicial Review.

372
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,270
Mr. Li.

373
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,950
You still don't understand?

374
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,550
But where do you want me to go?

375
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,070
Wherever!

376
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,730
Go back to where you came from!

377
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,870
Leave Shendu.

378
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,310
This matter is over.

379
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,590
But I still know

380
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,710
your secret.

381
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,110
Then tell others.

382
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,520
No one will believe you.

383
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,830
Go.

384
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,070
Go!

385
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,430
Mr. Li.

386
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,340
Where are you going?

387
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,590
I...

388
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,950
I may have to leave the Court of Judicial Review.

389
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,610
A vacation?

390
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,020
That's good.

391
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,110
After all, you will soon be

392
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,000
the official scribe of the Court of Judicial Review.

393
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,110
It'd be hard to take a leave

394
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,740
then.

395
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,630
Chen Shi.

396
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,690
Congratulations.

397
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,280
Your hard work has paid off.

398
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,390
You really passed the exam. Take it.

399
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,030
Take it.

400
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,400
Chen Shi.

401
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,440
In fact, Vice Minister asked us

402
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,150
to prepare this token

403
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,080
for you long ago.

404
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,790
So that once you've passed the exam,

405
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,880
you'd have it in your hands.

406
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,350
Well,

407
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,560
after Zhiyi

408
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,590
reviewed the exam questions,

409
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,310
as soon as I saw that you passed,

410
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,630
I came to give it to you right away.

411
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,620
[Court of Judicial Review's scribe: Chen Shi]

412
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,630
You

413
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,030
should work hard.

414
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,490
Don't let this title down.

415
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,030
I'll leave you to it then.

416
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
I'll take my rest.

417
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,910
See you.

I'm going to Chen Village.

Chen Village?

456
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,080
The one about 40 miles away?

457
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,640
What a coincidence. It's on my way.

458
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,770
I'll give you a ride.

459
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,700
No need.

460

Thank you.

You look kind.

463
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,780
Take the easy route whenever you can.

464
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,470
Don't be afraid. Come on.

465
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,870
Okay then.

466
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,630
Thank you.

467
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,790
Here.

468
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,580
Help me.

469
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,310
Here.

470
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,150
Let's go.

471
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,550
But I know the evidence

472
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,550
your father found

473
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,600
was kept in the Secret Chamber.

474
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,470
I don't know the exact location,

475
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,030
but I think you

476
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,510
can definitely find it.

477
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,150
Sir.

478
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,200
How about I go down and walk?

479
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,840
Buddy, I'm not busy.

480
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,430
Well,

481
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,840
let's take a rest then.

482
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,390
Don't run!

483
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,410
Stop there!

484
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,190
Stop there!

485
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,390
Tell me.

486
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,190
What did Li Bing ask you to do?

487
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,920
I...

488
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,470
Mr. Wang?

489
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,790
Mr. Sun?

490
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,110
I knew it was you.

491
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,280
You lied to me again!

492
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,160
Who's your Mr. Wang and Mr. Sun?

493
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,470
I'm not patient enough to play house with you.

494
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,030
Tell me!

495
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,630
Good for you, Chen Shi.

496
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,880
We almost made an accidental mistake!

497
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,420
Chen Shi.

498
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,550
I don't mean to scold you,

499
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,910
but you’ve been at the Court of Judicial Review

500
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,110
for quite a while now.

501
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,150
How can you be cheated so easily?

502
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,340
If we hadn't

503
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,270
shown up,

504
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,040
would you have already confessed?

505
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,190
Don't hide it from us anymore.

506
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,190
What did Vice Minister ask you to do?

507
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,400
Why are you shaking your head?

508
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,330
Mr. Li didn't ask me to do anything.

509
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,880
After he kicked you out,

510
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,720
he asked me to leave too.

511
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,750
What?

512
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,350
Chen Shi.

513
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,350
Vice Minister kicked us out,

514
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,390
but he wouldn't have kicked you out.

515
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,990
This must be a sympathy ploy.

516
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,510
Tell me.

517
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,190
What should we investigate?

518
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,980
Yes, what should we investigate?

519
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,870
I'm really not lying.

520
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,550
Mr. Li asked me...

521
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,830
to leave Shendu.

522
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,270
What?

523
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,880
Chen Shi wouldn't lie.

524
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,320
What he said is all true.

525
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,630
How is that possible?

526
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,790
Does Vice Minister want us to

527
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,850
separate for good?

528
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,150
But I promised Vice Minister Shangguan.

529
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,350
I’m going to break...

530
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,000
break my promise.

531
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,950
Chen Shi.

532
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,390
Before you left,

533
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,180
did Vice Minister really not tell you

534
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,380
what he's going to do?

535
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,570
Even if Vice Minister kicked you out,

536
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,830
you wouldn't have left easily.

537
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,230
Do you

538
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,910
have your own plan?

539
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,510
I have...

540
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,340
I have a clue to investigate.

541
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,550
What clue?

542
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,230
My brother,

543
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,480
that is Black Rakshasa,

544
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,510
once wrote a letter to me.

545
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,000
He asked me to go home right before he died.

546
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,550
I doubt

547
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,170
he'd have said that for no reason.

548
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,800
Where is your hometown?

549
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,990
Chen Village.

550
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,700
Chen Village?

551
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,630
Since we have a clue,

552
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,400
we have to keep investigating.

553
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,390
Since Jinwu Guards sent people

554
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,450
to follow Chen Shi,

555
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,670
they must be prepared

556
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,730
for the variables.

557
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,150
I just interrogated them.

558
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:34,830
Those two guys

559
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,890
would send a letter

560
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,810
to Jinwu Guards every four hours.

561
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,750
If anything goes wrong,

562
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,230
Jinwu Guards will be alerted.

563
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,560
This Lai Zhongshu

564
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,120
is really scheming.

565
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,200
How about this?

566
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,000
Let's split up.

567
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,810
I,

568
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,470
Cui Bei,

569
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,150
and Chen Shi

570
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,190
will go to Chen Village.

571
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,500
Yes.

572
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,070
Let's

573
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,670
go here,

574
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,500
to Chen Village.

575
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,630
Sun Bao and Alibaba.

576
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,080
Send the letter to Jinwu Guards on time

577
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,510
and lure them away,

578
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,430
as far as possible.

579
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,790
Okay.

580
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,490
After that,

581
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,790
go to the Court of Judicial Review immediately

582
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,790
and coordinate with Vice Minister.

583
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,270
After we find the clues,

584
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,310
we will gather in Shendu.

585
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,750
In two days.

586
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:10,470
Two days.

587
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,070
No problem. Two days.

588
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,230
Okay.

589
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:21,510
Okay!

590
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,600
Chen Shi.

591
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:03,710
What was written

592
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,170
in your brother's letter?

593
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,710
I don't know.

594
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:07,950
I was illiterate.

595
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,700
My friend told me

596
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,990
to find him in Shendu.

597
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,990
Find him in Shendu?

598
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,800
Why is there no road ahead?

599
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,200
Come down.

600
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,930
Come with me.

601
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,230
Well...

602
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,270
Let's go down.

603
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,150
Come on.

604
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,780
Let's go.

605
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,650
Chen Shi, you...

606
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,440
Chen Shi, you...

607
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,490
Why is your village

608
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,630
so remote?

609
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,490
A letter could even be sent to

610
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,620
such a remote place?

611
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,550
How long more do we have to go?

612
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,480
Not much longer.

613
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,390
What's wrong?

614
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,510
What's wrong?

615
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,239
I don't know.

616
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,239
Chen Shi.

617
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,310
What's wrong?

618
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,590
Be careful.

619
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,469
Its an animal trap

620
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,800
set up by the villagers.

621
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,810
Be careful.

622
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:24,909
Its legs!

623
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,310
Open up the clamp.

624
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,949
Come on. One, two, up.

625
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:28,710
Up.

626
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,659
All right.

627
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,219
Let me see.

628
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,389
It's fine.

629
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,719
It's just a scratch.

630
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:35,989
Here.

631
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,699
Hurry up.

632
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:40,949
Here.

633
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,620
It's okay.

634
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:47,870
Be good.

635
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,429
Be good.

636
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:49,670
It's okay.

637
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,880
Give it to me.

638
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,430
It's okay.

639
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,120
Chen Shi!

640
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,380
You scared me.

641
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,160
I thought there was a beast.

642
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,590
I'll release it.

643
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,700
W-Who is it?

644
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,690
Who released the rabbit I caught?

645
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,750
Datang!

646
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,590
Chen Shi?

647
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,310
It's me.

648
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,470
It's family.

649
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,190
It's family.

650
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,400
We are Chen Shi’s friends

651
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,550
from the Court of Judicial Review.

652
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,210
The Court of Judicial Review?

653
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:33,500
Chen Shi.

654
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,350
Why did you come back?

655
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,650
I-I'm here to look for letters...

656
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,710
to see if my brother

657
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,190
sent me anything.

658
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,070
Chen Jiu?

659
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,950
His stuff is long gone.

660
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,590
Gone?

661
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,840
Chen Shi.

662
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,400
Datang.

663
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,790
I know you must have read

664
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,430
the letter my brother sent me.

665
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,510
That letter is really important.

666
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,170
What does it have to do with me?

667
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,230
You and your brother

668
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,960
are no longer from Chen Village.

669
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,420
All of you,

670
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,150
leave Chen Village right away!

671
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,030
Chen Shi.

672
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,750
Was that your brother?

673
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,750
Who the heck is he?

674
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:11,920
He shot the arrow carelessly.

675
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,520
He almost shot me in the head.

676
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,310
Sorry.

677
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:15,920
Chen Shi.

678
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,350
What should we do now?

679
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,590
What should we do?

680
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,350
General.

681
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,110
General.

682
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:03,830
Tell me.

683
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,410
Should I save you?

684
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,170
Let's find a place to stay first.

685
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,950
It's getting dark.

686
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,360
I don't know what we'll encounter.

687
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,040
Hurry up.

688
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,990
Let's go.

689
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,740
How long more do we have to go?

690
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,870
We're almost there.

691
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,320
Where can we stay here?

692
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,270
Let's go.

693
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,070
We're here!

694
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,320
Over there!

695
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:43,870
Hurry up.

696
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,930
Hurry up, Mr. Wang.

697
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,550
Hurry up.

698
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,950
S-Step on this.

699
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,050
Be careful.

700
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,950
Come on.

701
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,680
Chen Shi.

702
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,790
There is a house in this tree.

703
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,160
It's quite unusual.

704
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,160
This is where I used to live.

705
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,790
In ancient times, there were many animals and few people.

706
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,830
So the people lived in nests to avoid them.

707
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,840
Picking up acorns and chestnuts in the day and perching on trees at night.

708
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,790
Therefore, it is said

709
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,650
there are nest-dwelling people.

710
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,750
When the weather is good,

711
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,750
when the sun is about to set,

712
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,320
you could see the smoke in the village.

713
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,180
My brother often watched it here.

714
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,310
Chen Shi.

715
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,590
Then why did you live in the tree?

716
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,390
There are many wild beasts here.

717
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,520
Our village is full of hunters.

718
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,350
Hunters?

719
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,350
Our ancestors escaped to here.

720
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,810
There is no land in the mountains.

721
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,880
We can only hunt.

722
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,510
It has been passed down from generation to generation.

723
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,840
We are all good hunters.

724
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,150
But I don't know how to hunt.

725
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,990
I can't bear to do it.

726
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,350
They chased you out of the village

727
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,950
just because you don't know how to hunt?

728
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,710
No, no.

729
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,550
My brother didn't like living in the village either.

730
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,070
Then...

731
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,270
Then why?

732
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,490
My parents died early.

733
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,230
Except me,

734
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,910
my brother

735
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,000
didn't want to deal with other people.

736
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,510
Besides, living in the mountains

737
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,190
was convenient for hunting.

738
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,710
Then

739
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,010
Black Rakshasa...

740
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,290
What kind of person

741
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,350
is Chen Jiu?

742
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,810
My brother is a good hunter.

743
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,410
He was born with it.

744
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,070
Datang said

745
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,550
my brother only cared about his prey,

746
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,410
and not humans.

747
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,110
They said my brother is like a beast,

748
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,030
like a lone wolf.

749
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,520
But I don't think so.

750
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,280
My brother had always been nice to me.

751
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,630
Is Datang

752
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,230
the one who shot me with an arrow?

753
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,990
Datang is the village head now.

754
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,630
If my brother sent a letter,

755
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,030
the letter must be with Datang.

756
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,840
Forget it.

757
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,740
We've been traveling all day.

758
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,480
I'm exhausted.

759
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
Let's rest early.

760
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,080
Chen Shi.

761
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,390
You...

762
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,950
don't think too much.

763
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,310
Eat and drink when you should.

764
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,970
Don't take anything to heart.

765
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,150
Where do we sleep?

766
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,910
Let me prepare it for you.

767
