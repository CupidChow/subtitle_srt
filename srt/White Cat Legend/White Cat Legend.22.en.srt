[Episode 22]

4
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,330
Everyone, go home.

5
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,390
We're closed today.

6
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:52,910
Sorry, guys.

7
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,509
How can you just turn us away?

8
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,550
We're all regular customers.

9
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,950
We really can't sell any salt to you.

10
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,910
We're closed.

11
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,350
Please come another day.

12
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,500
Guys, go home.

13
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,470
We need salt.

14
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,650
You can survive a day

15
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,710
without salt.

16
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,270
Go home. Go home.

17
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,110
Guys, go home.

18
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,350
-Guys, go home.
-Go back.

19
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,880
Officer.

20
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,270
Officer. Officer.

21
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,840
You finally came, officer.

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,450
This way.

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,070
Mr. Li.

24
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,640
Officer.

25
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,440
You guessed right.

26
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,390
She was buried in salt here

27
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,430
when we found her.

28
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,610
Did she commit suicide, or was she murdered?

29
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,210
Given the direction and pattern of the wounds,

30
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,900
I don't think she sliced herself.

31
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,110
If she had done it to herself,

32
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,040
the wounds would have been neater.

33
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,329
Did she get smothered

34
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,250
in salt?

35
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,150
Sir,

36
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,960
do you know this woman?

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,890
Is she your…

38
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,410
Officer,

39
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,790
don't talk nonsense.

40
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,840
My wife

41
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,130
is very jealous.

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,660
I've never seen this woman before.

43
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,370
In my opinion,

44
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,570
she might have come to steal salt.

45
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,310
People nearby

46
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,730
all come here to buy salt.

47
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,790
I haven't seen her recently.

48
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,950
She definitely didn't live nearby.

49
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,390
If she was a salt thief,

50
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,190
why did she come all the way here?

51
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,080
Well,

52
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,310
then someone did it for revenge.

53
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,550
Officer,

54
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,770
many people are jealous of me now.

55
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,850
Maybe someone killed her and dumped her body here

56
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,650
to ruin my business.

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,850
Perhaps

58
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,560
you colluded with the murderer.

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,670
If you had closed the door and windows,

60
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,329
this wouldn't have happened.

61
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,310
Manager.

62
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,380
I locked the door,

63
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,900
and the key has always been on me.

64
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,110
Stop lying.

65
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,590
It has nothing to do with him.

66
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,850
It has nothing to do with the door either.

67
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,310
Officer,

68
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,540
what do you mean?

69
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,100
She didn't commit suicide.

70
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,060
Nor was she killed and dumped here.

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,040
She climbed in through the back window.

72
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,070
That's…

73
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,910
That's so high.

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,590
How did she get up there?

75
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,570
Why did she trap herself inside?

76
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,430
Maybe someone was chasing her,

77
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,290
and she had to climb through the window.

78
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,840
Don't you see the ladder?

79
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,630
There's blood on the floor.

80
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,670
Trinkets for sale. Come and take a look.

81
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,870
Look at this.

82
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,710
Stop looking.

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,960
What?

84
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,230
This is the most densely populated place

85
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,070
in Shendu.

86
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,920
Even if there had been more blood,

87
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,260
the passing carriages and horses this morning

88
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,260
would have made it unidentifiable.

89
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,740
You guys,

90
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,220
go ask the neighbors about it.

91
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,690
Chen Shi, go back with me for an autopsy.

92
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,150
Yes.

93
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,900
-Yes.
-Yes.

94
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,570
Let's go.

95
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,220
I told you.

96
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,360
Every time my eyelids twitch,

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,350
a death will be reported.

98
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,880
Go get it.

99
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,190
The cat ate people.

100
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,670
Thieves left empty-handed.

101
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,830
The medicine failed.

102
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,390
Blood filled the cup.

103
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,310
Wait.

104
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,060
What were you singing?

105
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,590
Don't be afraid.

106
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,630
I'm just curious

107
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,800
about the nursery rhyme you just sang.

108
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,880
The cat ate people.

109
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,630
Thieves left empty-handed.

110
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,310
The medicine failed.

111
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,270
Blood filled the cup.

112
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,320
What did he say?

113
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:01,750
It's…

114
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:02,780
It's…

115
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,920
It's…

116
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,390
It's absurd

117
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,230
and crazy.

118
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,750
What's wrong?

119
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,030
It's impossible.

120
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,070
Just tell us what he said.

121
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,910
You may not believe what I'm going to say.

122
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,570
Isn't it just a nursery rhyme?

123
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,130
The cat ate people.

124
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,950
Thieves left empty-handed.

125
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,020
The medicine failed.

126
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,910
Blood filled the cup.

127
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,190
Doesn't it

128
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,780
remind you of the cases we solved?

129
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,300
Don't read into it.

130
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,230
It just means

131
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,420
Mingjing Hall

132
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,820
is very famous now.

133
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,060
We're that famous?

134
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,940
Of course.

135
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,060
Then what's the meaning of "Blood filled the cup"?

136
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,630
It's a nursery rhyme.

137
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,390
Many of its lyrics

138
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,870
are made up.

139
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,470
All the old nursery rhymes

140
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,300
I read

141
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,470
were prophecies.

142
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,430
Could "Blood filled the cup"

143
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,720
be something

144
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,610
we'd face next?

145
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,190
Don't jink it.

146
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,070
Who taught those children that nursery rhyme?

147
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,820
I don't know.

148
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,640
That boy said

149
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,630
he heard it

150
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,870
from other children.

151
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,190
Should we tell Vice Minister Li

152
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,800
to make him worry about it?

153
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,150
You can't be serious.

154
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,270
Vice Minister Li wouldn't want

155
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,430
to hear your groundless theory.

156
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,670
You must be joking.

157
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,930
Bai.

158
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,610
Vice Minister.

159
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,240
I've cleaned her up.

160
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,990
Why is her skin so pale?

161
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,650
Is it because of the salt?

162
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,640
I don't think so.

163
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,930
Her blood was drained.

164
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,840
Back in the salt shop,

165
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,630
I couldn't examine her body with so many people around.

166
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,380
This woman

167
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,440
didn't die of suffocation.

168
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,100
The cuts on her wrist

169
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,750
caused excessive bleeding.

170
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,670
She went limp,

171
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,280
fainted on the salt,

172
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,710
and died there.

173
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,990
Are these tissues

174
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,630
on her hand calluses?

175
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,710
What kind of tools did she often use?

176
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,630
Needles.

177
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,180
Scissors.

178
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,390
This is a piece of patchwork.

179
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,150
Is this the new fashion trend?

180
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,930
No.

181
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,710
Maybe she just sewed together what she had.

182
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,910
So she was a tailor.

183
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,890
Chen Shi.

184
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,720
Ask Cui Bei to draw a portrait of the victim

185
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,510
and ask the nearby tailors about her.

186
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,030
Yes.

187
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,330
Sir.

188
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,000
Another death is reported.

189
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,120
Just like the woman who died in the salt shop,

190
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,950
she doesn't have any other wounds on her body

191
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,550
except the cuts on her wrist.

192
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,780
How did you find her?

193
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,470
I'm a storyteller at the tea house.

194
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,150
The tea house was closed this morning.

195
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,280
I wanted to know why,

196
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,630
so I came to the back room and went upstairs.

197
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,490
Then I found her

198
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,060
lying here.

199
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,570
Vice Minister.

200
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,710
We heard about this death

201
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,590
once we went back. So we hurried over.

202
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,960
We asked around along the way.

203
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,550
The victim is called Madam Wang.

204
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,480
She was the owner of this tea house.

205
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,710
Behind the tea house,

206
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,170
there's no sign of a chase.

207
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,860
Nobody saw Madam Wang again

208
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,180
after she closed the tea house yesterday.

209
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,310
This case is exactly like

210
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,590
the case this morning.

211
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,720
The murderer could've just killed them.

212
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,110
Why did he cut their wrists

213
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,370
to make them bleed out?

214
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,710
We'll investigate the two cases together.

215
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,630
-Yes.
-Yes.

216
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,590
Excuse me.

217
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,030
Do you know this person?

218
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,310
Have you seen Madam Wang from the tea house?

219
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,040
Have you had dealings with her?

220
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,430
No.

221
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,670
Please take a closer look.

222
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,560
Think hard.

223
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,020
It just doesn't ring a bell.

224
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,940
Officer.

225
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,330
This is a noodle stall.

226
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,910
People come and go every day.

227
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,910
I'm too busy

228
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,840
running my stall

229
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,850
to mind my neighbor's business.

230
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,360
Then why did you stare at her portrait for so long?

231
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,080
She looks pretty.

232
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,770
Do you know anyone who had a grudge

233
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,420
against Madam Wang?

234
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,430
She sold tea

235
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,090
and was a matchmaker.

236
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,730
She knew a lot of people.

237
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,330
I don't know.

238
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,450
We didn't get any useful information.

239
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,230
Mr. Wang.

240
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,310
Mr. Wang.

241
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,070
Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang.

242
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,390
Mr. Li is at the tailor's in the alley.

243
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,120
Come with me.

244
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,270
These are all high-end fabrics.

245
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,580
Looks like her business was good.

246
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,000
The victim's name is Zhao Erniang.

247
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,970
She owned this tailor shop.

248
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,150
This shop has been empty for days.

249
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,980
Three days.

250
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,750
Mr. Li, how do you know that?

251
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,650

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,050
It's…

256
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,070
What's wrong?

257
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,710
She didn't put away

258
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,230
the unfinished clothes.

259
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,750
She must have left in a hurry.

260
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,070
Whose clothes are these?

261
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,770
They don't have a name tag.

262
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,910
The person who can wear these clothes

263
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,670
is nearly 2 meters tall.

264
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,800
There's no name tag on the clothes.

265
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,770
I don't think they're for a customer.

266
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,970
They should be for someone close to her.

267
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,660
Vice Minister.

268
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,790
We've asked around.

269
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,950
No one has noticed anything odd

270
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,790
with Zhao Erniang in the past few days.

271
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,780
The same goes for Madam Wang.

272
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,570
The murderer is so mysterious.

273
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,620
He must have planned for a long time

274
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,020
to leave no trace behind.

275
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,360

the murderer

277
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,270
knew the two of them very well?

278
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,050
I've talked with people nearby.

279

If they find anything,

had any dealings with Madam Wang.

Mr. Li.

00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,510
Do you think

288
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,270
that Mr. Wang and the others

289
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,530
were a bit weird today?

290
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,590
Were they?

291
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,930
Why do you think so?

292
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,500
They were lethargic

293
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,080
and didn't joke around.

294
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,470
Maybe it's because the cases lately

295
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,200
are too grave and complicated.

296
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,470

It's understandable that they're tired.

After seeing the dark side of the world,

300
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,190
they've naturally become heavy-hearted.

301

where a young woman was found dead

312
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,750

to the tailor shop for these worthless things.

385
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,830
You went there on a whim

386
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,080
after you heard about her death, right?

387
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,540
It was not illegal, was it?

388
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,050
Do you know anyone

389
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,900
who had a grudge against your mother?

390
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,950
Let me tell you.

391
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,830
Niu Er from the gambling house on North Street

392
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,190
had a quarrel with her

393
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,790
because I owed him money.

394
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,500
Officer.

395
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,210
Can I leave now?

396
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,180
Yes.

397
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,110
Officer.

398
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,270
When you see Niu Er,

399
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,800
don't tell him you met me.

400
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,070
He…

401
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,390
What a scumbag.

402
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,480
Sir.

403
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,510
Zhao Xun owed me money.

404
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,089
He should've paid me back last month.

405
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,790
Since it was Zhao Xun who owed you money,

406
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,369
why did you go to Zhao Erniang?

407
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,030
She was Zhao Xun's guarantor.

408
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,720
Zhao Xun has been missing for half a month.

409
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,780
Naturally, we went to his guarantor.

410
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,700
But you shouldn't have forced her.

411
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,520
Zhao Erniang vouched for

412
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,500
Zhao Xun of her own accord.

413
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,790
We didn't force her.

414
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,210
Look at this if you don't believe me.

415
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,750
This is the IOU.

416
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,150
Officer, are you suspecting that I killed her?

417
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,910
I only want people's money,

418
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,130
never their lives.

419
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:47,840
I mean it.

420
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,400
Besides,

421
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,910
she paid me back

422
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,990
half a month ago.

423
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,510
Why would I have killed her?

424
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,060
Am I right?

425
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,920
Vice Minister.

426
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,870
Vice Minister.

427
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,790
People at the tavern said

428
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,090
he was drinking all night that night

429
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,760
and stayed in the tavern after curfew.

430
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,870
He didn't leave until the next morning.

431
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,930
He didn't have time to kill Zhao Erniang.

432
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,490
Okay.

433
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,630
You can go now.

434
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,220
Sir, you're so sensible.

435
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,860
Chen Shi.

436
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,330
How familiar are you with the laws?

437
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,480
You lent three taels to Zhao Xun

438
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,750
and asked him to return five taels

439
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,310
in 20 days.

440
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,720
The interest was more than 5%.

441
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,710
According to the laws,

442
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,370
you should be flogged 20 times

443
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,230
or be fined.

444
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,130
Make your choice.

445
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:56,710
I…

446
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,710
I choose to pay the fine.

447
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,280
I'll pay the fine.

448
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,940
Five taels of silver.

449
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,430
That was a lot of money.

450
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,190
Vice Minister.

451
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,870
According to a neighbor who knew Zhao Erniang,

452
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,830
after spending almost all her savings

453
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,910
on that tailor shop,

454
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,550
she didn't have much money left.

455
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,190
The market price of a winter garment

456
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,050
is 50 wen. That of a summer garment

457
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,200
is 20 wen.

458
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,590
Let's say she could make ten garments every month.

459
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,580
Minus the cost of fabrics, she could only earn several hundred wen.

460
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,070
She couldn't put away five taels of silver

461
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,130
even in half a year.

462
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,590
Then she must've found another solution.

463
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,120
Let's go.

464
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,080
Do you know her?

465
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,590
This is Zhao Erniang, isn't it?

466
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,030
She's made over 20 pieces of clothing

467
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,230
for me.

468
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:48,840
Well,

469
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,210
did she borrow money from you?

470
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,090
No.

471
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,470
I never heard that she was short of money.

472
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,110
The clothes she made

473
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,230
were exquisitely embroidered

474
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,360
and well-designed.

475
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,000
They were also stylish.

476
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,030
But I haven't visited her shop in a long time.

477
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,960
I can't give you more information.

478
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,790
When she came to deliver clothes to me,

479
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,910
I didn't have enough money to pay her, but she just let it slide.

480
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,830
When was that?

481
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,130
At the end of last month.

482
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,670
Do you remember

483
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,650
what day it was?

484
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,120
No.

485
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,410
But I'm sure Zhao Erniang remembered it.

486
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,340
She always kept her bookkeeping

487
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,660
up to date.

488
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,150
Yes.

489
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,300
This is the ledger.

490
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,070
You can check it.

491
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,390
Did Zhao Erniang keep the accounts herself?

492
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,770
Why is the handwriting different?

493
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,670
Her apprentice did.

494
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,390
When

495
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,670
I went to buy clothes,

496
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,260
her apprentice was keeping accounts.

497
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,790
I thought Zhao Erniang

498
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,920
ran that shop alone.

499
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,310
She did.

500
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,590
But she used

501
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,960
to have an apprentice named Sun Xiaoying.

502
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,960
That girl was a peasant,

503
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,290
but she was very handy.

504
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,430
Her father

505
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,230
sent her here to learn sewing skills.

506
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,110
She was smart,

507
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,350
and in just a few months,

508
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,270
her embroidery

509
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,730
was as great as Erniang's.

510
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,310
She embroidered this dress.

511
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,430
Indeed.

512
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,830
It's different from the clothes

513
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,490
in Zhao Erniang's shop.

514
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,420
Where is she now?

515
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,630
Zhao Erniang told me

516
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,720
she got married a while ago.

517
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,890
Both her parents died,

518
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,570
and she left in a hurry.

519
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,670
I wonder

520
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,230
who arranged her marriage.

521
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,510
When did she leave?

522
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,240
About half a month ago.

523
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,270
It was also half a month ago

524
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,390
when Zhao Erniang returned the money to Niu Er.

525
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,750
Wang Qi. Sun Bao.

526
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,920
I've got something!

527
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,430
Here.

528
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,030
Thank you, madam.

529
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,100
Thank you, madam. Thank you.

530
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,040
Hurry up.

531
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,680
Stop shouting.

532
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,670
Madam Wang, the owner of the tea house,

533
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,030
worked secretly as a human trafficker.

534
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,940
She had a house

535
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,470
where she locked girls.

536
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,340
Sun Xiaoying.

537
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,430
She was the connection

538
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,190
between Madam Wang and Zhao Erniang.

539
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,590
Come.

540
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,750
Let's go find that house with Vice Minister Li.

541
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,630
Let's go.

542
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,710
Thank you.

543
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,590
Someone told me

544
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,000
Sun Xiaoying worked for Zhao Erniang

545
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,630
for half a year.

546
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,510
It seems that she had been with Zhao Erniang

547
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,440
since she opened the shop.

548
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,500
Zhao Erniang desperately needed money

549
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,490
to pay Zhao Xun's debt.

550
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,950
Her female apprentice was parentless.

551
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,070
From the looks of it,

552
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,480
it's highly possible

553
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,740
that she sold Xiaoying to Madam Wang.

554
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,790
Zhao Xun

555
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,970
never mentioned Sun Xiaoying.

556
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,830
He must have been holding out on us.

557
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,710
Then it was Sun Xiaoying

558
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,630
who killed Madam Wang and Zhao Erniang?

559
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,230
After she was sold,

560
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,330
she came back to take revenge on them.

561
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,520
That girl is so cruel.

562
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,210
She not only killed them

563
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,750
but also drained them of their blood.

564
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,790
Let's go check it out.

565
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,720
-Yes.
-Let's go.

566
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,560
Madam Wang chose a good place.

567
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,770
Even if the girls escaped,

568
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,630
they'd have nowhere to hide

569
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,830
and nobody to turn to.

570
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,600
Vice Minister, let me do it.

571
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,040
It's so big.

572
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,350
If she wanted to,

573
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,310
she could keep a dozen girls here.

574
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,280
I don't think she'd do that.

575
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,940
Too many people would make management too hard.

576
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,790
People in this line of business

577
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,280
usually keep clear accounts

578
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,110
to ensure

579
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:22,980
their safety.

580
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,570
Let's split up to look for the ledger.

581
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,030
Yes.

582
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,470
Yes.

583
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,070
Yes.

584
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,430
If she thought

585
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,900
this house was very safe,

586
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,990
she wouldn't spend much time

587
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,780
hiding it.

588
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,430
It should be either near at hand or…

589
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,760
Here it is.

590
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,660
It's here. It's here.

591
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,590
[June 3rd, paid the carpenter Ding Guangyi 240 wen]

592
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,000
[18th, cleared a debt and paid the tea merchant Zhu Chen…]

593
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,000
[25th, paid Zhao Erniang…]

594
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,070
S-Sun…

595
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,150
Sun Xiaoying.

596
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,590
So,

597
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,310
this is the buyer.

598
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,190
[18th, cleared a debt and paid the tea merchant Zhu Chen…]

599
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,190
[25th, paid Zhao Erniang…]

600
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,630
I did

601
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,510
go to Madam Wang to pick girls.

602
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,430
She had

603
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,670
two pretty girls for sale.

604
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,500
But I didn't buy them.

605
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,070
You didn't buy them?

606
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,090
I wanted to,

607
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,150
and we agreed on a price,

608
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,500
but unexpectedly,

609
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,500
she changed her mind at the last minute.

610
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,750
Changed her mind?

611
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,480
Why did she change her mind?

612
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,540
Someone offered a higher price.

613
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,140
But you look rich.

614
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,610
I can't deny that,

615
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,070
but I was not dead-set

616
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,560
on buying those two girls.

617
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,670
Madam Wang offered me

618
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,110
compensation.

619
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,270
The compensation

620
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,930
was enough to buy three girls.

621
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,790
So I just let it go.

622
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,870
Do you know

623
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,760
to whom those two girls were sold?

624
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,440
That's none of my business.

625
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,200
However,

626
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,070
whoever bought them was so unlucky.

627
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,900
I heard

628
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,150
that those two girls

629
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:47,880
ran away.

630
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,190
It appears that

631
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,430
[Justice Hall]

632
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,870
after Sun Xiaoying ran away,

633
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,990
she found those two women and bled them out

634
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,770
for revenge.

635
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,590
But

636
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,380
it's strange that she killed them by bleeding them out.

637
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,730
If she just wanted revenge,

638
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,710
she didn't have to go to such lengths.

639
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,650
Besides,

640
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,790
a young woman once died in Shendu

641
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,470
in the same way.

642
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,190
I have the feeling

643
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,180
that this case

644
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,960
is related to that old case.

645
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,780
Sun Xiaoying

646
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,640
was not in Shendu two years ago.

647
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,120
She can't be responsible for the old case.

648
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,280
Sun Xiaoying had associations

649
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,340
with both victims.

650
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,760
She had the motive

651
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,950
and was familiar with both crime scenes.

652
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,090
From the looks of it,

653
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,170
she's the key to solving the case.

654
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,110
Gosh.

655
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,230
Shendu is so big.

656
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,380
It's not easy

657
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,060
to find a girl.

658
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,190
She's not alone, is she?

659
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,750
If I remember correctly, she ran away

660
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,910
with another girl.

661
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,630
I checked every name

662
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,090
on Madam Wang's name list.

663
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,270
Except for Sun Xiaoying,

664
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,880
all the other women are slaves.

665
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,350
It's hard for them to leave the city.

666
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,610
Hard to leave the city.

667
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,400
If you were her,

668
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,510
what would you do?

669
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,840
Hide

670
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,710
and bide my time until I get a chance to leave the city.

671
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,540
Where would you hide?

672
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,740
Somewhere familiar.

673
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,270
The most dangerous place

674
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,440
is the safest place.

675
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,910
One in Yongtai District.

676
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,910
Two in Liren District.

677
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,960
One in Zhengping District.

678
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,990
One in Renhe District.

679
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,050
Plus the tea house,

680
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,280
Madam Wang

681
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,830
had six houses in total.

682
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,510
She was like a cunning rabbit…

683
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,510
With many burrows.

684
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:16,940
Vice Minister.

685
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,510
We've searched the tea house and the house in Yongtai District.

686
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,510
There are four houses left.

687
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,830
Don't bother to search all of them.

688
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,230
Among those four houses,

689
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,710
the one in Renhe District is the closest to the city gate.

690
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,170
It's the best hiding spot.

691
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,040
Let's go.

692
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,680
We'll go there first.

693
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,050
-Okay.
-Okay.

694
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,790
This place is so remote.

695
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,640
No wonder the houses here are unoccupied.

696
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,360
Split up.

697
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:47,710
Yes.

698
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,270
Yes.

699
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,610
No one's here.

700
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,950
Mr. Li.

701
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,390
So many berries.

702
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,640
They're so fresh.

703
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,680
Chen Shi.

704
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,320
Look.

705
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,310
Vice Minister.

706
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,440
There are no signs of anyone living here.

707
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,080
That room is empty.

708
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,740
Could she have left the city?

709
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,490
The barn is empty, but there is straw in the trough.

710
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,590
There is also some straw

711
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,990
in the corner of the yard.

712
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,220
And the wild berries in the yard

713
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,180
-Look.
-have been picked.

714
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:53,990
No.

715
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,760
She should still be here.

716
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,180
If I were on the run,

717
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,920
I wouldn't dare to live in a house

718
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,890
or sleep on a bed

719
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,860
with covers.

720
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,810
I'd be scared and nervous.

721
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,630
Only corners

722
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,230
that can't be easily noticed

723
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,590
would make me feel safe.

724
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,710
You're Liu

725
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,770
who escaped from Madam Wang's place?

726
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,270
Don't be afraid.

727
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,810
We won't send you back.

728
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,290
Madam Wang is dead.

729
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,780
Really?

730
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,990
Sun Xiaoying

731
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,570
escaped

732
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,670
with you.

733
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,020
Do you know where she is now?

734
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,910
We suspect that she killed Madam Wang.

735
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,640
Impossible.

736
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,390
She wouldn't have done such a thing.

737
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,360
You sound very sure.

738
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,280
What's your reason?

739
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,710
One can't fake

740
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,930
one's involuntary reaction.

741
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,660
Mr. Li is not a bad guy.

742
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,830
Neither are we.

743
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,530
You can tell us what you know.

744
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,550
Actually,

745
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,040
Ying failed to escape.

746
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,820
Can you be more specific?

747
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,310
After I was sold to Madam Wang,

748
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,420
I was locked up with Xiaoying.

749
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,100
One day,

750
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,870
Madam Wang seemed to have found

751
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,910
a suitable buyer.

752
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,360
She wanted to show us to him

753
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,090
and took us out.

754
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,770
Where did she take you?

755
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,200
I don't know.

756
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,480
She had our eyes covered.

757
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,920
We walked for about thirty minutes.

758
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,110
I vaguely remember

759
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,670
being brought to a brothel.

760
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,120
I heard laughter

761
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,160
and music from the hall.

762
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,790
I also heard crying from a room.

763
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,350
[Sun Xiaoying] [Liu]

764
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,130
We'll get out of here sooner or later.

765
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,690
Take your pick.

766
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,300
How did he choose

767
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,630
which girl to take away?

768
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,790
It was strange.

769
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:18,990
I've never seen a buyer

770
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,250
pick girls like he did.

771
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,220
Good.

772
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,310
I'll take

773
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,930
the last two girls.

774
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,120
He picked girls by smelling them.

775
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,860
Girls are not food

776
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,130
that may go bad.

777
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,510
Why did he smell them?

778
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,020
You just said

779
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,780
Sun Xiaoying failed to escape.

780
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,400
What does that mean?

781
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,470
After leaving the brothel,

782
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,790
we were led into a carriage

783
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,050
with our eyes covered.

784
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,650
Someone followed us all the way.

785
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,790
He grabbed my dress

786
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,620
and dragged me off the carriage.

787
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,940
My wounds

788
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,620
were caused at that time.

789
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,040
Someone snatched you away.

790
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,100
Who was it?

791
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,740
It was too dark,

792
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,850
and that guy was wearing a mask.

793
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,380
I couldn't see him clearly.

794
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,530
I only remember that

795
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,890
when he saw my face,

796
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,220
he looked surprised

797
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,740
and disappointed.

798
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,760
He wanted to chase after the carriage,

799
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,960
but the carriage had gone too far.

800
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,080
You mean

801
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,900
someone came to save Sun Xiaoying

802
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,540
but saved you by mistake?

803
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,630
Are you sure it was a man?

804
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,240
He left after realizing

805
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,270
he saved the wrong girl,

806
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,000
leaving me alone on the street.

807
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,969
I didn't dare go back

808
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,750
and didn't know where to go.

809
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,630
So,

810
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,320
you went to hide in that house?

811
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,790
I only knew the places

812
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,350
where Madam Wang

813
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,060
had taken us.

814
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,110
Vice Minister.

815
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,300
What's wrong?

816
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,540
This is appalling.

817
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,810
How were the bodies found?

818
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,520
A passer-by

819
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,370
saw a female corpse in the bush

820
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,690
and reported it to the government.

821
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,370
Unexpectedly,

822
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,150
so many more corpses have been dug out.

823
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,470
We've already found 12 victims.

824
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,600
They were all women.

825
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,900
Such an atrocity

826
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,490
is appalling.

827
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,610
Can't you just get to the point?

828
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,340
They all have cuts on their wrists

829
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,910
and died in a similar way

830
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,640
to Madam Wang and Zhao Erniang.

831
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,330
These women

832
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,550
didn't die at the same time.

833
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,390
Some died more than a year ago.

834
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,370
Some died just one or two days ago.

835
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,790
Some corpses have decomposed.

836
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,590
Some corpses' bones can be seen.

837
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,310
All the victims

838
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,980
whose wounds are still identifiable

839
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,630
died of excessive bleeding

840
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,870
like those two women.

841
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,330
Judging from their bones,

842
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,830
they were all young women

843
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,810
who hadn't given birth.

844
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,000
There is something different.

845
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,140
Look at this wound.

846
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,110
This wound

847
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,830
is quite complete.

848
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,770
New cuts are overlapping with old ones.

849
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,570
Besides,

850
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,930
her wrist seems to have been sliced again and again.

851
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,600
These victims

852
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,030
are exactly the same

853
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:00,830
as the woman I read about

854
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,910
who was found dead by accident

855
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,900
two years ago.

856
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,870
Young women were killed

857
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,980
one after another.

858
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,380
Their wrists were cut open again and again.

859
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,910
What did the murderer want?

860
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:10,910
Could it be

861
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,030
that he wanted their blood?

862
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,490
I heard in the Western Regions

863
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,270
that some people would take young women's blood

864
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,660
for rejuvenation.

865
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,250
The nursery rhythm.

866
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,720
Blood filled the cup.

867
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,590
Stop thinking about

868
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,890
those made-up lyrics.

869
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,000
These women

870
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,190
were of similar age

871
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,590
and died in a similar way.

872
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,390
The earliest death dates back more than two years.

873
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,150
Maybe this has something to do

874
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,150
with Madam Wang and Zhao Erniang's deaths,

875
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,740
but I don't think

876
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,800
it was the same guy.

877
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:36,990
Maybe it's true that they were killed

878
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,950
as blood slaves.

879
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,870
So the deaths of Madam Wang

880
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,800
and Zhao Erniang

881
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,720
should still be related to Sun Xiaoying.

882
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,850
Liu said

883
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:46,990
a man

884
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,390
tried to save Sun Xiaoying.

885
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,320
Could it be that the man

886
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,890
failed to save Sun Xiaoying

887
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,210
and came back to take revenge on them?

888
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,360
I wonder

889
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,120
if the girl called Sun Xiaoying

890
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,640
was saved in the end.

891
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,500
By the way, Mr. Li,

892
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,790
I've done a head count.

893
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,460
There are 17 victims in total.

894
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:09,990
Okay.

895
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,070
Clean

896
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,930
these women up.

897
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,800
Bring them back with us.

898
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,310
Okay.

899
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,820
Take them away.

900
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:23,760
Let's go.

901
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,580
Give it to me.

902
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,240
Why is there a shoe here?

903
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,080
What's this?

904
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,240
Cat fur?

905
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,380
Impossible.

906
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,290
I've checked all the victims.

907
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:40,750
It's…

908
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,110
Their shoes

909
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,310
are all on their feet.

910
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,130
This shoe

911
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,890
doesn't belong to any victim.

912
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,420
It's not the victims' shoe.

913
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,380
I'm right.

914
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:54,110
This shoe doesn't belong to any victim.

915
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,430
Where is the body here?

916
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,710
Sir.

917
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,750
I made inquiries in the shoe shops

918
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,350
near the tailor shop.

919
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,350
This is indeed Sun Xiaoying's shoe.

920
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,830
Then her body…

921
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,540
Perhaps

922
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,750
after that man

923
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,220
failed to save Sun Xiaoying,

924
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,950
he learned that she was killed.

925
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,010
Then he sought revenge for her.

926
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,740
Have you found out

927
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,830
whose land it is where the bodies were buried?

928
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,150
That land originally

929
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,510
belonged to a rich merchant called Wang Zhi.

930
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,400
He was sent to death row for a capital crime.

931
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,150
By now,

932
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,880
he has probably died in prison.

933
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,040
So that land doesn't have an owner now.

934
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,310
Whoever buried the bodies there

935
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,630
is not afraid of them being discovered.

936
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,710
If the murderer

937
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,350
wants to avenge Sun Xiaoying,

938
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,430
his final target

939
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,530
must be the one drinking the blood.

940
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,510
As long as we find that person,

941
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,830
we can find the murderer.

942
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,850
Liu escaped,

943
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,910
so he'll definitely try to get a new blood slave.

944
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,710
We can start with places

945
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,040
where he can buy slaves.

946
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,830
It seems that

947
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,620
he's very picky about his blood slaves.

948
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,060
Given what he wants the slaves for,

949
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,790
he definitely won't buy slaves

950
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,860
from the government-run slave and horse market.

951
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,020
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,360
she was taken to a brothel.

954
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,800
If we can find that brothel,

955
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,880
we may be able to catch that guy.

956
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,610
According to your description,

957
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,990
we secretly visited all the brothels

958
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,750
that are less than thirty minutes by carriage

959
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,280
from where you were locked.

960
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,030
If you can tell which brothel

961
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,790
is where you and Sun Xiaoying

962
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,710
met the buyer,

963
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,050
it'll help us greatly.

964
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,800
You can find the man who took Ying away?

965
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,930
It's very possible.

966
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,950
I'll help you.

967
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,950
How should I do it?

968
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:34,830
Come.

969
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,370
Coming.

970
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,070
Different brothels use

971
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,200
different incense.

972
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,150
They all smell incredible. So do those girls.

973
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,490
Of course, I heard about that.

974
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,290
I've never been to those places.

975
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,560
Take a sniff.

976
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,270
Mr. Li.

977
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,170
Will this work?

978
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,340
She's not a wild cat.

979
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:06,850
Can she…

980
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,740
I mean…

981
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,880
Never mind.

982
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,350
This is it.

983
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,910
Which brothel is this from?

984
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,080
It's from Cloud Pleasure House.

985
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,660
Don't worry.

986
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,110
Mr. Li can definitely

987
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:31,830
find the bad guy.

988
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,830
Chen Shi, Wang Qi,

989
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,630
Sun Bao, Alibaba.

990
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,170
Come with me.

991
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:34,540
Yes.

992
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:34,870
Yes.

993
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,870
Cui Bei, stay here.

994
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,050
Take good care of Liu.

995
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:37,470
Yes.

996
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,580
There will be slave trade in the brothel tonight.

997
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,760
The guests tonight are either rich or exalted.

998
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,380
The…

999
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,840
The monster who drinks human blood

1000
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,210
will come to buy slaves?

1001
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,440
If he's a regular guest,

1002
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,700
he's likely to show up.

1003
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,620
Sir, come and play with us.

1004
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:02,750
Come here.

1005
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,630
Don't go.

1006
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,470
Don't be shy.

1007
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,110
What? You want to play with them?

1008
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,030
I just think

1009
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,090
Vice Minister Li looks too righteous

1010
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,510
to be someone who'd sell his maid to a brothel.

1011
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,840
No one would believe it.

1012
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,990
Vice Minister Li is a two-faced

1013
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,790
hypocrite.

1014
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,910
He can make it.

1015
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,390
Sir,

1016
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,630
we're running an honest business here.

1017
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,630
We don't buy girls

1018
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,190
directly from our guests.

1019
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,960
You didn't even bring a contract with you.

1020
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,000
You call

1021
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,200
a prostitution business honest?

1022
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,710
