4
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,900
What was written on the paper?

5
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,630
The message was written in a foreign language.

[Huangchong's stuff is hidden in the warehouse]

7
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,760
Fortunately,

8
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,390
I knew

9
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,870
a foreign merchant.

10
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,990
He looked a bit like you.

11
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,280
He taught me some of his language.

12
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,820
I know a few words,

13
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,280
but not very many.

14
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,970
That message

15
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,300
was very short.

16
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,950
It was also very strange.

17
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,780
It said,

18
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,829
"Huangchong's stuff is…"

19
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,870
Somewhere, I guess.

20
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,470
I couldn't understand the last few words.

21
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,230
Huangchong?

22
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,750
What happened next?

23
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,460
I was scared.

24
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,520
So I tied the bamboo container

25
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,550
back to the pigeon's leg

26
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,010
and threw the pigeon down.

27
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,900
I was afraid it might bring me back luck.

28
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,160
Where did you throw it?

29
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,260
I just threw it out of the window.

30
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,580
After about half a day, I went down

31
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,170
and found the pigeon gone.

32
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,950
Maybe

33
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,990
a cat took it.

34
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,510
So you two

35
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,790
really didn't know about this,

36
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,720
did you?

37
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,460
What do you mean?

38
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,240
Well, after that day,

39
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,140
an officer came.

40
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,630
He was in the uniform of the Court of Judicial Review

41
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,110
and asked me about the pigeon.

42
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,079
The Court of Judicial Review?

43
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,329
What did he look like?

44
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,790
He had too much beard.

45
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,410
I couldn't see his face clearly.

46
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,850
After he asked me about the pigeon,

47
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,670
he told me not to tell anyone about it.

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,530
He also gave me an ingot of silver.

49
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,870
If that was the case,

50
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,070
why did you report it to the government?

51
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,270
Because…

52
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,050
Because he was a bit weird.

53
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,300
How?

54
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,540
To be honest,

55
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,710
many officials

56
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,950
come here to have fun.

57
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,110
After he asked me about the pigeon,

58
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,370
I walked him to the door

59
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,350
and ran into

60
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,870
two government officials.

61
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,040
At the sight of them,

62
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,710
he walked away in a hurry.

63
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
He was like a thief

64
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,550
who saw the police.

65
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,710
I got suspicious right away.

66
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,630
I asked him

67
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,890
if he was really from the Court of Judicial Review.

68
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,080
He beat around the bush and ran off.

69
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,380
After that,

70
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,550
I thought about it again and again

71
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,190
and couldn't get over it.

72
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,790
Thinking of the strange things that have happened in Shendu recently,

73
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,589
I reported it to the government.

74
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,829
I told you

75
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,230
he'd come to you again.

76
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,630
Come in, sir.

77
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,270
This matter is so strange.

78
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,110
It indeed is.

79
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,270
That's why I want to discuss it with Vice Minister Li.

80
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,800
But he hasn't returned yet.

81
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,830
Someone sent a letter by pigeon.

82
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,060
In the letter,

83
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,110
Huangchong

84
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,230
was mentioned.

85
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,070
If I remember correctly,

86
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,800
Sun Bao once dealt with a case

87
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,270
where the Assistant Minister of Justice

88
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,870
colluded with Lu Chenghuang

89
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,190
whose nickname was Huangchong.

90
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,830
Yeah.

91
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,060
His involvement

92
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,860
has made this case interesting.

93
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,990
We need to find

94
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,550
that fake officer first.

95
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,000

96
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,910
The office of Jinwu Guards.

97
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,350
All their orders

98
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,280
are issued here.

99
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,360
If they want to do something,

100
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,550
we can notice signs here.

101
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,620
This place is heavily guarded.

102
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,550
It's impossible to infiltrate it.

103
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,790
I'm afraid it won't be easy this time.

104
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,910
Your buns.

105
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,320
Why are you staring at that food stall?

106
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,790
It looks a bit different.

107
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,970
Come with me.

108
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,820
Come.

109
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,550
Unless it's a festival,

110
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,550
no food stalls

111
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,940
are allowed to do business

112
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,420
near the government office.

113
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,790
Officials prefer to work

114
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,310
without so many eyes and ears around.

115
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,440
I've looked around.

116
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,510
Other stalls are all far away.

117
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,590
Could it be a secret post of Jinwu Guards?

118
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,390
No.

119
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,350
I can tell from the color of the steamer

120
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,280
that it's been used for a long time.

121
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,480
And that vendor

122
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,220
must have been in this trade for many years

123
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,770
to be so skilled.

124
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,270
It should be a real food stall.

125
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,310
The key

126
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,950
is the customers.

127
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,510
Obviously, those customers are Jinwu Guards.

128
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,340
Did you notice their attitude towards the vendor?

129
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,830
Okay.

130
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,230
Have you ever seen Jinwu Guards

131
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,600
be so polite

132
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,710
to a stall owner?

133
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,080
What does that mean?

134
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,190
It means this stall is special.

135
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,230
The vendor

136
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,670
should be close

137
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,320
with someone who holds a high position.

138
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,510
That's why he can do business

139
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,980
near the government office.

140
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,950
Jinwu Guards must know that.

141
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,150
That's why they're so polite to the vendor.

142
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,070
You have a point.

143
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,110
I bet the person with whom the vendor is close

144
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,110
barely shows up.

145
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,150
Jinwu Guards have strict rules.

146
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,050
He doesn't want to give people

147
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,760
anything to talk about.

148
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,800
What if

149
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,250
something happens

150
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,950
to that stall?

151
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,830
Will he show up to intervene?

152
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,390
You're smart.

153
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,670
Then

154
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,610
who do you think is the big shot?

155
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,510
It can't be Qiu Qingzhi.

156
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,750
He wouldn't do this.

157
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,630
Have you forgotten

158
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,770
that you're a scout?

159
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,610
Have you learned nothing from Vice Minister Li?

160
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,600
You should use your brain

161
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,420
and carefully observe everything in your life.

Sir,

175
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,270
is there a boat

176
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,350
called Taixing here?

177
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,230
Taixing?

178
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,610
That ship sank a long time ago.

179
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,510
When it was pulled back

180
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,230
to the shipyard,

181
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,190
it was already beyond repair.

182
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,450
Only its hull was left.

183
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,010
It's long become a shelter for the homeless.

184
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,120
That's the ship.

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:06,880

Mr. Li, you…

195
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,390
Someone once lived here.

196
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,840
Someone lived here?

197
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,100
Why…

198
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,950
Why are the chains so strange?

199
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,400
It's the Nine Linked Rings.

200
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,590
Nine…

201
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,260
Nice Linked Rings?

202
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,100
It's a very complicated lock.

203
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,600
It changes every time you move the rings.

204
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,660
The harder you try to unlock it, the more complicated it becomes.

205
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,470
What is

206
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,590
in this box?

207
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,350
Why is it locked with such a lock?

208
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,790
What's it used for?

209
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,120
Someone's inside. What…

210
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,640
What's going on?

211
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,150
Mr. Li.

212
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,770
The door up there is closed.

213
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:13,950
Chen Shi.

214
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,630
There's smoke coming in.

215
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,630
Cover the window.

216
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,270
Chen Shi.

217
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,630
Mr. Li. Mr. Li.

218
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,750
It's water.

219
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,360
Mr. Li. Mr. Li.

220
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,390
The pigeons come and go regularly.

221
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,550
According to that goal,

222
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,150
the pigeon keeper should be nearby.

223
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,790
Pigeons?

224
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,550
There's someone keeping pigeons over there.

225
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,150
Thank you.

226
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,080
Thank you, sir.

227
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,320
Pigeon dung. It should be here.

228
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,310
All the cages are empty.

229
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,390
Look. There's a message container on its leg.

230
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,040
Get on the horse.

231
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,880
Get on the horse!

232
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,350
Hold me tight.

233
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,150
That kind of pigeon

234
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,670
usually goes back to the sender for sleep.

235
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,870
We can find the sender

236
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,550
by following it.

237
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,300
You're so smart, Vice Minister.

238
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,050
Hold tight.

239
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,040
Be careful.

240
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,840
Get it up.

241
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,870
Mr. Li.

242
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,680
Alright.

243
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,270
The man who killed the butcher

244
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,200
and lured me here

245
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,040
shouldn't be Yi Zhi Hua.

246
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,110
It was not him?

247
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,070
There was no smell of Yi Zhi Hua

248
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,930
on our way here.

249
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,470
Besides, Yi Zhi Hua has a weird way of doing things.

250
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,130
But this man is very discreet.

251
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:35,860
Moreover,

252
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,660
it seems that he doesn't want

253
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,540
to harm me.

254
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,940
He should be emulating Yi Zhi Hua

255
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,950
to tell me something.

256
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,510
Do you remember

257
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,460
the skeleton at the stage station?

258
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,370
[Death row inmate]

259
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,410
The words are so deeply carved into the bone.

260
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,670
He was a felon before he died.

261
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,750
He should have been on death row.

262
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,480
And the criminal in the blood-sucking case,

263
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,200
Wang Zhi.

264
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,030
Since you escaped from death row,

265
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,550
you've been drinking young women's blood

266
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,630
to stay young.

267
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,040
He was also on death row.

268
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,500
So we can say…

269
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,520
So we can say that

270
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,110
someone

271
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,270
escaped from death row.

272
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,200
And there was more than one of them.

273
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,990
It's…

274
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,590
It's…

275
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,340
[Criminal Wang Zhi, sentenced for manslaughter]

276
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,670
Why are there criminal tablets here?

277
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,970
[Criminal Wang Zhi, sentenced for manslaughter]
[Criminal Du, sentenced for murder]

278
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,470
These are death tokens.

279
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,660
They're used to confirm the criminals' identities

280
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,990
before beheading them.

281
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,030
That guy is trying to say that there are fugitives.

282
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,670
The name on this one is Wang Zhi.

283
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,940
[Criminal Wang Zhi, sentenced for manslaughter]
[Criminal Du, sentenced for murder]

284
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,070
This one is Du…

285
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,230
Du…

286
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,260
If this is true,

287
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,300
everything makes sense now.

288
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,630
After Du Zixu got into

289
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,440
the Minister's Mansion,

290
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,390
he mysteriously disappeared

291
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,109
because he was put on death row.

292
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,150
Wang Zhi and Yi Zhi Hua

293
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,089
were also on death row.

294
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,329
My father had a boat.

295
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,329
And Hu Ji said…

296
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,740
Three years ago,

297
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,510
he was paid

298
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,130
to pick up someone by boat.

299
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,430
Then both he and the man he picked up

300
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,390
were murdered.

301
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,090
The man he picked up

302
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,370
was Du Zixu.

303
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,150
Then why have you been

304
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,480
looking into Yi Zhi Hua?

305
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,960
Because he and Du Zixu

306
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,370
were in the same prison.

307
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,350
He appeared on her father's boat

308
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,880
and was killed by Yi Zhi Hua.

309
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,870
That means

310
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,510
the three of them

311
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,040
all escaped from death row.

312
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,170
Who on earth is this person?

313
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,370
Why is he telling me these things?

314
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:51,990
Mr. Li.

315
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,950
What's wrong?

316
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,550
Look.

317
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,380
This…

318
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,940
Isn't this…

319
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,170
Why can't I find anything?

320
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,710
No way.

321
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,250
I'll search again.

322
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,900
Sir!

323
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,990
Give me something hot!

324
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,070
Sir, please wait a second.

325
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,350
I'm serving a very important client now.

326
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,680
I'll serve you next.

327
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,580
Please be patient.

328
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,880
Gosh.

329
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,030
Why are there so many splinters

330
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,560
on these chopsticks?

331
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,030
They've hurt my fingers!

332
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,630
Sorry. I'll get you

333
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,710
another pair later.

334
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,270
Okay.

335
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,840
I don't want to wait.

336
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,670
Just give me what he ordered.

337
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,700
Sir,

338
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,790
I can't do that.

339
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,430
Why not?

340
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,390
We arrived at the same time.

341
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,870
Why did you serve him first?

342
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,150
Just because he's an officer?

343
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,430
Just because he's an officer?

344
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,270
Just because you're an officer?

345
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,100
Just because you're an officer?

346
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,030
Just because…

347
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,470
-Sir.
-Just because you're…

348
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:37,930
You're…

349
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,590
Sir.

350
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,470
You're

351
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,570
-an officer?
-Sir.

352
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,160
Consultant Lai.

353
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,630
Come in.

354
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,030
Consultant Lai.

355
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,330
Someone is messing with your uncle.

356
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,530
He's kicking up a fuss before his stall.

357
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,670
Why is it flying further and further away from the city?

358
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,730
Could we be mistaken?

359
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,260
I don't think so.

360
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,110
Why is there

361
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,150
a camp of foreigners?

362
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,210
Many foreigners

363
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,510
come from a line of nomads.

364
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,870
They're not used to living in houses,

365
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,950
so they gather together

366
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,010
to live in the wild.

367
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,450
Vice Minister.

368
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,710
These foreigners

369
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,150
live outside the city.

370
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:24,900
They're all illegals.

371
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,950
There's no telling

372
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,880
what they may do.

373
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,740
So what?

374
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,790
What do you want?

375
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,080
What did you say to them?

376
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,950
I just communicated with them

377
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,870
in another way.

378
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,870
What does it mean?

379
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,630
What does it mean?

380
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,190
It means…

381
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,230
It means…

382
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,910
Alibaba.

383
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,590
What on earth is Mingjing Hall

384

[The Court of Judicial Review]

Jinwu Guards are looking for someone.

397
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,710
Five years ago, the Court of Judicial Review

398
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,390
had a judicial commissioner

399
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,880
called Wu Yiren.

400
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,630
He once worked at Mingjing Hall

401
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,340
under the former Minister of Judicial Review.

402
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,030
He was fired

403
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,500
by the Minister of Judicial Review

404
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,230
for going to extremes.

405
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,670
So in the beginning,

406
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,230
none of us knew

407
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,110
who he was.

408
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,670
Later, for some reason,

409
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,430
he killed someone

410
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,230
and was put on death row.

411
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,910
As we guessed,

412
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,870
he was on the same death row as Du Zixu.

413
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,510
So if we can

414
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,030
find this person,

415
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,590
we'll know

416
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,150
where Du Zixu is

417
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:54,680
and how he

418
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,770
managed to escape.

419
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,640
It's him!

420
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,190
It's him.

421
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,840

I left her in the suburbs.

426

Otherwise, she'd find out what we're doing.

Forget about her.

428
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,390
We found

429
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,630
something very important.

to be a judicial commissioner of the Court of Judicial Review.

432
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,400
It seems that he knows everything.

433
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,720
Not a person.

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:41,990
Indeed.

What does it say?

442
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,030
It says the reason

443
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,760
why Du Zixu was put on death row.

444
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,640
It says

445
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,590
he presented the formula

446
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,080
of the Five Minerals Powder to the minister

447
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,340
and won favor with him.

448
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,550
But the minister soon found

449
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,620
that he had ulterior motives

450
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,870
and put him on death row.

451
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,430
He was forced to explain

452

why he came to Shendu.

453
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,030
It was for an ingredient in his formula.

454
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,650
The minister also wanted to know where to get that ingredient.

455
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,230
But the minister was not the ringleader.

456
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,430
The mastermind was someone else.

to report it to you, General.

472
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,750

Every year around this time,

477
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,830
I come here.

478
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,350
After all, your father helped me

479
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,480
and taught me a lot of things.

Of course I do.

484
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,970
Since you're still here,

485
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,170
can I ask you about some official business?

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,310
Those at the shipyard have seen you as well.

496
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,350
Take my advice.

497
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,990
Stop lying.

498
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,830
Sure enough, you're not here just for reminiscing.

499
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,870
I warned you

500
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,950
not to interfere in this case.

501
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,210
Why didn't you listen?

502
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,770
Why should I listen to you?

503
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,770
This case is related to the Court of Judicial Review.

504
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,870
Of course I have to dig into it.

505
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,800
This case is extremely intricate.

506
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,950
I advise you to stay out of it.

507
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,160
Just tell me what you've found.

508
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,190
Jinwu Guards will take care of the rest.

509
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,020
Why?

510
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,610
It's for your own good.

511
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,810
For my own good?

512
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,000
After all,

513
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,920
we used to be friends.

514
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,310
Friends?

515

about this case?

518
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,510
It actually made you say

519
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,710
we used to be friends.

520
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,020
If we were friends,

521
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,230
why don't you explain to me

522
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,670
why you had to meddle in

523
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,110

What are you digging into?

526
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,870
What's in this case for you?

527
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
You won't tell me?

528
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,920
I'll say it for you.

529
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,600
You just want a promotion.

530
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,020
That year, you said

532
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,320
Do you still remember that year?

00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,710
My name is Li Bing.

What's your name?

Qiu Qingzhi.

536
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,810
I know where the people from Zixu are.

537
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,060
Do you want to see them?

538
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,110
But my father

539
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,490
has had the door locked.

540
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,530
I can't get out.

541
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,290
Forget it.

Wait. I'll go with you.

543

How are we going to see them?

544
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,790
I have my ways.

545
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,950
Come.

546
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,660
This way.

547
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,340
We made it.

548
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,010
A tavern?

549
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,670
Yes. The envoys from Zixu

550
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,240
have been attending banquets here recently.

551
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,660
What's wrong?

552
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,560
You've never been here before?

553
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,770
I have.

554
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,990
I've even been to pleasure houses.

555
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,950
Okay.

556
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,470
Come.

557
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,030
Look.

558
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,120
Haven't you watched enough of that dance?

559
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,260
I'm watching it for the last time.

560
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,510
He's the friend you brought with you?

561
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,370
Okay.

562
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,700
Remember

563
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,940
to get your salary later.

564
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,430
Okay.

565
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,080
So you work here.

566
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:35,680
I thought

567
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,820
we sneaked in.

568
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,460
Shut up.

569
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,630
Thank you for taking me here.

570
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,590
Actually,

571
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,990
this is indeed my first time in a tavern.

572
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,860
I've been sickly since I was young.

573
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,510
The doctor said I needed a lot of rest.

574

Otherwise, I wouldn't make it to adulthood.

You said that to me

when we first met.

593
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,679
At that time, you were a slave,

594

but you had a backbone.

595

You didn't allow anyone

596

to look down on you.

597
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,350
At that time, I saw

598
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,650
an aspiring young man.

599
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,770
I recruited you,

helped you join the army,

601
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,020
and freed you from slavery

602

maybe

607
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,830
you could live my dream as well.
