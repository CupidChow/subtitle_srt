00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:49,940
Wait.

197
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,720
Aren't you just being perfunctory?

198
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,110
You're so stubborn.

199
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,390
Of course it's not the same.

200
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,900
It's acceptable for both sides.

201
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,510
Besides,

202
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,740
once the Vice Minister asks about it,

203
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,510
we won't have to take

204
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,110
responsibility for that.

205
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,430
I'm wronged! I'm wronged!

206
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,190
What are you looking for?

207
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,190
What's going on?

208
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,100
I'm wronged!

209
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,830
Why is she yelling?

210
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,230
What are you looking for?

211
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,590
What's wrong?

212
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,230
You lost something?

213
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,110
What happened?

214
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:08,990
What's missing?

215
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,720
I don't know.

216
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,140
Are you looking for a pen?

217
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,600
Well...

218
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,460
[Injustice]

219
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,030
The petition has been submitted, right?

220
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,870
She wants to find her own petition.

221
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,420
[Injustice]

222
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,330
Since she couldn't find it,

223
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,990
she could only write a new one.

224
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:33,870
Mr. Wang.

225
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,900
How did the review of the case go?

226
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,840
What are you doing?

227
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,260

Sir.

231
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,490
We haven't finished reviewing the case yet.

232
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,090
Please...

233
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,650
Please allow us to report to you after we finish.

234
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,150
Okay.

235
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,420
We'll take our leave.

236
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,800
Let's go.

Mr. Li.

239
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,840
The review of that case...

240
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,650
They're quite thoughtful.

241
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,190
Take good care of her.

242
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,720
I'll talk to you later.

243
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:32,790
Got it.

[Mingjing Hall]

245
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,700
Are you asleep?

246
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,470
Tomorrow,

247
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,250
I want to go to the Ministry of Justice again.

[27, Jiashen]

249
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,470
Lord.

250
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,030
The judicial commissioner of the Court of Judicial Review wants to see you.

251
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,810
Let him come in.

252
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,350
Yes.

253
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,360
Not bad.

254
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,750
I didn't expect

255
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,770
you to finish the review so fast.

256
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,490
If you ask me,

257
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,030
there's no need for you

258
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,660
to have come all the way here.

259
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,830
But

260
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,070
it's good that you're here.

261
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,790
I can file it away.

262
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,350
Lord.

263
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,870
We are here today

264
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,590
because there're still some problems with the case.

265
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,230
What?

266
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,870
Is there anything

267
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,750
unclear in this dossier?

268
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,510
Well...

269
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,270
No, no.

270
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,460
It's very detailed.

271
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,430
There's only a flaw in this almost perfect dossier.

272
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,900
I'm afraid there might be some errors in this case.

273
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,430
We should survey the scene.

274
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,260
What?

275
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,270
Lord.

276
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,380
They ate so much last night

277
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,430
that they're not thinking straight.

278
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,910
We came here yesterday

279
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,090
under the order of Vice Minister

280
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,030
We wanted to do our work

281
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,340
more rigorously.

282
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,190
So,

283
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,350
after we went back,

284
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,980
we also had a discussion

285
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,070
besides reading the dossier.

286
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,780
We found that

287
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,120
the Ministry of Justice's survey method

288
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,220
is really amazing.

289
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,970
It's eye-opening.

You make it sound nice.

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,270
Don't think I don't know

294
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,100
what you are up to.

295
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,070
If

296
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,630
you insist on reviewing it,

297
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,830
don't blame me

298
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,630
for not reminding you then.

299
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,870

No.

They...

313
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,190
Half of the Ministry of Justice's officials are here.

You know what?

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,510
These are the officials

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,370
from the Court of Judicial Review

326
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,940
Okay. No problem.

327
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,380

Wait, he...

330

I...

331
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,850
The Demon Cat Case was so complicated.

332
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,520
How did you find the clues?

333
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,510
But as far as I know,

334
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,790
the murderer was already dead by then.

335
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,660
How did you find the evidence?

336
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,390
Exactly.

337
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,470
Where did you get it?

338
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,180
I heard

339
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,970
the Court of Judicial Review required you to solve the case in 10 days,

340
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,110
and you ended up arresting the wrong person.

342
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,710

the details?

00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,070
How can we investigate?

348
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,110
We can't do anything.

349
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,310
How about we split up?

350
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,530
We'll go investigate something else.

00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,660
Let's meet up later.

352
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,910
Don't go.

00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,870
Don't go,

354
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,390
Don't let them go.

355
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,520
Tell us the details.

356
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,110
Take your time.

357
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,590
Hey.

358
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,530
Wait.

359
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,010
Isn't it a bit rude

360
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,630
that we just left like this?

361
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,230
What are you talking about, being rude?

362
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,670
Didn't you see how many people they have?

363
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,230
The four of us

364
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,340
would have all been trapped there.

365
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,200
We might as well

366
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,350
leave a foreigner

367
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,390
and a bonehead there

368
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,250
for them to ask.

369
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,330
Besides,

370
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,440
Cui Bei is there.

371
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,190
As long as he behaves normally,

372
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,760
soon,

373
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,210
there won't be so many people.

374
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,540
Where are we going then?

375
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,770
To...

376
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,110
To the Councilor's.

377
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,870
Isn't the Councilor's sister

378
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,630
at the Court of Judicial Review?

379
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,360
Who said I'd be looking for her?

380
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,430
What's going on?

381
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,530
It's thundering.

382
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,750
Bad news!

383
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,790
There was a dry thunder

384
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,820
out of the blue just now.

385
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,590
And for no reason,

386
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,310
it struck

387
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,070
right at

388
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,920
the Ministry of Justice's prison

389
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,950
Even the cornice on the southwest corner

390
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,050
was shattered by the thunder.

391
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,310
Many colleagues and prisoners

392
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,990
were injured.

393
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,130
I'm afraid that those felons

394
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:20,950
have escaped

395
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,380
when we weren't noticing.

396
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,530
They escaped? Then why are we still standing here?

397
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,270
Hurry up and go.

398
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,590
Hurry up. Let's go.

399
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,600
Go catch them.

400
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,230
This is huge.

401
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,630
You'd better not go.

402
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,560
Just stand here.

403
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,790
Learn from me,

404
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,550
okay?

405
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,930
Be careful.

406
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,240
Although he's

407
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,610
already gone,

408
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,270
there should be traces of his life

409
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,470
left here.

410
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:48,420
[Lu's Residence]

411
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,310
Bao.

412
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,210
[Lu's Residence]

413
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,690
What do you want?

414
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,390
Squat here.

415
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,350
Lift me up.

416
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,610
Come on.

417
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,240
Lower. My legs are short.

418
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,430
Lift harder.

419
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,660
[Lu's Residence]

420
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,470
Harder.

421
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,790
Harder.

422
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,780
Wait.

423
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,350
Wait.

424
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,390
[Lu's Residence]

425
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:25,810
This won't do.

426
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,990
My leg is cramping.

427
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,790
Are you okay?

428
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,670
I'm having a leg cramp. How can I be okay?

429
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,680
[Lu's Residence]

430
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:45,870
Come in.

431
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,750
The Councilor's sister

432
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,950
is already like that.

433
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,790
She may not even be able to find her way home.

434
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,950
Why did she lock the door?

435
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,590
Why is their house

436
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,590
as modest as ours?

437
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,080
What do you know?

438
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,690
He is the Councilor of the Ministry of Justice.

439
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,500
Maybe he has other houses.

440
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,190
Don't move.

441
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,360
Someone is in the yard.

442
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,300
Otherwise,

443
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,350
the door wouldn't have been locked.

444
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,020
Pay attention to the traces of life.

445
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,430
Wait for me.

446
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,870
It hurts.

447
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,470
Get down.

448
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,250
Who are you?

449
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,450
What are you here for?

450
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,740
Excuse me, are you familiar with the Councilor?

451
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,670
No.

452
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,200
Have you handled this case?

453
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,210
Is there anything fishy

454
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,520
about it?

455
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,570
Actually,

456
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,330
you can compile the catalog

457
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,040
respectively according to the time, jurisdiction, and category

458
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,120
of the cases.

459
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,090
It may take some effort,

460
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:25,990
but

461
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,470
it will be more convenient

462
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,290
to look up in the future.

463
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,070
I'm also in charge of dossier arrangement

464
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,350
in the Court of Judicial Review.

465
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,290
There are numerous cases.

466
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,090
If we don't put effort into it,

467
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,650
we'll suffer in the future.

468
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,800
Just now,

469
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,360
I saw that they all went out,

470
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,430
and you were the only one staying here.

471
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:44,980
If you are not

472
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,470
Councilor's friend,

473
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,480
is it because you also have doubts about this case?

474
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
The Court of Judicial Review

475
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,620
claims to re-investigate this case,

476
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,220
but you don't even know this?

477
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,130
We only know a bit about it.

478
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,730
Please enlighten us.

479
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,210
Actually,

480
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,830
the first person

481
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,590
to find Councilor's body

482
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,510
during the shift handover that day

483
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,120
was me.

484
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,860
So Heaven's vengeance is slow

485
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,820
but sure indeed.

486
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,350
You

487
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,790
always sound so weird.

488
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,350
If there's something

489
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,460
you want to know,

490
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,440
go ahead.

491
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,070
[Injustice]

492
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,110
[Injustice]

493
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,490
[Injustice]

494
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,850
How many times have I told you?

495
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,940
I'm here to get...

496
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,340
I'm here to borrow the pickle jar.

497
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,350
Why don't you believe me?

498
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,350
This house has been robbed.

499
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,750
Does it really have nothing to do with you?

500
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,640
Yes.

501
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,470
What's to steal

502
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,750
from the siblings?

503
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,350
That's true.

504
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,670
Ma'am.

505
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,230
I heard that

506
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,480
you are this family's neighbor, right?

507
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,380
There must have been

508
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,300
a lot of contact between you and them.

509
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,180
Of course.

510
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,850
I've always helped them with

511
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,780
the sewing work of this household.

512
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,160
We

513
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,190
want to ask you

514
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,890
about the news of this family.

515
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,580
It's already noon.

516
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,030
I have to go home and cook.

517
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,150
If I don't cook,

518
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,790
they'll

519
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,080
have to buy food outside.

520
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,780
Just tell me,

521
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,870
how much money do you need to buy food?

522
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,720
Officer.

523
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,650
You can give me as much as you want.

524
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,020
Put it back.

525
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,590
Ma'am.

526
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,400
You're trespassing in broad daylight.

527
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,490
I haven't even held you accountable.

528
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,710
You're afraid that you'd delay cooking,

529
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,990
but aren't you afraid that you'd be caned at the government office?

530
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,790
Don't. Don't.

531
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,490
Just ask, Officer.

532
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,000
I'll ask then. Be honest with me.

533
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,110
How was Councilor

534
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,710
as a person?

535
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,530
To be honest, Officer,

536
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,350
as an elder brother,

537
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,080
he treated his younger sister very well.

538
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,070
As long as he was free,

539
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,320
he'd take care of his sister.

540
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,620
He was more attentive than his parents.

541
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,240
He'd give all the good stuff and delicious food

542
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,570
to his sister.

543
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,380
He even wore a shabby pair of boots

544
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,110
for three years without replacing them.

545
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,840
Why did he have to be so thrifty?

546
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,230
He had to save money.

547
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,140
Otherwise,

548
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,840
how could he find doctors and buy medicine?

549
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,560
His sister's dementia

550
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,880
can't be cured.

551
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,630
So how did you feel

552
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,420
when you heard that

553
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,040
Councilor hanged himself?

554
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,550
Well...

555
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,540
I'm not sure.

556
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,620
Besides,

557
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,570
I'm in no position to say anything.

558
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,550
Several years ago,

559
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,510
once,

560
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,870
when the siblings were out,

561
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,550
they both fell into the water.

562
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,330
They were saved and sent back.

563
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:49,830
But

564
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,550
countless people

565
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,120
fall into Luo River every year.

566
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,190
That's not

567
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,390
something unusual.

568
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,430
But it seemed to me that

569
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,340
they didn't fall into the water.

570
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,520
It's more like they were trying to drown themselves.

571
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,070
Officer, think about it.

572
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,030
Councilor

573
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,640
was already in his thirties.

574
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,270
He couldn't get married

575
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,470
because of his sister's illness,

576
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,290
and he had to live a hard life enduring that.

577
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,710
He must have felt aggrieved.

578
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,670
I think

579
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,070
it's understandable

580
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,040
if he wanted to commit suicide.

581
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,230
Don't go.

582
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,030
Has anything special

583
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,830
happened to Councilor

584
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,630
lately?

585
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,470
No?

586
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,020
I don't know.

587
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,990
He didn't talk about anything except for work.

588
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,350
Didn't your love grow over time

589
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,870
since you worked together?

590
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,130
What friendship could we possibly have?

591
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,130
The only thing I know

592
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,870
is his family's situation.

593
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,470
I believe you know it as well.

594
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,780
He

595
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,350
had a bad temper.

596
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,500
He was too serious.

597
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,410
But everyone knows

598
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,550
he was diligent.

599
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:58,870
So they wouldn't bother

600
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,480
getting into conflict with him.

601
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,280
But of course,

602
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,530
they didn't care about him either.

603
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,610
Besides,

604
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,440
lately,

605
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,950
he just got scolded

606
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,310
by Assistant Minister.

607
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,710
When was that?

608
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,870
Two months ago.

609
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,150
It was actually nothing.

610
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,600
Assistant Minister

611
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,790
was just dissatisfied with him

612
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,900
because he took leave too often

613
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,230
in order to go home

614
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,840
and take care of his sister.

615
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,640
Although

616
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,150
he took work home with him

617
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,560
and didn't delay anything,

618
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,470
it wasn't

619
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,320
a long-term solution.

620
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,240
Assistant Minister

621
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,680
seemed to intend to dismiss him.

622
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,360
How is it?

623
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,700
Is everything going okay?

624
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,230
You...

625
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,040
You...

626
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,230
You are ungrateful!

627
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,340
You colluded with each other!

628
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,590
It's not that serious.

629
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,190
It's not that serious, okay?

630
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,950
Is everything going well with you?

631
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,710
When the watchman Zhang Da passed by here

632
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,310
on his night patrol at 3 a.m.,

633
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,230
he found that Councilor

634
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,510
was still burning the midnight oil.

635
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,590
But at 5 a.m.,

636
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,420
[Nightwatch]

637
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,830
when someone came to take over from Councilor,

638
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,510
he was found dead in the room.

639
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,710
This is in line with

640
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,370
what's recorded in the dossier.

641
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,110
So it really was suicide.

642
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:14,960
We asked

643
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,280
the siblings' neighbor.

644
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,270
She said that Councilor

645
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,190
once took his sister

646
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:18,850
to drown themselves in the river.

647
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,910
Drown themselves?

648
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,940
Plus, he was going be dismissed.

649
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,990
It was too stressful.

650
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,910
He was eccentric,

651
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,640
and he didn't have any friends,

652
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,440
so he might take things too hard.

653
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:28,950
Well,

654
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,170
please take us to the scene.

655
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,540
Okay.

656
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,750
Master said

657
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,630
ghosts who committed suicide

658
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,070
have the strongest evil aura.

659
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,880
This is the dossier

660
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,270
Councilor was marking that night.

661
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,670
I've copied it.

662
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,590
I'll leave the original to you.

663
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,940
He was really meticulous.

664
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,440
So he wet the file

665
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,590
since he was writing

666
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,630
and drinking tea at the same time.

667
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,360
The color of the ink

668
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,070
doesn't seem like

669
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,510
it's been soaked in tea.

670
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,670
Could it be

671
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,080
he started crying when he was writing?

672
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,110
When I was preparing for the Mandarin Level 8 Exam,

673
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,110
I also shed tears on the papers a lot.

674
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,790
Judging from the shape of the water stain,

675
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,790
it's more like it fell from a height.

676
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,330
Has this table

677
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,670
always been here?

678
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,070
It hasn't been moved?

679
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,510
That night,

680
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,670
Councilor was sitting right here.

681
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,200
So what if

682
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,370
he was sitting here?

683
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,910
Did you see him?

684
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,320
Did it rain that night?

685
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,790
It did rain that night.

686
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,110
There was a small hole

687
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,350
on the roof before.

688
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,100
But it's been raining lately,

689
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,230
and it didn't leak again.

690
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,590
After that night,

691
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,950
did the Ministry of Justice send someone to fix the roof?

692
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,990
As far as I know,

693
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,450
no one has come to fix it.

694
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:07,940
So...

695
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,720
So what did you find?

696
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,530
The roof has indeed been fixed.

697
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,550
It's probably Councilor himself

698
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,820
who asked someone to come fix it.

699
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,190
Does that mean

700
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,860
on the night Councilor died,

701
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,320
a craftsman had been here?

702
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,870
We have a suspect.

703
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,020
You met Councilor that night.

704
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,270
Why didn't you say it?

705
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,800
No one asked me.

706
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,970
If you had asked me,

707
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,480
I would have told you the truth.

708
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,870
At least you know that

709
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,030
Councilor died that day, right?

710
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,590
You didn't take the initiative to go to the Ministry of Justice

711
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,560
and provide clues.

712
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,910
You have a guilty conscience.

713
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,830
You're lying.

714
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,830
No.

715
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,060
It's not because of this.

716
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,240
Then what's the reason?

717
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,150
I had a fight with that Councilor.

718
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,330
I was worried that if I went,

719
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:03,910
people would think

720
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,910
that I killed him.

721
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,780
A fight?

722
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,590
Revenge.

723
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,310
It sounds very much like

724
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,670
a motive for murder.

725
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,110
Look.

726
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:13,830
Look.

727
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,620
I told you.

728
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,699
Why did you have that fight?

729
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,159
I'm pretty skilled at my job,

730
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,000
so I went to fix the roof

731
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,310
for the Ministry of Justice.

732
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,400
But this Councilor

733
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,239
was paranoid.

734
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,590
He kept on saying that the roof I fixed was leaking.

735
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,600
Since I refused to admit it,

736
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,400
he came to me again and again

737
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,550
and asked me

738
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,699
to see it myself when it rains.

739
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,190
I was so annoyed by him.

740
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,650
It was raining that night,

741
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:35,810
so I went there.

742
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,420
I was only there to fix the roof.

743
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:43,820
Keep making up stories.

744
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,810
I'm not making it up.

745
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,830
When I left after I finished fixing it,

746
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,909
Councilor was there

747
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,460
handling official documents, safe and sound.

748
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,350
If I were the suspect,

749
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,920
I would have made up the same story.

750
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,750
But maybe

751
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,820
I couldn't do it so well as you.

752
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,219
Words alone are no proof.

753
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,590
Do you have a witness?

754
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,740
Witness...

755
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,300
I didn't go home

756
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,260
after fixing the roof that night.

757
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,150
I went to see that...

758
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,880
That night watchman, Zhang Da.

759
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,930
I drank with him

760
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,070
until dawn.

761
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,100
Go ask him if you don't believe me.

762
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,650
Okay.

763
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,670
We'll go find

764
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,790
Zhang Da right now.

765
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,160
If you dare to lie to us,

766
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,180
just wait and see.

767
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,500
Come in.

768
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:54,000
[Wanted]

769
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,530
Hu Si.

770
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,790
Vice Minister Shangguan.

771
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,990
Vice Minister Li.

772
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,370
Since you have time to visit me, Vice Minister Li,

773
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,270
I think the cases

774
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,150
must have all been solved.

775
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,310
You must be joking, Vice Minister Shangguan.

776
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,780
I am just an ordinary person.

777
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,090
How could I possibly solve so many old cases

778
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,290
in just a few days?

779
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,060
I'm here today

780
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,100
for something else.

781
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,330
Please go ahead, Vice Minister Li.

782
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,790
I want to go to the Secret Chamber of the Court of Judicial Review.

783
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,830
Since the Court of Judicial Review doesn't have a minister for now,

784
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,130
the two vice ministers,

785
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:30,890
you and I,

786
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,710
are in charge of the keys

787
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,750
to the Secret Chamber for the time being.

788
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,020
Both keys are needed.

789
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,000
I want to borrow yours.

790
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,180
Why do you want to go to the Secret Chamber?

791
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,920
My father's book is stored

792
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,330
in the Secret Chamber.

793
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,570
I want to look it up.

794
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,600
I can lend you the key.

795
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,330
But

796
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,110
I have to go with you.

797
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,050
No problem.

798
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,930
[Subtle and Precise]

799
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,320
I've never been here

800
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,270
since I joined the Court of Judicial Review, either.

801
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,330
Judging from this,

802
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,800
this place is no different

803
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,320
from the Dossier Library.

804
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,320
The files stored in the Dossier Library

805
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,580
are from recent years.

806
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,890
But what's stored here in the Secret Chamber

807
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,550
are felonies of various states,

808
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,990
and even the old cases from the previous dynasty.

809
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,360
For example, the Poisonous Magic Case from the previous dynasty,

810
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,910
the Dry Well Case from the first year of Yansheng,

811
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,370
and the Custody Case from the third year of Jingyuan.

812
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,630
The dossiers of these cases are all here.

813
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,960
That's the Wrongful Conviction Collection

814
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,690
complied by the predecessors.

815
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,250
Over there are the personal collections

816
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,740
of the former ministers of the Court of Judicial Review.

817
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,150
Is the Mystery Case Collection

818
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,070
here?

819
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,340
It's over there, in the middle shelf.

820
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,760
Why do you know

821
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,050
the books here so well?

822
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,180
When my father was in office,

823
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,760
he allowed me to read alone in the temple.

824
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,370
The place I spent the most time in was the Secret Chamber.

825
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,170
How many books and dossiers here

826
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,260
have you read?

827
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,870
Probably 8 or 9 out of 10.

828
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,950
I was in poor health at that time.

829
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,290
The only fun I could have

830
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,950
was reading.

831
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,990
I'm curious what

832
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,620
the Court of Judicial Review

833
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,460
under the governance of the former minister

834
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,420
was like.

835
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,490
The Court of Judicial Review under my father's governance

836
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,850
was disciplined,

837
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,860
but also liberal.

838
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,570
Take the Secret Chamber as an example.

839
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,390
Although it's a secret chamber,

840
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,610
everyone from the

841
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,940
Court of Judicial Review,

842
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,110
regardless of their ranks,

843
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,770
could borrow books from here.

844
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,350
Besides, regardless of the gravity of the case,

845
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,670
all the officials would work together

846
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,730
to investigate it.

847
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,990
It seems like

848
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,100
you are quite dissatisfied

849
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,970
with the current Court of Judicial Review.

850
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,170
You're overthinking, Vice Minister Shangguan.

851
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:03,950
I just miss

852
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,520
and respect my late father.

853
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,130
However,

854
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,470
even though it helps with

855
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,950
the assessment,

856
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,570
grading the cases into 4 levels,

857
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,720
A, B, C, and D,

858
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,700
if the officials start to

859
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,190
treat different cases

860
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,170
with priorities and favoritism because of this,

861
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,600
that would be grasping the shadow and letting go the substance, right?

862
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,230
Besides, the cases handled by the Court of Judicial Review

863
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,010
are mostly related to human lives.

864
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,710
A man's mind is unpredictable.

865
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,590
Most of the time, it's hard to assess

866
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,310
the gravity of a case

867
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,350
till the end.

868
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,540
Easy for you to say.

869
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,190
There are so many cases in the Court of Judicial Review.

870
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,170
How can we possibly investigate all of them

871
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:43,940
[Peace]

872
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,380
if we don't grade them according to gravity?

873
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:44,860
[1,000 miles]

874
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,840
Vice Minister Shangguan.

875
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,970
I have a suggestion.

876
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,580
Go ahead.

877
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,950
In the Demon Cat Case,

878
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,830
there must be

879
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,870
some misunderstanding between us.

880
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,800
Now that

881
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,970
we are both vice ministers of the Court of Judicial Review,

882
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,060
why don't we make up

883
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,090
and work together

884
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,960
to solve cases and help people seek justice?

885
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,450
Let's not get into conflict with each other.

886
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,720
I'm sorry that

887
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,040
I offended you many times before.

888
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,280
It never occurred to me that

889
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,400
there's any conflict between us,

890
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,190
Vice Minister Li.

891
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,990
So we've had a tacit understanding for a long time.

892
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,630
I'm done.

893
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,810
Let's go.

894
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,270
Don't you need to

895
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,480
take this book out?

896
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,170
I've memorized it.

897
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,100
If I need to come again,

898
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,120
I'm afraid I have to trouble you again, Vice Minister Shangguan.

899
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,960
[Court of Judicial Review]
