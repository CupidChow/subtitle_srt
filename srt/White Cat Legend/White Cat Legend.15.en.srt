The alleys and sheds here

12
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,470
are too densely packed.

13
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,250
It's really hard to find people here.

14
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,480
I asked many people.

15
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,050

and he disappeared.

24
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,550
It was very likely to be Lu.

25
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,480
He lives nearby.

use a pouch similar to yours?

about two pouches being similar, right?

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,570
We were worried about our livelihood,

77
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,500
so we started working at the wharf.

78
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,870
We didn't expect that the watercourse was blocked.

79
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,710
We couldn't support our families

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,160

82
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,160
but to become thieves.

83
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,130
That night,

84
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,750
we went to steal goods from the ship with masks on

85
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,150
as usual.

86
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,870
How could this be?

87
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,550
No time for talking.

88
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,610
Take it away first.

89
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,330
We distribute and store goods

91
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,270
It's close to the wharf,

92
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,000
and normally no one goes there.

93
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,560
So once we steal something,

94
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,990
we'd put it there temporarily.

95
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,390
Nothing ever went wrong.

96
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,680

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,570
It's just a wooden box.

102
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,100
When did I leave a mark?

103
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,780
Someone wants to frame me.

106
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,760

107
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,180
Even we can't see it.

108
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,560

Why do you have this

112

in your hand?

113
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,350
So what is this?

114
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,710
I don't know.

115
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,400
The most ridiculous thing is that

116
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,150
I don't know

117
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,900

118
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,020

120
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,630
broke into our camp

121
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,580
and raided it thoroughly

122
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,110
during the war.

123
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,910
And this thing

124
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,280
appeared

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,230
on my brother's bed for no reason.

126

00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,450
He was completely unreasonable.

This pouch

159
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,890
was embroidered by our mother

Mother has bad eyesight.

162
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,270
She embroidered it under the dim light of an oil lamp

163
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,670
for two nights straight.

164
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,240
She said

165
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,220
it was to bless us

166
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,950
to win every battle.

167
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,670
Her wish was not for us to return home in glory,

168
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,430
but only to be safe.

169
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,990
I didn't expect...

170
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,760
I didn't expect that

171
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,720
instead of being killed on the battlefield,

172
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,590
he got killed by our people

173
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,540
for no reason.

174
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,170
Not only that,

175
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,890
since we refused to plead guilty,

176
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,280
although we risked our lives

177
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,370
and had a lot of military exploits,

178
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,390
we didn't get

179
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,910
any pay.

180
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,530
What's worse, after retirement,

181
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,490
there was no way to make a living.

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,880
What about your mother?

185
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,310
Mother

186
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,640
became blind from all the crying.

187
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,210
Didn't they

188
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,380
accuse us of stealing?

189
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,470
Then we'll be thieves and show them.

190
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,550
The world is unfair.

191
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,970
How much is innocence

192
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,390
worth?

193
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,570
Could it be worth my brother's life?

194
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,120
But I

195
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,950
never imagined that

196
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,500
the culprit would be

197
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,910
Liu Fu.

198
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,420
How could we possibly spare him?

199
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,710
But...

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But Zhao Huazi...

201
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,990
Zhao Huazi was innocent.

202
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,690
It was his fault,

203
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,350
taking something he shouldn't have

204
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,950
and refusing to hand it over.

205
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,550
He died for money.

206
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,770
He wasn't wronged.

-Don't come over!
-Chen Shi!

Don't move.

Let go!

220
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,930
That thing is a scourge.

221
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,710
No one should have it.

222
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,290
[Mingjing Hall]

223
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,550
[Lunar March 3rd, the fifth year of Shenggong]

224
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,410
Vice Minister.

225
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,320
The case has been filed.

226
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,860
Although the case is solved,

227
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,460
there are still some doubts.

228
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Lu confessed that

229
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,450
before Liu Fu died,

230
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,970
he refused to admit that he left a mark

231
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,840
on the deck.

232
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,630
But coming to think of it,

233
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,830
it's impossible that Liu Fu didn't know

234
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,740
this thing

235
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,050
would get him killed.

236
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,000
It was indeed uncalled for.

237
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,270
Then who's the one that left the mark

238
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,110
and made Lu and the others

239
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,410
go steal at night?

240
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,550
There's indeed some doubt about this matter.

241
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,750
Keep investigating.

242
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:26,830
Yes.

243
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,510
It's all my fault. It's because the only thing I knew was to look for my brother

244
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,110
that I got kidnapped by Lu,

245
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,110
and you had to come and save me.

246
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,740
Chen Shi.

247
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,570
You can't say that.

248
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,810
You can put it this way that

249
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,990
you unknowingly

250
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,670
acted as a bait.

251
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,150
Otherwise, the case couldn't have been solved

252
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,910
so neatly.

253
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,520
You are quite skillful at

254
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,470
anti grappling.

255
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,390
The clues of this case are all interlinked.

256
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,140
It couldn't have been solved

257
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,340
with anyone missing.

258
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,160
We are in cahoots.

259
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,910
As for this case,

260
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,170
if we want to talk about merits,

261
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,470
everyone has made their own.

262
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,750
But when it comes to demerits,

263
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,210
I'm afraid it's also true.

264
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,730
But we did solve the case in the end.

265
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,550
It proves that

266
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,550
everyone in Mingjing Hall

267
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,610
is indispensable.

268
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,480
Chen Shi, let me ask you.

269
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,240
Are you still leaving?

270
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,240
I've made up my mind.

271
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,770
Since I'm here,

272
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,530
I shouldn't rush it through.

273
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,330
I can't just cause you trouble

274
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,110
without knowing any better.

275
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,380
I also hope

276
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,250
if I can see my brother in the future,

277
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,840
I can become someone he can rely on.

278
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,230
Of course.

279
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,210
You should also practice more

280
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,040
to get enrolled at the Court of Judicial Review as soon as possible.

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,570

Give him some guidance when you have time.

283

But

284
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,680
don't go too far.

285
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,390
Yes.

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:15,950

The most important thing about being a scout

289
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,200
is to endure.

290
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,950
It's also true when it comes to being a judicial commissioner.

291
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,210

If I don't use my connections,

358
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,270
given that you always go against

359
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,870

360

It's fine if you don't make friends with him.

366

But how can you go against him all the time?

367
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,670

00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,600
cause me trouble anymore?

to work at the Court of Judicial Review.

382

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,090
go against her will at this time?

386
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,470
Besides,

387
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,120
Qin has grown up.

388
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,620
In a few years,

389
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,560
it'll be time for us to arrange her

390
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,580
a good marriage.

391
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,570
By then,

392
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,790
it won't matter

393
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,790
whether she's Vice Minister or not.

394
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,210
Father, Mother.

395
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,790
I'm not feeling well.

396
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,170
I'll take my leave.

397
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,420
Look at her.

398
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,860
She has no manners at all.

399
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,220
The commission was not completed.

400
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,140
We did fail the commission,

401
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,470
but we can continue

402
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,870
our cooperation, right?

403
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,110
Why?

404
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,290
It's obvious that

405
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,430
there are other people who are also

406
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,610
interested in that thing you are looking for.

407
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,950
Now you're out in the open, while they're hiding in the dark.

408
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,110
No matter what you want to do,

409
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,440
your hands will be tied.

410
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,240
I want to catch them too.

411
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,030
So

412
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,670
the enemy of my enemy

413
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,490
is naturally my friend.

414
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,050
What?

415
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,270
So you're also trying to dance around the problem, Vice Minister Li?

416
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,910
You know things I don't,

417
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,870
and I can complete

418
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,110
things you can't.

419
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,180
It's good for both of us

420
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,650
to exchange information.

421
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,880
Okay.

422
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,110
I might as well

423
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,080
tell you directly, Vice Minister Li, that

424
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,480
the thing I'm looking for

425
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,510
is related to

426
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,700
a man named Du Zixu.

427
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,150
Du Zixu?

428
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,720
Three years ago,

429
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,550
the Minister of Rites was seriously ill.

430
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,470
He was dying.

431
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,990
He got all the famous doctors to treat him, but he couldn't be cured.

432
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,990
He was about to die of severe sickness,

433
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,730
when a man named Du Zixu showed up

434
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,950
and cured him.

435
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,090
The reason why he could cure Minister

436
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,870
is said to be that he used a miracle drug.

437
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,100
Drug, drug, drug.

438
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,540
What exactly

439
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,600
is this Du Zixu's background?

440
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,480
No one knows his background.

441
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,110
It's only known that he's from the Western Regions.

442
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,350
After he cured Minister,

443
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,530
he disappeared

444
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,890
and never showed up again.

445
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,350
It's hard to find a good doctor.

446
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,480
It's not surprising

447
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,200
that he did that, right?

448
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,590
But the weird thing is that

449
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,950
all the doctors who treated the Minister of Rites

450
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,360
said that

451
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,870
Minister

452
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,690
didn't suffer any real illness.

453
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,620
He was only old and frail,

454
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,950
and his time had come.

455
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,400
So everyone wants to know

456
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,750
what on earth

457
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,580
Du Zixu used

458
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,870
to cure the minister.

459
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,270
Is this

460
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,940
that drug?

461
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,490
This is just a guiding drug.

462
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,260
Alibaba.

463
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,570
I'm on vacation with Vice Minister.

464
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,950
Stop delivering the official documents for now.

465
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,630
Wait till Vice Minister returns.

466
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,350
Hu Si.

467
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,990
Merrily... the ospreys cry,

468
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,870
Merrily...

469
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,590
Merrily...

470
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,050
Merrily... Merrily...

471
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,920
Merrily the ospreys cry.

472
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,840
Merrily... Merrily the ospreys cry.

473
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,670
On...

474
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,870
On...

475
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,420
On the islet in the stream.

476
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,110
G...

477
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,870
G...

478
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,510
Gentle and graceful is the girl.

479
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,310
Gentle and graceful is the girl.

480
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,030
A...

481
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,870
A fit wife for the gentleman.

482
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,750
A fit wife for the gentleman.

483
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,270
Wife for the gentleman. Wife for the gentleman.

484
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,970
After listening to it so many times,

485
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,230
I almost memorized it.

486
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,570
But it's not your fault.

487
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,230
Alibaba.

488
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,940
Can't you teach him something simpler?

489
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,200
Who can remember that?

490
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,180
No.

491
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,090
"There are 300 poems in the Book of Poetry.

492
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,490
Let there be no evil in your thoughts."

493
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,830
He has to start from the basics.

494
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,120
What?

495
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,770
Besides, even you memorized it.

496
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,420
Why can't Chen Shi memorize it?

497
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,170
Right?

498
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,620
Chen Shi.

499
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,310
Besides memorizing it,

500
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,890
you have to picture yourself in the poem.

501
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,670
Look.

502
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,350
In spring,

503
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,750
a bird

504
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,800
is chirping in the daylight.

505
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,370
Chirping.

506
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,140
Just like what you did just now,

507
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,550
chirping like that.

508
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,920
The other bird

509
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,240
hears its cry,

510
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,830
and it responds

511
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,480
with the same sound.

512
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,380
They reach for the sky together.

513
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,040
They are like moths to a flame.

514
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,510
By the river,

515
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,230
a beautiful girl

516
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,830
gets startled by the birds and raises her head.

517
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,150
A young man passing by

518
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,220
sees her.

519
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,550
Since she's a beauty,

520
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,860
he can't get her out of his mind after seeing her.

521
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,470
If he can't see her for a day,

522
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,170
he misses her like crazy.

523
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,150
Do you

524
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,820
understand?

525
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,150
I

526
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,250
really don't understand.

527
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,190
You are this good,

528
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,240
yet you still failed to pass the Mandarin Level 8 Exam.

529
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,030
How hard

530
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,410
must this exam be?

531
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,330
I...

532
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,720
Mr. Wang.

533
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,770
Alibaba.

534
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,070
Now that Vice Minister Shangguan is on leave,

535
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,270
are you on heat again?

536
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,920
You...

537
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

538
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:30,830
Alibaba.

539
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,700
This is the summary of the last case.

540
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,300
Please deliver it to Vice Minister Shangguan.

541
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,270
On the islet in the stream.

542
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,110
Chen Shi.

543
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,000
Please deliver this

544
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,400
to Vice Minister.

545
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,900
Got it.

546
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,320
Be careful.

547
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,350
Merrily...

548
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,040
What's the rush?

549
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,080
Merrily the ospreys cry.

550
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,870
On the islet in the stream.

551
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,980
Gentle...

552
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,710
Gentle and graceful is the girl.

553
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,590
Gentle and graceful is the girl.

554
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,650
Still on this line.

555
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,270
A fit wife for the gentleman.

556
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,790
A fit wife for the gentleman.

557
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,350
Chen Shi.

558
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:15,950
Got it.

559
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,440
Chen Shi.

560
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,300
-Have a walnut.
-I'll be on my way.

561
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,110
It broke.

562
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:20,620
Stupid.

563
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,240
Bye.

564
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,280
Alibaba.

565
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,150
I'm on vacation with Vice Minister.

566
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,890
Stop delivering the official documents for now.

567
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,750
Wait till Vice Minister returns.

568
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,760
Hu Si.

569
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:08,530
[Court of Judicial Review]

570
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,440
Vice Minister Shangguan.

571
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Vice Minister Li.

572
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,960
Aren't you on leave today?

573
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,620
Yes.

574
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,990
But there's some official business

575
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,390
I'm still worried about.

576
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,040
It doesn't happen all the time.

577
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,700
No big deal.

578
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,900
Vice Minister Li.

579
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,670
[Court of Judicial Review]

580
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,000
Vice Minister Li.

581
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,110
Today...

582
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,630
Assistant Minister.

583
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,390
Vice Minister Shangguan, you are here too.

584
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:00,870
What?

585
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,690
Don't you think I should be here?

586
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,400
It's not like that.

587
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,110
It's just

588
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,110
your outfit today…

589
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,430
Vice Minister Shangguan

590
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,860
is supposed to be on leave today.

591
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,190
Since I'm already here,

592
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,540
that means I'm no longer on leave.

593
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,600
Let's get down to official business.

594
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,550
Okay.

595
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,290
Please.

596
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,150
Please.

597
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,600
[Court of Judicial Review]

598
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,460
Come here. Have a seat.

599
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,780
How is it, Alibaba?

600
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,310
Did you get your "fit wife"?

601
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,990
Hey.

602
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,650
Can you stop

603
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,750
acting dumb with all that nonsense?

604
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,740
How about this?

605
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,280
I have an idea for you.

606
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,390
You can go

607
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,670
ask Cui Bei for help.

608
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,740
Ask him to follow Vice Minister Shangguan around

609
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,840
for a day.

610
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,600
I guarantee that all kinds of bad things will happen

611
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,590
to Vice Minister Shangguan on that day.

612
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,570
Then you'll have plenty of chances

613
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,030
to be a hero in front of her.

614
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,560
This...

615
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,920
Don't be like this.

616
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,100
I can hear you.

617
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,860
There seems to be a man in the deep mountain.

618
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,500
Clad in creeping vine and girded with ivy.

619
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,030
Where is this poem from?

620
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,920
This is a Song of Chu.

621
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,870
Guys.

622
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,470
Guys.

623
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,360
Guys, bad news.

624
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,780
A case happened.

625
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,190
Vice Minister Shangguan and Mr. Li

626
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,030
both went there.

627
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,630
Hurry up.

628
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,750
Vice Minister Shangguan is also there?

629
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,390
Hurry up.

630
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,190
Let's go.

631
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,050
It's the yard in front.

632
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,750
Hurry up.

633
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,350
Hurry.

634
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,480
Who's the deceased?

635
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,440
His name is Qin Wan.

636
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,080
He was Chancellor

637
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,120
Qin Shu's younger brother.

638
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,990
This is

639
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,720
the Qin family's side yard.

640
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,950
Otherwise, we wouldn't have

641
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,910
asked the Court of Judicial Review for help.

642
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,950
What is a chancellor?

643
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,070
It's the title of an official position.

644
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,020
The Chancellor is in charge of the Imperial College.

645
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,880
So it's a high-ranking official.

646
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,200
Who found him?

647
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,800
It was a cat.

648
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,630
A resident

649
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,800
nearby

650
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,020
heard a cat meowing

651
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,780
when it was almost dawn.

652
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,530
What season is it? Why are the cats still on heat?

653
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,690
This place was robbed.

654
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,800
It's so weird.

655
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,210
The way the deceased died was also weird.

656
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,520
Is he inside?

657
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,740
I'll leave the scene

658
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,510
to the Court of Judicial Review.

659
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,100
Thank you.

660
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,010
Be careful.

661
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,950
Isn't this the coroner

662
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,190
of the Court of Judicial Review?

663
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,100
When did he come?

664
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,310
I didn't see him.

665
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,510
Bai is the most mysterious person

666
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,940
in the Court of Judicial Review.

667
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,790
You don't need to know

668
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,630
when he comes.

669
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,640
And you don't need to know

670
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,660
when he leaves.

671
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,680
Just know that whenever you need him,

672
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,540
he'll be there.

673
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,230
This cat sucked human blood.

674
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,320
It should be a stray cat nearby.

675
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,810
It was attracted here by the smell of blood,

676
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,210
thus the body was found.

677
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,260
I'll step out for a while.

678
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,670
I'm sorry.

679
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,250
Madam.

680
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,030
Madam.

681
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,480
There are obvious marks of strangulation on his neck,

682
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,800
but they're not fatal.

683
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,730
The fatal wound

684
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,500
is this stab wound on his chest.

685
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,710
The time of death

686
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,330
should be less than a day ago.

687
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,570
Vice Minister Shangguan.

688
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,560
What? Why are you following me?

689
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,000
This is mint cream.

690
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:10,980
Apply some.

691
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,870
It's refreshing, and it can help clear your mind.

692
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,560
Okay, thank you.

693
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,100
Wine.

694
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,900
What is this smell?

695
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,260
Five Minerals Powder

696
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,860
Before he died,

697
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,000
he took Five Minerals Powder.

698
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,090
Five Minerals Powder?

699
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,040
Wang Qi, Sun Bao.

700
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,450
Go inquire of the residents nearby

701
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,310
about this guy.

702
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,150
Yes.

703
00:33:59,470 --> 00:33:59,980
Yes.

704
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:17,850
Madam.

705
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,699
Look.

706
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:49,659
Vice Minister.

707
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,889
I found something.

708
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,790
Let's go.

709
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,660
This way.

710
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,930
What is it?

711
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,350
Someone stepped on this box

712
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,610
to climb over the wall.

713
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,440
He's probably the murderer.

714
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:16,920
How did it go?

715
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,450
We asked around.

716
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,310
It seems that Qin Wan was very withdrawn.

717
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,580
He was rarely seen.

718
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,770
And no one knows

719
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,450
he was the younger brother of the Chancellor.

720
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,100
But there's something weird.

721
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,510
Shengping Mansion is

722
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,620
a deserted and lonely place in the city.

723
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,480
The Qin family is a famous family.

724
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,750
Given his status,

725
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,630
how could Qin Wan

726
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,700
possibly have lived here?

727
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,230
According to Assistant Minister of Justice,

728
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,490
it's because Qin Wan violated family rules

729
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,470
and discredited the family

730
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,520
that he was expelled by the Imperial College,

731
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,590
and even got kicked out of the house by Qin Shu.

732
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,460
For a noble family,

733
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,650
being kicked out of the house

734
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,850
equals being exiled.

735
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,110
So what crime

736
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,230
did Qin Wan commit?

737
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,870
It's said to be related to Five Minerals Powder.

738
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,470
It's probably because Qin Wan was addicted to Five Minerals Powder

739
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,600
and behaved absurdly

740
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,800
that he got expelled.

741
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,950
Wait, everyone.

742
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,300
So,

743
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,650
what is Five Minerals Powder exactly?

744
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,000
Five Minerals Powder.

745
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,510
Have you heard of alchemy?

746
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,840
Alchemy?

747
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,620
I've heard of it.

748
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,610
It's the process of making magic pills,

749
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,410
which can make people immortal.

750
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,190
There are no

751
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,140
real immortals in this world.

752
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,480
But there are indeed some
alchemists

753
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,870
who believe in the story of immortals,

754
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,770
using gold and stone as raw material

755
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,570
to make some kind of magic pills.

756
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,390
Of course they failed to make magic pills.

757
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,920
That's how Five Minerals Powder came into being.

758
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,030
The so-called Five Minerals Powder

759
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,710
is actually a collective name.

760
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,780
Anyway, it's formulated

761
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,830
by the medicines and stone needles

762
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,990
with the nature of dryness and heat.

763
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,800
There are potent ingredients like

764
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,680
sulfur,

765
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,470
orpiment,

766
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,560
and cinnabar in it.

767
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,830
It's said that after taking it,

768
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,990
people will feel uplifted,

769
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,370
or even attain enlightenment

770
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,760
to get a glimpse of the realm of immortals.

771
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,160
But this is all wild talk.

772
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,110
The so-called "attaining enlightenment"

773
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,630
is just

774
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,700
the illusion after being poisoned.

775
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,740
But...

776
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,510
But cinnabar, sulfur, and the other ingredients

777
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,680
are all poison.

778
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,080
How can humans eat them?

779
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,030
Yes.

780
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,510
Wine is also poison.

781
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,070
But some people like it.

782
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:54,510
I quit.

783
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,180
I quit.

784
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,450
Be careful.

785
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,200
Sun Bao, are you all right?

786
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,720
Not only that.

787
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,150
Maybe it's because of

788
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,590
the story of the immortals

789
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,010
that Five Minerals Powder grew particularly popular

790
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,120
in the past two years.

791
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,520
It even became a fashion.

792
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,700
Many people got addicted to it.

793
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,990
In that case,

794
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,150
Qin Wan was a black sheep.

795
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,730
Chancellor Qin Shu

796
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,010
is in charge of the Imperial College.

797
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,830
He is strict in studies and ruling the family.

798
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,560
Why does he have such a brother?

799
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,870
You've been beating around the bush,

800
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,150
and no one got to the point.

801
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,880
The point is these footprints.

802
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,970
This is a homicide.

803
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,350
And the murderer escaped over the wall.

804
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,130
The murderer is very likely to be the one

805
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,430
who left these footprints.

806
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,190
The key is to find him.

807
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,140
Vice Minister Shangguan is right.

808
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,970
Do you have any directions?

809
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,940
Of course I have my own directions.

810
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,400
But you can go ahead first, Vice Minister Li.

811
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,610
I suggest

812
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,480
we start with ice.

813
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,350
Ice?

814
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,430
Five Minerals Powder is very effective.

815
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,420
It must be accompanied with dispersal.

816
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,340
Otherwise,

817
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,350
the internal heat generated will attack the heart.

818
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,350
It's very painful.

819
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,760
And those who take it often

820
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,270
will have extremely sensitive skin.

821
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,100
They can't wear new clothes,

822
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,110
only old clothes.

823
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,110
It's also true to the body

824
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,150
we saw just now.

825
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,230
This is also the reason

826
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,710
why he took his clothes off.

827
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,120
To disperse the effect of the medicine,

828
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,830
they usually choose to sleep on cold beds,

829
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,410
eat cold food and...

830
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,690
Iced wine.

831
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,810
Yes, iced wine.

832
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:18,990
So I suggest

833
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,320
we start with the investigation on ice.

834
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:21,910
Besides,

835
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,350
ice is hard to store.

836
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,480
He must have had ready access upon use.

837
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,650
So the person who stepped on this box

838
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,580
to enter the room

839
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,440
was probably

840
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,340
here to deliver the ice.

841
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,410
Deliver the ice?

842
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,970
Besides, the bottom of this box is particularly wet.

843
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,570
It must be because the ice melted after a night.

844
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,140
All right.

845
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,590
Since we've got the clues,

846
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,370
let's waste no time

847
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,320
and start investigating.

848
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,250
Maybe after we find that person,

849
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,190
everything will be clear.

850
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,470
Okay. Let’s split up.

851
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,230
Chen Shi, come with me.

852
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:44,910
As for the rest,

853
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,280
they'll be at your disposal, Vice Minister Shangguan.

854
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,870
Alright.

855
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,270
We'll start with

856
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:48,760
the ice.

857
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:49,390
Okay.

858
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,750
I'll go to the Qin Mansion.

859
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,950
Hopefully there will be some new clues.

860
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:53,480
Let's go.

861
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,470
Let's go.

862
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:57,790
Come on.

863
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:02,760
Mr. Li.

864
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,470
Isn't today

865
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,790
Vice Minister Shangguan's day off?

866
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,520
Why is she...

867
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,670
There must be a reason

868
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,950
why Vice Minister Shangguan

869
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,680
returned from her leave early.

870
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,730
I heard that

871
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,450
her father, Minister Shangguan,

872
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,760
is very dissatisfied

873
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,010
with her working in the Court of Judicial Review.

874
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:17,930
How come?

875
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,150
It's rare to see female officials.

876
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,360
That's what we think.

877
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,750
But not everyone

878
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,680
thinks this way.

879
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,230
Vice Minister Shangguan

880
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,660
was summoned by Her Majesty

881
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,830
and passed multiple assessments

882
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,950
to get in the Court of Judicial Review.

883
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,210
It's actually harder for her to be an official

884
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,270
than ordinary men.

885
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,690
She sincerely

886
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,490
wants to be a good vice minister.

887
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,870
Let's go to the Qin Mansion.

888
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,470
Let's go.

889
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,550
Cui Bei.

890
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,340
How many ice stores are there near Shengping Mansion?

891
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:47,990
Three.

892
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,210
They're on Qingyu Street, Qili Street,

893
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,920
and Xianliu Lane respectively.

894
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,390
Alibaba, do you remember that?

895
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,170
How many ice stores are there

896
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,570
near Shengping Mansion?

897
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,470
Go away.

898
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,770
What?

899
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,830
So you know?

900
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,740
There are three.

901
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,890
They're on Qili Street, Qingyu Street,

902
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,690
and Xianliu Lane respectively.

903
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,590
Okay, let's check one by one.

Something just occurred to me.

906
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,040
Qin Wan was in the Imperial College before.

907
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,710
That place is also a clue.

908
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,990
It's worth investigating.

909
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,030
How about this?

910
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,520
Let's split up into two groups to investigate.

911
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,980
It will be more efficient.

912
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,750
Lord, what do you think?

913
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,210
Okay.

914
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,030
What a coincidence.

915
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,950
This place is not far from the ice store on Qili Street.

916
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,820
Lord, you should go there.

917
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,680
We'll go to the Imperial College.

I never thought

00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,670
I could investigate cases with you, Vice Minister Shangguan.

I'm worried that

957
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,570
it may be self-defeating.

958
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,860
Let me tell you.

959
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,210
My nickname in Yangzhou

960
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,820
is Matchmaker Sai.

961
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,050
Just wait and see.

962
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,210
What about me?

963
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,330
It's been so long, and I never had any companion.
