00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,330
or a monster?

199
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,010
If the world sees that you are

200
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,850
a half-human and half-cat,

201
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,070
would they still let you be

202
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,870
the vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review?

203
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,250
Vice Minister!

204
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,990
-Vice Minister!
-Mr. Li!

205
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,390
It's us, Vice Minister!

206
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,550
-Vice Minister!
-Vice Minister!

207
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,880
It's us, Vice Minister!

208
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,430
I think he's fine now.

209
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,430
Hurry up. Let go of him.

210
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,160
Let go of him!

211
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,440
Vice Minister!

212
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,450
Vice Minister!

213
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,290
Vice Minister!

214
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,470
Are you all right?

215
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,710
That's great.

216
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,630
Vice Minister!

217
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,490
-Vice Minister!
-Vice Minister!

218
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,000
An auspicious sign?

219
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,350
Yes.

220
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,740
The mythical beast has descended

221
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,510
to wish that our country will be prosperous and peaceful

222
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,670
and that Your Majesty's

223
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,000
empire will be eternal.

224
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,960
An auspicious sign?

225
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,590
A mythical beast?

226
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,070
What are you waiting for?

227
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,270
Three days later,

228
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,750
the auspicious sign will descend in Shendu.

229
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,110
Your Majesty, please come to Ming Hall to welcome the auspicious sign

230
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,320
to enlighten the world

231
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,450
and pray for the country's blessings.

232
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,710
This is also what everyone in Yong'an Pavilion

233
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,310
wants.

234
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,230
What about the case

235
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,270
where the demon cat recently reappeared?

236
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,430
And where is Li Bing?

237
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,780
That case has passed.

238
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,100
Your Majesty.

239
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,940
It's better not to ask about it.

240
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,030
As for Li Bing,

241
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,290
his old injury has relapsed

242
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,550
and is now incurable.

243
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,550
What did you say?

244
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,230
Regarding the auspicious sign,

245
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,870
please give a response.

246
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,380
As you wish.

247
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,370
Thank you, Your Majesty.

248
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,730
-Vice Minister!
-Vice Minister!

249
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,830
Vice Minister!

250
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,420
Vice Minister!

251
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,420
-My Lord!
-Vice Minister!

252
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,280
Mr. Li!

253
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,570
Vice Minister!

254

-Vice Minister!
-Vice Minister!

255

Mr. Li!

256
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,180
Vice Minister!

257
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,280
There are no traces.

258
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,030
Would someone

259
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,770
notice Vice Minister?

260
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,900
Vice Minister!

261
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,010
Vice Minister!

262
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,470
Vice Minister!

263
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,730
My Lord, where are you?

264
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,730
Ask yourself.

265
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,800
Are you a human

266
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,990
or a monster?

267
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,430
Even if you find out the truth,

268
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,790
will others believe you?

269
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,420
Will they?

270
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,130
If one day,

271
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,900
the world sees that

272
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,430
you are a half-human and half-cat,

273
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,200
would they still let you be

274
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,000
the vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review?

275
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,080
Son.

276
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,800
I'm here to see you again.

277
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,460
[Memorial tablet of beloved son, Xiaoyi]

278
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,300
If you hear me,

279
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,550
come to my dream.

280
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,800
I hope those water ghosts

281
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,010
won't pester you anymore

282
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,710
in the underworld.

283
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,660
[Memorial tablet of beloved son, Xiaoyi]

284
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,430
Son!

285
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,820
Son!

286
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,070
Son!

287
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Is that you?

288
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:20,930
Be careful.

289
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,320
Whose child are you?

290
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,730
Thank you.

291
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,920
You're welcome.

292
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,650
Young man.

293
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,280
It's still a long way

294
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,190
to the village.

295
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,570
Do you think

296
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,670
you can accompany me there?

297
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,110
Young man.

298
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,410
Where are you from?

299
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:40,770
I...

300
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,490
was just passing by.

301
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,420
Thank you, young man.

302
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,720
When we get to the village,

303
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,310
come have a rest at my house.

304
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,790
Thank you.

305
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,270
But it's fine.

306
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,990
It's late.

307
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,490
Why are you out alone?

308
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,660
My son

309
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,090
was captured by water ghosts.

310
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,990
I couldn't find him anywhere.

311
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,350
As an old woman, there's nothing I could do.

312
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,350
So I set up a memorial tablet for him.

313
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,750
I was worried.

314
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,150
So, when I'm free,

315
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,300
I come visit him often to talk to him.

316
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,260
You can't trust the rumors about water ghosts.

317
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,190
He went missing.

318
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,510
Did you report it to the government?

319
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,030
This place is very remote.

320
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,620
How can we report to the government?

321
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,180
The villagers

322
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,970
said it was the water ghosts' doing.

323
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,700
They make it sound so realistic

324
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,810
that you can't help but believe it.

325
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,250
Give it to me.

326
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,340
No.

327
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,130
Wait for me.

328
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,040
Madam.

329
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,750
We're almost at the village entrance.

330
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,150
I'll send you until here.

331
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,830
We're already in the village.

332
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,240
Come to my home to drink some water

333
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,100
and have a rest.

334
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,470
It's fine.

335
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,630
Thank you so much.

336
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,400
Mrs. Liu.

337
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,320
Why are you here?

338
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,480
We've been looking for you.

339
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,110
Aren't you afraid

340
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,870
the water ghosts would catch you?

341
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,390
This is...

342
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:01,780
This...

343
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,040
Mrs. Liu, you're back.

344
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,430
D-Demon!

345
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,200
Demon!

346
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,390
G-Get him!

347
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,030
Look.

348
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,360
Hurry up.

349
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,240
Vice Minister!

350
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,520
Hurry up.

351
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,110
He helped me just now.

352
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,510
He's not a demon.

353
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,630
You're blind.

354
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,710
He's really a demon!

355
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,280
He can't be a demon.

356
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,350
What are you waiting for?

357
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,010
Step aside.

358
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,320
Vice Minister!

359
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,150
Put the things down!

360
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,060
We are from the Court of Judicial Review!

361
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,710
We are from the Court of Judicial Review!

362
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,160
Mr. Li!

363
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,990
We finally found you.

364
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,820
The Court of Judicial Review!

365
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,480
The Court of Judicial Review!

366
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,430
Mr. Li.

367
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,930
Don't leave again.

368
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,400
We agreed

369
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,070
to investigate the case together.

370
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,330
No matter what you are,

371
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,920
we will never abandon you.

372
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,090
Vice Minister.

373
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,580
We've gone through fire and water

374
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,910
together so many times.

375
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,250
If you keep doing this,

376
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,510
you'll be hurting me.

377
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,930
Vice Minister.

378
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,030
We're all in this together.

379
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,740
Time reveals a man's heart.

380
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,560
Vice Minister.

381
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,780
Did you find something?

382
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,540
Du Zixu came to Shendu

383
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,110
to hunt down Yi Zhi Hua.

384
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,410
He used the bones of Fengsheng Beasts

385
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,350
to make the magical medicine

386
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,980
and bewitched Yong'an Pavilion.

387
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,080
He hoped to find

388
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,930
through them

389
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,890
the dagger that can kill Yi Zhi Hua.

390
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,750
But for immortality, Yong'an Pavilion

391
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,430
did not hesitate to launch a war

392
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,890
and destroyed Zixu State.

393
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,620
But even so,

394
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,030
they still couldn't find Yi Zhi Hua.

395
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,870
They only found some

396
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,140
remnants of the bones of Fengsheng Beasts.

397
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,540
So they brought them back

398
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,590
to Shendu to use as the guiding drug.

399
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,880
My father found out

400
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,540
some of the truth of this case,

401
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,590
so Yong'an Pavilion was wary of him...

402
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,680
and killed him to silence him.

403
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,510
When Qiu Qingzhi returned in triumph,

404
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,910
he was also recruited by Yong'an Pavilion

405
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,310
and cut ties with me and my father.

406
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,910
On my way back to my hometown,

407
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,670
I was ambushed by Yong'an Pavilion.

408
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,710
But I had to run into Yi Zhi Hua

409
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,110
and he turned me into this state.

410
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,280
According to what you just said,

411
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,270
Yong'an Pavilion has now

412
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,510
found Yi Zhi Hua.

413
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,310
I'm afraid that dagger

414
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,310
was also obtained by Qiu Qingzhi.

415
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,850
In that case...

416
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,750
In that case,

417
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,530
those villains have won.

418
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,090
The universe is ruthless.

419
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,040
We almost died on the battlefield,

420
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,350
but it was actually for these bastards.

421
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,410
No.

422
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,030
What do you think?

423
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,990
I...

424
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,440
I'm not sure.

425
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,750
I just think

426
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,250
I've seen Yi Zhi Hua

427
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,440
and General Qiu.

428
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,600
I also know my brother is...

429
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,110
I just want to say

430
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,920
humans are not that simple.

431
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,920
If we consolidate all the cases

432
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,910
that arose from the demon cat

433
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,350
into one case...

434
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,950
there are three suspects in this case:

435
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,010
Yong'an Pavilion,

436
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,000
Yi Zhi Hua...

437
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,520
and Qiu Qingzhi.

438
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,830
The motive of Yong'an Pavilion is very clear.

439
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,790
They're willing to risk the country and the people for immortality.

440
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,050
But I don't understand

441
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,110
the other two's motives.

442
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,030
According to what Yi Zhi Hua has said,

443
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,510
that his goal is

444
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,680
to find that dagger,

445
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,000
then why did he go to great lengths

446
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,010
to hide behind the scenes

447
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,950
and guide us

448
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,610
to find the truth step by step?

449
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,270
He didn't have to do that.

450
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,820
He even turned me

451
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,270
into the same state as him.

452
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,870
He's not an ordinary person.

453
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,840
I'm afraid

454
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,850
we can't speculate based on logic.

455
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,170
No.

456
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,730
I believe that no matter how strange a person is,

457
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,750
in his world,

458
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,640
it must be logically consistent.

459
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,030
Qiu Qingzhi

460
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,460
just wants to get promoted and make a fortune.

461
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,990
What's so strange about it?

462
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,630
I don't think he's such a person.

463
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,110
No matter what,

464
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,440
until the criminals have been brought to justice,

465
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,560
I won't give up.

466
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,470
They just got what they want for now.

467
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,910
Actually, since I mutated,

468
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,420
I

469
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,360
have always been scared.

470
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,540
I was afraid of

471
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,910
being treated as a demon

472
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
or a monster.

473
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,040
But I'm not afraid anymore.

474
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,520
Whether I'm a human or a cat,

475
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,010
I'm still the vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review.

476
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,020
As long as I'm here

477
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,680
and you are all here,

478
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,280
the Court of Judicial Review

479
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,830
has no reason to bow down

480
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,870
to criminals.

481
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,450
Appearances don't matter.

482
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,700
It's your actions that matter.

483
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,030
Right and wrong exists.

484
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,310
Justice prevails.

485
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,960
Just do good deeds

486
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,010
and do not worry about the future.

487
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:16,910
Madam.

488
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:17,880
Here.

489
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,620
Thank you.

490
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,730
This is...

491
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,700
Vice Minister.

492
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,690
Vice Minister.

493
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,310
I heard

494
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,540
from them

495
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,090
that you were harmed by a villain

496
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,000
and got a strange disease,

497
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,590
so you became like this.

498
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,140
We were ignorant

499
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,330
and even treated you as a demon.

500
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,020
I'm really sorry.

501
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,700
N-No need.

502
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,450
You really don't have to be like this.

503
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,610
Young man...

504
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,410
Vice Minister.

505
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,670
Everyone.

506
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,280
I have a request.

507
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,110
Is it about your son?

508
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,890
Vice Minister,

509
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,550
we know

510
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,300
the case you're dealing with is more important.

511
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,490
We shouldn't

512
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,270
bother you with our trivial matter.

513
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,010
But the water ghosts are really making a scene,

514
00:25:59,010 --> 00:25:59,470
so we...

515
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,360
Don't worry.

516
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,750
We all know that.

517
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,990
There is no big or small case.

518
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,480
All cases are equally important.

519
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,220
There also aren't that many supernatural beings.

520
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,240
Don't be afraid.

521
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,510
Support all elders like you do your parents.

522
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,000
We are all from the Court of Judicial Review.

523
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,730
The Court of Judicial Review is the place

524
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,070
where right and wrong is discerned.

525
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,510
Yes.

526
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,910
Go ahead.

527
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,220
The myth of the water ghosts

528
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,830
started three years ago.

529
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,740
At that time,

530
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,580
there were ghost soldiers in the village crossing the border.

531
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,710
Ghost soldiers crossing the border?

532
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,710
I saw it with my own eyes.

533
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,660
At that time,

534
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,180
I had a piece of land at the border of the village.

535
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,830
One day, I was tidying up the land

536
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,050
and it was too late

537
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,510
to go back to the village,

538
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,940
so I stayed there.

539
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,310
In the end,

540
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,420
I saw it at night...

541
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,180
I was terrified.

542
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,580
The next day,

543
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,540
I brought people

544
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,010
to see it,

545
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,920
b-but there were no footprints

546
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,510
in the grass.

547
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,410
Even the road that was there

548
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,510
was gone!

549
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,210
Sir.

550
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,090
Don't be anxious.

551
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,680
Then,

552
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,040
what's the matter about the water ghosts?

553
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,310
After the ghost soldiers crossed the border,

554
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,550
the village was in panic for a while.

555
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,600
But gradually,

556
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,150
they disappeared.

557
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,340
So no one

558
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,860
took it seriously.

559
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,130
Who knew that

560
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,290
not long ago,

561
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,460
I saw it again.

562
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,750
It's you again?

563
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,920
You're almost as psychic as Cui Bei.

564
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,330
What did you see again?

565
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,010
Our village is next to the river.

566
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,750
Everyone makes use of local resources

567
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,790
accessible to them.

568
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,750
Many people make a living

569
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,750
with the river.

570
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,160
We are no exception.

571
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,670
So I found

572
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,030
a secluded river branch

573
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,070
and set a trap.

574
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,800
That night,

575
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,640
I went to retrieve the trap.

576
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,230
It scared me to death.

577
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:44,670
Then

578
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,380
did the water ghost do anything to you?

579
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,030
No.

580
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,740
When I looked at the river again,

581
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,140
he disappeared.

582
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,070
Then,

583
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,040
what happened with the man's disappearance?

584
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,500
After I met the water ghost,

585
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,490
I went back to the village

586
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,550
and told everyone.

587
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,190
But there was a young man

588
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,260
who didn't believe me

589
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,980
and went there to witness it personally.

590
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,430
That's my son.

591
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,750
He went to the river when it was dark,

592
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,170
and then he disappeared.

593
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,360
My darn son...

594
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:09,920
Madam.

595
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,550
C-Calm down.

596
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,750
There are no demons in this world.

597
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,080
There must be something behind this case.

598
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,220
Maybe this case

599
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,820
is even related to

600
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,950
our investigation.

601
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,090
Madam, don't worry.

602
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,570
We will find out the truth.

603
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,870
This place is very close to the death-row prison.

604
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,950
The ghost soldiers crossing the border

605
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,430
happened three years ago.

606
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,680
Maybe

607
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,440
it coincided with the prison's riot.

608
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,720
So,

609
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,670
the so-called ghost soldiers and water ghosts

610
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,430
are most likely

611
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,360
old death-row soldiers

612
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,900
who escaped from prison?

613
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,970
After those old soldiers escaped,

614
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,950
they disappeared for three years.

615
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,280
Where were they hiding?

616
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,340
Why did they

617
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,300
suddenly appear recently?

618
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,230
And why did they capture the villagers?

619
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,550
How about this?

620
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,820
Tomorrow morning,

621
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,870
Wang Qi and Cui Bei,

622
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,170
you two go back to Shendu

623
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,530
and check out the situation in the city.

624
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,380
The rest of you,

625
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,460
follow me to investigate the details of the old soldiers.

626
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,220
-Yes.
-Yes.

627
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:23,200
[As swift as wind and lightning]

628
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:03,910
This is

629
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,310
where the villagers who witnessed the water ghosts

630
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,560
saw the ghost flames.

631
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,560
Be careful.

632
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,380
A boat?

633
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,180
It seems that this river cove

634
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,590
is a hidden wharf.

635
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,350
This river is a tributary of the canal.

636
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,060
Following this river,

637
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,880
in a few miles,

638
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,030
it would be the goods yard in Dragon King Temple

639
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,370
of the hidden-corpse case.

640
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,430
Before, in order to investigate

641
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,250
the wharf case,

642
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,280
I asked Shuidao and Qucheng

643
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,230
to check out the hydrology

644
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,360
of the entire river.

645
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,590
A team in hiding

646
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,090
needs supplies.

647
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,920
In this case,

648
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,070
three years ago,

649
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,750
the old soldiers of the underground death row

650
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,550
escaped from prison

651
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,220
and hid in the mountains and wilderness.

652
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
They established

653
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,960
a secret channel

654
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,870
to communicate with the outside world for supplies.

655
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,020
They are afraid of being discovered,

656
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,480
so they often move around at night.

657
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,740
And those ghost flames

658
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,790
are what they use

659
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,650
to locate and contact each other.

660
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,530
In that case,

661
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,320
they should be hiding nearby.

662
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,710
This shabby path is too difficult to walk.

663
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,840
This shabby path...

664
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,720
Those at the back,

665
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,430
keep up.

666
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:21,910
Sirs.

667
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,740
What's wrong?

668
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,140
Are you going into the city?

669
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,760
Yes.

670
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,980
You can't go in now.

671
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,150
-Why?
-Why?

672
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,910
I heard that an auspicious sign was discovered.

673
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,420
Her Majesty is holding a ceremony.

674
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,750
The city gate is closed.

675
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,540
Look.

676
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,480
I have to pull

677
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,190
two carriages of goods back.

678
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:35,880
Let's go.

679
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,190
Let's go.

680
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,760
Let's go.

681
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,540
Why is the city gate closed

682
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,120
in broad daylight?

683
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,780
What should we do now?

684
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,920
How would I know?

685
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,870
Think of a way.

686
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,030
We can only go back

687
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,950
and discuss with everyone.

688
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:48,640
Good idea.

689
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,830
Be careful.

690
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,590
Come on.

691
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,290
There's an ambush.

692
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,670
Vice Minister, leave it to me.

693
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,070
This...

694
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,510
Be careful.

695
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,890
Impressive.

696
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,400
There are so many traps.

697
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,860
The way out is right ahead.

698
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:54,660
Let's go.

699
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,060
Be careful.

700
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,750
Thank you, Mr. Li.

701
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,030
There is no trace of anyone.

702
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:31,920
Let's go in and have a look.

703
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,469
Yes.

704
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,110
Yes.

705
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:20,780
This...

706
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,950
Unbelievable. It's a different world altogether.

707
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,110
This is a military camp.

708
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,150
Those old soldiers

709
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,950
have lived here for three years.

710
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,910
Where are they?

711
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,100
There's smoke.

712
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,310
Let's go.

713
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,460
Be careful.

714
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,440
Who is it?

715
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,510
Who's outside?

716
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,390
Let me.

717
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,020
-Let me help you.
-Hurry.

718
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,010
Be careful.

719
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,070
Who's outside?

720
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,830
You are...

721
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,060
Come on.

722
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,510
Come on.

723
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,900
Don't be afraid.

724
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,430
Come on.

725
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,070
Come on.

726
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,190
Be careful.

727
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,850
Be careful.

728
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,080
I brought this all upon myself.

729
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,160
I heard from an old man from my village

730
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,660
that there are water ghosts.

731
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,920
I was seeking novelty.

732
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,940
And I really met him.

733
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,490
He's not a ghost,

734
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,390
but a human.

735
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,610
A person captured me all the way here.

736
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,740
Did they do anything to you?

737
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,140
No.

738
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,420
After he locked me in the cave,

739
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,910
he sealed the entrance.

740
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,400
I was terrified at first.

741
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,480
But then

742
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,310
no one cared about me the whole time.

743
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,810
I became confused.

744
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,940
I didn't know what was going on.

745
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,460
I eat when I'm hungry,

746
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,000
drink when I'm thirsty,

747
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,730
and sleep when I'm sleepy.

748
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,350
Wait.

749
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,340
There are even food and drinks?

750
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,720
Both food and drinks.

751
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,410
There's full bedding too.

752
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,050
Actually,

753
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,160
apart from being confused,

754
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,870
life is quite comfortable.

755
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,830
Did you see anything

756
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,130
or hear anything?

757
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,350
I was brought in

758
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,450
with my eyes covered.

759
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,940
After I was locked in the cave,

760
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,380
I tried to run away.

761
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,150
I saw a crack on the door,

762
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,020
so I looked outside.

763
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,420
But I didn't see it clearly.

764
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,070
It was very vague.

765
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,510
I saw a large group of people.

766
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,510
But...

767
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,500
three days ago,

768
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,350
they all disappeared.

769
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,280
I didn't hear from them after that.

770
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,100
It's been three days.

771
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,880
Your mother is going crazy from worrying about you.

772
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,780
You should hurry back to the village.

773
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,340
Okay.

774
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:12,590
He's back!

775
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,380
He's back!

776
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,720
Grandma!

777
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,190
Mother!

778
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:16,920
Son!

779
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,080
Mother!

780
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:18,710
Son!

781
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,550
Mother!

782
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,040
You darn child.

783
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,300
You almost worried me to death!

784
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,130
It's all my fault.

785
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,610
I shouldn't have wandered around.

786
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,370
Are you hurt?

787
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:30,910
Madam.

788
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,630
He's fine.

789
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,840
Don't worry.

790
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,650
Thank you, Vice Minister.

791
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,380
Thank you, everyone.

792
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,670
You're welcome.

793
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,530
Vice Minister.

794
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,190
Then

795
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,100
are there really water ghosts?

796
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,250
No.

797
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,370
It was just

798
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,240
humans hurting other humans.

799
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,040
-No?
-There are no water ghosts?

800
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,420
I never believed there were water ghosts.

801
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,100
Excuse me.

802
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,790
Excuse me.

803
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,310
Vice Minister.

804
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,170
Vice Minister.

805
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,510
Mother!

806
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,680
An auspicious sign?

807
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,170
I don't know what Qiu Qingzhi

808
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,900
and Yong'an Pavilion are up to.

809
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,790
Are they trying to

810
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,190
repeat their old tricks?

811
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,510
People from Yong'an Pavilion are bloodthirsty after taking the medicine.

812
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,590
Although they live on,

813
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,410
it's hard to show up in front of people.

814
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,900
But if an auspicious sign descended from heaven,

815
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,530
they could re-appear in the mortal world

816
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,460
in the name of the auspicious sign.

817
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,310
This auspicious sign is very likely

818
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,170
to be Yi Zhi Hua.

819
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,230
Just like how

820
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,360
the Demon Cat Case resurfaced yesterday?

821
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,160
That's right.

822
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:28,930
Oh no.

823
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,570
What's wrong, Mr. Li?

824
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,780
Her Majesty may be in danger.

825
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,580
-What?
-What?

826
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,560
Her Majesty rules by the heavenly mandate.

827
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,800
If they want to hold the ceremony,

828
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,030
they must get the approval of Her Majesty.

829
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,740
I'm afraid they'll threaten Her Majesty.

830
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,990
Just like how the Demon Cat Case

831
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,900
required the endorsement of the Court of Judicial Review.

832
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,780
So,

833
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,030
those old soldiers hiding

834
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,800
were prepared by Yong'an Pavilion?

835
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,590
But Hu

836
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,820
seems to be with them.

837
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,680
He couldn't be

838
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,490
obeying those old monsters in Yong'an Pavilion.

839
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,380
What if...

840
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,320
No matter what,

841
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,550
we can't consider everything.

842
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,320
The old soldiers went missing

843
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,050
three days ago.

844
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,280
That means three days ago,

845
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,150
they've already infiltrated Shendu.

846
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,920
The ceremony is tomorrow.

847
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,040
We have to hurry back to Shendu.

848
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,710
But

849
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,900
the city gate is closed

850
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,900
and Shendu is sealed.

851
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,230
Everyone there is from Yong'an Pavilion.

852
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,950
We

853
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,880
are fugitives now.

854
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,770
We can't fly even if we have wings.

855
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,190
Fly?

856
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,610
Vice Minister.

857
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:29,990
This...

858
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,620
Well...

859
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,260
Vice Minister.

860
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:31,860
Everyone,

861
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,510
can you help us

862
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,430
make something?

863
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,360
Make something?

864
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,240
How is it?

865
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,760
Impressive.

866
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,140
I've been working all my life

867
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,980
but I've never made this before.

868
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,590
Vice Minister.

869
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,570
Can this thing

870
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,580
really fly to the sky?

871
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,090
Yes.

872
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
I even fell off it from above before.

873
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,050
It's windy.

874
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:01,830
Get ready.

875
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,480
This...

876
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,710
We're flying it right after it was made.

877
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,940
Is it really safe?

878
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,800
A virtuous person will not worry; a brave person will not be afraid.

879
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,440
The thing is we've never flown on this before.

880
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,190
Well...

881
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:11,970
It's okay.

882
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,590
Mr. Li and I have experience.

883
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,070
I didn't notice anything wrong.

884
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,920
All the best.

885
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,560
You can do it.

886
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,410
I'm sure of it.

887
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,350
Let's go.

888
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,430
What is he doing?

889
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,240
Yeah.

890
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,810
I've never seen it before.

891
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,470
This...

892
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,690
Be careful of the torch.

893
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,750
It's rising!

894
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,400
It can really fly.

895
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,270
Don't just stand there.

896
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,910
Get in.

897
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,050
Okay, let's go.

898
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,750
Be careful.

899
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,450
Be careful.

900
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,780
Vice Minister.

901
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,190
It can fit so many people?

902
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,120
We'll get going.

903
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,930
Thank you, everyone.

904
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:03,450
We'll get going.

905
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,030
Go back.

906
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,950
Goodbye, everyone.

907
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,470
Everyone, take care.

908
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,070
I'm leaving.

909
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,510
Thank you.

910
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,350
See you again!

911
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,070
Go back. See you.

912
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,190
Take care.

913
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,710
Go back.

914
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,430
Go back.

915
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,510
Take care.

916
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,560
[Court of Judicial Review]
