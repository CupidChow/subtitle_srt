General Qiu.

11
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,829
How have you been?

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,400
Come on.

Show General Qiu to his seat now.

14
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,060
Yes.

15
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,920
No need.

16
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,810
I’m not here today

17
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,040
to have a chat.

18
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,350
I have two business matters to attend to.

00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,610
I'll leave after that.

20
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,990
The first matter.

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,050
Vice Minister Shangguan.

22
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,500
The Jinwu Guards want to

23
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,650
take these two criminals away.

24
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,850
Here, Vice Minister.

25
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,810
General Qiu, you sure are well informed.

26
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,860
These two criminals

27
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,150
were just caught by my Court of Judicial Review.

28
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,950
What right do you have to take them away?

29
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,110
Why did you capture them?

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,310
These two are the real culprits

31
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,090
in the recent trafficking case.

32
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,400
They are also the robbery duo

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,260
responsible for multiple lives.

34
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,010
These two men were prisoners

35
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,450
who escaped from death row in Duji Circuit.

36
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,720
My department has been trying to arrest them for a long time

37
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,500
but to no avail.

38
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,990
I didn't expect them to be found by the Court of Judicial Review.

39
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,430
All criminal cases in Duji Circuit

40
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,390
are under the jurisdiction of the Jinwu Guards.

41
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,070
I would really like to thank you

42
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,930
for finding the criminals for us.

43
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,390
For the second matter,

44
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,440
I’m here to ask you

45
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,000
how the demon cat murder case is going.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,590
With this case,

47
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,180
Minister made it very clear.

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,950
the Court of Judicial Review has to clarify this case.

50
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,410
Well...

51
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,490
The ten days are up.

53
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,140
How is it going?

54
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,360
General Qiu, you sure remember

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,060
the affairs of the Court of Judicial Review well.

56
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,070
I'm responsible for supervising this matter.

57
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,080
It's my duty.

58
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,770
Of course I can't be careless.

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,210
Vice Minister Shangguan.

60
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,630
How is it going?

61
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,860
The suspect...

62
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,980
has been captured.

63
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,140
Hu Si.

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,079
Yes.

65
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,310
Go get Wang Qi and the others.

66
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,750
Yes.

67
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,240
This case is handled by my subordinates

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,580
of Mingjing Hall of the Court of Judicial Review.

69
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,130
They were the ones who caught them.

70
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,990
They should tell you the details.

71
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,690
Mingjing Hall?

72
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,140
I heard you solved

73
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,600
the demon cat murder case.

74
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,909
I didn't expect you

75
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,270
to crack such a big case.

76
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,090
One really mustn't judge a book by its cover.

77
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,659
Is he praising us?

78
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,540
He said we look stupid.

79
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:57,890
I wonder

80
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,240
how you solved the case.

81
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,420
Who is the suspect?

82
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,860
How did you solve

83
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,360
such a strange case?

84
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,240
With this case...

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,940
Isn't the suspect

86
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,000
already locked up?

87
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,670
Take General Qiu to have a look.

88
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,340
Yes.

89
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,070
My Lord.

90
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,640
It's no use talking. Lead the way.

91
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,190
Okay.

92
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,670
Y-Y-You are...

93
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,060
You're awake?

94
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,470
You...

95
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,930
Who are you?

96
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,370
I'm from the Court of Judicial Review.

97
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,970
But I appeared a little late.

98
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,830
You haven't really seen me before.

99
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,130
This is the token of the Court of Judicial Review.

100
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,790
That case is closed.

101
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,740
Everything is settled?

102
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,630
Yes.

103
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,230
Then...

104
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,790
can I go?

105
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,520
Go.

106
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,900
Then...

107
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,900
Where are they?

108
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:27,950
Who?

109
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,000
T-T-There's a foreigner

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,750
with a lot of things hanging on him.

111
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,600
Jingling and jangling.

112
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,780
It's noisy when he walks.

113
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,240
And a talkative officer

114
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,920
and a fair-skinned man who doesn't talk.

115
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,950
Are you talking about the people from the Court of Judicial Review?

116
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,080
They have other cases to investigate.

117
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,460
Don't worry about them.

118
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,560
Move aside.

119
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,500
My Lord.

120
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,480
Should we reconsider this matter?

121
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,310
Let’s talk about it after today.

122
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,610
Vice Minister Shangguan.

123
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,130
Where is the criminal you mentioned?

124
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,690
What happened?

125
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,940
Vice Minister.

126
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,040
Where is the person and the cat?

127
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,590
Vice Minister Shangguan.

128
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,260
You should know

129
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,100
the demon cat murder case is very important.

130
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,640
I'm afraid you

131
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,680
can't be accountable to Minister.

132
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,510
I'll take my leave.

133
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,910
What case is he talking about?

134
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,600
What case?

135
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,640
What case?

136
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,360
Ten days ago,

137
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,790
there was a demon cat murder case.

138
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,190
The case is complicated.

139
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,390
The dead body is hung on Zhuque Gate.

140
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,880
It will be Meng Chun in a few days.

141
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,230
Her Majesty's Harvest Ceremony will be held in Ming Hall.

142
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,960
This is a serious matter.

143
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,770
When all the officials arrive,

144
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,030
they must pass through Zhuque Gate.

145
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,010
This case

146
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,390
is extremely ominous.

147
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,390
It also compromises the dignity of the imperial court.

148
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,190
That's right.

149
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,960
You're quick to understand.

150
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,429
The minister who is in charge of the ceremony

151
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,590
handed this matter to the Court of Judicial Review.

152
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,510
Qiu Qingzhi's scheming

153
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,110
must have played a part in it.

154
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,610
This case obviously happened in Shendu,

155
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,140
but it was assigned to the Court of Judicial Review

156
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,929
for us to take the lead.

157
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,510
They're bullying us

158
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,370
for not having someone in charge,

159
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,950
but just a vice minister.

160
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,560
Madam.

161
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,010
This is a serious case.

162
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,310
It’s not a case

163
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,350
of Mingjing Hall.

164
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,910
I don't think it has

165
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,070
anything to do with us.

166
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,390
We'll take our leave.

167
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,920
How is it irrelevant to you?

168
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,160
Didn't you catch a cat

169
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,690
in your trafficking case?

170
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,270
That cat was very fierce.

171
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,310
Its background is unknown and it was very strange.

172
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,350
Then, it somehow escaped from prison

173
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,150
for no reason.

174
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,390
It even escaped from prison

175
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,390
when it was in the hands of the people of Mingjing Hall.

176
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,770
Madam.

177
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,670
It was just a stray cat.

178
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,510
How do you know that cat

179
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,510
is not a demon cat?

180
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
And that Chen Shi.

181
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,670
How do you know he didn't commit the crime

182
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,790
or is not an accomplice?

183
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,110
I...

184
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,910
Don't try to steer clear of this.

185
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,630
Since you caught

186
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,690
the cat and person,

187
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,450
and you also lost them,

188
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,110
you should get them back.

189
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,240
The deadline is three days.

190
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,270
If your people of Mingjing Hall

191
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,400
can’t get them back,

192
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,350
I can't

193
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,880
ask Minister for leniency.

194
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,430
The Court of Judicial Review

195
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,560
can't be magnanimous towards you lot.

196
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,590
Hu Si!

197
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,790
Hurry up and arrange the arrest warrant

198
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,870
for them.

199
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,830
Yes.

200
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,190
Guys,

201
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,190
we're all colleagues.

202
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,850
Let's forgo the formalities.

203
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,200
Vice Minister.

204
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,880
Why do I feel like

205
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,200
you want us to take the blame?

206
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,990
Nonsense!

207
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,740
Every one of you has been at

208
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,750
the Court of Judicial Review

209
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,950
for quite a while now.

210
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,290
Have you accomplished anything decent?

211
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,390
The assessment is coming soon.

212
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:07,830
I'm giving you

213
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,590
a great chance to make contributions.

214
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,020
If you don't seize it,

215
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,390
don't blame me.

216
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,310
Don't blame me.

217
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,960
All right.

218
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,230
I'm going to report

219
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,960
to Minister.

220
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,090
You guys had better

221
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,740
hurry up

222
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,840
and catch the demon cat.

223
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,340
Hurry up, you guys.

224
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,070
The Demon Cat Case is so dangerous.

225
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,640
It will eventually fall on me.

226
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,480
This is fine too.

227
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,340
Now I don't have to worry about it.

228
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,290
Wait, where is the wild cat?

229
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,000
Didn't I tell you?

230
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,220
I released it.

231
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,960
You released it?

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,300
It's just a cat.

233
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,980
Why should we lock it up?

234
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,450
Wait.

235
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,500
I-It's not an ordinary cat.

236
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,470
It can write,

237
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,530
light fireworks,

238
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,310
and even catch bad guys for me.

239
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,180
Also, it was drugged

240
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,960
and injured.

241
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,670
What if something happens to it?

242
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,670
How could you have just released it?

243
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,270
I didn't expect someone to care so much

244
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,060
about a cat.

245
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,830
Whether it's a cat

246
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,190
or anything else,

247
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,750
that's it.

248
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,910
This matter is over.

249
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,980
Leave.

250
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,720
What about the girl?

251
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,590
T-The girl from the tavern.

252
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,840
She didn't mean it.

253
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,600
She was forced

254
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,970
t-to steal things.

255
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,070
Please don't...

256
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,740
d-don't punish her.

257
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,350
She should have been sent to Jici Hall

258
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:32,950
by someone

259
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,920
from the Court of Judicial Review.

260
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,830
W-What about her family?

261
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,080
Well...

262
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,400
That depends on whether anyone comes

263
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,170
to find her.

264
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,860
This does not fall under the jurisdiction of

265
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,520
the Court of Judicial Review.

266
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,770
She's quite pitiful.

267
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,480
If no one comes to find her,

268
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,210
how will she live in the future?

269
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,610
Wait.

270
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,200
You helped the Court of Judicial Review solve the case.

271
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,260
I can do you a favor.

272
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,360
The Court of Judicial Review

273
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,240
owes no favors.

274
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,560
Officer.

275
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,820
Please promise me to help that girl

276
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,790
find her family.

277
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,800
How about

278
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,370
I treat you to a meal first?

279
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,470
-Let’s go.
-Sure!

280
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,170
Gosh.

281
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,350
This place is so deserted.

282
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,980
This is the side yard of the Court of Judicial Review.

283
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,980
No one has lived here for a long time.

284
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,490
This way.

285
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,910
Officer.

286
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,520
How did I get here?

287
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,880
I just remember

288
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,700
I was in a daze.

289
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,480
Did the wild cat drag me here?

290
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,500
Wasn't that cat

291
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,840
drugged by someone?

292
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,980
It even bit you.

293
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,700
Then the knockout drops entered your bloodstream.

294
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,300
So,

295
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,930
what you saw were illusions.

296
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,690
Illusions?

297
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,950
Yes, illusions...

298
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,830
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

299
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,780
The Demon Cat Case.

300
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,060
What bad luck.

301
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,880
I just wanted to solve a case.

302
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,050
Why did a cat come out of this?

303
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,950
It's even related to demons.

304
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,270
They want us to catch demons.

305
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,990
There are no demons in this world.

306
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,380
Where are we going to catch demons?

307
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,060
Vice Minister Shangguan is obviously

308
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,070
trying to make us take the blame.

309
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,510
Wait.

310
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,740
You guys, say something.

311
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,840
There's nothing I can do.

312
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,380
Much ado about nothing.

313
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,060
I feel helpless.

314
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,240
What are you going on about?

315
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,130
What have you been learning from Cui Bei?

316
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,470
You're always throwing around poetic verses.

317
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,950
If this case can't be solved,

318
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,290
we'll be banished together.

319
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:56,780
Don't think this has

320
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,980
nothing to do with you.

321
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,540
I...

322
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,830
I'm just a chief clerk.

323
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,980
I take notes on case files every day.

324
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,510
I'm afraid I can't help you.

325
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,970
I'm just a judge.

326
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,140
Besides, I'm a foreigner.

327
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,320
I haven't taken the Mandarin Level 8 Exam

328
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,420
and am not a regular employee

329
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,190
authorized by the Court of Judicial Review yet.

330
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,390
Although I'm the judicial commissioner,

331
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,440
I mainly work outside.

332
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,530
Besides, you've always been in charge

333
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,630
of the Court of Judicial Review's affairs.

334
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,690
The plan to lure the snake out of the hole was also yours.

335
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,490
Fine. Fine.

336
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,120
You guys have no conscience.

337
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,160
Usually, none of you

338
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,210
respects me.

339
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,260
But when there's trouble,

340
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,710
I'm in charge.

341
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:27,730
Also,

342
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,160
what's wrong with my plan?

343
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,910
Are we talking about the same thing now?

344
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,790
I'm talking about the demon cat murder case!

345
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,750
What does it have to do with what happened before?

346
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,620
I know what this is! Everything has consequences.

347
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,140
Then...

348
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,260
That cat

349
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,090
was lost by Sun Bao though?

350
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,640
Wait.

351
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,300
You have no idea

352
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,610
how scary that cat was.

353
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,790
It's not my fault.

354
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,550
And that cat was very abnormal.

355
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,270
Maybe

356
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,350
it really is a demon.

357
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,640
What are you talking about?

358
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,550
Are you serious?

359
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,710
We work in the Court of Judicial Review.

360
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,870
The Court of Judicial Review is where criminal sentencing is determined

361
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,400
and where right and wrong are judged.

362
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,480
What do we have to do

363
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,760
with those monsters and demons?

364
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,880
There are no demons in this world.

365
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,050
Sun Bao, none!

366
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,150
And that Chen Shi

367
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
is obviously a fool.

368
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,560
He said the cat was writing with its claws.

369
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,090
That's nonsense.

370
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,950
That day at the shop,

371
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,010
the cat was very brave.

372
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,440
Alibaba and I saw it with our own eyes.

373
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,310
And the fireworks.

374
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,350
Who left them? How do you explain it?

375
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,810
Yes, seeing is believing.

376
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,890
According to the Classic of Mountains and Seas,

377
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,130
there is a beast on Yiwang Mountain

378
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,480
which looks like a wild cat.

379
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,530
It has one eye and three tails.

380
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,650
It's called the Huan badger.

381
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,050
Its calls are louder than that of a hundred animals.

382
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,280
It can ward off evil spirits.

383
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,920
What we're saying now

384
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,900
is all useless.

385
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,210
The Demon Cat Case

386
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,450
is hanging here.

387
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,660
If anything goes wrong

388
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,710
at that Harvest Ceremony,

389
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,570
Her Majesty will blame Minister,

390
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,050
and Minister will blame it

391
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,080
on the Court of Judicial Review.

392
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,610
Vice Minister is in charge of the Court of Judicial Review,

393
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,600
so she will blame it

394
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,290
on the few of us

395
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,290
at Mingjing Hall.

396
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,440
Who will be the scapegoat in the end?

397
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,170
Slow down. I can't record everything.

398
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,130
I just think

399
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,450
Chen Shi and that cat

400
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,280
helped us.

401
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,620
He's not a demon.

402
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,210
Well...

403
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,930
We talked for so long but got nowhere.

404
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,140
Everyone,

405
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,450
prepare to be disbanded.

406
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,110
Disbanded.

407
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,420
Disbanded!

408
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,770
I think

409
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,440
when times are difficult,

410
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,440
we should make a last-ditch attempt.

411
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,930
Speaking of looking for someone,

412
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,930
I know a master.

413
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,010
Shendu is really huge.

414
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,570
The scenery of Shendu

415
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,230
is really nostalgic.

416
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:30,950
Officer.

417
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,820
Are you not from Shendu?

418
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,730
I was on a business trip.

419
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,770
I just came back.

420
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,030
What are you doing at Shendu?

421
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,470
To make a living?

422
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,780
No.

423
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,260
I'm looking for my brother.

424
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,650
My brother is in Shendu.

425
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,530
You are really interesting.

426
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,510
I said I owe you a favor.

427
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,520
Rather than asking me to find your brother,

428
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,970
you asked me to look for the family

429
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,830
of the girl, a complete stranger.

430
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,970
I'm a grown man.

431
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,240
I can think of a way myself.

432
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,560
But that girl is too young

433
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,450
and her family doesn't know

434
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,180
where she is.

435
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,250
In a few years,

436
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,450
she will change a lot.

437
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,349
By then,

438
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,890
her family won't be able to recognize her.

439
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,089
Fine.

440
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,599
I promise you

441
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,770
to find her family.

442
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,010
Really, Officer?

443
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,390
A gentleman keeps his word.

444
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,660
[Zuixian Restaurant]

445
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,920
Here it is.

446
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:33,930
Sirs.

447
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,640
Come in.

448
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
This way, please.

449
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,020
What would you like to eat?

450
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,880
Claypot rice,

451
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,730
stir-fried meat,

452
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,790
and cold porridge.

453
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,040
You're a regular?

454
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,270
You look unfamiliar.

455
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,780
I haven't been here for a while.

456
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,580
So I specially came to try it out.

457
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,930
And wontons from the opposite 24th row.

458
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,530
Two bowls.

459
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,010
You really know your food.

460
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,400
You even take care of the business across the street.

461
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,930
Hurry up. I'm starving.

462
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,250
Okay, wait a moment.

463
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,950
What are you going to do

464
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,090
after finding your brother?

465
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,360
I don't know. We'll see.

466
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,650
He's my only family.

467
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,080
I haven't seen him in a long time.

468
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,770
My brother

469
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,880
left home a few years ago.

470
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,840
My parents died a long time ago as well.

471
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,690
I grew up

472
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,090
begging for food.

473
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,200
I've never dreamed about seeing him again.

474
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,070
Who would have thought

475
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,190
I'd receive his letter.

476
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,020
That's why I came to Shendu to look for him.

477
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,480
You can write?

478
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,400
[Go]

479
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,850
But I can't read.

480
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,150
I thought you can't read?

481
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,940
Someone looked for me and read it

482
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,570
for me...

483
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,770
Officer.

484
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,400
How do you know I can't read?

485
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,820
I...

486
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,100
guessed it.

487
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,510
Do you think Shendu is good?

488
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,960
Of course. Why not?

489
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,700
For example, look at this.

490
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,720
Well...

491
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,390
It's just...

492
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,890
I don't know how to put it.

493
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,910
It's just good.

494
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Except for being slightly dizzying

495
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,760
and having too many people.

496
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,890
There are also no other living things.

497
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,280
Other living things?

498
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,200
Cows, sheep, pigs, chickens,

499
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,520
dogs,

500
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,520
wild cats...

501
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,010
Speaking of wild cats,

502
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,280
I wonder

503
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,600
how it's been.

504
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,820
This is a bite by that cat?

505
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,320
It didn't do it on purpose.

506
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,380
How do you know?

507
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,150
I've been playing with wild cats since I was a kid.

508
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,920
I know

509
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,370
that wild cat would never

510
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,950
bite anyone for no reason.

511
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,040
That wild cat is really smart.

512
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
It would be great if I could raise it.

513
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,570
You still want to raise that cat?

514
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,450
That wild cat understands human sentiment.

515
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,770
It's obvious it can't

516
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,050
get along with other cats.

517
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,250
If it plays alone,

518
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,490
it will be very lonely.

519
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,050
So if someone takes care of it

520
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,050
and plays with it,

521
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,280
it won't be lonely.

522
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,850
By the way, Officer,

523
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,770
I don't know your name yet.

524
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,630
Don't be so formal with me.

525
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,110
My name is Li Bing.

526
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,220
Mr. Li!

527
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,340
It's here.

528
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,130
Here.

529
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,570
I'll bring you the wontons.

530
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,120
Okay.

531
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,010
Thank you.

532
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,100
Waiter!

533
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,440
For your stir-fried meat,

534
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,050
don't you usually use

535
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,120
the most tender tenderloin?

536
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,440
Why is it pork belly today?

537
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,830
Your boss didn't make it?

538
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,910
You sure know your food.

539
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,910
Our boss is not in.

540
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,410
Our female boss cooked these.

541
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,010
Our boss

542
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,560
went to buy groceries at the West Market this morning.

543
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,090
But he hasn't come back yet.

544
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,760
This morning?

545
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,220
The female boss said that.

546
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,610
Isn't Mr. Wang single?

547
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,090
When does he have a wife?

548
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,950
Last year, they just got married.

549
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,970
Enjoy.

550
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,450
Chen Shi.

551
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,120
Stop eating.

552
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,010
Let's go.

553
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,510
Sir, you...

554
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,810
You haven't paid yet.

555
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,490
The bill is not important.

556
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,330
Your boss

557
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,500
might be in trouble.

558
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:38,970
What?

559
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,840
What are you talking about?

560
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,160
Are you trying to dine and dash?

561
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,360
Keep your voice down.

562
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,040
You just said

563
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:44,680
your boss

564
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,060
went to the West Market this morning.

565
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,950
Mr. Wang cares a lot about the ingredients.

566
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,080
Even if there are leftover ingredients,

567
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,110
he will never reuse them the next day.

568
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,710
But the claypot rice just now

569
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,870
was stiff and dull.

570
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,380
It was obviously cooked with leftover rice.

571
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,700
As a waiter,

572
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,710
don't tell me you don't even know that?

573
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,950
That means

574
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,570
since you closed yesterday,

575
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,090
your boss wasn't here.

576
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,130
Then why

577
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,620
would the female boss lie?

578
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,380
The female boss is much younger than the boss,

579
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:08,880
right?

580
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:09,760
Yes.

581
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,070
They often quarrel too?

582
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,700
Yes.

583
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,790
How do you know?

584
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,090
There was a faint smell

585
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,040
of pomegranate juice on the plate just now.

586
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,500
Pomegranate juice

587
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,670
is a raw material for good rouge.

588
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,400
I think that person

589
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,480
must value

590
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,370
her appearance.

591
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,300
She even uses

592
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,330
such strong rouge while cooking.

593
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,390
It's not hard to guess

594
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,290
her age.

595
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,610
As for why they often quarrel...

596
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,880
Mr. Wang is very strict with the dishes.

597
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,490
This was found in your dish.

598
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,530
Would he have tolerated it?

599
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,200
And you.

600
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,420
As a waiter,

601
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,620
you stay in the restaurant every day.

602
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,820
But last night,

603
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,780
you must have been absent.

604
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,630
Yes.

605
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,380
The female boss gave me a day off.

606
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,410
How do you know everything?

607
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,520
You reek of alcohol.

608
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,160
If you stayed in the restaurant,

609
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,490
would your boss have let you drink so much?

610
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,160
Is the boss of the wontons from the opposite 24th row

611
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,720
still that widower?

612
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,630
Yes.

613
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,230
Since this morning...

614
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,170
has he been there

615
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,300
cleaning the store?

616
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,090
[Wang's Wontons]

617
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,400
Yes.

618
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,780
What does that mean?

619
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,900
I... well...

620
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,690
The taste of the wontons from the opposite 24th row

621
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,750
hasn't changed...

622
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,450
but the taste of the soup has changed.

623
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,200
There's an additional aspect

624
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,840
and a missing aspect.

625
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,230
The additional aspect is the fragrance of pomegranate juice,

626
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,940
while the missing aspect is a procedure.

627
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,670
He didn't use bamboo leaves to remove the grease.

628
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,870
Not only can bamboo leaves remove grease,

629
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,070
[Bamboo leaf water]

630
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,570
but also blood.

631
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,840
Impossible.

632
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,770
We'll have to report it regardless of its possibility.

633
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,030
We'll find out after the investigation.

634
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:10,800
R-R-Re...

635
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,430
Report it.

636
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,850
Report it.

637
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,520
[Wang's Wontons]

638
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,790
Why are you so impressive?

639
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,830
You noticed so many things.

640
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,880
I just...

641
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,140
observe things carefully.

642
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,340
And this.

643
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,770
You're much better than those guys.

644
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,410
I didn't expect

645
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,820
the Court of Judicial Review to be in such a mess now.

646
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,950
But even though they

647
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
are stupid,

648
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,030
they're at least not evil.

649
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,070
They can't be

650
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,660
as stupid as me.

651
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,070
I doubt it.

652
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,870
I think you are decent.

653
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,230
Nothing.

654
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,590
By the way, Mr. Li.

655
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,050
Should I

656
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,270
go back to the Court of Judicial Review?

657
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,290
Why do you keep thinking about

658
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,250
returning to the Court of Judicial Review?

659
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,060
Because I have to testify.

660
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,740
If it were a murder just now,

661
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,840
I have to testify.

662
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,000
That was how it used to be like...

663
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,650
Enough.

664
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,090
I'll take care of this.

665
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:09,820
Don't worry.

666
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,760
I'm still curious.

667
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,930
Aren't you from the Court of Judicial Review?

668
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,030
Why do you still need that waiter

669
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,760
to report it?

670
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,760
It's not convenient for me.

671
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,740
I have something else to do.

672
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,060
A case?

673
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,960
A very tricky case.

674
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,890
It's very difficult.

675
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,090
But I will find out the truth.

676
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,050
What case?

677
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,390
Why do you have so many questions?

678
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,870
Aren't you looking for

679
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,780
the girl's family?

680
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,110
You don't care anymore?

681
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,080
I do, of course.

682
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,160
The North Street of the South Market is right ahead.

683
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,020
Jici Hall is over there. Let's go.

684
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,660
Mr. Li. Mr. Li.

685
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,330
I suddenly remembered something.

686
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,530
It's very important.

687
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,990
We didn't pay

688
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,050
for our meal just now.

689
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,600
Well...

690
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,540
now...

691
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,610
I will pay for it next time.

692
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,660
Let's go.

693
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,850
Okay.

694
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,890
[Chen Shi, male, 25 years old]

695
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,360
Shangguan.

696
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,660
I heard from Qingzhi that

697
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,130
you have a lead on the suspect

698
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,670
of the demon cat murder case.

699
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,710
[Minister of Rites: Lyu Qing]

700
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,320
Yes.

701
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,400
The ten days are up.

702
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,710
When will we find out the truth?

703
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,220
We're investigating.

704
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,930
You're investigating?

705
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,500
When will we get the result?

706
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,850
This case is hard to solve.

707
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,030
We can't rush it.

708
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,180
Besides,

709
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,020
we have a lead now.

710
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,390
We just need a few days.

711
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,240
The ceremony will be held soon.

712
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,040
There aren't many days to spare.

713
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,770
Besides, I heard

714
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,690
the subordinates you mentioned

715
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,600
are actually a bunch of idling people

716
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,320
in the Court of Judicial Review

717
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,000
who has never solved a serious case before.

718
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,030
It's embarrassing to speculate

719
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,260
on this lead.

720
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,650
Vice Minister Shangguan.

721
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,600
Don't tell me you've already

722
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,590
made a plan to shirk the blame.

723
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,770
Qiu Qingzhi.

724
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,060
Don't be so aggressive.

725
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,560
You must be joking.

726
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,910
I'm just speaking the truth.

727
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,820
The Demon Cat Case,

728
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,050
logically,

729
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,390
is also under the jurisdiction of the Jinwu Guards.

730
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,040
Why did you shirk the entire responsibility

731
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,840
to the Court of Judicial Review?

732
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,020
Of course I should investigate it.

733
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,000
But if I figure it out first,

734
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,960
what would become of the Court of Judicial Review?

735
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,120
What do you mean?

736
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,920
Isn't the Court of Judicial Review still missing

737
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,210
a vice minister?

738
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,440
We can't delay the Demon Cat Case anymore.

739
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,400
The ceremony will be held in a few days.

740
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,620
I'm the host.

741
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,220
I can't become a laughingstock.

742
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,340
If the Court of Judicial Review

743
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,070
can crack the case, then great.

744
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,360
If not,

745
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,850
we'll just add one more supervisor.

746
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,950
Duji Circuit under General Qiu's jurisdiction

747
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,940
clearly has many talents.

748
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,490
There are plenty of talented youths

749
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,890
like General Qiu.

750
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,800
Thank you, Minister.

751
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,010
Duji Circuit is in charge of

752
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,980
criminal cases

753
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,290
and maintaining the long-term peace of Shendu.

754
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,290
The Court of Judicial Review

755
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,850
is proficient at adjudicating, sentencing,

756
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,110
and enforcing the law.

757
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,290
There are things

758
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,690
to learn from each other.

759
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,900
If the Court of Judicial Review needs help

760
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,960
