[White Cat Legend]

00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,160
[Episode 23]

4
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,060
What? You want to play with them?

5
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,110
I just think

6
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,170
Vice Minister Li looks too righteous

7
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,610
to be someone who'd sell his maid to a brothel.

8
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,940
No one would believe it.

9
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,910
Vice Minister Li is a two-faced

10
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,830
hypocrite.

11
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,780
He can make it.

12
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,360
You call

13
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,329
a prostitution business honest?

14
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,230
I told you.

15
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,750
That woman lied to us.

16
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,140
What woman?

17
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,510
Madam Wang who ran the tea house.

18
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,030
I bought

19
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,230
this maid from her.

20
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,010
When we made the deal, she promised

21
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,140
that if I didn't want this maid anymore,

22
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,530
I could come here and sell her to you.

23
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,430
She also said

24
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,060
she was close to people here.

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,110
Apparently,

26
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,150
she lied.

27
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,980
Are you talking about

28
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,310
the dead Madam Wang?

29
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,440
Who else could it be?

30
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,340
Her death

31
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,020
just made this maid inauspicious.

32
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,079
Or I wouldn't have come to sell such a…

33
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,300
Look at her.

34
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,470
I wouldn't have come

35
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,350
to sell her.

36
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,330
Forget it. Forget it.

37
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,030
Sir. Sir.

38
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,870
Calm down.

39
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,310
Don't be angry. Wait a second.

40
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,840
I'll go ask my boss about it.

41
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,610
Take a look at her.

42
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,220
Come with me.

43
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,280
They made it?

44
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,590
Sir,

45
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,870
I'd like two more bowls of wontons.

46
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,350
Okay.

47
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,270
Goodbye, sir.

48
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,840
Please come again.

49
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,370
You made it?

50
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
Tonight…

51
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,310
Chen Shi,

52
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,470
you'll stay with me.

53
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,430
We'll pretend to be customers who want to buy slaves.

54
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:10,900
Okay.

55
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,050
Vice Minister, how about us?

56
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,430
You'll keep an eye on the gates of the brothel.

57
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,029
Okay.

58
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,029
A dancer.

59
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,670
16 years old.

60
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,070
She's good at singing and dancing

61
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,470
and knows a thing or two about instruments.

62
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,230
She's good.

63
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,720
This girl is not bad.

64
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,580
Music.

65
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,880
Coming through.

66
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,600
Coming through.

67
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,040
Don't draw too much attention.

68
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,190
Mr. Li.

69
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,290
I was not looking around because I was curious.

70
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,020
Then why were you looking around?

71
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,570
I saw many servants just now.

72
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,270
I can't see any of them now.

73
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,610
Look up.

74
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,210
That room.

75
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,640
Sir.

76
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,840
Do you like any of the girls?

77
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,940
They're too ordinary.

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,790
Look.

79
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,280
I've brought enough money.

80
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,380
It's a pity that none of them are good enough.

81
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:02,970
Let's go.

82
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,240
Sirs, don't go.

83
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,870
We have better girls.

84
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,890
Come on.

85
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,210
Excuse me. Excuse me.

86
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,650
Come with me.

87
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,820
This way, please.

88
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,350
Sir,

89
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,420
you have very high standards.

90
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,620
The girls down there

91
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,750
can outshine most maids

92
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,080
and ladies of pleasure.

93
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,320
Come in.

94
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,020
Sir.

95
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,670
Let me feed you.

96
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,430
Here, let me fill your cup.

97
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,260
The servants can't go in.

98
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,150
He's my brother,

99
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,060
not my servant.

100
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,590
Can he come in now?

101
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,150
Sorry. We should've known better.

102
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,030
Please.

103
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,570
This girl

104
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,830
is so hot.

105
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,120
You haven't started working

106
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,380
but are already tired?

107
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,790
Why are you lying there?

108
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,260
Get up.

109
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,010
It hurts. It hurts.

110
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,890
You're good-looking.

111
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,990
Do you sing or dance?

112
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,400
A little.

113
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,140
Liar.

114
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,720
A girl like you

115
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,290
can only do manual labor.

116
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,559
Come with me.

117
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,010
Change your clothes.

118
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,360
I'm ticklish.

119
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,320
Ticklish?

120
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,210
You're just shy, aren't you?

121
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,360
Let me help you

122
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,690
overcome your shyness.

123
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,210
Let me help you change.

124
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,790
I can change myself.

125
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,710
How can I examine your body

126
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,910
if you do it yourself?

127
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,270
I can examine myself.

128
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,350
Examine yourself?

129
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,410
Cut the crap.

130
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,490
What do you want?

131
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,450
Listen carefully.

132
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,790
No matter

133
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,940
who you were before,

134
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,960
you're a slave on the market now.

135
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,190
After I dress you up,

136
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,790
maybe you can get picked by a rich family.

137
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,390
Behave.

138
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,110
I'm a human,

139
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,710
not an object.

140
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,720
Whose dress is this?

141
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,330
Some girl.

142
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,480
Where is she?

143
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,390
She just…

144
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,020
She just left.

145
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,050
Where did she go?

146
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,190
What are you doing?

147
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,360
This is not for you.

148
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,490
Your dress is here.

149
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,210
This dress.

150
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,270
This is your dress.

151
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,460
You'll wear this.

152
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,770
What are you doing?

153
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,900
Where are you going?

154
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,700
Beautiful.

155
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,090
Why aren't you watching?

156
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,190
Don't run so fast.

157
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,850
I mean no harm.

158
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,810
Chen Shi.

159
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,110
Naughty girl.

160
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,750
Where are you going?

161
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,050
Stop.

162
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,900
Stop.

163
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,510
Come.

164
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,240
Give me a hug.

165
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,550
Move!

166
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,310
Move!

167
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,320
That way.

168
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,950
Round her up.

169
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,630
Hurry up. That way.

170
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,630
Move! Move!

171
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,410
Move!

172
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,210
Take it.

173
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,590
Vulgar.

174
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,820
Be careful.

175
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,690
You spilled your wine.

176
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,310
Sorry. Sorry.

177
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,830
Baby.

178
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Take care.

179
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,450
Vice Minister.

180
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,170
Help, Vice Minister.

181
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:44,830
Let's go.

182
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,860
Help!

183
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,800
Vice Minister.

184
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,830
Another girl has been taken away.

185
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,390
Vice Minister.

186
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,020
Help!

187
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,790
Go get them. Hurry.

188
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,270
Okay.

189
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,320
Help!

190
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,510
Hurry!

191
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,390
Move!

192
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,830
Make way!

193
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,650
Move away. Move away.

194
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,540
Vice Minister.

195
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,350
You finally came.

196
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,460
Another girl

197
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,010
who wore the dress Sun Xiaoying made

198
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,040
was taken away.

199
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,510
Idiots.

200
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,780
What if

201
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,030
the slave buyer

202
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,110
didn't come today?

203
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,310
No.

204
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,950
Our plan is foolproof.

205
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,290
Vice Minister Li can definitely find him.

206
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,230
What if Wang Qi gets exposed?

207
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,480
He's good

208
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,310
at acting.

209
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:36,910
That won't happen.

210
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,770
Coming through. Coming through.

211
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,120
Have you seen

212
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,110
a carriage leaving?

213
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,950
No.

214
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,520
But Mr. Wang said

215
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,660
another girl was taken away.

216
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,390
Come with me.

217
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,700
Make way. Make way.

218
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,550
Make way. Make way.

219
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,200
Move away.

220
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,370
Make way. Make way.

221
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,490
Someone is coming.

222
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,580
You're a man.

223
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,130
Of course.

224
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,030
You have guts.

225
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,080
But this joke

226
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,190
is out of line.

227
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,470
This is not a joke.

228
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,370
We're from the Court of Judicial Review.

229
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,530
The Court of Judicial Review?

230
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,950
Officers.

231
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,900
This must be a misunderstanding.

232
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,960
Make way. Make way.

233
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,930
Break it up.

234
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,190
Continue to enjoy your night.

235
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,520
Break it up. Break it up.

236
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,070
Break it up.

237
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,800
Are you okay?

238
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,550
I'm fine.

239
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,450
Vice Minister.

240
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,430
We've been watching the gate.

241
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,630
No carriage has left.

242
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,910
No?

243
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,070
Don't move.

244
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,630
Are there secret doors in the brothel?

245
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,260
In the room you just visited,

246
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,350
there is a door leading

247
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,460
to the street outside.

248
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:43,990
Let's go.

249
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,630
Make way. Make way.

250
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,110
Make way.

251
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,550
Make way.

252
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,270
Make way.

253
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,670
Make way.

254
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,780
Liu?

255
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,910
Isn't Liu in Mingjing Hall?

256
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,670
This is Liu's dress.

257
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,140
She was lying all this time.

258
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,950
There was no

259
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,620
mysterious man.

260
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,190
It's she

261
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,510
who wants to avenge Sun Xiaoying.

262
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,200
Oh no.

263
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,420
The nerd, Cui Bei,

264
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,410
was with Liu.

265
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,650
Go back to Mingjing Hall now.

266
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,150
Yes.

267
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,270
The rest of you, follow me.

268
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:17,630
Go.

269
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,550
Hurry. Go. Go.

270
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,950
Do I look young

271
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,750
to you?

272
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,080
Look up at me.

273
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,230
I'm asking you.

274
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,310
Answer me.

275
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,850
I'm not sure.

276
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,150
You're not sure?

277
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,410
Look.

278
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,550
This painting is too old.

279
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,790
This painting is very old.

280
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,260
But the person hasn't aged a bit.

281
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,230
Why won't you look at me?

282
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,490
Are you scared?

283
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,740
It's so big here.

284
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,750
Are you here alone?

285
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,430
Yes.

286
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,390
It's only you

287
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,780
and me here.

288
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,150
I bought you,

289
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,830
so you have to listen to me.

290
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,940
I'm not a demanding master.

291
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,970
So don't be afraid.

292
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,390
What I want you to do

293
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,870
is very simple.

294
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,470
What…

295
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,870
What can I do for you?

296
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,030
Young.

297
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,590
It's good to be young.

298
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,140
I just want to borrow

299
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,070
some of your youth.

300
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,110
No.

301
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,680
It's a purchase.

302
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,270
Look.

303
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,240
Do you like them?

304
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,310
These are all yours.

305
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,070
I'll just borrow a little bit

306
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,580
every time.

307
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,550
Just a little bit.

308
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,240
Cui Bei.

309
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,950
Cui Bei.

310
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:10,990
Cui Bei.

311
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,930
Where is Liu?

312
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,230
What Liu?

313
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,640
Aren't you Wang Qi?

314
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,380
Your drink was spiked with

315
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,180
the drug human traffickers use.

316
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,220
Where is Xiaoying's body?

317
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,130
Vice Minister.

318
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,470
Why is this place

319
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,630
so weird?

320
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,210
The smell of blood.

321
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:09,990
What?

322
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,430
Stop! Calm down!

323
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,200
Put down the knife.

324
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,869
Put down the knife.

325
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,930
Put down the knife?

326
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,950
He killed so many girls.

327
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,079
How can you ask me to put down the knife?

328
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,680
Are you doing this for Sun Xiaoying?

329
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,270
Yes.

330
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,900
I killed those two women too.

331
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
For revenge?

332
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,610
Why?

333
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,970
You could've told us.

334
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,980
It has to be me.

335
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,490
I have to do it myself.

336
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,180
Xiaoying told me to run away.

337
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,170
Come down.

338
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,930
Come down.

339
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Come down.

340
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,360
Come down.

341
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,340
Why did you try to kill yourself?

342
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,750
Is that my wedding dress?

343
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,250
You don't want to get married?

344
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,310
Get married?

345
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,630
Wherever I go,

346
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,090
I'm just at others' mercy.

347
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,040
But at least I can decide

348
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,950
to end my life now.

349
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,550
Then run away.

350
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,550
What?

351
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,200
Since you don't want to get married,

352
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,370
let's run away.

353
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,950
Come.

354
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,810
You need to sneak out

355
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,710
with the laborers

356
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,310
before the city gate closes.

357
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,080
But where should I go?

358
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,630
You can go wherever you want.

359
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,630
The world is so big.

360
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,160
Get as far away as possible.

361
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,190
Look.

362
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,630
I embroidered this.

363
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,540
I'm an orphan.

364
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,310
Everyone pities me for having no parents.

365
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,020
But I'm used to being alone.

366
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,190
I feel free this way.

367
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,970
When I was a tailor,

368
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,270
I embroidered this bird

369
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,600
on every woman's dress.

370
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,130
I don't think women

371
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,470
should be caged birds.

372
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,430
They should fly high in the sky

373
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,330
through clouds

374
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,630
to the south sea.

375
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,110
I embroidered a dress for you as well.

376
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,070
I hope you like

377
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,400
the color of this dress.

378
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,030
What will you do after I leave?

379
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,130
I'll be fine.

380
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,470
I can take care of myself.

381
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,130
I've been a slave for ten years.

382
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,060
I was sold again and again and suffered a lot.

383
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,190
If it weren't for Xiaoying,

384
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,860
I wouldn't have thought of escaping.

385
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,780
I didn't know I had another choice

386
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,870
other than death.

387
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,390
Although I was only free for a few hours,

388
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,470
that was the happiest time

389
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,390
of my life.

390
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,680
It was my fault that Xiaoying

391
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,890
was sold as a slave.

392
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,230
At the last minute,

393
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,180
she still wanted me to escape first.

394
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,290
That night at the brothel, you…

395
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,790
I was useless.

396
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,030
Go!

397
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,190
I can't leave without you.

398
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,920
At least one of us has to escape.

399
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,350
Go!

400
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,700
Where is she now?

401
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,310
I thought you moved her body.

402
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,330
It was not me.

403
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,010
Only he knows where her body is.

404
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,170
I don't know what you're talking about.

405
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,300
I don't know what she's talking about.

406
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,340
She wants to kill me.

407
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,710
Sir, help me.

408
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,740
You murderer!

409
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,780
You drank those girls' blood.

410
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,040
You definitely know where Xiaoying is!

411
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,730
Sun Xiaoying?

412
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,680
I don't know Sun Xiaoying.

413
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,590
Sir.

414
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,520
I don't know this girl.

415
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:08,970
Tell me.

416
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,750
Let her go!

417
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,240
Don't move!

418
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,030
Put the knife down.

419
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,390
Don't move!

420
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:13,750
Let go of me.

421
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,140
Don't move.

422
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,390
He's the murderer.

423
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:16,990
Sir.

424
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,630
She just admitted

425
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,350
she committed murder, didn't she?

426
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,760
I bought this maid.

427
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,350
I don't know why she's gone mad today

428
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,480
and wants to kill me.

429
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,860
Fortunately, you came in time.

430
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,790
Did you kill

431
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,440
those girls?

432
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,210
Don't move!

433
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,020
I can

434
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,910
pay for that.

435
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,080
I can pay as much as you want.

436
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,400
Pay?

437
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,120
These are the slave contracts.

438
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,790
They all signed their names.

439
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,720
I signed

440
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,980
with every one of them.

441
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,820
Once they become disciples,

442
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
their lives are not theirs anymore.

443
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,120
Vice Minister.

444
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,470
You killed so many people.

445
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,910
Do you think you can get away with it

446
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,250
[March 11th, the third year of the Shenggong Era]
[May 16th, the fourth year of the Shenggong Era]

447
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,250
[Owner of the maid: Wang Zhi]

448
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,070
with several pieces of paper?

449
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,830
Sir.

450
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,910
This is what the law

451
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,430
states.

452
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,100
Who on earth are you?

453
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,710
Why did you

454
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,940
drink those women's blood?

455
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,580
Where is Sun Xiaoying?

456
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,440
Answer me!

457
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,830
You monster.

458
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,500
You damn monster.

459
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,930
You should already be dead.

460
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,870
What did you say?

461
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,830
Can't you

462
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,760
smell yourself?

463
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,870
You smell like dead people.

464
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,790
Are you okay?

465
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,670
Vice Minister.

466
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,510
You can't escape.

467
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,200
You can never find the woman

468
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,130
you're looking for.

469
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,790
Where is Sun Xiaoying?

470
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,340
She's dead.

471
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,320
But I didn't kill her.

472
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,020
She killed herself.

473
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,280
She wouldn't let me drink her blood

474
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,430
and tried to escape.

475
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,350
Did that make her special

476
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,230
in your eyes?

477
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,870
She actually laughed at me

478
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,340
and pitied me.

479
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,020
She was just a slave.

480
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,590
How could she laugh at me?

481
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,360
Where is she?

482
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,620
She's right here.

483
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,690
She wanted to escape,

484
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,520
so I locked her up here

485
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,550
so that she could never leave.

486
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,150
It's the same for you.

487
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,190
You're Wang Zhi, aren't you?

488
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,960
After you escaped from prison,

489
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,910
you've been drinking young women's blood

490
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,070
to stay young.

491
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,840
What a surprise.

492
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,150
Someone actually still remembers my name.

493
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,640
What was your relationship with Du Zixu?

494
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,630
Du Zixu?

495
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,670
You know more

496
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,910
than I thought.

497
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,630
Du Zixu did have a way

498
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,220
to keep people young.

499
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,190
I just adopted

500
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,510
his method.

501
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,320
Do you mean drinking human blood?

502
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,120
I didn't just drink human blood.

503
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,350
There's more to it.

504
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,220
What more?

505
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,130
It seems that you're more interested

506
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,190
in this secret than that woman.

507
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,870
But save your breath.

508
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,710
I will never tell you.

509
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,090
Let's break the door down.

510
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:31,860
Come.

511
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,180
Give back my blood!

512
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,910
Stay back.

513
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,250
It's you.

514
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,290
It's you.

515
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,960
It's really you.

516
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,100
Vice Minister.

517
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,790
Vice Minister.

518
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,440
Are you alright?

519
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,300
Vice Minister.

520
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,230
Give her to me.

521
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:48,870
Be careful.

522
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,990
Sun Bao, go inside.

523
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:55,790
Yes.

524
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,330
Let's go.

525
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,120
Careful.

526
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,660
Vice Minister.

527
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,710
What happened?

528
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,000
I didn't kill him.

529
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,480
I think he was poisoned.

530
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,340
Liu risked her life to take revenge.

531
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,740
She must have covered her skin with poison.

532
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,560
How is Liu?

533
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,640
She...

534
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,760
Mr. Li. Mr. Li.

535
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,220
Liu has…

536
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Where I come from,

537
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,540
people believe that after death,

538
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,090
people's souls will become birds.

539
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,850
People are reborn

540
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,270
when they die.

541
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,150
If we had come sooner,

542
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,950
would Liu and the other girls...

543
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,670
Mr. Li.

544
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,630
I want to

545
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,110
put on new shoes for them.

546
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,230
With new shoes,

547
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,710
they can go

548
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,840
wherever they want.

549
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,390
This is not over yet.

550
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,950
I swear to find

551
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,120
the culprit for you.

552
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,480
It's really you.

553
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,330
My god.

554
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,410
I finally found you.

555
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,070
Who's it?

556
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,470
Mr. Li. Mr. Li. Mr. Li.

557
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,270
It's me.

558
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,470
I'm Chen Shi. I'm Chen Shi.

559
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,070
Chen Shi. Chen Shi. Chen Shi.

560
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,150
Mr. Li.

561
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,630
Mr. Li.

562
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,030
I brought you some gum.

563
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,710
I've put it there.

564
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,390
I also closed the window.

565
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,440
I'm fine.

566
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,260
You may leave.

567
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,490
-But...
-Leave.

568
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:26,910
Okay.

569
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,710
So this is the guiding drug.

570
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,150
The murderer

571
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,710
can't be Wang Zhi, can it?

572
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,830
No one in the world

573
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,990
can reverse aging.

574
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,230
I've checked Wang Zhi's portrait

575
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,710
before he was imprisoned.

576
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,170
They were not the same age,

577
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,830
but they did look alike.

578
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,540
Maybe it's a coincidence.

579
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,370
Maybe he was an illegitimate son,

580
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,340
or they were brothers

581
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,430
or from the same family line.

582
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,330
They just happened to look alike.

583
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,820
Alibaba.

584
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,170
What are you thinking?

585
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,010
I'm thinking about that nursery rhyme.

586
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,510
Its lyrics are about real cases.

587
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,750
The cat ate people. Thieves left empty-handed.

588
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,150
The medicine failed. Blood filled the cup.

589
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,030
It seems that

590
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,150
since Vice Minister Li

591
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,660
returned to the Court of Judicial Review,

592
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,150
all the cases we encountered

593
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,550
were planned in advance.

594
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,520
They're written in the stars and destined to happen.

595
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,130
Nonsense.

596
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,910
No way.

597
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,750
How...

598
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,830
How is that possible?

599
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,389
You're so superstitious.

600
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,030
Nonsense.

601
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,150
Yeah.

602
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,610
Vice Minister Shangguan.

603
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,070
I didn't see you coming in.

604
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,030
What brought you here?

605
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,000
Are you alone?

606
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,050
Where is Vice Minister Li?

607
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,989
Where are the other staff at Mingjing Hall?

608
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,350
They're out investigating a case?

609
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,820
Can you answer my questions instead of just shaking your head?

610
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,220
Sorry,

611
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,470
but I really don't know.

612
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,270
I want to know where they are too.

613
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,350
The test held by the Court of Judicial Review is coming soon.

614
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,410
Are you prepared?

615
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,270
I…

616
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,270
I…

617
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,830
I…

618
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,470
Fine.

619
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,480
Study hard then.

620
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,050
Don't embarrass Vice Minister Li

621
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,210
and Mingjing Hall.

622
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,150
Take care.

623
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,700
Pendants.

624
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,050
Do you mean

625
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,550
the house where someone died a few days ago?

626
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,280
Yes.

627
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,380
The monster who drank human blood.

628
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,470
Everyone in Shendu is talking about him now.

629
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,290
I know.

630
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,550
But we don't get to sell

631
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,760
that kind of house.

632
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,790
Why?

633
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,980
That house was confiscated.

634
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,190
Its owner

635
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,310
was called Wang Zhi.

636
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,270
He committed a capital crime

637
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,470
and was put in prison.

638
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,100
His house was confiscated.

639
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,370
Technically speaking,

640
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,590
it belonged to the government.

641
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,990
But because it was considered ominous,

642
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,690
it was deserted in the end.

643
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,830
There are dozens of houses like that

644
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,230
in Shendu, big or small.

645
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,240
So,

646
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,430
it's not surprising

647
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,550
that some unidentified people

648
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,080
would occupy those houses.

649
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,660
Sun Bao,

650
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,910
how dare you stalk me?

651
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:41,570
Pay him.

652
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:44,820
Here.

653
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,450
Thank you.

654
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,780
You were not in the Court of Judicial Review.

655
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,100
I wanted to know what you were investigating.

656
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,000
Are you also investigating the blood-sucking case?

657
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,930
How did you know?

658
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,600
Because I'm also investigating it.

659
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,570
I'm doing it alone

660
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,770
and feel a bit afraid.

661
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,310
You're a man.

662
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,410
Why are you afraid?

663
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,380
What did you find?

664
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:06,710
I

665
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,930
wanted to start with real estate agents

666
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,170
to find out if someone had

667
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,520
bought that old house.

668
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,150
But my investigation

669
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,630
just led to Wang Zhi again.

670
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,140
I've also looked into it.

671
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,260
Wang Zhi's families

672
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,060
were either exiled

673
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,960
or sent to war.

674
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,610
He didn't have any relatives

675
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,630
who could have killed people in Shendu.

676
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,310
But Wang Zhi

677
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,510
disappeared

678
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,260
after he went to death row.

679
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,170
Think about it.

680
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,100
A man

681
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,480
hid in an old house,

682
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,980
lived off human blood,

683
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,730
and aged backward.

684
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,300
That's creepy enough

685
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,930
to be a ghost story.

686
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,830
And that nursery rhyme.

687
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,550
It says,

688
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,870
"The cat ate people.

689
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,870
Thieves left empty-handed.

690
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,110
The medicine failed. Blood filled the cup."

691
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,470
It sounds so scary.

692
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,510
Come.

693
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,170
Also, I've barely

694
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,250
seen Vice Minister Li

695
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,710
since this case happened.

696
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,330
He must be investigating something.

697
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,730
But why didn't he tell us?

698
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,640
He and that man

699
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,770
were in the secret room alone.

700
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,030
Something must have happened.

701
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,090
Are you suspecting Vice Minister Li?

702
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,590
I didn't say that.

703
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,160
Why would I suspect him?

704
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,350
I just have

705
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,430
this strange feeling

706
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,540
that something is very wrong.

707
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,160
I have the same feeling.

708
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,590
The wind picks up.

709
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,030
Let's go back to the Court of Judicial Review.

710
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,360
The weather is turning.

711
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,080
[The Court of Judicial Review]
