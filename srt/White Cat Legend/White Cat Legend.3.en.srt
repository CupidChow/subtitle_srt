Chen Shi,

50
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,020
here's the first thing.

51
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,590
We'll take action in secret,

52
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,580
and we must keep a low profile no matter what.

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,130
Got it!

54
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,350
What does "keep a low profile" mean?

55
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,220
It means not to attract attention.

56
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,829
Got it!

57
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,110
Secondly,

58
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,270
you must listen to me about everything.

59
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,880
Got it!

60
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,630
What's the third thing?

The third thing

62
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,350
is that I need you to keep

78
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,720
why you asked us to come.

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,350
About the previous demon cat murder case,

80
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,900
I handled it in haste.

81
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,170
Madam, are you suggesting

82
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,120
that this case

83
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,430
no longer has anything to do with us?

84
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,560
What I'm saying is,

85
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,550
I approached that matter in an oversimple manner,

86
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,390
and that I didn't give you enough support.

87
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,710
Now that I've put you on this case,

88
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,910
I should give you a chance to do a good job on it.

89
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,070
After some thinking,

90
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,110
I've decided that from today on,

91
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,350
the manpower and material resources of the Court of Judicial Review

92
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,830

94
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,070
Make sure you'll take the investigation seriously,

95
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,600
and put some effort into it.

96
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,930
In three days,

97
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,290

98
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:43,750

You'll be safe and sound

107
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,670
since your face isn't on the flyers stuck on the walls like mine is.

108
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,630
If people spot me,

109
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,150
what am I supposed to do?

110
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,610
They won't recognize you.

111
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,290
Why?

112
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,790
Because of the uniform you're wearing.

113

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,290
what officials look like.

115
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,670
When they're faced with officials,

116
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,150
they tend to

117
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,150
avert their eyes.

118
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,040
If you don't believe it, just look.

119
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,120
What's the reason for that?

120
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,060
The reason is that you represent law,

121
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,659
constraints and sanctions.

122
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,340
By the way, Mr. Li,

don't have access to horse skin.

136

Although the paint on it

138

has started falling off,

139

140
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,830
that it isn't an ordinary kind of ink.

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,280
A few days ago,

192
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,030
a demon cat started killing people.

193
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,230
A senior military officer

194
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,290
met that demon cat.

195
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,850
Then he ended up dead, hanging on Zhuque Gate.

196
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,150
Help!

197
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,030
Help!

198
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,230
It's just fog.

199
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,810
Keep going.

200
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,430
Yes.

201
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,450
Gu was the coachman for this officer.

202
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,000
[Gu]

203
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,260
Gu!

204
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,660
They were both eaten by that demon.

205
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,880
There's no such thing as a demon in the world.

206
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,940
They must have been killed by a human.

207
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,150
How can you say there's no demon?

208
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,760
The Court of Judicial Review has said there is!

209
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,560
The government has admitted it.

210
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,350
What are you talking about?

211
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,410
Three years ago,

212
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,090
many people in Shendu

213
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,150
suddenly disappeared for  no reason.

214
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,210
No one knew if they were dead or alive.

215
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,720
The government didn't care much about it.

216
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,670
Those who lost their families, including Gu,

217
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,750
urged the government for an explanation.

218
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,610
But up till now,

219
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,160
the case is still unsolved.

220
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,170
Later on, the imperial court asked a sorcerer for help.

221
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,500
Hurry! Hurry!

222
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:48,910
Bravo!

223
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,950
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

224
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,190
The sorcerer was said to have stunning magic powers.

225
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,180
He shot an arrow

226
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,430
and hit that demon cat

227
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,110
which then fell from the sky.

228
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,460
Get out of the way!

229
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,150
After the sorcerer made that miracle happen,

230
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,070
nobody else went missing.

231
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,990
Then the Court of Judicial Review closed the case

232
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,470
with a conclusion that the demon cat ate the missing people.

233
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,590
Did the Court of Judicial Review really conclude

234
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,230
that the demon cat was the culprit?

235
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,760
So, Officer,

236
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,030
whether people say there are demons or not,

237
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,960
you have to admit

238
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,070
that demons do exist, don't you?

239
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,070
Gu and his family are so pitiful...

240
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,100
Since Xiaohuan went missing,

241
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,000
[Gu Xiaohuan, female, 5 years old, about 3 feet high]

242
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,660
Gu spent every day

243
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,550
showing these portraits around

244
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,590
and asking people about Xiaohuan's whereabouts.

245
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,630
Mister, look at this.

246
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,110
Have you seen this child?

247
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,630
No.

248
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,700
Xiaohuan's mother

249
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,420
longed for her daughter's return.

250
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,430
She sat by the entrance to the alley, just watching.

251
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,350
[Zhang's Carriages]

252
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,470
Even her eyes were hurt.

253
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,910
All she got in the end

254
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,350
was some news about her daughter being eaten by the demon cat.

255
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,300
Xiaohuan's mother

256
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,900
got seriously ill.

257
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,080
Soon,

258
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,690
she passed away.

259
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,700
Gu had to live all by himself,

260
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,300
lonely and suffering.

261
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,780
When he had spare time,

262
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,910
he'd go out on the streets with the portraits and search.

263
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,140
What a poor man!

264
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,430
Till the day he died, he hadn't

265
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,870
got a chance to see his daughter again.

266
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,530
He didn't even know Xiaohuan was alive.

267
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,720
Mr. Li!

268
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,710
Mr. Li!

269
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,150
Come here, Xiaohuan.

270
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:51,950
Come.

271
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,030
Sit here.

272
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,210
Xiaohuan,

273
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,030
do you remember Uncle Zhang?

274
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,470
It's me who asked someone

275
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,310
to draw on your rattle drum

276
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,550
with oil paint.

277
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,160
Uncle Zhang.

278
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,520
Good girl.

279
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,510
Officers,

280
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,510
Gu

281
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,660
had worked here for many years.

282
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,920
We saw him as a member of our family.

283
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,710
My wife and I

284
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,870
have no children.

285
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,200
Why don't you

286
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,110
let us take care of

287
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Xiaohuan?

288
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,080
Uncle Zhang,

289
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,190
where's my dad?

290
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,890
Xiaohuan,

291
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,540
your dad

292
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,210
has gone to a remote place,

293
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,350
which is far away.

294
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,190
But before he went away,

295
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,510
he left you a message.

296
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,680
That is, when you come back,

297
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,430
you must be a good girl and listen to

298
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,190
Uncle Zhang and Auntie Zhang.

299
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,630
You'll also need to finish all your meals.

300
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,750
When you grow as tall

301
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,790
as Uncle Zhang,

302
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,990
your dad will come home and meet you.

303
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,030
Sir.

304
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,670
What's up, Xiaohuan?

305
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,550
Sir,

306
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,230
thank you.

307
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,590
Thank you for helping me find my dad.

308
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,710
I thought

309
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,300
the Court of Judicial Review would never owe anyone anything.

310
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,430
But it does owe many things to Xiaohuan

311
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,510
and her parents.

312
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,760
I promise you

313
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,740
that I'll give you an answer.

314
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,840
Xiaohuan,

315
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,130
remember,

316
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,070
whenever you want,

317
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:31,870
you can always

318
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,950
come to the Court of Judicial Review for me.

319
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,500
Got it?

320
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,390
Xiaohuan,

321
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,030
I'll be there for you too.

322
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:37,950
Come on.

323
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,010
-Go play.
-Go play.

324
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,250
Come on!

325
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,670
I didn't know there's such a story

326
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,750
about Xiaohuan's origin.

327
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,230
Mr. Li,

328
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,590
what do you think we...

329
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,520
Continue with the investigation.

330
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,790
By the way, Mr. Li,

331
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,720
it's been a while

332
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,750
since you started looking so stern.

333
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,910
For the sake of Xiaohuan

334
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,590
and you,

335
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,550
I must get to the bottom

336
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,310
of this case.

337
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,080
Hold on.

338
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,490
[Jianyang Gate]

339
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,870
Mr. Li,

340
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,360
I trust you.

341
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,270
You are different from those who close cases

342
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,000
without careful consideration.

343
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,350
you willingly offer me help,

344
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,150
and seek justice for Xiaohuan's dad.

345
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,210
You're brilliant.

346
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,910
You can do whatever you set your mind to.

347
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,790
You are

348
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,590
too trusting,

349
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,710
and too kind.

350
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,040
You're gonna be tricked in Shendu.

351
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,270
I got it.

352
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,510
See,

353
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,750
a man suddenly died

354
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,940
on the bridge.

355
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,430
Then out of nowhere,

356
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,360
he showed up on a faraway city gate.

357
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,510
Other than a demon,

358
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,830
who could've done it?

359
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,160
I think he was bewitched by a demon.

360
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,590
What does that mean?

361
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,920
These so-called demons

362
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,310
are in fact deceptive tricks.

363
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,910
They not only appear before people's eyes,

364
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,640
but also get in people's minds.

365
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,090
Once a demon is rooted in a person's mind,

366
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,750
this person will be captivated by the demon,

367
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,150
and fail to see the truth.

368
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,590
When you say it out, it would sound ordinary.

369
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,040
But if you don't say it out,

370
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,170
it would appear to be very mysterious.

371
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,750
The so-called demons that have shown up here,

372
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,000
no matter how unfathomable they seem,

373
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,160
can be explained by what I said.

374
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:35,910
Mr. Li,

375
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,110
have you figured out the truth?

376
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:38,880
General,

377
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,950
we've checked this place many times,

378
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,830
and yet we can't find anything.

379
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,030
General, why would you come here again?

380
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,550
I'm supposed to investigate the case.

381
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,550
I should at least look like I'm putting in some effort.

382
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,430
General, you and the Minister have made

383
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,910
a pact about solving the case in three days.

384
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,910
Is there anything

385
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,390
I can help you with?

386
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,980
This pact

387
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,850
is designed for the Court of Judicial Review

388
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,240
and Shangguan Qin.

389
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,990
If they can't solve the case in three days,

390
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,120
I will be the winner.

391
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,640
Now it's been ten days.

392
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,030
I don't mind waiting for three more days.

393
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,890
I bet they won't

394
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,390
be able to solve the case.

395
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,290
General, you're right.

396
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,950
By then, you'll be appointed as

397
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,210
a Vice Minister there.

398
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,990
Thank you, General.

399
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,050
No need to thank me.

400
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,410
I'm not the only one having this idea.

401
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,530
But I still need to thank you for recommending me.

402
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,870
Mr. Li! Mr. Li!

403
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,000
There are two people coming this way.

404
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,270
General,

405
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,230
they seem to be officers of the Court of Judicial Review.

406
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,090
Go check it out.

407
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,720
Yes.

408
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,630
Do as I say.

409
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,110
Okay.

410
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,120
Tell them to stop moving first.

411
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,030
Stop!

412
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,990
Ask them who they are.

413
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,690
Who are you?

414
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,920
This is General Qiu, a leader of Left Jinwu Guards.

415
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,950
I'm Lai Zhongshu, a consulting officer.

416
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,260
Are you officers of the Court of Judicial Review?

417
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,790
Go on.

418
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,190
This...

419
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,280
This is where an important case happened.

420
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,300
The Court of Judicial Review is carrying out an inspection here.

421
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,550
Unauthorized personnel must not enter!

422
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,350
Please leave!

423
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,880
You...

424
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,710
Please leave!

425
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,550
Lai Zhongshu,

426
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,440
let's go.

427
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,350
Yes.

428
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:57,950
Mr. Li,

429
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,190
was I

430
00:17:59,390 --> 00:17:59,940
just...

431
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,270
It's okay.

432
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,800
One of them is my acquaintance.

433
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,550
I had to avoid him.

434
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,960
If you had told me earlier,

435
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,790
I would have let you go away first.

436
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,590
I could've blocked them for you.

437
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,070
They already spotted us.

438
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,000
If we had suddenly turned around,

439
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
they would've found us suspicious.

440
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,470
That's why I asked you to yell and tell them to leave.

441
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,270
Sounds right.

442
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,830
Mr. Li,

443
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,790
just now, your eyes...

444
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,750
My eyes are fine.

445
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,030
We should get going now.

446
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,160
Where are we going?

447
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,210
Would you say you're a daring person?

448
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,550
I am a daredevil!

449
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,340
Those two officers from the Court of Judicial Review

450
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,730
were being so rude.

451
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,740
Their institute will collapse soon.

452
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,160
Just let them be.

453
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,590
You're right.

454
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,310
After what happened three years ago,

455
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,170
there haven't been any impressive officers there.

456
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,130
I'm sorry I said that.

457
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,760
Why are we back here?

458
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,110
This is a shorter route.

459
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,090
Wait for me!

460
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,890
Wait!

461
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,530
What is this?

462
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,670
A shortcut.

463
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,430
Don't go!

464
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,590
It's dark inside.

465
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,470
Keep up with me.

466
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,230
I...

467
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,580
It's been three years.

468
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,240
I don't know if it still works.

469
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,870
Nice and slow.

470
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,190
[Morgue of the Court of Judicial Review]

471
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,530
This...

472
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,290
Bless me, Buddha!

473
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,780
Didn't you say

474
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,030
you were a daredevil?

475
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,710
But...

476
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,240
Mr. Li, I didn't know you would

477
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,500
bring me to this place.

478
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,790
We've inspected the crime scene.

479
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,070
Certainly, now it's time to visit the victim.

480
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,070
Bless me, Buddha!

481
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,270
If you're scared,

482
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,390
why not retreat through the tunnel?

483
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,250
I don't have a guilty conscience.

484
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,010
I'm not afraid.

485
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,540
Now no one's here.

486
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,520
Act fast!

487
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,750
This...

488
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,150
Sun Bao,

489
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,190
can't you stop clinging to me

490
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,580
like a tail?

491
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,420
Why do we have to come here?

492
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,300
Vice Minister Shangguan asked us to put some effort in the investigation.

493
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,190
We have to strictly follow the procedure, right?

494
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,190
Why didn't you tell them two to come?

495
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,740
Look at you, you're a military officer,

496
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,140
but you always pray to gods and fear ghosts.

497
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,370
You need some training.

498
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,270
Here is a chance for you

499
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,470
to gain more courage.

500
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,060
Mr. Bai.

501
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,110
I seldom see you two here, Officers.

502
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,860
[Bai, a coroner]

503
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,350
We are pressured

504
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,550
by the superiors.

505
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,790
We aren't usually lucky enough to be given

506
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,250
the cases that require visits to this place.

507
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,390
Was the murderer really a demon cat?

508
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,370
Well...

509
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,010
I wouldn't dare to draw that conclusion.

510
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,850
But there's something

511
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,800
creepy about this case.

512
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,950
The body does have

513
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,350
rips and wounds made by claws and teeth,

514
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,430
along with many injuries inflicted by humans.

515
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,260
I guess the victim was abused.

516
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,110
All his bones and organs

517
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,430
were broken and ruptured.

518
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,150
How horrible!

519
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,470
Obviously,

520
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,130
the harm was caused by a fall from a great height.

521
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,270
As for your question

522
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,000
that whether this was done by a demon cat or not...

523
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,260
B-Be careful.

524
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,250
Be careful.

525
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,870
I think

526
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,230
you should

527
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,590
look at the body yourselves.

528
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,430
Take a look.

529
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,910
You do it.

530
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,430
You go first.

531
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,110
Just go.

532
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,470
I refuse.

533
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,730
Time to train yourself to be a braver man.

534
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,810
H-H-Has he been like this all the time?

535
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,400
Let's go.

536
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,630
Sun Bao, you...

537
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,920
You are such a disgrace!

538
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,310
It's shameful!

539
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,950
Did you just faint?

540
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,850
It was so frightening.

541
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,190
It's just a dead body.

542
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,030
What's frightening about it?

543
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,090
He can't stand back on his feet, can he?

544
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:18,910
Why were you afraid?

545
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,590
Because a dead man

546
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,270
was sitting up. Wasn't it frightening?

547
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,030
If it had been a living person

548
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,750
or a dead person who was lying still,

549
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,610
I wouldn't have been frightened.

550
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,070
It must be Hu Si who made that happen.

551
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,830
He did it in order to humiliate us.

552
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,630
It must be him.

553
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,790
Who are you talking about?

554
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,630
You talk about people behind their backs

555
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,390
every day!

556
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,000
Here you are.

557
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,600
I heard you fainted.

558
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,950
Were you spooked?

559
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,710
Hu Si!

560
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,230
We are colleagues.

561
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,710
Do you think it's fun to put that dead body

562
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,180
in that shape to scare us?

563
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,230
Don't you make false accusations

564
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,990
about me!

565
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,070
I didn't do that.

566
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,340
I guess

568

that the case had been

569
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,550
taken by you guys,

570
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,710

571
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,470
Maybe

572
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,260
he just got up to see how you were doing.

573
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,720
You...

574
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,230
Well, this case

575
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,590
is quite mysterious.

Otherwise, you wouldn't have been

577

appointed to solve this case.

I'd like you to bring these dossiers

into the room.

581

I'd like to kindly

582

remind you

583
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,590
that now it is already nighttime.

You have less than two days to solve the case.

585

586
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,790
is counting on you.

587
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:27,950
What do you mean?

588
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,430
I only mean to encourage you.

589

If you need anything,

590
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,040
just let me know.

591
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,030
Why is it so dark?

592
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,110
I did it. I did it.

593
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,620
Done!

594

Mr. Li, do you...

596
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,110
still have that chewy stuff?

597
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,520
I can't...

598
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,180
I can't put up with this smell.

599
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,230
Mr. Li,

600
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,170
why do you enjoy chewing this?

601
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,130
Why do you ask?

602
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,660
It sure tastes fresh,

603
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,940
but it had a strange flavor

604
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,090
of thoroughwort.

605
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,350
In my hometown in the countryside,

606
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,880
only cats like eating this.

607
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,040
What's wrong, Mr. Li?

608
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,770
Chewing it has become a habit of mine.

609
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,050
Oh, right,

610
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,020

611
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,540

613
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,960
did pay attention to every detail.

614
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,590
Instead of talking about those tricks,

615
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,660
let's make a list of questions first.

616
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,420
Questions?

617

Solving cases is all about answering questions.

618
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,070
Each case consists of

619
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,310
numerous questions.

620
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,970
When we find answers to the questions,

621
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,900
the case will be naturally solved.

622
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,480

Well,

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,790
in this world,

648
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,950
there are lots of bizarre things,

demons truly exist.

The demon cat is said to have appeared twice in three years.

Three years ago, many people in Shendu

653

suddenly disappeared for no reason.

654
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,150

about the demon cat that has recently appeared,

659
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,470
we must first find the truth

that in Shendu, there has always been

663

an urban legend about demon cats.

664
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,660
People say these demon cats would kill humans

665
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,990
and feed on human flesh. It sounds so true.

666
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,490
At least till the moment I left Shendu,

667
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,620

00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,570
These aren't mine.

755
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,710
These belong to him!

756
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,650
Talk, guys.

757
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,780
You two should talk.

758
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:55,950
It...

759
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,710
It has nothing to do with me!

760
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,150
These

761
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,600
talismans are his. His!

762
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,560
Y-You...

763
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,130
Have you seen this person?

764
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,500
No need to rush to clear up your stall.

765
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,840
Let's have a chat.

766
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,230
I really don't know this person.

767
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,350
I've seen him.

768
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,670
I met him by chance.

769
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,670
In the afternoon,

770
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,930
he sat here for a while.

771
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,160
I'm acquainted with

772
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,310
Mr. Sun Bao

773
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:34,950
who works in Mingjing Hall of

774
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,610
the Court of Judicial Review.

775
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,750
Soon after he left my stall, this man came.

776
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,630
If you don't believe it, go ask him.

777
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,510
You don't need to tell me those things.

778
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,970
Just answer my questions.

779
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,840
Understood.

780
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,860
Don't look back.

781
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,110
He's a colleague of mine.

782
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,670
Are you worried that I might run away?

783
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,390
I won't go anywhere.

784
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,650
I'll ask you questions

785
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,160
and you'll answer them.

786
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,150
Since you're in this line of business,

787
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,470
I bet you can get all sorts of information.

788
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,200
That's true.

789
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,199
What is the story about the demon cat

790
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,989
that showed up three years ago?

791
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:13,250
The whole thing started three years ago.

792
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,810
At that time,

793
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,070
There was a series of

794
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,590
strange incidents in Shendu.

795
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,110
Many people

796
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,270
went missing for no reason.

797
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,710
Then the government reached a conclusion...

798
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,310
There was also a Demon Cat Case three years ago.

799
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,770
I can't believe the Court of Judicial Review

800
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,230
would close the case with such a conclusion.

801
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,210
Three years ago,

802
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,409
people constantly went missing,

803
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,870
including men from all walks of life,

804
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,810
young women,

805
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,550
and some of the elderly in their eighties.

806
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,389
Even

807
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,350
a whole troupe went missing.

808
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,510
In the end,

809
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,389
the Court of Judicial Review

810
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:45,790
concluded that the culprit was a demon cat.

811
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,969
Where were you three years ago?

812
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,110
I returned from a war

813
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,280
and started working as a constable in Shendu.

814
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,739
I was still in my hometown.

815
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,080
I was studying in the Imperial College.

816
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,230
Three years ago, I was selling fabric

817
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,820
with my dad in Yangzhou.

818
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,820
It turns out that in the entire Court of Judicial Review,

819
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,340
we're the only four simpletons

820
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,540
who haven't got to know about this case.

821
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,490
Three years ago, the Court of Judicial Review

822
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,950
concluded that the crimes were committed by a demon cat.

823
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,210
It means the authorities have confirmed

824
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,610
the existence of demons.

825
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,560
Then what can we do to solve this case?

826
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,540
All the blame

827
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,480
will be taken by us.

828
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,460
We'll even drag the Court of Judicial Review down!

829
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,550
What should we do now?

830
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,950
What should we do?

831
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,230
How am I supposed to know what we should do?

832
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,260
The government meant to settle the whole thing quietly.

833
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,830
For the past three years, there hasn't been

834
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,210
a new missing persons case.

835
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,270
But now, the mystery about demon cats

836
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,090
has become a prevailing theory.

837
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,250
Speaking of which,

838
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,040
those wicked sorcerers should be held accountable.

839
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,400
They are scaremongers

840
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,030
and habitual frauds.

841
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,500
Those who lack morals would even

842
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,050
deliberately bring back sad memories for people.

843
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,310
The story itself is just an urban legend.

844
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,820
No big deal.

845
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,100
However,

846
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,310
ten days ago,

847
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,270
there was one more death.

848
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,350
Those crooked sorcerers

849
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,860
saw it as a new opportunity

850
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,270
to exaggerate the situation

851
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,630
in order to yield more profits.

852
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,070
That's how the story about demon cats

853
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,030
was brought up by people again.

854
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,770
There must be a connection

855
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,950
between the two Demon Cat Cases.

856
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,310
Exactly because they are

857
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,640
definitely connected,

858
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,390
it's impossible for us to solve the current case.

859
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,920
Unless we can catch a demon,

860
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,910
we won't stand a chance of closing this case.

861
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,390
But where can we catch a demon?

862
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,050
It's not necessarily a demon.

863
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,840
If the demon thing is not true,

864
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,140
then we'll have to solve the case

865
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,510
that happened three years ago as well.

866
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,630
Do you know what the key problem

867
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,310
is?

868
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,190
It's that we'll contradict our own judgement

869
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,320
and the conclusion made by the Court of Judicial Review.

870
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,720
The four of us shouldn't

871
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,670
deserve this!

872
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,110
We're being made

873
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,850
the scapegoats for this matter.

874
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,670
It's getting more and more serious!

875
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,430
Why don't we

876
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,830
just quit?

877
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,160
Quit?

878
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,320
In the past, if we failed our exams,

879
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,160
at worst, we would be fired.

880
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,650
But do you know what situation we're in now?

881
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,990
The four of us have been

882
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,530
forced to become the enemies

883
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,070
of the Minister and Qiu Qingzhi.

884
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,070
You wanna quit?

885
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,740
Do you how we'll be punished for disobedience,

886
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,870
dereliction of duty,

887
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,070
deceiving and disrespecting the emperor,

888
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,710
and...

889
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,750
That'll be exhilarating.

890
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,280
No. It'll be excruciating.

891
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,830
Excruciating!

892
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,190
By the way,

893
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,470
about the officers you mentioned,

894
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,550
namely Sun Bao, and his fellows,

895
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,150
do they work in Mingjing Hall?

896
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,630
Yes.

897
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,950
They are nice people.

898
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,790
But that doesn't mean they're helpful.

899
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:21,110
Mingjing Hall used to be so...

900
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,880
I'm not saying that the Court of Judicial Review

901
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,770
isn't helpful.

902
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,350
Please don't take it the wrong way.

903
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,880
If what you've said is true,

904
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,630
then it's fair to say the Court of Judicial Review isn't helpful at all.

905
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,460
When the worst happens, I'll go back to be a constable again.

906
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,670
And I'll return to my country.

907
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,010
Being a teacher

908
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,370
is a good choice for me.

909
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,430
All of you have

910
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,300
backup plans, don't you?

911
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,680
I'm the only fool here then!

912
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,630
I can bring you to my country.

913
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,660
Forget it.

914
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,890
Is anyone there?

915
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,440
Is anyone there?

916
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,830
Someone must be watching us.

917
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,950
Hu Si!

918
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,630
What should I do?

919
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:25,950
What's up?

920
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,510
Ginseng soup.

921
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,720
Chicken soup,

922
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,670
The signature dishes of Cuihua Restaurant.

923
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,990
All the desserts written in the menu

924
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,480
of Shuyi House. I want all of them!

925
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,380
Do you understand?

926
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,750
How dare you make me do your bidding!

927
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,310
Do you think you are Lord Shangguan?

928
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,660
Don't I get to order you around?

929
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,830
Our jobs are very tiring,

930
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,290
so we need more nutrition.

931
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,680
Do as they asked.

932
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,110
Yes.

933
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,030
Madam,

934
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,430
are we really going to let them

935
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,430
throw their weight around?

936
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,090
Let them be.

937
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,830
Though their work might not deliver a result, they've tried hard.

938
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:01,380
Madam,

939
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,330
are we gonna keep waiting?

940
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,360
It's not easy

941
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,070
to solve this case.

942
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,190
If Qiu Qingzhi

943
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,670
really sends his minions here,

944
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,670
what should we do?

945
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,390
We'll see what we can do as the situation develops.

946
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:18,920
Do you

947
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,710
have any other question?

948
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,910
Would you do me one more favor?

949
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,030
Sure. Of course I'll help you.

950
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,100
Go to the Court of Judicial Review

951
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,510
to deliver a message and then you'll be rewarded.

952
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,090
Rewarded?

953
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,460
I have a question.

954
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,430
You're already working in the Court of Judicial Review.

955
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,560
Why do you need me to deliver a message?

956
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,080
It's true that I work there,

957
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,830
but I belong to the old Court of Judicial Review,

958
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,210
not the current one.

959
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,460
Understood.

960
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:18,350
Sir,

961
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,560
what's this?

962
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,600
Don't play dumb with me.

963
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,160
It's the seal for the Minister of Judicial Review.

964
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,970
The old one has been missing for three years.

965
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,350
[Seal of the Court of Judicial Review]

966
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,340
Now, a new one has finally been made.

967
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,630
The Court of Judicial Review is in charge of all criminal cases in the country.

968
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,660
The position of the Minister of Judicial Review

969
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,110
has a lot of power,

970
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,440
so it is very important.

971
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,460
We can't let the burden of managing the whole institute

972
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,980
be borne by one or two Vice Ministers forever, right?

973
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,920
This post must be filled.

974
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,760
Now that there's a new seal,

975
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,920
we need to find a person to hold it.

976
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,960
[Court of Judicial Review]
