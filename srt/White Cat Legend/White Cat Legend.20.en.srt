4
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,430
When I was in the brothel before,

5
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,830
he bought my freedom.

6
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,440
He's a good man.

7
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,200
Even though he steals,

8
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,010
those people's things deserve to be stolen.

9
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,090
Besides,

10
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,070
he chopped it himself.

11
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,750
He already promised me

12
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,590
that he would never steal again

13
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,509
and would live his life accordingly.

14
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,070
But

15
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,870
this time, he...

16
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,050
It's different this time.

17
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,840
He said

18
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,920
he had a friend who needed his help.

19
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,190

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,550
I knew something was wrong,

21
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,880
but I couldn't stop him.

22
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,860
I didn't expect

23
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,810
this to happen.

24
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,590
Who is this friend?

25
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,300
I disagreed.

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,190
He's asking you. Does he have a partner?

00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,160

51
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,360

During the war that year,

114
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,790
when we were spying on the enemies,

115
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,190
we were ambushed in a place

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,590
called Huangsha Valley.

125

They fought against each other.

141
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,200
was originally called Lu Huangchong.

142
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,230
He was a corpse-digger on the march.

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,800
What is

144
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,600
a corpse-digger?

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,020
During the war,

146
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,790
those idle beggars

147
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,430
followed behind to clean the battlefield.

148
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,760
They made money

149
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,850
from the property left on the bodies.

150
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,840
They were called corpse-diggers.

151
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,370
They took money from the dead?

152
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,260
Yes.

153
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,200
That's why he was called Lu Huangchong.

154
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,080
I don't know

155
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,190
what incredible thing

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,390
Lu Huangchong found.

157
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,020
He made a fortune.

158
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,790
After returning to Shendu,

159
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,790
he relied on money

160
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,960
to attract bad guys,

161
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,240
gathering a lot of rogues around him

162
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,250
to do evil things.

163
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,110
He did all kinds of business.

164
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,590
He became powerful.

165
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,070
His nickname also changed.

166
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,669
It changed to Lu Chenghuang.

167
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,030
Xu Hu offended him?

168
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,039
No.

169
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,030
He fixed him.

170
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,390
We conflicted with him several times

171
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,850
and caught many of his sons

172
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,850
and grandsons.

173
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,310
He started to hate us.

174
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,610
Later,

175
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,190
Xu Hu got a tip-off.

176
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,750
Lu Chenghuang smuggled

177
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,550
a batch of illegal goods into Shendu.

178
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,410
Illegal goods?

179
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,350
The use of troops in the war destroyed the trade route.

180
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,670
The war was just over at that time.

181
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,330
The prohibition wasn't used.

182
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,680
Many rare things

183
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,430
from unknown places entered Shendu.

184
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,490
Many people made a fortune with this.

185
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,990
Although we took him

186
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,470
down a peg at that time,

187
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
we didn't hurt him

188
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,670
much.

189
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,710
If we had had the evidence

190
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,710
of his smuggling,

191
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,550
we would have put him to death.

192
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,220
But...

193
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,910
But Xu Hu went to him himself.

194
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,030
Yes.

195
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,290
He didn't inform me.

196
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,830
Maybe it was because those people

197
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,790
were too cruel

198
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,850
and too dangerous.

199
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,470
Then,

200
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,190
his body was found

201
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,920
in the canal.

202
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,670
He became unrecognizable.

203
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,070
What about...

204
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,270
What about... What about Huangchong?

205
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,030
The person who killed him must be Lu Chenghuang.

206
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,430
But there's no evidence.

207
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,140
He's so bad.

208
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,510
No one dealt with him?

209
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,990
Later, the imperial court tried its best to purge them

210
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,450
and got rid of half of them.

211
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,410
Speaking of which,

212
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,270
I should thank the Jinwu Guards.

213
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,830
Qiu Qingzhi?

214
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,310
After he took over Jingji,

215
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,840
he handled many bad people.

216
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,150
Lu Chenghuang also learnt about it.

217
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,790
Then he got a clean slate.

218
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,230
He used the money he earned before

219
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,670
to do some

220
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,870
so-called legitimate business.

221
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,580
But I know

222
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,310
his business has been shady

223
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,440
from the beginning.

224
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,990
And that bastard just now

225
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,470
is his godson.

226
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,310
The box in the storage facility that day

227
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,630
belongs to Lu Chenghuang.

228
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,270
There must be

229
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,670
something shady inside.

230
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,990
A thief who came back again

231
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,790
after being out of the business.

232
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,390
A bandit who changed everything

233
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,710
except his nature.

234
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,390
This case is getting more complicated.

235
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,940
Qiu Qingzhi.

236
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,470
For the current case,

237
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,820
there are two things.

238
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,870
First, the key.

239
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,990
Since both the storage facility and the owner

240
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,440
said they didn't lose the key,

241
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,640
check the place where the lock was made.

242
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,510
Start with the inscription.

243
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,390
There's no inscription on the lock.

244
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,770
The locks of the storage facility are specially made.

245
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,470
They don't inscribe words on obvious areas.

246
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,630
It's on the key.

247
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,270
The structure inside the lock is its inscription.

248
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,270
One is the yin word.

249
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,730
The other is the yang word.

250
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,150
That one...

251
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,660
Ri.

252
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,310
[Ming]

253
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,430
Yue.

254
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,380
[Ming]

255
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,100
Ri.

256
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,520
[Mingchang]

257
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,630
Ri.

258
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,710
Mingchang.

259
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,520
Second,

260
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,350
Zhao Ruyi

261
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,910
is a person with a broken finger.

262
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,840
This is a distinguishing feature.

263
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,390
So I think he has an accomplice

264
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,790
to help him case the joint.

265
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,470
We need to check

266
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,190
if there is anyone in the storage facility

267
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,590
who cooperated with him.

268
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,670
The clients who have been there in the past two days

269
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,330
also need to be investigated.

270
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,270
You guys split up and investigate.

271
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,800
I'll go meet Lu Chenghuang.

272
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,750
Yes.

273
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,070
Yes.

274
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:42,580
Yes.

275
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,590
Lords, you came at a bad time.

276
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,850
Godfather isn't home.

277
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,550
Okay.

278
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,990
Lords, please wait.

279
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,990
Are you Vice Minister Li?

280
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,640
Slow down, Godfather.

281
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,350
I'm Lu Chenghuang.

282
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,920
Unload everything.

283
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,260
Sort them out

284
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,830
and put them in the warehouse.

285
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,510
Lords.

286
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,590
This way.

287
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
This way, please.

288
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:54,820
Here.

289
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,010
This way, please.

290
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,870
This way, please.

291
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,140
These

292
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,590
are the junk I've accumulated

293
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,810
over the years.

294
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,070
Some

295
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,390
were left over

296
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,300
from the war.

297
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,360
I like to save things.

298
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,770
I can't bear to throw anything away.

299
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,990
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,510
Come, Lords.

301
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,070
Come.

302
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,990
Go in, please.

303
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,370
Please have a seat.

304
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,350
It's not appropriate for me to see guests in this outfit.

305
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,020
Let me go get changed.

306
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,590
No need.

307
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:36,870
It's fine.

308
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,600
Okay.

309
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,340
Since you know who I am,

310
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,350
you should know

311
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,520
why I want to see you.

312
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,630
I know.

313
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,040
You're here

314
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,230
for Zhao Ruyi, right?

315
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,090
I...

316
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,380
There're some misunderstanding about these things.

317
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,310
What do you mean?

318
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,750
Here's the thing.

319
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,180
Over the years,

320
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,390
I've indeed saved a lot of money.

321
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,180
But I was lonely.

322
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,330
Therefore,

323
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,270
I took in a few boys as my sons.

324
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,790
First,

325
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,340
it was for making the home busy.

326
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,080
Second,

327
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,100
it was for having some people to help me.

328
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,910
But there is a failed one.

329
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,590
He stole a lot.

330
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,150
He didn't dare to write it in the account book.

331
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,260
I...

332
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,810
I didn't know about it.

333
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,260
I didn't expect

334
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,600
I would be stolen

335
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,380
and offend you.

336
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:24,790
Here.

337
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,310
You mean

338
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,510
your godson

339
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,870
stole your money?

340
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,790
Yes.

341
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,230
How about this?

342
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,430
I'll ask him to come in

343
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,760
and apologize to you.

344
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,360
Here.

345
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,420
Come in.

346
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,640
Did you know you were wrong?

347
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,790
I knew I was wrong.

348
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,870
I knew I was wrong.

349
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,870
Please forgive me.

350
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,000
You were rude to Lord

351
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,950
and said harsh things to him.

352
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,700
Continue.

353
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,710
I knew I was wrong.

354
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,030
I knew I was wrong.

355
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,230
Here, take it.

356
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,750
I knew I was wrong.

357
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,800
I knew I was wrong.

358
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,990
Please spare me.

359
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,780
Take it.

360
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,680
The choice is yours.

361
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,720
I apologize.

362
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,030
How you teach your

363
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,110
son

364
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,260
is your own business.

365
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,030
Don't punish him illegally in front of me.

366
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,160
If you break the law,

367
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,200
the Court of Judicial Review will arrest you.

368
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,500
You're right.

369
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,990
You're right.

370
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,520
Leave.

371
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,480
Leave.

372
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,600
Thank you, Lord

373
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,640
Thank you, Lord.

374
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,830
Are you sure there's nothing else

375
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,030
in that storage?

376
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,470
There's nothing else.

377
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,230
Then why did people die

378
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,330
because of this?

379
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,230
Well,

380
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,660
I don't know.

381
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,940
I really don't know about it.

382
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,230
Actually, you shouldn't

383
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,270
have come here to ask.

384
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,270
Even though you're looking for someone,

385
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,430
you should look for

386
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,940
Zhao Ruyi's accomplice,

387
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,660
right?

388
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,870
Do you know a person

389
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,510
named Xu Hu?

390
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,910
Xu... Xu Hu?

391
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,910
I don't know.

392
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,740
Who is it?

393
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,800
A friend of one of my subordinates.

394
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,400
I don't know.

395
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,770
Besides,

396
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,950
I didn't mention

397
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,010
Zhao Ruyi just now.

398
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,230
How did you know that?

399
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,790
It's just hearsay.

400
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,460
Hearsay?

401
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,270
Bye.

402
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,300
Take care.

403
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,230
Lords.

404
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,030
Lords, let me see you off.

405
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,550
It can't be my fault.

406
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,530
If you don't have keys,

407
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:14,930
the locks made here

408
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,050
can't be opened

409
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,550
unless they're smashed,

410
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,550
let alone

411
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,069
custom-made locks made in the storage facility.

412
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,470
Every lock is different.

413
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,750
What if the key gets lost?

414
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,430
Then according to the copy of the pattern,

415
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,720
a new key can be made.

416
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,950
Where is the pattern?

417
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,590
Officer.

418
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,910
There are patterns.

419
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,830
But they're important.

420
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,270
We can't show them to outsiders.

421
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,830
Where did you put the patterns?

422
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,670
Show us.

423
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,700
This is my bedroom.

424
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,150
Please

425
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,000
help me

426
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,430
move the cabinet.

427
00:17:59,230 --> 00:17:59,790
Okay.

428
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,190
What's in

429
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,640
your cabinet?

430
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,330
It's so heavy.

431
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,880
Stones.

432
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,990
What?

433
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,090
A little more.

434
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,270
Okay.

435
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,830
How do you usually

436
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,590
move this cabinet?

437
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,590
I usually

438
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,950
take out the stones first.

439
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,140
Aren't you in a hurry?

440
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,830
Okay.

441
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,040
Hold this for me.

442
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,210
This room is heavily protected.

443
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,590
You don't usually come in, right?

444
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,290
Yes.

445
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,830
I only come in

446
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,430
when there are new patterns.

447
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,170
When did you come in last time?

448
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,080
A month ago.

449
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,590
Come. Help me.

450
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,630
What are you doing?

451
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:51,750
This...

452
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,080
The patterns are fine.

453
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,870
It has nothing to do with me.

454
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,830
The bottom of this box was sawed off.

455
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,320
It was glued back the way it was before.

456
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,270
Thank you.

457
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,640
How did you know

458
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,530
the bottom of the box was changed?

459
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,090
This thief's tactic

460
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,560
is really similar to that of the scout.

461
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,620
It's what they did in the army before.

462
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,740
You go back to the Court of Judicial Review first.

463
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,140
I need to go find a person.

464
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,810
What are you doing?

465
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,830
Sun Bao.

466
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,240
Besides you and security,

467
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,790
only the clients can enter the warehouse?

468
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,350
Yes.

469
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,830
Have you checked it?

470
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,360
The security are all clean.

471
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,110
If people want to put their property in your storage facility,

472
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,710
they must have

473
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,130
a fish token as proof, right?

474
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,040
Of course.

475
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,420
What's the process?

476
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,230
The client shows the fish token

477
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,910
and the property they want to put in.

478
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,670
What about the property?

479
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,430
Only when it's confirmed

480
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,110
and the information on the fish token is registered

481
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,970
can it be stored in the warehouse.

482
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,190
You want to check

483
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,470
our former clients?

484
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,060
Yes.

485
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,340
Okay. I'll go get the ledger.

486
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,970
They're useless.

487
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,660
Why?

488
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,670
If the thief cased the joint

489
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,730
for the purpose of confirming the situation,

490
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,470
he wouldn't reveal his true identity.

491
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,000
The fish token must be fake.

492
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,270
Even though he had to show his money,

493
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,750
he wouldn't really put his property here.

494
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,350
Because it would leave something unfinished.

495
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,450
I see.

496
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,550
Boss.

497
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,590
Let me ask you.

498
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,070
Is there such a person?

499
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,110
He came here many times and stayed here for a long time.

500
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,070
But in the end,

501
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,220
he changed his mind.

502
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,380
There really is such a person.

503
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,390
His money was already put in the warehouse.

504
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,490
He suddenly patted his forehead and said

505
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,720
he had to use the money for cash flow.

506
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,710
His change of mind

507
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,630
made us work on it

508
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,580
for two hours.

509
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,430
Do you remember

510
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,430
what he looks like?

511
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:04,910
Yes.

512
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,350
I've been a manager for so many years.

513
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,150
I'm good at remembering people.

514
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,190
Tell me. I'll draw.

515
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,350
What are his characteristics?

516
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,950
Okay.

517
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,550
Zhao Ruyi found another way.

518
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,670
He went to the locksmith to get the blueprint

519
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,230
and figured out the internal structure.

520
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,630
Then he went to make a key.

521
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,410
He's so meticulous.

522
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,620
He doesn't want others to know it.

523
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,070
You saw Lu Chenghuang.

524
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,590
What kind of person is he?

525
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,890
He's not a good person.

526
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,430
But I don't think he's the murderer.

527
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,370
Otherwise, he's too bold.

528
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,360
Where is Sun Bao?

529
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,670
Sun Bao said he wanted to see...

530
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,590
Vice Minister.

531
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,490
Vice Minister.

532
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,790
This person may be

533
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,230
Zhao Ruyi's accomplice.

534
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,030
Don't move.

535
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,620
Is this criminal in prison?

536
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,230
Yes or no?

537
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,430
Yes.

538
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,890
Bring him to me. I'll interrogate him.

539
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,750
Vice Minister.

540
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,520
This is the prison of the Jinwu Guards.

541
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,320
What's wrong?

542
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,350
The Jinwu Guards often

543
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,250
come to the Court of Judicial Review and ask for prisoners.

544
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,880
Can't the prisoners of the Jinwu Guards

545
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,770
be interrogated by the Court of Judicial Review?

546
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,390
Let me inform General first.

547
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,600
Bring him here first.

548
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,980
I'll tell Qiu Qingzhi about it.

549
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,050
This is also the case of the Ministry of Justice.

550
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,860
Assistant Minister.

551
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,060
Why are you here?

552
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,060
Vice Minister Li.

553
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,180
I was going to the Court of Judicial Review

554
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,320
to see you.

555
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,350
I heard you came here.

556
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,100
So I came here specially.

557
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,750
Assistant Minister.

558
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,900
Why do you want to see me?

559
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
There's no hurry.

560
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,810
Solving cases is more important.

561
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,470
What?

562
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,690
The Court of Judicial Review and the Ministry of Justice

563
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,950
are not as effective as

564
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,210
your general's words?

565
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,050
My lords, this way.

566
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:17,950
Aren't you...

567
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,590
Yes.

568
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,030
It's me.

569
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,830
But...

570
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,590
I've confessed

571
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,830
everything already.

572
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,960
I'm the one interrogating you now.

573
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,670
I was imprisoned

574
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,710
with Zhao Ruyi before.

575
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,920
We were in the same cell.

576
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,850
He was nice and took good care of me.

577
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,030
After getting released,

578
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,950
he even gave me some money

579
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,350
for me to run a small trade.

580
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,310
I have no reason to kill him.

581
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,850
Tell me about the storage facility.

582
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:39,950
Zhao Ruyi asked me to help

583
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,830
and check the location.

584
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,310
I didn't know anything else.

585
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,950
Really?

586
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,230
Yes.

587
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,530
He didn't tell me and I didn't ask.

588
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,550
For people like us,

589
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,820
the less we know about each other,

590
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,230
the better.

591
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,170
Then what?

592
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,900
After helping Zhao Ruyi,

593
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,190
everything was in peace for a long while.

594
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,250
Nothing happened.

595
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,030
A few days ago,

596
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,510
Zhao Ruyi suddenly came to me

597
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,950
and told me to go hide.

598
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,720
He didn't tell me why.

599
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,070
He just said

600
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,310
something went wrong

601
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,990
and told me to stay away for a while.

602
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,870
I was getting ready to leave the city

603
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,000
when I was targeted.

604
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,510
You all know

605
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,320
what happened next.

606
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,710
Have you done anything else

607
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,100
other than Zhao Ruyi's matter?

608
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,070
No.

609
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:23,950
Really.

610
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,610
My Lord, I have a proper business.

611
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,430
Why would I commit treason?

612
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,390
If it weren't for the fact

613
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,350
that Zhao Ruyi helped me before,

614
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,110
I'd never help him

615
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,830
with this.

616
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,290
My Lord,

617
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,870
please investigate this.

618
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,510
In that case,

619
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,510
why did the Jinwu Guards arrest you?

620
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,630
Answer him.

621
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,190
If you don't,

622
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,150
I'll give you a taste of torture.

623
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,790
I'll tell you.

624
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,320
They asked me

625
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,710
if I knew someone

626
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,760
called Xu Hu.

627
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,470
They said he was a constable.

628
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,310
Xu Hu?

629
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,670
This...

630
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,390
My Lord, I'm innocent.

631
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,670
Please investigate more.

632
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,150
I really am innocent.

633
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,650
Go back.

634
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,170
My Lord.

635
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,870
Stay put.

636
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,330
Vice Minister,

637
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,230
do you know this Xu Hu

638
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,090
that the criminal mentioned?

639
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,250
It's not clear yet.

640
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,720
Vice Minister Li.

641
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,300
Assistant Minister.

642
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,460
Why didn't you inform me

643
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,550
that you came to the Jinwu Guard for an interrogation?

644
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,230
Well...

645
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,440
Consultant Lai,

646
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,270
we haven't

647
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,510
met in a long time.

648
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,230
Yes.

649
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,870
You have been

650
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,020
promoted?

651
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,630
I took part in the arrest of this man.

652
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,850
Besides, the cases are intertwined.

653
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,200
In the past, the Jinwu Guard

654
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,030
would also go to the Court of Judicial Review for interrogations.

655
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,510
Is there any problem

656
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,390
with me investigating the case here?

657
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,320
Of course not.

658
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,270
Of course not.

659
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,350
Why did

660
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,650
the Jinwu Guard look for Xu Hu?

661
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,030
Vice Minister Li,

662
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,070
you know him too?

663
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,050
He is related to one of

664
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,060
the Court of Judicial Review's cases.

665
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,570
Please cooperate.

666
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,350
Of course.

667
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,510
In the past two years,

668
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,450
there have been some

669
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,400
unsolved murder cases in the Jingji Circuit.

670
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,730
We've always suspected

671
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,230
that Xu Hu did it.

672
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Murder cases?

673
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,490
Who died?

674
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,570
They're people who did dirty things.

675
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,000
Dirty?

676
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,040
Gangsters?

677
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,560
Gangsters usually

678
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
fight amongst themselves.

679
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,050
It's survival of the fittest.

680
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,270
They don't need a reason

681
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,430
to kill someone.

682
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,550
But at that time,

683
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,280
Xu Hu should have already died.

684
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,120
How did you know it was him?

685
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,590
Vice Minister Li,

686
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,000
usually when you do

687
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,110
dirty things,

688
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,470
dead people

689
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,650
are more valuable.

690
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,410
The victims

691
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,170
tended to cherish their lives

692
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,670
and were heavily guarded.

693
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,330
Ordinary people

694
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,460
couldn't kill them,

695
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,950
but Xu Hu could.

696
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,070
In the past,

697
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,520
he was a top scout.

698
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,630
Then why did you investigate

699
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,890
the criminal just now?

700
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,640
Well...

701
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,350
I don't know.

702
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,990
The Jinwu Guard

703
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,160
has so many secrets.

704
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,710
Vice Minister Li,

705
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,670
do you not have secrets?

706
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,300
Whether it's the Court of Judicial Review solving cases

707
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,030
or the Jinwu Guard arresting people,

708
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,390
clues are very valuable

709
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,750
to all of us.

710
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,150
If a bit of news

711
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,150
leaks out,

712
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:17,990
the consequences

713
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,320
will be unpredictable.

714
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,920
General Qiu

715
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,640
usually

716
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,350
just doesn't talk much.

717
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,070
The Jinwu Guard

718
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,150
is not as bad

719
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,670
as you make us out to be.

720
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,950
I just heard about

721
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,440
what happened just now.

722
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,910
If not for the fact

723
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,450
that I'm like General Qiu,

724
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,630
how could I

725
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,710
be sincere towards you.

726
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,650
The cases may have other overlapping parts.

727
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,670
I might visit

728
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,930
the Jinwu Guard again.

729
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,870
Vice Minister Li, feel free to investigate.

730
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,350
If you need my help,

731
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,800
please don't hold back.

732
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,530
Vice Minister Li,

733
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,590
one of your subordinates

734
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,270
was a scout too, right?

735
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,330
Okay.

736
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,630
I'm just reminding you.

737
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,390
A gentleman

738
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,720
shouldn't stand under a falling wall.

739
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,880
Vice Minister Li, be careful.

740
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,790
Thank you,

741
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,130
but there are no problems with my men.

742
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,020
What's the matter, Assistant Minister?

743
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,270
Nothing important.

744
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,230
Let me see you off.

745
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,650
What are you doing?

746
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,140
What are you doing?

747
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,430
Vice Minister Li,

748
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,710
I came to you

749
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,350
for this.

750
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,630
Let go!

751
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,370
Behave!

752
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,110
You—

753
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,330
Assistant Minister.

754
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,130
This is unnecessary.

755
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,470
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

756
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:06,810
No problem.

757
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,390
Since it's your request...

758
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,230
Show him.

759
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,690
Where is this from?

760
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,510
It was stuck

761
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,030
in Zhao Ruyi's throat.

762
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,230
The coroner of the Ministry of Justice found it

763
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,190
when the Ministry of Justice examined the body again.

764
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,150
Only the elite soldiers

765
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,830
of the scout camp were qualified

766
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,590
to wear the wolf's head pendant.

767
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,110
Am I right?

768
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,590
Scouts are top soldiers.

769
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,880
They are rare among the veterans who returned

770
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,480
to the capital after the war.

771
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,400
Those with the wolf's head pendant

772
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,310
are even rarer.

773
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,030
You and Xu Hu are one of them.

774
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,190
The wolf's head pendant is an honor.

775
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,800
Those who wear it rarely part with it,

776
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,250
such as in your case.

777
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,990
But two years ago,

778
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,070
this pendant was not found

779
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,830
on Xu Hu's body,

780
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,830
right?

781
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,830
Xu Hu

782
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,670
died by drowning.

783
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,550
Maybe

784
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,070
it was lost in the water.

785
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,950
Are you trying to say

786
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,030
Xu Hu is still alive

787
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,170
and he killed Zhao Ruyi, right?

788
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,160
Ridiculous.

789
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,790
You guessed that based off the wolf's head pendant.

790
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,030
Anyone could've gotten it after Xu Hu died.

791
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,430
The Jinwu Guard is also searching for Xu Hu.

792
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,070
Qiu Qingzhi never does things

793
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,400
that he's unsure about.

794
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,820
A few years ago,

795
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,280
the Ministry of Justice sent many spies

796
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,800
to inquire about Lu Chenghuang's business.

797
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,390
However,

798
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,430
most of them were killed.

799
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,160
Xu Hu was the last one.

800
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,190
But before he died,

801
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,470
the Ministry of Justice already got their eyes on him.

802
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,910
You mean Xu Hu was the mole

803
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,060
and pretended to die to avoid trouble?

804
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,980
Impossible.

805
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,860
Impossible.

806
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,630
I read the dossier

807
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,710
that the Ministry of Justice's Assistant Minister brought.

808
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,910
Zhao Ruyi had a grudge against Lu Chenghuang.

809
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,810
He had

810
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,320
stolen from Lu Chenghuang before.

811
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,160
His finger was cut off

812
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,230
by Lu Chenghuang's men

813
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,070
and Zhao Ruyi

814
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,430
was also arrested because of this.

815
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,160
The person who arrested him...

816
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,190
It was Xu Hu.

817
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,330
You mean

818
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,880
Zhao Ruyi stole from Lu Chenghuang

819
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,790
for revenge after getting released,

820

while Xu Hu helped Lu Chenghuang

821
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,310

822
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,840
He works for Lu Chenghuang?

823

He's my brother.

824

He saved my life before.

825
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,750
He can't be the murderer

826
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,790

Even if I don't dissect the body,

871
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,790
the corpse can tell me

What?

875

The coroner of the Ministry of Justice came to check the body

876
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,030
and said they found the wolf's head pendant

877

were similar to what scouts used.

If Xu Hu is indeed a thief,

00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,840
Sun Bao.

963
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,830
Xu Hu is your brother.

964
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,630
So are we.

965
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,430
Careful!

966
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,150
Here.

967
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:27,930
Be careful.

968
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,800
Are you okay?

969
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,710
Hold on.

970
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,560
Thank you.

971
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,150
Did I scare you?

972
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,180
It's fine.

973
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,790
Are you Bao's friends?

974
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,430
Yes.

975
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,110
Did he ask you to send me something again?

976
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,050
No need.

977
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,330
I don't lack anything here.

978
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,520
I don't need anything either.

979
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,410
Thanks.

980
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,070
Sun Bao asked us to come.

981
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,920
Have a seat.

982
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,350
No need.

983
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,750
Let me get you some water.

984
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,470
Here.

985
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,950
Have a seat.

986
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,430
Let me get you some water.

987
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,980
Thank you.

988
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,050
Let me do it.

989
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,150
Okay.

990
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,600
Bao calls me Uncle Yang in private.

991
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,300
You can call me Yang.

992
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,280
Have you...

993
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,640
been to the battlefield?

994
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,610
Yes.

995
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,670
I'm an old man.

996
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,750
I was just there to make up the numbers.

997
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,390
As you can see,

998
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,830
I just got lucky.

999
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,790
Did Xu Hu save you?

1000
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,230
You know about Hu?

1001
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,200
Sun Bao mentioned him to us.

1002
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,610
Yes.

1003
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,230
When our troops returned to Shendu,

1004
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,500
the bandits attacked us

1005
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,870
and struck me from the front.

1006
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,930
I lost a lot of blood

1007
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,890
and thought I was a goner for sure.

1008
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,270
Hu saved me.

1009
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,920
He and Bao

1010
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,930
dragged me back to the Shendu.

1011
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,230
After that,

1012
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,170
they continued to take care of me.

1013
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,910
My son died on the battlefield.

1014
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,070
They

1015
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,310
are just like my own sons.

1016
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,350
Why did I say that?

1017
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,910
I'm not that lucky.

1018
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,230
Bao came to see me not long ago.

1019
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,080
And now, the two of you are here.

1020
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,950
What happened?

1021
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,550
Xu Hu might still be alive.

1022
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,610
He might have killed someone too.

1023
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,740
That's impossible.

1024
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,790
I personally recovered

1025
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,270
Hu's body back then.

1026
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,970
How could he still be alive?

1027
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,360
What are you thinking?

1028
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,220
You've been quiet the entire way.

1029
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,700
Mr. Li.

1030
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,890
I've always wanted to ask.

1031
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,100
Why did

1032
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,870
the war happen 3 years ago?

1033
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,910
The Zixu State of the Western Regions invaded us.

1034
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,280
The imperial court sent troops to fight back

1035
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,150
with overwhelming strength

1036
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,950
and destroyed the small nation.

1037
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,080
The situation was very rushed.

1038
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,630
The war started before

1039
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,290
preparations were complete.

1040
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,830
Qiu Qingzhi also joined the battlefield

1041
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:32,630
at that time.

1042
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,240
Was this war

1043
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,990
a hard-earned victory?

1044
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,850
No.

1045
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,910
Three months after the imperial court

1046
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,350
sent out the troops,

1047
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,750
Zixu State was defeated.

1048
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,190
Then,

1049
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,110
why did an old man like him

1050
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,710
have to join the battlefield too?

1051
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,920
Vice Minister!

1052
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,430
Sir!

1053
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,070
Sir!

1054
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:52,940
What's wrong?

1055
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,550
Sir...

1056
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,590
Say it.

1057
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,170
Tell me.

1058
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,270
Someone died again.

1059
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,620
Yes.

1060
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,110
Mr. Li!

1061
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,630
Mr. Li!

1062
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,390
Wait for me!

1063
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,780
[Court of Judicial Review]
