Where is Chen Shi?

00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,390
Could it be that Vice Minister Shangguan

Having one or two vice ministers play that role

80
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,070

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,660
You need to ask me something?

197
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,400
Yuan Buer said

198
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,870
you're from the Court of Judicial Review,

199
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,180
and you have Chen Shi.

200
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,710
He said if we want to solve the Demon Cat Case, we have to come to you.

201
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,780
Who on earth are you?

202
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,650
I have a few questions

203
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,510
for you as well.

204
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,780
Answer me first.

205
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,000
Questions for us?

206
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:24,710
Sun Bao.

207
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,880
Stay where you are.

208
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,530
Don't move!

209
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,370
Don't move. Don't move.

210
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,230
He's holding a sword to my throat.

211
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,090
He's holding a sword to my throat.

212
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,310
That's really Chen Shi.

213
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,030
Guys, he's holding a sword to my throat.

214
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,960
What do you want?

215
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,930
Who is in charge of the Court of Judicial Review now?

216
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,620
Vice Minister Shangguan Qin.

217
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,190
Don't you even know that?

218
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,820
The position of Minister of Judicial Review

219
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,600
is open?

220
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,050
Yes.

221
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,290
It makes sense now.

222
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,400
Are you here for the Demon Cat Case

223
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,860
or for Chen Shi?

224
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,270
Is there a difference?

225
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,370
Of course there is.

226
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,760
The arrest warrant

227
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,150
has made him

228
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,080
the suspect in this case.

229
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,510
Maybe you want to make him the scapegoat

230
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,110
instead of solving the case.

231
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,030
Those are obviously two different things.

232
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,630
We're here to solve the case.

233
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
But is Chen Shi okay?

234
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,390
I'm fine.

235
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,310
No.

236
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,110
Don't move, guys!

237
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,840
I'm not okay.

238
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,910
My life is in danger.

239
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,830
Don't move.

240
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,780
You think this case

241
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,600
has nothing to do with Chen Shi?

242
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,210
We can't say it has nothing to do with him,

243
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,390
but he indeed doesn't have much to do with it.

244
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,080
Then what do you think is the truth

245
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,480
about the Demon Cat Case?

246
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,450
Who on earth are you?

247
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,470
My buddies and I will have to take the fall

248
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,870
for the Court of Judicial Review.

249
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,540
We don't have time

250
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,110
for your endless questions.

251
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,800
What do you want to achieve

252
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,460
by holding Chen Shi hostage?

253
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,440
Just be honest with us.

254
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,510
You're dealing with

255
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,840
such an important case.

256
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,150
Instead of figuring out a way to crack it,

257
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,010
you're trying to shift the blame.

258
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,350
You're from Mingjing Hall.

259
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,860
You should be too ashamed to yell at me.

260
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,340
What do you know?

261
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,340
This case is complicated,

262
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,130
and there are limits to what we can do.

263
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,670
Under pressure from different fronts,

264
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,600
we're up a stump.

265
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,060
You must have held Chen Shi hostage

266
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,040
and invited us here

267
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,960
for a good reason.

268
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,160
Please enlighten us.

269
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,990
Like you,

270
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,290
I'm also from Mingjing Hall.

271
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,440
Are you…

272
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,410
Mingjing Hall used to

273
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,900
be the head of the Court of Judicial Review.

274
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,200
The Court of Judicial Review

275
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,440
can't close any case

276
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,010
by claiming the culprit is a demon.

277
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,530
You know it all?

278
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,320
The only thing you need to do now

279
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,470
is prove that this case

280
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,040
has nothing to do with demons.

281
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,900
That can get you some wiggle room.

282
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,990
This case is tricky and mysterious

283
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,670
because

284
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,020
the murderer is reportedly a demon cat.

285
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,150
But that's the trick the murderer used

286
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,710
to cover himself up.

287
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,550
As long as you figure out how that trick worked,

288
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,900
the case can be solved.

289
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,690
So that's a smokescreen.

290
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,780
Shut up.

291
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,430
Chen Shi!

292
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,880
Chen Shi! Chen Shi!

293
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,040
General.

294
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,810
What's it?

295
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,290
General.

296
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,240
I noticed something weird.

297
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,710
Today, a case was reported

298
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,840
in the South Market.

299
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,570
A murder happened in a restaurant.

300
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,700
Its owner was killed

301
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,180
by his wife and her lover.

302
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,550
They ruined his body to cover their tracks.

303
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,460
What's the problem?

304
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,320
The person who reported the murder

305
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,050
was a waiter at the restaurant.

306
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,290
According to him,

307
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,990
it was two guests who noticed that something was off.

308
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,460
One of them is the suspect

309
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,690
in the Demon Cat Case.

310
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,440
A fortune teller said the other

311
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,040
is an official at the Court of Judicial Review.

312
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,010
As far as I know,

313
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,270
the Court of Judicial Review

314
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,440
hasn't arrested the suspect.

315
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,310
And according to the waiter,

316
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,200
the purported official of the Court of Judicial Review

317
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,600
found out the whole crime

318
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,190
just by tasting

319
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,270
the dishes.

320
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,280
That's unbelievable.

321
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,070
So I'm wondering

322
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,970
since when

323
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,090
the Court of Judicial Review

324
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,890
has had such a capable official.

325
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,980
[Mingjing Hall]

326
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,080
Madam.

327
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,910
They're back.

328
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,470
Stop!

329
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,850
Where are you going?

330
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,800
Where did you go?

331
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,910
Madam.

332
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,350
We went to perform a ritual

333
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,130
to catch the demon cat.

334
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,140
A ritual?

335
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,690
How dare you lie through your teeth?

336
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,150
What kind of ritual was it that you had to perform secretly?

337
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,300
[Mingjing Hall]

338
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:14,860
Madam.

339
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,280
They also beat me with a sack over my head.

340
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,790
You were beaten, Mr. Hu?

341
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,610
That is too bad.

342
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,780
You can't accuse us of doing it.

343
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,980
Do you have evidence?

344
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,340
Where on earth did you go?

345
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,050
Madam.

346
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,130
Didn't you say you'd give us your full support

347
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,200
and take full responsibility?

348
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,150
Then just let us carry out our plan.

349
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,240
And please tell Mr. Hu

350
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,140
to stop watching us.

351
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,930
We won't run away.

352
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,200
[Mingjing Hall]

353
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,230
I…

354
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,560
How dare you beat me!

355
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,790
You beat me.

356
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,140
You guys are dead.

357
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,600
Madam.

358
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,790
Tell us.

359
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,680
What happened to Mingjing Hall?

360
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,220
Who could that guy be?

361
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,240
I can't believe

362
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,600
you know nothing about it.

363
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,080
Tell us now.

364
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
Mingjing Hall

365
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,320
was established

366
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,250
by the Minister of Judicial Review.

367
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,420
It solved countless major and strange cases.

368
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,720
It played a pivotal role

369
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,040
in upholding the laws.

370
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,210
Really?

371
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,150
The son of the Minister of Judicial Review,

372
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,860
Mr. Li Bing,

373
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,950
was a rare genius.

374
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,350
It's said that

375
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,310
he often helped solve cases

376
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,310
in Mingjing Hall.

377
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,240
Then how did Mingjing Hall

378
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,430
end up like this?

379
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,360
Three years ago,

380
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,600
the Minister of Judicial Review died.

381
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,710
Li Bing escorted his father's coffin back to their hometown,

382
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,440
and no one heard from him again.

383
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,430
Since then,

384
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,920
Mingjing Hall has been on the wane.

385
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,910
Then that mysterious man…

386
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,230
I'm afraid he once worked

387
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,710
at Mingjing Hall.

388
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,950
Then it makes sense

389
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,030
that he secretly took away Chen Shi

390
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,550
and tried to solve the Demon Cat Case himself.

391
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,750
Mingjing Hall has lost

392
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,750
its former glory.

393
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,870
He feels bad about it.

394
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,130
It's understandable.

395
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:55,870
Now,

396
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,170
let's sum it up.

397
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,670
He is on our side.

398
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,640
I feel that

399
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,950
we've been looked down on.

400
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,150
He's just given us pointers as a senior.

401
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,349
It's like a wake-up call.

402
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,750
That's a great metaphor.

403
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,450
No matter how tricky a case is,

404
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,180
there will be clues to crack it.

405
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,530
As that senior said,

406
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,599
as long as we can find out

407
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,000
how the so-called demon cat killed people,

408
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,760
we don't have to take the blame.

409
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,349
Since Mingjing Hall

410
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,950
was very powerful in the past,

411
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,950
we can't

412
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,349
chicken out!

413
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,010
It's just a smokescreen.

414
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,720
I can conjure a demon cat too.

415
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,130
[The Demon Cat Case]

416
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,470
It's so late.

417
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,710
Where did you get the food?

418
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,020
The moon is bright tonight.

419
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,360
I can see things clearly.

420
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,500
In the yard, there are gumbos,

421
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,810
some wild greens, and mushrooms.

422
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,990
I picked some

423
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,890
and made porridge.

424
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,790
I also put bird eggs in it.

425
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,050
Mr. Li.

426
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,350
Eat it while it's hot.

427
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,450
Thank you.

428
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,410
No problem.

429
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,270
Why don't you eat?

430
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:27,790
I'm fine.

431
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,230
I'm just a little distraught.

432
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,830
I came to Shendu

433
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,320
to look for my brother.

434
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,240
Unexpectedly,

435
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,470
I somehow was involved

436
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,320
in the Demon Cat Case,

437
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,920
and my name was on the notice that the Court of Judicial Review posted.

438
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,450
And the demon cat was made up

439
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,270
by the Court of Judicial Review.

440
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
I'm really sorry.

441
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,270
Don't be.

442
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,790
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Li.

443
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,420
It's okay.

444
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,180
I'm from the Court of Judicial Review.

445
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,910
Since it has done something wrong,

446
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,040
I should apologize.

447
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,170
Chen Shi.

448
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,680
I swear I'll get justice for you,

449
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,440
Xiaohuan,

450
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,240
and those victims

451
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,170
three years ago.

452
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,600
I know, Mr. Li.

453
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,040
You know?

454
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,280
Then let's eat.

455
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,180
Mr. Li.

456
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,780
I…

457
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,960
I have another question for you.

458
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,150
Go ahead.

459
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,720
You told me

460
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,630
you had taken over

461
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,750
my case from them.

462
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,870
But it appeared

463
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,300
that you

464
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
didn't know them,

465
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,500
and they didn't seem to know you either.

466
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,340
If you didn't know them,

467
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,200
how did you get me out of the prison

468
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,760
of the Court of Judicial Review?

469
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,620
Can you tell me?

470
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,550
I didn't expect you

471
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,950
to wise up to that.

472
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,990
What?

473
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,970
I mean,

474
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,810
I did lie to you.

475
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,530
I lied

476
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,390
because I have a secret.

477
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,290
And that secret

478
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,270
is the reason

479
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,310
why I left Shendu

480
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,950
three years ago

481
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,550
and why I came back

482
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,500
three years later.

483
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,310
As for why I left Shendu

484
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,150
three years ago

485
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:19,580
and why I came back to Shendu

486
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,630
three years later,

487
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,150
it's…

488
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:21,950
Mr. Li. Mr. Li.

489
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,480
You're confusing me.

490
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,920
Have some porridge.

491
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,010
Chen Shi, is there any more porridge?

492
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,980
Yes.

493
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,960
You can eat mine.

494
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,870
It's a little cold.

495
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,200
I'll go get some for you.

496
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,960
Wait for me.

497
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,010
Okay.

498
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,510
Go.

499
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,400
[Li Residence]

500
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,240
Search.

501
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,970
-Yes.
-Yes.

502
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,180
Stop!

503
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,780
Where is the person who was with you?

504
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,380
I don't know.

505
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,160
I'll give you one last chance.

506
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,870
Where is the person

507
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,800
who was with you?

508
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,130
I don't know!

509
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,400
Take him away.

510
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,310
Yes.

511
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,090
Get up.

512
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,750
Move.

513
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,620
Mr. Li.

514
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,660
Mr. Li.

515
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,990
Li Bing?

516
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,110
Don't shout so loudly

517
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,370
every time you wake up.

518
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,300
I'm here.

519
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,750
Mr. Li.

520
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,230
Mr. Li.

521
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,770
Mr. Li.

522
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,070
Last night,

523
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,620
a group of people with swords

524
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,110
wanted to catch me.

525
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,220
And you…

526
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,870
Your

527
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,310
eyes…

528
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,080
What's wrong with my eyes?

529
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,880
Nothing.

530
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,470
By the way,

531
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,260
the man last night

532
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,790
was the general you met

533
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,710
on the bridge.

534
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,170
I know.

535
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,420
Then why…

536
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,490
Why did he...

537
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,470
I told you this before.

538
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,970
He and I are acquainted.

539
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,170
He has issues with me.

540
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,690
Now, it seems

541
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,670
that he's on the opposite side

542
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,220
of the Court of Judicial Review.

543
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,190
I'm afraid he came

544
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,650
for the Demon Cat Case too.

545
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,720
He came for the Demon Cat Case as well?

546
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,070
Then…

547
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,270
That's all

548
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,290
I can think of now.

549
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,390
If he

550
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,390
is going against us,

551
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,490
it will be more difficult for us

552
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,670
to solve the case.

553
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,110
We have to hurry up.

554
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,470
Mr. Li.

555
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,250
Without you,

556
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,340
I'd have been taken away by them last night.

557
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,560
You said a lot

558
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,480
when we had porridge.

559
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,990
Although I didn't completely get it,

560
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,030
I understood some of it.

561
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,960
You've got plans of your own,

562
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,890
and I'm wanted again.

563
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,760
Why don't you just leave me behind?

564
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,220
This way,

565
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,000
you can carry out your plans.

566
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,440
I trust you.

567
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,420
Sooner or later,

568
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,440
you'll solve

569
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,030
my case.

570
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,420
What's wrong?

571
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,080
You don't want to investigate the case anymore?

572
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,320
Of course I do.

573
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,280
I just don't want to be your burden.

574
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,470
What does the whole thing have to do with you?

575
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,670
You saw it yesterday.

576
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,260
Those people came at me.

577
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,380
The Demon Cat Case,

578
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,750
I'll crack it.

579
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,100
So don't think of yourself

580
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,830
as a burden.

581
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,290
Do you mean it?

582
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,420
But

583
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,550
don't let me hear you say

584
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,000
anything like that again.

585
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,560
Eat.

586
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,870
Okay.

587
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,820
What are we going to investigate?

588
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,880
We'll go find Xiaohuan.

589
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,910
Xiaohuan?

590
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,590
To be exact,

591
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,490
we'll go find Xiaohuan's father.

592
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,080
To make the demon cat kill someone,

593
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,870
the culprit

594
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,080
must have precise timing.

595
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,130
Any minute earlier or later

596
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,190
would affect the effect of the trick.

597
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,340
So the coachman was very important.

598
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,450
Only he could control

599
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,310
the speed of the carriage

600
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,710
and signal his accomplices to do the trick.

601
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,820
That senior military officer was on an errand.

602
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,480
He had to drive the carriage to the destination

603
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,130
before the curfew

604
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,130
so that the victim

605
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,130
couldn't return.

606
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,820
After the incident,

607
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,330
Gu disappeared without a reason.

608
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,390
People at the carriage shop said

609
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,050
he was killed by the demon cat.

610
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,120
But it's not mentioned

611
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,970
in the scrolls

612
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,600
from Mingjing Hall.

613
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,360
It looks like this case is not that simple.

614
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,790
Where are Wang Qi and the others?

615
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,260
They stayed up all night

616
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,430
and cleared

617
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,590
the whole backyard

618
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,050
this morning.

619
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,550
Then they moved a lot of stuff into it.

620
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,910
The door is locked.

621
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,430
I don't know what they're doing.

622
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,750
Vice Minister.

623
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,190
Vice Minister.

624
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,350
Vice Minister.

625
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,260
Bad news!

626
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,050
What happened?

627
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,450
Something bad happened.

628
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:06,950
Come.

629
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:07,590
This way.

630
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,280
What have you been doing?

631
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,710
The ritual failed,

632
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,790
but it was worth it.

633
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,410
What?

634
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,960
What are you talking about?

635
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,830
Where is this place?

636
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:23,890
Please.

637
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,690
What are you doing?

638
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,540
What are you doing?

639
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,600
What are you doing?

640
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,220
Young Miss.

641
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,870
Young Miss.

642
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,300
Alibaba!

643
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:37,990
Young Miss.

644
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,540
Alibaba!

645
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,610
Alibaba!

646
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,650
Young Miss.

647
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,130
Alibaba!

648
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,180
Seal the smoke.

649
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,630
Wang Qi,

650
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,850
let me down now!

651
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,090
Young Miss.

652
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,280
Let go of her.

653
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,580
Sorry, Vice Minister.

654
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:04,750
Young Miss.

655
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,680
Are you alright?

656
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,160
What do you want?

657
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,060
What on earth do you want?

658
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,710
Answer me.

659
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,240
The demon cat murder case, Vice Minister.

660
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,230
The demon cat

661
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,680
killed people.

662
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,690
This is how the murderer

663
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,690
in the Demon Cat Case killed people?

664
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,630
It's basically so,

665
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,730
Madam.

666
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,210
How did you figure it out?

667
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,580
Magic tricks are used a lot in circuses.

668
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,020
They all originate in the Western Regions.

669
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,930
In ancient times,

670
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:52,880
Indian performers

671
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,790
could do magic tricks to cut off their limbs

672
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,650
and pull out their insides.

673
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,290
Such performances have a long history.

674
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,760
There are lots of records about them.

675
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,510
Those tricks are not rare.

676
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,160
Alibaba made a contribution too.

677
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,380
In my hometown,

678
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,960
I saw many magic tricks.

679
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,120
Vice Minister,

680
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,380
I'm happy to be of help.

681
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,310
Madam.

682
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,470
Lime generates steam on contact with water.

683
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,190
The murderer used the steam for cover.

684
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,080
But the river in the moat

685
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,140
is flowing.

686
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,230
That's simple.

687
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,290
He could use a barrier

688
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,900
to block most of the water

689
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,010
and then pour lots of lime into it.

690
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,790
Then his goal could be achieved.

691
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,690
But

692
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,790
there was nothing above the moat.

693
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,630
How could he hang someone there?

694
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,490
Besides,

695
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,900
how did the body appear

696
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,190
above the Zhuque Gate?

697
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,090
How did the body…

698
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,250
It…

699
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,540
Kongming lantern.

700
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,250
But

701
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,250
no one saw any light that night.

702
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,970
How big did the Kongming lantern have to be

703
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,570
to lift someone into the air?

704
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,270
That's impossible.

705
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,430
Nothing is impossible.

706
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,510
We just need to understand

707
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,710
how the trick worked.

708
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,820
Then how do you explain

709
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,880
the cuts on the body

710
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,480
that were left by some beast?

711
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,180
I was in the army for many years.

712
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,510
Other than real beasts,

713
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,090
iron claws and steel clips

714
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,490
can cause the same wound.

715
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,230
Madam.

716
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,180
Have you noticed this?

717
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,950
What we are discussing now

718
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,650
is not how to catch the demon,

719
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,920
but how the murderer killed the victims.

720
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,460
The murder reportedly committed by the demon cat

721
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,550
was actually committed by a human.

722
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,630
As long as the murderer is a human,

723
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,770
there must be traces.

724
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,490
In Shendu,

725
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,610
there are only a handful of theaters

726
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,490
where magic shows are performed.

727
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,510
As long as I look into them hard enough,

728
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,370
I'll definitely find something.

729
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,430
But…

730
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,180
But

731
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,470
you're worried about

732
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,420
the Demon Cat Case three years ago.

733
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,770
The Court of Judicial Review

734
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,720
closed that case

735
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,120
and confirmed that there were demons.

736
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,520
It's very hard to crack this case.

737
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,180
Therefore,

738
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,880
you

739
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,260
made my buddies and me

740
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,800
take the fall.

741
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,570
Madam.

742
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,880
Now that we're sure

743
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,600
that the murderer is a human,

744
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,550
if this case can't be cracked,

745
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,630
we won't be the ones

746
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,630
to blame.

747
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,170
You

748
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,070
will be

749
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,750
the one to blame.

750
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,270
You…

751
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,710
Madam.

752
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,830
Are we going to

753
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,130
look into this case

754
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,600
or not?

755
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,970
Vice Minister.

756
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,230
They've put you on the spot.

757
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,800
Should we investigate this case

758
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
or not?

759
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,900
Where are you going?

760
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,260
I'm going to meet the minister.

761
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,490
What for?

762
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,610
The key to this matter

763
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,780
doesn't lie in the Court of Judicial Review.

764
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,110
The minister is the key.

765
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,280
That case was ruled a demon crime

766
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,160
three years ago

767
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,290
because of the minister's testimony.

768
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,460
Testimony?

769
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,570
Madam.

770
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,410
[The Court of Judicial Review]

00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,660
Lai Zhongshu?

772
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,430
What are you doing here?

773
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,480
Vice Minister.

774
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,060
I'm here on an errand for General Qiu.

775
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,080
Come in.

776
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,540
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

777
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,480
Great.

778
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,350
It feels so great.

779
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,950
Our conspiracy worked.

780
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,690
Whether this case is investigated or not,

781
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,140
the pressure is not on us.

782
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,160
We should thank that senior

783
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,400
for his advice.

784
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,450
I wonder if he and Chen Shi

It doesn't matter.

788
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,740
He's on our side anyway.

789
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,390
Even if they can't find anything,

790
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,920
we still have a backup plan.

Vice Minister.

794
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,219
You're so audacious.

795
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,659
You colluded with the suspect

796
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,120
and lied to your superior.

797
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,190
Did you bring these dossiers

798
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,340
of the Court of Judicial Review out?

799

M-Madam.

800
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,690
We didn't collude with the suspect.

A senior

00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,790
from the Court of Judicial Review

803
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,800
asked to meet us.

804
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,120
He gave us advice

805
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,790
on h-how to solve the Demon Cat Case.

00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,650
Don't stutter.

807
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,370
You told me

808
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,719
you went to perform a ritual.

809
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,719
Why are you changing your story now?

810
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,889
For selfish reasons,

811
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,719
we planned to report it to you

812
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,070
after we made some progress.

813
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,510
But…

814
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,370
You still lied.

815
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:46,679
But Madam,

816
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,469
no matter what,

817
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,690
we didn't collude with the suspect.

818
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,320
Chen Shi is not a suspect.

819
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,480
And the senior from the Court of Judicial Review

820
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,440
is a real person.

He can be our witness.

826
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:58,750
Yes.

We shouldn't be quarreling.

835

The arrest warrant

836
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,670
was issued by the Court of Judicial Review.

837
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,940
The Court of Judicial Review decided that Chen Shi was a suspect.

00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,700
It can't be a mistake, can it?

839
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,830
I think in the Court of Judicial Review,

840
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,050
we should listen to Vice Minister Shangguan.

00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,620
By the way, Vice Minister,

859

it must have been an illusion.

I've been thinking about the demon cat lately,

882
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,350

It must have been an illusion.

Were the cat's eyes you saw

885
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,640
scary?

worked.

give us more advice?

When we're in cahoots,

we can achieve anything.

939
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,160

with the clue on the magic trick,

941
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,440
we could look into the troupes in Shendu

942
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,350
that can do that trick.

943
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,300

961
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,000
the demon cat won't dare to approach you.

962
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,080
You wizard!

963
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,760
Stop spreading false rumors!

964
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,150
How could you hit him?

965
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,660
Are you from the Court of Judicial Review?

966
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,330
I am.

967
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,240
He's not.

968
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,010
I've seen the arrest warrant.

969
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,560
What brought you here?

970
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,070
I'm here to find the murderer

971
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,360
to dispense justice and reveal the truth.

972
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,490
From the looks of it,

973
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,330
you're the murderer.

974
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,540
I expected the Court of Judicial Review

975
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,910
to come after me,

976
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,400
but I didn't anticipate

977
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,680
this situation.

978
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,800
You people are good at slander.

979
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,360
Dispensing justice

980
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,300
doesn't sound like something you'd do.

981
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,960
Since you're here to catch me,

982
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,710
things are easy.

983
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,450
[The Court of Judicial Review]
