00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,890
You have something to tell me?

5
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,610
But instead of speaking,

6
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,500
you'll gesticulate.

7
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,410
It's a game,

8
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,010
like a charade?

9
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,580
Interesting.

10
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,490
Go ahead.

11
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,710
It seems that he wants Vice Minister Li

12
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,350
to be his translator.

13
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:47,450

It's a holiday.

23
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,020
Why does Vice Minister Shangguan stay in her office

24
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,400
instead of going out for a walk?

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,930
It's none of your business.

Vice Minister Li has gone to the court.

27

Not every day is a holiday.

28
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,950
Can you ask Vice Minister Shangguan

29
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,880
to go out as well?

I just think

33
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,350
Vice Minister Shangguan has been working too hard.

34
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,610
She should take a break

35
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,010
and go out for a walk.

36
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,070
Leave it to me.

talk to her for you.

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,000
But remember,

40
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,280
don't do anything

41
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
out of line.

42
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,350
Don't worry.

43
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,260

Go buy some food

47

48
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,990
Don't worry.

49

67

I'm fine.

69
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,850

72
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,180
would be used to do this one day.

73
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,770
This is more tiring than fighting a war.

I let it go when we were in your residence,

84
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,110
but now that we're in your office,

85
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,040
why haven't you changed into your official uniform?

86

87
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,110

He's an adult now.

92
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,790
He can wear whatever he wants.

93
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,790
I just want to see our son

94
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,620
in his official uniform.

95
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,950
What's wrong with that?

96
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,710
Well,

97
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,470
boys,

98
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,530
help me change.

99
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,320
Change...

100
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,660

No problem.

102
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,780
Go.

103
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,910
He should

104
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,200

109
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,640

You look great.

111
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,990
Let me look at you.

112
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,280
The fabric of your uniform

113
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,409
is no better than my…

114
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,350
The fabric doesn't matter.

115
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,310
What matters is…

116
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,670
It's also a bad fit.

117
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,740
Yeah. Why does it look like

118
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,270
you're wearing my clothes?

119
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,060
I've been too busy with work lately

120
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,990
and lost weight.

121
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,550
Dad.

122
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,420
You should lose some weight too.

123
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,500
Oh, you've been so busy with work

124
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,300
that you…

125
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,180
Then continue to work.

126
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,440
Continue to work.

132
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,990
Look. Our son

133
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,860

134
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,030
Vice Minister…

135
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,900
Vice Minister,

136
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,760
the case files that you need to go over

137
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,320
are all here.

138
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,420
He looks so cool.

139
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,120
Look at his frown.

140
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,600
He's got so much work to do.

141
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,800
Write your remarks.

142
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,960
Write your remarks.

143
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,800
Is he really going to do it?

144
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,270
Do as your mom said.

145
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,970
Okay.

146
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,190
Look at those circles he drew.

147
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,790
His handwriting is better than mine.

148
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,420
Of course.

149
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,920
He's the vice minister.

150
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,260
Guys,

151
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
here's the thing.

152
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,700
We

153
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,060
are the parents

154
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,970
of your vice minister,

155
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,960
but

156
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,850
we're also just ordinary people.

157
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,750

158

have bothered you at work.

159
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,490
How about this?

160
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,420
His father and I

161
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,830
will go have a walk in the yard.

162
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,429
Good idea.

163
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,030
We'll leave you to your work.

164
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,000
You guys,

165
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,090
show my parents

166
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,070
around.

167
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,070
Yes.

00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,230
We're the vice minister's parents.

169

When we want to go out for a walk,

170
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,540
you should let us.

171
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,660
Please.

172
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,640
Let's go.

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,130
Go on with your work.

174
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,660
Go on with your work.

175
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,230
He's the vice minister now.

176
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,710
Write as many remarks as you can.

177
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,040
We're proud of you, son.

178
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,610
Awesome.

Respected in his own fief,

185

he's also praised here.

186
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,050
May he stay diligent and cautious

187
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,840

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,370
Amazing.

196
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,070
Wonderful.

197
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,130
Wonderful.

198
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,250
I've never enjoyed

199
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,230

200
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,260
Maids.

201
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,780
Bring me

202
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,710
my favorite pair of palace lanterns.

203
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,930
I'll give one to either of them

204
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,860
as a reward.

205
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:34,990
Yes.

206
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,050
Great.

207
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,480
Is this the law court?

208
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,200
Yes.

209
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,210
Look.

210
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,920
Look. How magnificent!

211
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,490
Yeah.

212
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,110
Young man,

213
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,400
what's your name?

214
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,260
How many years have you been working here?

215
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,490
My name is Sizhi Jia.

216
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,630
I've been working here for over a year.

217
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,430
Your name means a rich judicial commissioner.

218
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,410
So you're the judicial commissioner

219
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,880
of the Court of Judicial Review?

220
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,640
No.

221
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,380
I'm just a judge.

222
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,200
My name is Sizhi Jia.

223
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,180
My father

224
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,220
wanted me to be

225
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,200
a righteous

226
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,340
and rich man.

227
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,510
So he named me Sizhi Jia.

228
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,450
What an interesting name.

229
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,350
You're good. Keep working hard.

230
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,550
Try to be Shaoqin Jia,

231
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,300
a rich vice minister.

232
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,880
Yeah.

233
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,190
Shaoqin Jia.

234
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,030
Go on with your work.

235
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,200
Let's go over there.

236
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,440
Who are they?

237
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,560
Witnesses in a case.

238
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,190
What they saw at the crime scene was too much for them.

239
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:08,960
So they…

240
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,870
Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang.

241
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,590
It's been so long.

242
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,110
Is Mr. Li coming back soon?

243
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,310
I want to ask that too.

244
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,920
Madam Wang.

245
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,740
Why don't you come with me

246
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,740
to Vice Minister Wang's residence?

247
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,160
Vice Minister Wang

248
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:26,900
is going back soon.

249
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,830
Why don't you go wait for him there?

250
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,360
Our son is going back.

251
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,100
Let's wait for him at his residence.

252
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,620
Okay.

253
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,090
Yes.

254
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,110
Wait.

255
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,260
Sizhi Jia.

256
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,090
I need to borrow this.

257
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,010
Our son's house is dirty.

258
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,380
I'll do the cleaning for him.

259
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,900
Okay.

260
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,830
Where is everybody?

261
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,160
This place was never so empty

262
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,490
on holidays in the past.

263
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,350
Madam.

264
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,170
We've been working on

265
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,540
several major cases lately.

266
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,200
Maybe everyone is tired.

267
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,430
Hurry.

268
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,760
Madam.

269
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,970
I didn't expect to see

270
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,510
a girl in the Court of Judicial Review.

271
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,380
Don't be rude.

272
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,110
She's Vice Minister Shangguan,

273
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,080
not just a girl.

274
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,370
A female vice minister?

275
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,620
You and my son are colleagues.

276
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,290
My son is also a vice minister.

277
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,270
I'd be grateful

278
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,100
if you could help him at work.

279
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,820
Are you Li Bing's...

280
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,370
What Bing?

281
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,660
Not Li Bing?

282
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,200
Then…

283
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,150
My son is Wang Qi.

284
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,700
Vice Minister Wang.

285
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,610
Wang Qi?

286
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,020

288
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,650
Did I say something wrong?

289
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,580
What's going on?

290
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,020
I was wondering

291
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,750
why you were so nice to me today.

292

I didn't know

293
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,450

294
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,620
You appointed a new

295
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,830
vice minister so soon.

296
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,210

297
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,860
I…

298
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,970
Vice Minister, I…

299
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,470
What?

300
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,310
For the Holy Birthday Festival, your Vice Minister Li

301
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,660
has gone to the court to see a show.

302
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,590
Do you want a show too

303
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,380
so you put on one in Mingjing Hall?

304
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,110
Ridiculous.

305
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,740
You're so ridiculous.

307
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
Did you know their plan?

308
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,750
Was that why you persuaded me to go out?

309
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,840
No, no, no.

310
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,390
Madam, I knew nothing about it.

311
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,630
I didn't know

312
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,660
they'd do such an absurd thing

313
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,130
and make me take the fall.

314
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,090
Drop your hands.

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,890

00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,730

387
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,060
and acted out.

388
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,100
You even did

389
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,430
such a ridiculous thing today.

390
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,190
Tell me.

391
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
Do I have any reason

392
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,420
not to stamp that letter?

393
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,640
Vice Minister.

394
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,980
I know I was wrong.

395
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,710
Yeah, Mr. Li.

396
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,870
Mr. Wang…

397
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,630

398
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,520
Shut up.

399
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,000
From today onwards, Wang…

400
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000

401
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,430

402
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,150

404
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,410
Can we say something?

405
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,120
Sorry,

406
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,270
but this is official business.

407
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,000
I know it's official business.

408
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,160
But in a way,

409
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,740
it's also our family business,

410
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,440
isn't it?

411
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,680
Wang Qi is our youngest son.

412
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,900
We had him

413
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,850
when we were already middle-aged.

414
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,050
So,

415
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,150
I've been doting on him.

416
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,540
As the saying goes,

417
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,630
doting children is ruining them.

418
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,860
So, as his parents,

419
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,140
we're also responsible for his mistake.

420
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,400
Vice Minister.

421
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,070
For the sake

422
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,500
of his father and me,

423
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,990
please give him another chance,

424
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,540
will you?

425
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,480
Thank you, Vice Minister.

426
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,460

427
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,020
I want to add something.

428
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,350
I noticed

429
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,160
something was wrong with him.

430
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,750
Those shoes gave him out.

431
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,890
He's bow-legged.

432
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,650
I can tell from the wear on these shoes

433
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,360
that they don't belong to him.

434
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,840
The owner of these shoes

435
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,720
should have an imposing appearance

436
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,340
and a light gait.

437
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,550
It should be someone like you.

438
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,340

439
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,540

440
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,950
Stop.

441
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,180
Let me say something.

443
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,360
I failed to solve

444
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,820
the case from the Ministry of Justice

445
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,580
because I wanted to take shortcuts

446
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,650
and was too eager to prove myself.

447
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,800
It was also because I was lazy

448
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,210
and liked to cut corners.

449
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,790
What I did today

450
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,790
is unforgivable.

451
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,760
I apologize.

452
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,850
I'm too ashamed to beg you

453
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,610
to let me stay in Mingjing Hall,

454
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,860
but I want to tell you

455
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,670
that as long as you can let me stay

456
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,630
in the Court of Judicial Review

457
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,250
to work with my buddies

458
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:43,910
behind me,

459
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,600
I'll work very hard

460
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,380
even if I only get to do scut work.

461
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,440
I'll try my best to get admitted to Mingjing Hall again.

462
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,360
What do you think, Vice Minister Shangguan?

463
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,890
Wang Qi is from Mingjing Hall.

464
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,620
How to punish him is your decision to make.

465
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,520
But in the past two years,

466
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,660
when I was the only vice minister

467
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,460
in the Court of Judicial Review,

468
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,830
Wang Qi has impressed me

469
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,850
as someone with great potential.

470
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,960
All right. It's getting late.

471

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,730
This is the case file

474
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,500
that Wang Qi made remarks on without permission

475
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,990
when he was pretending to be a vice minister.

476
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,220
Silk is not waterproof.

477
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,680
It'll be ruined after being soaked in water for too long.

478
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,940
How could it be intact?

479
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,950
It was probably forged.

486
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,550
I'm sure of that.

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,970
If your judgment is correct

488
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,030
and the murderer can be caught,

Of course.

504
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,850

Fortune-telling. Fortune-telling.

770
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,200
S-Sorry.

771
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,350
[April 16, 2nd year of the Shenggong Era, in the North Market]

772
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,350
Thank you.

773
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,300
You're welcome.

774
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,750
Coming through.

775
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,500
Where is it?

776
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,450
Sir, take a look.

777
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,140
Pendants.

778
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,580
Sir.

779
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,040
Officer,

780
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,390
what can I do for you?

781
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,140
What officer?

782
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,400
You're talking about me.

783
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,920
I'm not an officer.

784
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,690
You appeared to be looking for something.

785
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,990
I was careless

786
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,660
and lost something just now.

787
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,160
It's not worth much.

788
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,150
It's just a pouch

789
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,670
my mother made for me.

790
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,500
Don't bother with it, officer.

791
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,570
Wait.

792
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,340
Look. Are you looking for this?

793
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,989
Yes, yes.

794
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,449
Thank you, officer.

795
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:17,380
-It's okay.
-Thank you, officer.

796
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,290
Open it and take a look.

797
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,489
Is anything missing?

798
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,850
No, no.

799
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,610
Thank you, officer.

800
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,350
Put it away.

801
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,400
Don't lose it again.

802
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,920
Okay.

803
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:34,750
Sir.

804
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,870
Is this your water cart?

805
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,949
Let me help you.

806
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:38,929
Let me help you.

807
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,230
Thank you, officer.

808
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,159
You're welcome.

809
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,710
I sell water.

810
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
A water seller.

811
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:47,790
Sir.

812
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,670
Do you happen to have anything to do with the north?

813
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,350
I'm from the north.

814
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,750
Sir, wait a second.

815
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,730
I need to ask you something.

816
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,700
Water cart. North.

817
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,650
Do I look familiar to you?

818
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,620
Have you met someone

819
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,750
who looks like me

820
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,090
and is called Chen Jiu?

821
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,170
Officer.

822
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,620
You look like a kind man.

823
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,950
But I'm afraid

824
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,090
I've never seen anyone who looks like you before.

825
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,580
It's all right.

826
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,900
I must have missed my brother too badly.

827
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,430
It's okay. I'll leave you then.

828
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,700
See you. See you.

829
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,690
I'm leaving.

830
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,500
Pancakes.

831
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,310
Pancakes.

832
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,120
Chen Shi.

833
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,300
I'm so disappointed in you.

834
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,790
I told you

835
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,290
that if someone attacks you from behind,

836
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,470
you should thrust your elbow

837
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,320
into his stomach

838
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,380
to take him down.

839
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,180
Let's do it again.

840
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,910
No, no, no.

841
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,910
Yield, yield.

842
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:05,750
I yield.

843
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,500
Mr. Wang.

844
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:08,990
I…

845
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,860
I bought you braised pork

846
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,790
from Zuixian Restaurant

847
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,710
and

848
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,240
desserts from Susheng Bakery.

849
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,870
Here.

850
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,890
Where is the sour plum soup from Dasixi Restaurant?

851
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:21,650
Where is it?

852
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,350
Sorry, I forgot to buy it.

853
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:24,790
I spent

854
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,180
some time with Mr. Yuan and forgot about it.

855
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,620
I…

856
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,470
Just as I said,

857
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,820
you're so forgetful.

858
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,100
Do the suplex again.

859
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,180
Please don't!

860
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,110
Mr. Cui. Mr. Cui.

861
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,880
I bought what you asked for too.

862
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,310
50 pieces of paper,

863
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,350
brushes, and ink.

864
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,370
Thank you.

865
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,100
I also asked you to buy hard yellow paper.

866
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,540
Paper?

867
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,260
I bought paper. Look.

868
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,620
It's white and cheap.

869
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,580
Hard yellow paper is used for sutra transcription.

870
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,790
This paper…

871
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,340
I made a mistake again?

872
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,190
Do the suplex.

873
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,570
Here we go.

874
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,010
Do it another time.

875
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,830
These are the questions I selected

876
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,490
from The Mathematical Classic of Master Sun.

877
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,220
Give the paper back to me after answering them.

878
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,790
Okay.

879
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,900
Chen Shi.

880
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,580
The seams on these training clothes

881
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,510
have come apart.

882
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,440
You're good at sewing. Sew them up.

883
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,170
You'll wear them when you practice martial arts.

884
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,260
Okay.

885
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,120
And my boots.

886
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,790
Thank you.

887
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,230
Okay.

888
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,100
Okay.

889
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,580
I'm exhausted.

890
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,350
Mr. Li.

891
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,730
Mr. Li.

892
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,490
How is

893
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,850
Yi Zhi Hua's case going?

894
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,470
I've gone over all the dossiers

895
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,730
in the Secret Chamber.

896
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,910
Logically speaking,

897
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,040
he was once in prison

898
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,350
and had no scruples,

899
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,590
so he must have left traces behind.

900
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,110
But I couldn't find any clues at all.

901
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,810
What can I do to help you?

902
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,960
Help with what?

903
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,050
I've been in the Secret Chamber these days.

904
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,740
Have you learned anything?

905
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,060
Are they good teachers?

906
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,950
They

907
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,880
taught me a lot.

908
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,190
I…

909
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:22,920
Good.

910
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,360
Mr. Li.

911
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,880
You promised

912
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,620
to help me find my brother…

913
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,480
Vice Minister.

914
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:31,990
Why did he follow me here?

915
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,420
What?

916
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,320
Vice Minister.

917
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:34,780
He…

918
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,560
Vice Minister, someone died.

919
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,190
Someone died?

[Xintan Wharf]

921
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,020
Vice Minister.

922
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,790
My family was worried

923
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,010
that I might need money,

924
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,450
so they sent me some.

925
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,760
When I went to the dock,

926
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,820
I found it very crowded.

927
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,090
I thought it was because a merchant ship

928
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,680
had arrived with valuable goods

929
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,480
that those people were so excited

930
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,370
and scrambled to take a look.

931
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,000
I wanted to take a look too.

932
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,510
But there were too many people

933
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,720
at the dock.

934
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,990
Fifteen minutes passed,

935
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,410
but I still hadn't gotten to the front.

936
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,000
Then I came up with a brilliant idea.

937
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,390
I took out my token from the Court of Judicial Review…

938
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,380
The crowd dispersed.

939
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,350
What did you see?

940
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,430
No, no, no. The crowd didn't disperse yet.

941
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,620
I don't care about that.

942
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,540
Get to the point.

943
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,720
Make it short.

944
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,220
Someone died in the Dragon King Temple

945
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,320
near the dock.

946
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,730
It's a strange death.

947
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,310
People from the Ministry of Justice have arrived.

948
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,220
So I hurried back

949
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,150
to report it to you, Vice Minister.

950
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,470

952
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,330
This will be the first time that you've assisted with an investigation

953
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,840
since you came to the Court of Judicial Review.

954
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,900
Be discreet.

955
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,430
Assistant Minister Feng from the Ministry of Justice is there.

956
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,100
Don't bring disgrace on Mingjing Hall.

957
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,750
I won't.

What brought you here?

961
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,430
I heard about the strange death

962
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,580
in the Dragon King Temple.

963
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,480
So I came to check it out.

964
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,350
Tell me if there is anything I can do.

965
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,750
I've long heard that you're good

966
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,520
at solving bizarre cases.

967
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,790
You've lived up to your reputation.

968
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,350
If you hadn't double-checked

969
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,340
the councilor's case,

970
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,910
we wouldn't have been able

971
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,080
to find out the truth.

972
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:17,990
If

973
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,990
we had wronged our own colleague,

974
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,320
the Ministry of Justice

975
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,260
would have failed at our job.

976
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,250
The Ministry of Justice and the Court of Judicial Review are important to each other.

977
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,340
I just did my job.

978
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,770
It's not worth mentioning.

979
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:28,630
Vice Minister.

980
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,300
I can't agree more.

981
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,170
Our two departments

982
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,150
are different sides of the same coin.

983
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,630
We should look out for each other

984
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,020
and help each other.

985
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,340
I'm glad that you're back

986
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,920
and in charge again.

987
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,470
It's a good thing for both the Ministry of Justice

988
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,330
and the Court of Judicial Review.

989
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,900
Vice Minister, look.

990
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,940
Why is the victim

991
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,420
in such a strange posture?

992
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,950
[The Court of Judicial Review]
