You didn't sleep well?

57
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,840
The first half of the night, you tossed and turned.

58
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,660
The second half, your snores were thunderous.

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,920

60
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,630
I was the one who didn't sleep well.

61
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,160
I couldn't control myself.

65
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,030

66
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,860
It's a foreign language.

67
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,680
He's talking in his sleep too.

69
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,600

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,270

We should celebrate for a few more days,

137
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:54,870

138
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,630

139
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,510

Merit determines one's fate.

157
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,350

158

who created the system,

159
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,230
I will never forgive him.

160
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,470
Back then, I was the one

161
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,200
who proposed

162
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,990
this system to the former Minister of Judicial Review.

163
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,309
At first, it was only used in Mingjing Hall,

164
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,840
but it was quite effective,

165
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,150
so it was later implemented throughout the entire Court of Judicial Review.

166
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,159
Vice Minister Li's Mingjing Hall

167
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,510
has two judicial commissioners,

168
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,440
one chief clerk,

169
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,870
and one judge who hasn't become official yet.

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,990

171
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,310
these four subordinates

172
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,430

173
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,590
many cases

174
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,440
in the last year.

175
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,070
However, since Vice Minister Li is in charge,

176
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,730
I don't need to worry anymore.

177
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,540

195
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,110
been able to exert our skills

196
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,710
no matter how skilled we are.

197
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,710
It's our honor to work with you

198
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,560
to solve the Demon Cat Case.

199
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,740
It's our duty.

200
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,600
Besides,

201
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
the Mingjing Hall

202
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,390
is your home,

203
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,430
while we

204
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,030
are subordinates of the Mingjing Hall.

205
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,430
If you have any orders,

206
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,260
we are solely at your command.

207
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,110
Well said.

208
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,030
Sir, you flatter me.

209
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,760
In that case,

210
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,790
you may report first.

211
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,830
I am Wang Qi, the judicial commissioner of the Court of Judicial Review.

212
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,030
In the Mingjing Hall,

213
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,660
I'm a small leader.

214
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,250
I'm also the most experienced

215
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,450
in the Mingjing Hall.

216
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,720
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

217
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,930
During the investigation of the Demon Cat Case,

218
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:08,670
I thought

219
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,330
that you were extraordinary.

220
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,160
I finally got to meet you today.

221
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,830
You are indeed a handsome

222
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,950
and talented man.

223
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,740
Man!

224
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:17,870
Man?

225
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:18,830
Man?

226
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,520
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

227
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,670
You go.

228
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,240
I am Cui Bei,

229
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,020
chief clerk of the Court of Judicial Review.

230
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,440
I am in charge of recording cases

231
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,300
and drawing criminal portraits.

232
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,010
Vice Minister,

233
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,520
I'm a crude person.

234
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,750
I didn't take exams

235
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,310
before entering the Court of Judicial Review,

236
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,240
but don't worry.

237
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,820
I don't come from a prestigious background,

238
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,140
but I'm strong.

239
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,700
Leave physical labor,

240
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,710
field work,

241
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,910
and catching suspects

242
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,040
to me without worry.

243
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,700
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

244
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,910
I...

245
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,740
I...

246
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,870
Don't be nervous.

247
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,080
I just didn't expect

248
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,830
that the Court of Judicial Review would have foreigners.

249
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,960
I have no prejudice.

250
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,430
Vice Minister,

251
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,710
I failed the Mandarin Level 8 Exam

252
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,520
every time.

253
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,150
That's why I don't have

254
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,330
the Court of Judicial Review's official position.

255
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:07,870
I'm just

256
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,070
an unofficial judge,

257
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,890
but I've made up my mind

258
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,850
If I fail, I will try and try again.

259
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,850
I swear I'll pass, or else I'll be ashamed for life.

260
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,330
What are your specialties?

261
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,510
My family did business in Yangzhou,

262
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,230
so since I was a child,

263
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,030
I've been good at dealing with people.

264
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,800
No matter what case it is,

265
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,820
I just need to make a visit

266
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,880
and I can

267
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,190
get a good understanding of the relations.

268
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,050
Vice Minister,

269
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,950
I've admired the Mingjing Hall since childhood,

270
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,790
so I joined the Court of Judicial Review.

271
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,720
Unexpectedly,

272
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,860
Vice Minister Shangguan

273
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,080
doesn’t care about the Mingjing Hall at all.

274
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,510
I have nowhere to use

275
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,950
any of my skills.

276
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,350
Fortunately,

277
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,800
I waited

278
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,490
until you arrived.

279
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,270
Hurry up.

280
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,950
I have a good memory,

281
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,640
but...

282
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,590
But what?

283
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,910
I have bad luck.

284
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,750
Wang Qi and the others are already prepared.

285
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,310
Vice Minister, you must also

286
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,070
be careful.

287
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,070
I...

288
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,070
I...

289
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,220
I don't seem to have

290
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,350
other specialties.

291
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,130
No need to be modest.

292
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,270
The civil war was harrowing

293
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,280
and difficult to survive.

294
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,070
Since you could return peacefully from the battlefield,

295
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,470
you're definitely not an ordinary person.

296
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,840
How did you know?

297
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,190
Since I met you,

298
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,970
you've been standing upright

299
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,790
and never relaxed in your movements.

300
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,050
You're tall,

301
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,000
but you walk very lightly.

302
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,240
You're quite skilled.

303
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,570
This is a scout's style.

304
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,430
When you were nervous just now,

305
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,940
your hand went to your hip.

306
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,990
These are subconscious habits,

307
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,250
so I guessed

308
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,400
that you were a soldier.

309
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,950
You entered the Court of Judicial Review without an assessment

310
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,390
because

311
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,310
only experienced soldiers

312
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,710
receive this treatment.

313
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,150
Our dynasty has been stable for a long time.

314
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,150
With your age,

315
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,750
the only war you could have participated in

316
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,610
was the civil war three years ago.

317
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,650
I...

318
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,270
I can speak many languages.

319
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,070
Besides Mandarin,

320
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,230
I can speak and write many languages

321
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,690
from the Western Regions.

322
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,360
Do you recognize the writing on this chip?

323
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,010
Yes.

324
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,140
Isn't this a chip from

325
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,630
a foreign gambling house?

326
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,230
I often...

327
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,710
I never go to places like that.

328
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,510
Vice Minister,

329
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:07,970
this...

330
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,960
This is not mine.

331
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,150
It's not mine.

332
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,070
Can you recognize which one it's from?

333
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,870
Gambling houses

334
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,830
write blessings for customers on the back of chips.

335
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,380
Each gambling house is different.

336
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,590
This says,

337
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,390
"Only wealth is dear."

338
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,990
I've never seen it before.

339
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,720
But I can...

340
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,960
Vice Minister,

341
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,370
are you testing me?

342
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,590
I really never go to

343
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,310
such places,

344
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,170
Vice Minister.

345
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:41,990
Wang Qi,

346
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,020
you are the administrator of the Mingjing Hall.

347
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,190
Yes, humbly.

348
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,260
Let me ask you.

349
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,240
Other than the Demon Cat Case,

350
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,270
how long has the Mingjing Hall gone

351
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,600
without solving a case?

352
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,900
There's that trafficking case too.

353
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,070
It's the one

354
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,400
that Chen Shi captured.

355
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,750
Vice Minister, here's the thing.

356
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,750
We indeed

357
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,700
haven't solved many cases before,

358
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,200
but it's not entirely our fault.

359
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,030
The main things is that

360
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,950
decent cases

361
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,670
aren't given

362
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,190
to us.

363
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,140
Even if we want to solve a case,

364
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,670
we don't have the chance to.

365
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,950
The Court of Judicial Review has

366
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,750
so many cases.

367
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,080
How can you

368
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,720
have no chance if you put in the effort?

369
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,380
Lord,

370
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,990
the Mingjing Hall's cases

371
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,990
are like this now.

372
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,310
They're divided into four classes

373
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,830
according to their severity and urgency.

374
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,960
The Vice Minister assigns them.

375
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,950
Us four

376
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,170
have low statuses

377
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,030
before Vice Minister Shangguan.

378
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,750
The cases that we get

379
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,030
are just unimportant class D cases.

380
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,390
What did you just say?

381
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,150
Unimportant?

382
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,190
Vice Minister,

383
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,650
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

384
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm Hu Si. I'm asking for audience.

00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,410
Come in.

386
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,670
What is it?

387
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,609
Greetings, Vice Minister.

388
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,069
Here's the thing.

389
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,430
My vice minister

390
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,680
asked me to tell you

391
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,430
some things.

392
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,260
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

393
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,270
My vice minister said...

394
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,869
Stop.

395
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,109
We are both vice ministers of the Court of Judicial Review.

396
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,569
We're not yours or theirs.

397
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,339
Yes.

398
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,910
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

399
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,569
Just refer to us by name.

400
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,420
Here's the thing.

401
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,170
The Vice Minister

402
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,030
wanted me to tell you all some things.

403
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,500
Your salary this month

404
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,400
will still be deducted.

405
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,599
Still?

406
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,190
We just solved the Demon Cat Case.

407
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,790
Why are you deducting again?

408
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,090
Well...

409
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,510
What is it?

410
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,050
Vice Minister Li,

411
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,590
the Court of Judicial Review

412
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,550
calculates the salary

413
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,800
based on how many cases are solved

414
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,630
and

415
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,250
the people of the Mingjing Hall

416
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,120
have always been lacking in cases.

417
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,590
But

418
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,790
we solved the Demon Cat Case.

419
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,740
It's such a big case.

420
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,780
Yes, that's right.

421
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,210
The Demon Cat Case

422
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,830
was the Mingjing Hall's first achievement.

423
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,450
It's also a class A case.

424
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,690
However,

425
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,710
one class A case

426
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,410
is only worth 10 class D cases.

427
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,790
You owed too many

428
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,590
cases before.

429
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,190
I worried you couldn't calculate it clearly,

430
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,880
so I asked someone

431
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,950
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

432
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,110
to bring all the cases you've accumulated

433
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,840
from before.

434
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,060
Vice Minister Li, please take a look.

435
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:06,990
Hu Si,

436
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,540
the new vice minister

437
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,540
just took office.

438
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,030
Are you doing it on purpose?

439
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,580
No, no, no.

440
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,620
I don't mean anything else.

441
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,300
I was just ordered to inform you all.

442
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,560
Since the rules are so,

443
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,550
let's follow the rules.

444
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,710
Deduct the salaries as you must.

445
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,640
Thank you for your understanding.

446
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,380
By the way, Vice Minister Li,

447
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,020
there's one more thing.

448
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,080
Say it all in one go.

449

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,470

452
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,850
What's wrong with him?

453
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,400

00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,490

at the xiezhi statue in the courtyard

457
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,790
and you'll see

458
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,790
what happened.

459
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,170

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,820

462
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,950
as you can see,

463
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,720
the rules—

464
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,980
What do you want to say?

465
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,770
The Court of Judicial Review rewards based on merit

466
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,970
and the cases solved.

467
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,630
Naturally, the bigger the case,

468
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,230
the faster you're promoted

469
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,830
and the higher your salary is.

470
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,310
You're right.

471
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,950
That's why you only focus on big cases

472
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,480
and ignore the small cases.

473
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,590
You can't solve big cases

474
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,190
and look down on small cases.

475
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,430
Since

476
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,560

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,980

480
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,270
the Court of Judicial Review won't keep you around.

481
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,680

that he did all the servants' work.

to count as one big case.

If you had the time for that,

568
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,390
you could solve some big cases

569
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,550
and everything would be settled.

570
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,870
The previous trafficking case

571
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,630
was intercepted by the Jinwu Guard.

572
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,110
Otherwise, if we had that and the Demon Cat Case,

573
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,740
we might

574
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,830
not get promoted,

575
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,330
but it'll be more than enough

576
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,710
for us not to be dismissed.

577
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,590
Previously, you said

578
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,720
there were no cases to solve be solved.

579
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,420
It turns out you're the one who suppressed them.

580
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,360
I put in all this effort

581
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,870
for you to focus your attention

582
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,210
on solving some big cases

583
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,540
without distractions.

584
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,230
If you hadn't hidden these,

585
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,350
we wouldn't be here today.

586
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:36,730
Hey,

587
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,870
what do you mean?

588
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,550
I did all of this

589
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,550
for your sakes.

590
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,250
Isn't it good

591
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,500
to solve some big cases sooner

592
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,420
and get promoted

593
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,030
sooner?

594
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,830
This is called grabbing the big and sacrificing the small.

595
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,230
But you shouldn't have hidden it from us.

596
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,150
Alibaba,

597
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,350
don't get involved.

598
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:50,910
Your salary

599
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,360
doesn't come from the Court of Judicial Review.

600
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,490
But I got captured by

601
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,150
the new vice minister, just like you all.

602
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,480
Alright.

603
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,990
I'm the administrator of Mingjing Hall now.

604
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,550
I have the right to deal with the case.

605
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,700
If you are afraid

606
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,720
of being implicated,

607
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,580
go report it to the vice minister.

608
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,840
What's wrong, girl?

609
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,290
The Court of Judicial Review?

610
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,440
Court of Judicial Review

611
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,380
Yes.

612
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,690
I am from the Court of Judicial Review.

613
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,400
What?

614
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,050
You want a rattle drum, right?

615
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,550
Wait,

616
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,770
I'll ask around.

617
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,000
Soup cakes.

618
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,750
Sir,

619
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,670
do you know

620
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,990
if rattle drums are sold nearby?

621
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,520
Officer,

622
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,020
are you kidding me?

623
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,670
How could rattle drums

624
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,950
be sold near the Court of Judicial Review?

625
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,430
Where can I find a drum

626
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,520
near the Court of Judicial Review?

627
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,450
The Court of Judicial Review.

628
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,510
Here we are.

629
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,110
Court of Judicial Review

630
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:04,950
Wait for me!

631
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,040
You can't beat it.

632
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,150
You can't beat this.

633
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,630
This is no joke.

634
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,710
Are you really going?

635
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,310
Listen.

636
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,070
Drums.

637
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:16,900
The Dengwen Drum.

638
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,270
There's a ghost in broad daylight?

639
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,040
Hurry up.

640
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,910
Alright.

641
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,980
Why did you give it to me?

642
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,620
This...

643
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,230
Look.

644
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,610
I knew ghosts don't exist.

645
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,810
You scared yourself.

646
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,660
Why is it her again?

647
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,830
Mr. Li.

648
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:46,600
Mr. Li,

649
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,890
she's making a report.

650
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,620
[Councilor's sister]

651
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,890
[Injustice]

652
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,650
Vice Minister Shangguan,

653
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,990
do you know her?

654
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,910
Yes.

655
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,740
She is the sister of a councilor

656
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,400
from the Ministry of Justice.

657
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,430
Has she come to the Court of Judicial Review to seek justice before?

658
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,190
Yes,

659
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,680
but the injustice she reported

660
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,510
didn't exist.

661
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,030
How so?

662
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,660
Three months ago,

663
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,590
her brother

664
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,870
hung himself

665
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,500
in the Ministry of Justice's office.

666
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,100
The case has been concluded.

667
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,670
Are you sure the case's facts are true?

668
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,940
The Ministry of Justice has investigated clearly.

669
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,140
Then, why does she come to seek justice?

670
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,010
Injustice.

671
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,250
Injustice!

672
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,330
[Fairness; Justice; Integrity; Authority]

673
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,540
What grievance do you have?

674
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,400
Say it bravely.

675
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:37,690
Injustice.

676
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:38,930
Injustice!

677
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,970
Injustice!

678
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,110
Stand up.

679
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,030
Chen Shi.

680
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,350
Mr. Li.

681
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,390
Come with me.

682
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,710
[Fairness; Justice; Integrity; Authority]

683
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,300
This way.

684
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,200
This child is indeed pitiful.

685
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,810
She was born like this.

686
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,470
She's clearly handicapped.

687
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,470
Most likely, she couldn't accept

688
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,750
the death of a loved one,

689
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,230
so she constantly comes to the Court of Judicial Review to seek justice.

690
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,160
Unfortunately,

691
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,230
there's no way

692
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,030
to discuss her grievances.

693
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,110
But all grievances must be handled.

694
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,150
This is the rule of the Court of Judicial Review.

695
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,140
You're right.

696
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,630
However,

697
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,540
the Ministry of Justice has already investigated it.

698
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,140
There is nothing to correct.

699
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,950
Also, the victim

700
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,310
was a member of the Ministry of Justice.

701
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,060
The Ministry of Justice

702
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,110
naturally investigated

703
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,170
clearly and fully.

704
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,870
Could it be

705
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,110
that you don't trust

706
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,510
the Ministry of Justice?

707
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,020
Has this case been reviewed?

708
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,470
Of course.

709
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,160
Logically speaking,

710
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,380
it was reviewed by

711
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,490
the Mingjing Hall.

712
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,240
But it's a fact that she

713
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,420
came to seek justice.

714
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,220
You can investigate it anytime.

715
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,030
However,

716
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,790
if the review had errors—

717
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,760
I know what to do.

718
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,380
One more question.

719
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,710
Is this case

720
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,560
a so-called class D case?

721
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,580
Of course.

722
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,070
The victim committed suicide

723
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,510
and there aren't many suspicious points.

724
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,910
Naturally, it's class D.

725
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,450
We'll discuss this later.

726
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,110
Vice Minister Li, thank you.

727
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:14,880

00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,260

00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,510
come here.

[Injustice]

732
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,830
Vice Minister Shangguan said

733
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,390
this case

734
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,120
was reviewed by Mingjing Hall.

735
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,670
What are the details?

736
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,590
Well...

737
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,390
I've read

738
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,430
this case.

739
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,500
Tell me the details.

740
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,470
About the details...

741
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,580
Vice Minister Shangguan

742
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,510
has already said

743
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,710
that this case

744
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,040
doesn't count as a case.

745
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:50,830
Besides,

746
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,320
the Ministry of Justice has investigated everything.

747
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,310
The case is simple.

748
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,840
He died by hanging himself.

749
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,170
We just had to

750
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,050
go through the motions.

751
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,380
Go through the motions?

752
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,390
You didn't read the dossier?

753
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,870
Since when

754
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,910
is the Court of Judicial Review's

755
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,670
case review only a formality?

756
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,230
This case

757
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,340
was the Mingjing Hall's responsibility.

758
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,710
Now, the victim came and beat the drum to seek justice,

759
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,440
but the Mingjing Hall can't provide any answers.

760
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,070
You four,

761
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,750
go review this case again

762
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,490
from the beginning to the end.

763
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,480
Report the result to me at any time.

764
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,530
If there are any other errors,

765
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,360
your fates will be determined

766
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,770
by this case.

767
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,840
Understand?

768
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,830
-Yes.
-Yes.

769
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,470
Yes.

770
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,330
[Mingjing Hall]

771
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,270
Mr. Li,

772
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,030
are you okay?

773
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,680
What's wrong?

774
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,070
What should we do with that girl?

775
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,330
Inform Jici Hall.

776
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,440
Someone will pick her up later.

777
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,670
Got it.

778
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,820
Can I accompany her before that?

779
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,190
Go ahead.

780
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,350
I'm leaving.

781
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:36,910
Girl.

782
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,600
Girl, what's your name?

783
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,030
How about

784
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,010
I take you to find something to eat?

785
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,230
Big meat buns.

786
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,230
Let's go.

787
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,640
Here.

788
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:00,880
Uncle Cai.

789
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,700
Uncle Cai.

790
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,990
Shi.

791
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,710
Uncle Cai,

792
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,910
do you have more buns?

793
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,470
No.

794
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,090
There's a lot of radish soup left.

795
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,860
Do you want some?

796
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,350
Yes.

797
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,590
Can you get me a bowl?

798
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,110
Hold on.

799
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:10,610
This girl

800
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,820
hasn't eat all morning.

801
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,720
Have a seat over there.

802
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,380
Over there.

803
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,840
Little girl,

804
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,750
come.

805
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,840
Sit here.

806
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:19,830
Here.

807
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,790
Here you go.

808
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,070
Take your time.

809
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,830
There's more.

810
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,530
Drink up.

811
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,680
What's going on?

812
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,010
She's seeking justice.

813
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,720
The councilor's sister?

814
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,660
You've seen her before?

815
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,410
She came to seek justice last month,

816
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,510
but her brother really did die by suicide.

817
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,570
What injustice is there to report on?

818
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,330
Poor thing.

819
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,890
There's more.

820
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:53,990
Okay.

821
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,140
Thank you, Uncle Cai.

822
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,000
Take your time.

823
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,580
If it's not enough, I'll give you—

824
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:02,950
What's wrong?

825
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,750
You're here?

826
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,070
It was so hard to find you.

827
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,950
You sneaked away again.

828
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,900
Get back here.

829
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,030
You're hiding?

830
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,220
Don't make me hit you.

831
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,190
Officer, what's wrong?

832
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,050
How can you hit her?

833
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,850
That's not allowed.

834
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,630
Officer,

835
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,180
you don't know.

836
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,050
This girl

837
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,470
keeps running away

838
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,330
and causing us trouble.

839
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,460
She's infuriating.

840
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,400
Besides,

841
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,550
if she escapes,

842
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,110
it won't be good for you either.

843
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,860
What do you mean?

844
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,070
You still can't do it.

845
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,910
You can't hit her.

846
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,440
Besides,

847
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,330
look.

848
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,510
She's so afraid of you.

849
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,370
You must treat her badly usually.

850
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,630
You can't take her away.

851
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,250
This...

852
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,550
Vice Minister Li

853
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,480
accepted this case,

854
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,390
but Jici Hall's men

855
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:35,980
are all here.

856
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,950
It's inappropriate

857
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,030
to keep her here.

858
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,380
How is it inappropriate?

859
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,310
Mr. Li.

860
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,170
The councilor's sister is the plaintiff.

861
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,830
It's more appropriate for her to stay in the Court of Judicial Review.

862
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,590
You all may leave now.

863
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,990
Yes.

864
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,840
Let's go.

865
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,590
It's okay.

866
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:51,990
Come.

867
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,640
Come out.

868
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:53,950
Mr. Li.

869
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,750
I knew

870
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,530
you would want her to stay.

871
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,830
I'm sorry.

872
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,430
I caused you trouble again.

873
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:01,880
No,

874
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,000
you did the right thing.

875
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,300
What do you mean?

876
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,900
That xie...

877
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,780
Xiezhi.

878
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,030
That's right, the xiezhi.

879
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,530
It looked pretty valuable.

880
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,940
I heard them talk about it.

881
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,760
It indeed is quite valuable,

882
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,250
but it doesn't matter.

883
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,470
It's old anyway.

884
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,350
It's good to wash and wipe it.

885
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,150
That won't do.

886
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,160
I have to pay.

887
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:26,750
No need.

888
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,470
I must.

889
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,470
There's really no need.

890
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,790
Mr. Li, you don't know.

891
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,350
When I saw them today,

892
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,830
they were all very polite

893
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,230
and called me "officer."

894
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,150
They thought everything I did and said

895
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,210
were your actions,

896
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,070
but I know

897
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,550
you are you and I am me.

898
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,510
To be honest,

899
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,960
you can't afford

900
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,110
the payment.

901
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,340
Why don't I give you an idea?

902
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,910
You can also

903
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,130
wipe the other one.

904
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,540
Maybe this will improve the situation.

905
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,510
Really?

906
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,700
It probably

907
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,630
will.

908
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,390
Great.

909
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,070
Have you figured out how to deal with her?

910
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,190
Right.

911
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,630
Where will she sleep?

912
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:07,590
Follow me.

913
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,880
Come on.

914
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,480
Let's go.

915
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,760
Grabbing the big and releasing the small

916
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,429
won't release a horrible an eternal justice

917
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,960
like in the stories, right?

918
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,429
The situation is already like this.

919
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,159
We can only think of a solution.

920
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,870
I

921
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,920
truly care for you all.

922
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,830
Let's not talk about other things.

923
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,880
Let's just focus on

924
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,750
the trafficking Duo Robbery Case

925
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,409
and that Demon Cat Case.

926
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,510
I helped

927
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,679
take responsibility for all of those.

928
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,949
Even if you don't thank me,

929
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:37,909
you shouldn't

930
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,239
expose my shortcomings like this, right?

931
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,190
Go to the Ministry of Justice tomorrow

932
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,620
and review the dossier of the councilor's case.

933
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,080
I’ll go with you tomorrow.

934
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,100
Chen Shi, you...

935
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,710
Sit.

936
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,030
Can you free up a dorm room?

937
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,910
I want to put the plaintiff there.

938
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,070
Yes, yes.

939
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:05,750
Right away.

940
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,470
But...

941
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:07,720
However,

942
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,440
the roof of that room

943
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,660
leaked a few days ago.

944
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,730
We've been outside

945
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,640
and haven't had time to fix it yet.

946
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,290
Well...

947
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,180
I can

948
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,920
handle the roof.

949
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,590
You?

950
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,350
Okay.

951
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,980
You all focus on investigating.

952
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,580
Don't create more troubles.

953
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,320
-Yes.
-Yes.

954
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:28,910
Here.

955
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,480
This way.

956
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,150
Sir, wait for me.

957
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,470
What's wrong?

958
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,070
Did you find any clues about the case?

959
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,940
Not this case.

960
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,580
Two days ago,

961
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,200
you asked me about the gambling house's chip.

962
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,070
I know you're not that kind of person.

963
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,430
You don't have to explain anymore.

964
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,680
No, I am...

965
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,720
You are?

966
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,020
No.

967
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,290
I mean,

968
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,670
I asked around later

969
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,400
and found this gambling house.

970
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,350
It turns out to be

971
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,480
an arena where you bet who wins a fight.

972
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,880
This is the address of the gambling house.

973
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,150
I hope I can

974
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,050
make some contributions for you.

975
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,920
Thank you.

976
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,800
You're welcome.

977
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,830
No problem at all.

978
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,380
There are so many foreign gambling houses.

979
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,230
It takes a lot of time

980
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,090
to investigate them all.

981
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:16,990
You haven't requested for leave

982
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,860
from the Court of Judicial Review either.

983
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,990
You've worked hard.

984
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,260
Thank you.

985
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,290
These are...

986
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,280
These are all natural victories.

987
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,670
Thank you.

988
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,790
I'm awesome.

989
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,580
Who are you?

990
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,190
None for you.

991
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,430
What's wrong?

992
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,970
Why are you staring at me?

993
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,290
Everything is normal.

994
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,830
Yes, everything is normal.

995
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,870
But when you

996
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,990
travel with me,

997
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,190
shouldn't something bad

998
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,310
happen to you?

999
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,390
Cui Bei,

1000
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,270
can't you hope for nice things for me?

1001
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,110
I mean...

1002
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,830
I know what you want to say.

1003
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,880
Let me tell you.

1004
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,950
When I was born,

1005
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,620
my father read my fortune.

1006
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,420
I'm destined to be an official.

1007
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,520
My fate is good.

1008
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,540
I was born

1009
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,070
to be an official.

1010
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,390
Your bad luck

1011
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,730
can't hurt me.

1012
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,810
Let me tell you something.

1013
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,800
Do you know why

1014
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,390
I just went through

1015
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,880
the motions for this case?

1016
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,830
Why?

1017
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,590
Look at you.

1018
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,740
You have a good memory,

1019
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,790
but if you don't think about

1020
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,990
the interpersonal relations here,

1021
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,150
you'll be done for.

1022
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,460
Vice Minister Shangguan

1023
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,080
tossed this case to the Mingjing Hall.

1024
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,350
Why did she do that?

1025
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,390
Because this was the Ministry of Justice's case.

1026
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,870
The Ministry of Justice and the Court of Judicial Review

1027
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,140
are at the same level

1028
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,410
and they specialize in solving cases.

1029
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,150
Who should review cases

1030
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,590
that they investigated?

1031
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,550
If we found a mistake,

1032
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,110
we'd offend them.

1033
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,270
So,

1034
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,690
I just went through the formalities.

1035
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,050
What do you mean?

1036
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,140
I told you you're a nerd.

1037
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,110
I'm just worried about how wooden you are.

1038
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,190
What I mean is

1039
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,860
when we get to the Ministry of Justice,

1040
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,670
we must keep a low profile.

1041
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,290
Otherwise, not only will we offend them,

1042
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,360
but the new vice minister

1043
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,600
will also offend them.

1044
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,400
Understand?

1045
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,110
Hey,

1046
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,750
do you understand or not?

1047
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,550
Answer me.

1048
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:55,870
Here.

1049
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,230
Be careful, it's hot.

1050
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,030
It's hot.

1051
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,630
Mr. Li.

1052
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,570
It's all tidied up?

1053
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,140
I took a board

1054
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,220
to cover the roof.

1055
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,780
It should be enough.

1056
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,910
The craftsmen will repair it later.

1057
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,440
Okay.

1058
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,360
Mr. Li, here.

1059
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,620
Don't do chores today.

1060
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,750
I have a task for you.

1061
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,990
Take good care of her.

1062
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,210
Don't worry about anything else.

1063
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:21,910
Got it.

1064
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,340
I have to go out for work later.

1065
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,510
Be careful on your own.

1066
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,640
Where are you going?

1067
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,320
I'm going to investigate my own case.

1068
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,470
How?

1069
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,430
This chip

1070
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,280
is from a foreign gambling house.

1071
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,190
Every gambling house

1072
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,390
has different chips.

1073
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,290
I'll just follow the clue.

1074
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,870
Mr. Li, be careful.

1075
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,600
Don't worry.

1076
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,640
I'm leaving.

1077
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,470
Don't you want to eat more?

1078
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:49,990
No.

1079
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,480
This doesn't taste good.

1080
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,300
[Court of Judicial Review]
