00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,150
I, Gu,

199
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,190
will try to save Vice Minister Li and the others

200
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,950
even if it means risking my very life.

201
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,620
But Dad,

202
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,390
there are so many bad guys.

203
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,660
How can we save them?

204
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,110
We…

205
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,790
No matter what,

206
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,330
I have to do something.

207
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,520
Gu,

208
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,060
do you have paper and a brush?

209
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,510
Yes.

210
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,720
[Your humble servant, Qiu Qingzhi, respectfully presents this to Your Majesty.]

211
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:40,500
[West Market]

212
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,630
Xiaohuan, take it.

213
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,110
Don't drop it.

214
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,590
Sirs, madams,

215
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,330
please stop for a second.

216
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,860
Take a look.

217
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,780
Guys.

218
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,990
Guys.

219
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,550
Please come over.

220
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,910
Guys.

221
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,390
My name is Chen Shi.

222
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,980
I'm from the Court of Judicial Review.

223
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,580
I have something to tell you.

224
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,950
You know what?

225
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,910
The real villain is Yong'an Pavilion.

226
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,680
They've done a lot of bad things.

227
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,980
My daughter, Xiaohuan,

228
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,190
was nearly fed on

229
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,630
by those at Yong'an Pavilion.

230
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,360
It was the Court of Judicial Review that saved us.

231
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,530
They plotted treason

232
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,790
and laid all the blame

233
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,170
on the Court of Judicial Review

234
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,040
and Vice Minister Li Bing.

235
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,990
Your humble servant, Qiu Qingzhi, respectfully presents this to Your Majesty.

236
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,910
The Demon Cat Case

237
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,370
was more complicated than it appeared.

238
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,250
It involved

239
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,610
more than just one case.

240
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,710
It all started three years ago

241
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,510
with a foreigner called Du Zixu.

242
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,350
Du presented an elixir of life

243
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,280
to the elders of Yong'an Pavilion.

244
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,310
The elders took that elixir with human blood to extend life.

245
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,660
To get human blood,

246
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,710
they went on

247
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,110
a macabre killing spree.

248
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,860
The insatiable elders,

249
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,030
not content

250
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,000
with the blood already spilled,

251
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,910
secretly imprisoned Du Zixu

252
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,230
to extract from him the active ingredient of the elixir:

253
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,760
the bone of the Zixu State's Fengsheng Beast.

254
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,460
Driven crazy by their quest for that ingredient,

255
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,270
the depraved elders of Yong'an Pavilion

256
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,510
faked border disputes

257
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,990
and unjustly started wars.

258
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,230
Under the guise of resolving conflicts,

259
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,990
they sent our soldiers to war

260
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,050
for their own clandestine searches.

261
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,830
Those elders

262
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,990
disrupted the order of nature

263
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,630
and fooled so many people

264
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,910
for selfish ends,

265
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,510
causing national calamity and suffering

266
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,590
that persists to this day.

267
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,870
Their crime is unbelievable

268
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,560
and unforgivable.

269
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,680
The elders,

270
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,170
along with their minions,

271
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,590
obscured the truth

272
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,510
and deceived Your Majesty

273
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,230
without arousing any suspicion.

274
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,710
Fortunately, Vice Minister Li Bing at the Court of Judicial Review,

275
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,950
since the Demon Cat Case,

276
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,290
has been sifting through the minutiae and,

277
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,910
with great personal sacrifice,

278
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,620
uncovered the entire truth.

279
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,400
Yet, before he could report,

280
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,350
he fell victim to a plot by Yong'an Pavilion's miscreants.

281
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,350
Out of necessity,

282
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,430
I wrote this report to relay his findings,

283
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,350
hoping Your Majesty will be enlightened

284
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,610
and no longer misled by those deceivers.

285
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,510
Vice Minister Li is a good man.

286
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,240
Come with me.

287
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,550
Vice Minister Li has been falsely accused.

288
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,140
Come with me.

289
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,560
Move!

290
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,910
Chen Shi, go!

291
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,210
Lai Zhongshu.

292
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,830
Thanks to you,

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,220
we can see the light of day again

294
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,110
and enjoy eternal peace.

295
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,960
You flatter me.

296
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,800
Don't be so modest.

297
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,700
Now that you're one of us,

298
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,910
stand tall when we talk.

299
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,750
Yes.

300
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,240
Lai Zhongshu.

301
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,550
Your parentage...

302
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,570
I…

303
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,150
Sorry.

304
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,230
I was…

305
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,860
My humble parentage…

306
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,820
Pavilion Elder.

307
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,550
It's not worth mentioning.

308
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,240
I heard

309
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,600
you were born in prison.

310
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,750
You don't even know

311
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,030
who your parents are.

312
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,510
When you were the vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review,

313
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,990
you promoted your foster father

314
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,700
to Director of Foods.

315
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,150
Yes.

316
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,390
With such parentage,

317
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,920
striving to move up the ladder

318
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,140
must have been hard for you.

319
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,110
You're capable,

320
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,170
discreet,

321
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,920
and brave.

322
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,210
Now that you're part of Yong'an Pavilion,

323
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,970
we'll share weal and woe.

324
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,569
I have another favor to ask of you.

325
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,190
What is it?

326
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,839
We need to use your blood

327
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,700
to awaken Yi Zhi Hua.

328
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,770
Lai Zhongshu.

329
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,080
Don't worry. Your portrait

330
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,990
will be hung in Yong'an Pavilion,

331
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,250
bringing honor to your family.

332
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,870
It's you guys.

333
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,500
You're doing this again.

334
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,970
The same old trick.

335
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,840
Yi Zhi Hua.

336
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,230
You're the auspicious sign given by God.

337
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,140
We need to follow God's will

338
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,720
and thank God for his blessings.

339
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,030
Auspicious sign?

340
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,090
Do you think I'll buy that?

341
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,950
I know.

342
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,950
You want to live longer, right?

343
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,520
I get it.

344
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,280
That's why you took me captive.

345
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,310
But why should I

346
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,460
cooperate with you?

347
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,310
You've got the dagger.

348
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,160
Where's Li Bing?

349
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,770
Is he dead?

350
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,020
Li Bing!

351
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,440
Yi Zhi Hua.

352
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,260
The only thing that can control you

353
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,430
is in our hands.

354
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,440
So just give in.

355
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,920
Give in?

356
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,170
This dagger can kill me.

357
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,380
I'm so scared.

358
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,200
You can kill me,

359
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,730
but will you kill me?

360
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,460
If I'm dead,

361
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,200
you'll have to die from old age.

362
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,030
Many people once

363
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,620
got hold of this dagger.

364
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,580
But you know what?

365
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,950
None of them could bring themselves to kill me.

366
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,550
So why should I be afraid?

367
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,270
You idiot!

368
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,270
If that's the case,

369
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,640
why have you

370
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,170
gone to so much trouble

371
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,350
to find this dagger?

372
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,230
Why?

373
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,260
Where's the stone?

374
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,350
Stone?

375
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,920
Where is the stone on this dagger?

376
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,320
Where is the Fengsheng Stone on this dagger?

377
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,630
There he is.

378
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,160

379
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,700
Li Bing, you…

380
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,550
Why are you…

381
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,890
Why am I here?

382
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,910
Because of the drum.

383
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,990
The drum?

384
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,210
Here we are. Here we are.

385
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:47,920
Here we are.

Tell me!

394

Where are my friends?

Despite all your schemes,

you've forgotten that

and sacrificing themselves for what is right.

Now, everyone in Shendu

439
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,710
is waiting to see you guys be brought to justice.

440
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,990
You fed people with lies

441
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,250
and twisted the truth,

442
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,030
only to poison yourselves

443
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,560
for a few more years of life.

444
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,090
The irony is that you only know

445
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,410
part of the truth.

446
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,480
The bone of the Fengsheng Beast is poisonous.

447
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,210
Those who take it can live longer,

448
00:22:59,210 --> 00:22:59,830
but in the end,

449
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,230
they'll lose all humanity

450
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,740
and become bloodthirsty monsters.

451
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,040
Look at yourselves.

452
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,910
Think about the sins you committed.

453
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,710
Do you still deserve to be called humans?

454
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,910
Actually,

455
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,710
everything that happened to you

456
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,570
was caused by the poisonous bone of the Fengsheng Beast.

457
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,630
Since it's poison,

458
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,070
there is an antidote.

459
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,430
The Fengsheng Stone on that dagger

460
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,360
is the antidote.

461
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,550
The stone and the beast coexist.

462
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,130
Naturally, they counteract each other.

463
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,200
Qiu Qingzhi went to the Secret Chamber before you

464
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,830
in order to find this stone.

465
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,510
The dagger was used

466
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,970
to hunt Fengsheng Beasts.

467
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,840
They were toxic,

468
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,150
so the hunters must have taken precautions.

469
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,950
The dagger was used to kill them,

470
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,640
while the stone was used for detoxification.

471
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,150
Antidote.

472
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,690
Go.

473
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,210
What Qiu Qingzhi had been looking for

474
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,090
was that stone.

475
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,230
Because it's the antidote

476
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,030
that can make me a normal person.

477
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,100
Did you eat it?

478
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,670
You've been looking for

479
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,900
this stone as well, right?

480
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,360
You want to become a human.

481
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,780
Why would I want that?

482
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,270
I'm a god.

483
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,450
Why would I want to be a human?

484
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,360
You're lying.

485
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,110
This dagger

486
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,960
was in your hands for a long time.

487
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
If you didn't want to become a human,

488
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,150
you would've destroyed it.

489
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,230
At that time…

490
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,890
At that time,

491
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,040
I just didn't know it.

492
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,410
Let me ask you, Li Bing.

493
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,760
Why didn't you eat it?

494
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,070
You know

495
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,280
this stone is one-of-a-kind.

496
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,230
It's the only way

497
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,650
to make you a human.

498
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,220
I can give it to you.

499
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,550
To me?

500
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,540
To me.

501
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,600
Why does he want to give it to me?

502
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,570
Why?

503
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,160
I got it.

504
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,650
He wants to use this stone

505
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,490
to turn me into a human

506
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,030
and then kill me

507
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,510
so that he can become a god himself!

508
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,190
Am I right?

509
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,670
I'm different from you.

510
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,040
I want to use

511
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,850
the only chance of making you a human

512
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,530
to make a deal with you.

513
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,710
As long as you can testify against

514
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,710
Yong'an Pavilion during the trial,

515
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,570
the stone is yours.

516
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,640
Why would I do that? I'm a god.

517
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,780
I'm a god!

518
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,230
You should've testified against them

519
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,470
three years ago.

520
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,510
When Qiu Qingzhi found you back then,

521
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,820
you said,

522
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,550
"The game has begun."

523
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,330
Have you ever wondered

524
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,390
if you had gone back

525
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,150
to Shendu with Qiu Qingzhi

526
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,100
and agreed to testify,

527
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,030
what would everything be like now?

528
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,270
What would everything be like now?

529
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,390
It'd be the same for me.

530
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,350
I'd still be treated as a monster.

531
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,680
People would still want to drink my blood.

532
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,310
Qiu Qingzhi and I

533
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,870
would do everything we could to find this stone

534
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,590
to turn you back into a human.

535
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,660
What?

536
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,740
Have you never wondered

537
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,600
why Qiu Qingzhi

538
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,860
didn't fear you at all?

539
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,680
Well,

540
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,600
my name is Yi Zhi Hua.

541
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,730
See you again.

542
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Qiu Qingzhi.

543
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,930
Because in his eyes,

544
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,990
you were neither a god

545
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,150
nor a monster.

546
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,540
You were just a pitiful man

547
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,430
who needed help.

548
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,200
I know him.

549
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,840
That must have been what he thought of you.

550
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,340
Li Bing.

551
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,480
If you give me the stone,

552
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,820
aren't you afraid

553
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,980
of being a monster for your whole life?

554
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:45,620
I,

555
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,010
Qiu Qingzhi,

556
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,540
and the others at the Court of Judicial Review

557
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,670
have always prioritized justice

558
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,190
before our lives.

559
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,230
Does it matter if I'm a human or a cat?

560
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,630
In my friend's eyes,

561
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,810
I'll always be Li Bing.

562
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,990
I'll always be

563
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,180
the vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review.

564
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,000
Yes, Vice Minister.

565
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,110
Vice Minister! Vice Minister!

566
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,720
We trust you, Vice Minister.

567
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,670
Vice Minister! Vice Minister!

568
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,960
Yi Zhi Hua.

569
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,630
I'm not threatening you

570
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,490
with anything.

571
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,500
I'm giving you a chance

572
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,100
to choose to be a human again.

573
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,700
What's your choice?

574
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,330
Li Bing.

575
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,720
In this world,

576
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,130
people treated me as a god,

577
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,080
as a ghost…

578
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,910
Monster! Monster! Monster!

579
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,740
Get away!

580
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,350
Or even

581
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,080
as a monster.

582
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,150
But you treat me as a human.

583
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,550
I lost.

584
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,520
I lost!

585
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,650
I lost!

586
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,540
I lost!

587
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,600
I lost!

588
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,340
I lost.

589
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,480
We were never meant

590
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,920
to be on opposing sides.

591
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,250
Criminal Yi Zhi Hua

592
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,710
has now been brought to justice.

593
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,980
Great!

594
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,960
Great!

595
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,300
You guys!

596
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:48,940
Great! Great!

597
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,170
You should've been brought to justice a long time ago.

598
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,250
-We're from the Court of Judicial Review.
-Stop resisting.

599
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,850
Vice Minister, I've written everything down.

600
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,790
Mr. Li.

601
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,350
This case is finally solved.

602
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,620
Thank you for everything you did.

603
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,800
Don't say that.

604
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,340
We just did

605
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,590
what we could do.

606
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,870
Am I right, guys?

607
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,670
Yes! Yes!

608
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,470
Thank you, everyone!

609
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,150
Yes!

610
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,900
Yes!

611
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,720
As for me,

612
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,190
I work at the Court of Judicial Review.

613
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,450
You're all my friends.

614
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,300
I'm glad to help.

615
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,570
You've grown up.

616
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,220
Gum.

617
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,800
I have none left.

618
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,860
Give me another one.

619
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,500
Is this what it's like to have friends?

620
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,630
Yong'an Pavilion's miscreants

621
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,960
have all been arrested.

622
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,030
The bone of the Fengsheng Beast has been destroyed.

623
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,220
Proper arrangements have been made for the slave soldiers.

624
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,620
The criminal, Yi Zhi Hua,

625
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,970
is awaiting trial.

626
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,790
Good.

627
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,540
By then,

628
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,510
I'll join you in the trial.

629
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,790
It would be great

630
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,350
if Your Majesty could attend the trial.

631
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,350
Vice Minister Li.

632
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,330
I'll give you

633
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,810
the seal

634
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,420
of the Minister of Judicial Review today.

635
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,680
However, due to your young age,

636
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,510
you'll keep holding the position of vice minister for now.

637
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,400
In the future…

638
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,750
I don't covet the position of Minister of Judicial Review.

639
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,070
I only wish to continue serving in the Court of Judicial Review

640
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,830
to solve cases and reveal truths.

641
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,720
Okay.

643
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:36,890

[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

645
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,630
Mr. Cui.

646
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:58,910
Mr. Li.

647
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,710
Vice Minister.

648
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:17,600
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

649
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,930
I've been vindicated

650
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,840
and have had my revenge.

651
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,320
Thank you for your help.

652
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:35,190
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

653
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,070
Vice Minister.

654
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,270
You're welcome.

655
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,780
Well,

656
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,150
I'm still

657
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,240
just a scribe.

658
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,640
Now that we've solved such a big case,

659
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,040
can you make me the judicial commissioner?

660
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,300
Vice Minister.

661
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,290
I think Hu

662
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,030
is suitable to work at the Court of Judicial Review.

663
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,750
Can you…

664
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,510
Vice Minister.

665
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,280
I missed the Mandarin Level 8 Exam

666
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,500
because of the investigation.

667
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,060
It's excusable, and I should be compensated.

668
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,770
Can you…

669
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,490
Vice Minister.

670
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,760
All these years,

671
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,920
I've been organizing dossiers alone.

672
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,400
The workload is indeed too heavy.

673
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,720
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

674
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,710
I didn't want

675
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,150
to burden them with it before.

676
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:03,980
Now that everyone

677
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,180
has gotten used to it,

678
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,000
can you

679
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,630
arrange for some of my colleagues

680
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,530
to work with me?

681
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,420
Mr. Li.

682
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,230
I want to keep some rabbits.

683
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:16,520
I think the math question about chickens and rabbits in the same coop

684
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,780
is quite interesting.

685
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,610
I mean this one.

686
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:26,840
Are you all up

687
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,260
for another round of performance reviews?

688
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,380
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

689
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:43,030
[The Court of Judicial Review]

690
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,130
What do you think?

691
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,460
I look amazing, don't I?

692
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,980
Get over yourself.

693
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,070
Why are you wearing a flower on your head?

694
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,170
You know nothing.

695
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,240
Let me tell you.

696
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,590
Those who get the highest score in the Imperial Exam

697
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,510
all wear a red flower on their heads.

698
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,300
I've been reinstated

699
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,360
as judicial commissioner. That's three ranks higher.

700
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,900
It's just like getting the highest scores in all three levels of exams.

701
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,420
Vice Minister Li

702
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,560
is so nice.

703
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,990
I just mentioned it,

704
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,440
but he really promoted me.

705
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,510
It's because your request was reasonable.

706
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,100
Alibaba didn't want to take the exam,

707
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,030
but Vice Minister Li didn't agree.

708
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,840
I look great, don't I?

709
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,110
You look mad.

710
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,330
You know nothing.

In a few days,

712
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,180
my parents will come again.

713
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,190
I want to give them

714
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,870
a big surprise.

715
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,390
Are you serious

716
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,290
about getting Xu Hu to work with us?

717
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,100
Yes.

718
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,590
The imperial court is to offer aid to the veteran soldiers.

719
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,060
It'd be great if he could come back to Shendu.

720
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,580
If he could come to the Court of Judicial Review,

721
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,780
he and I could be working buddies again.

722
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,350
Your flower…

723
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,270
What's wrong with my flower?

724
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,910
It looks a bit crooked.

725
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,510
Crooked? Help me with it.

726
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,030
It should come forward.

727
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,310
Adjust it for me. Come on.

728
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,320
I need to look perfect.

729
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,000

00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:17,550
Hurry.

Can you get out of the habit

736
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,120
of being a buzzkill?

737
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,070
You look great.

738
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,790
That's more like it.

739
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:33,490
By the way,

740
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,520
Vice Minister Li has allowed me to find someone myself

741
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
to assist me in the Dossier Library.

742
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,580
Are any of you

743
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,180
willing to help me?

744
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,020
Bad news!

745
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,630
Bad news!

746
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,550
What's wrong?

00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,270
Bad news!

748
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,270
What's wrong?

749
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,790
Tell us.

750
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,550
-Vice Minister Shangguan…
-Slow down.

751
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,350
What's wrong with Vice Minister Shangguan?

752
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,630
A letter came from Vice Minister Shangguan.

753
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,560
Isn't it a good thing?

754
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,550
I wrote many letters to her.

755
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,350
This is the first time she's replied.

756
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,550
But not only did her letter come,

757
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,980
but she'll also come back soon.

758
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,480
Really?

759
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,870
I was so close.

760
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,990
It was a total lapse in judgment.

761
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,100
Calm down.

762
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,210
You're all here.

763
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,660
So cute.

764
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,630
Sit down.

765
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,480
I can't do it.

766
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,440
So interesting.

767
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,500
Look at the rabbit.

00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,600
Its eyes are red. So cute.

769
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,190
Look.

770
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,450
Look at its small face.

771
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,670
It looks like Sun Bao.

772
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,650
What are you doing?

773
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,180
-Don't scare it.
-Sorry.

What brought you here?

791
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,870
We brought fireworks.

00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,790
♫Fly in the sky after the dark clouds dispersed♫

[The End]

825
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,300
[A few small things to add]

826
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:31,290
[The Court of Judicial Review often dealt with murder cases, but other than Li Bing,]

827
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:31,290
[no small animals were harmed in the process.]

828
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,840
[Vice Minister Li Bing invited everyone to have dinner at Zuixian Restaurant which has reopened recently,]

829
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,840
[and paid for the first meal he had with Chen Shi.]

830
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:50,400
[After Wang Qi and Alibaba were reinstated, they went to the family living next to the wedding vendors

831
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:50,400
[to return the clothes they borrowed.]

832
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:59,880
[Alibaba made a point of saying he'd never been to that place before.]

833
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:09,040
[Sun Bao promised Cui Bei that if Xu Hu got admitted to the Court of Judicial Review,]

834
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:09,040
[he'd persuade Xu Hu to help Cui Bei in the Dossier Library.]

835
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:18,920
[Cui Bei mistakenly wounded Hu Si with his inkstone. He felt very sorry and insisted on paying for Hu Si's medical expenses.]

836
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:18,920
[Therefore, the money he donated to the temple this year was not as much as that of last year.]

837
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:27,540
[Moreover,]

838
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:37,320
[when Si Zhijia and his brother were on leave, they didn't go back to their hometown to visit their family.]

839
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:37,320
[Instead, they sent Hu Si back to his hometown.]

840
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:46,870
[When Li Bing was a little boy, he thought the Court of Judicial Review never owed favors.]

841
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:46,870
[As the vice minister, Li Bing always feels indebted to too many people when he wakes up from dreams.]

842
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:56,420
[Later, Chen Shi told Yi Zhi Hua that he was luckier than his brother.]

843
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:05,780
[The first time Qiu Qingzhi saw fireworks was when he was a young boy and saw the flare of the Court of Judicial Review.]

844
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:05,780
[The last fireworks he saw were those just now.]
