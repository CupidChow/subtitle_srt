193
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,300
Radish?

194
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,630
I like radish.

195
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,750
There's also stir fried ginger with ginger.

196
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,210
We will become a huge ginger after eating it.

197
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,310
Sun Bao.

198
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,030
Wang Qi?

199
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,430
Alibaba!

200
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,650
Chen Shi!

201
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,430
Where are you?

202
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,190
Wang Qi!

203
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,760
Wang Qi!

204
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,180
Chen Shi!

205
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,130
Why are you here?

206
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,380
Come down!

207
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,470
What are you doing so high up?

208
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,910
For such a long time,

209
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,240
it has always been you who accompanied me.

210
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,710
You are a little dark,

211
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,990
and a little unlucky too.

212
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,030
But...

213
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,670
Without you,

214
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,100
I probably

215
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,020
wouldn't have come this far.

216
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,390
Wh-What's wrong?

217
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,670
Why are you crying?

218
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,710
What?

219
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,340
You're leaving?

220
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,860
You don't want to be a dark cloud anymore?

221
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,410
To do good deeds

222
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,770
and leave the rest to fate.

223
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,080
So you remember

224
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,170
what I said.

225
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,190
Father.

226
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,110
Mother.

227
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,070
You have never resented me.

228
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,870
Is that true?

229
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,230
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,710
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,150
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,660
What are you doing?

233
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,920
I hereby announce

234
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,560
the annual Court of Judicial Review

235
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,390
martial arts test

236
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,580
begins now!

237
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,350
You

238
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,240
won't fight

239
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,600
nor retreat.

240
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,150
What is that for?

241
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,550
Well, I...

242
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,210
We...

243
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,230
I'll go first.

244
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,150
You have a lot of courage.

245
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,230
Then, choose one.

246
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,490
Arm wrestling.

247
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:30,950
Okay.

248
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,550
Wait.

249
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,260
I'll let you use your other hand too.

250
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,470
You said it yourself.

251
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,950
Push harder.

252
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,700
Harder!

253
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,590
Finish him.

254
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,990
Harder. Harder.

255
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,830
Harder.

256
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:54,910
Harder!

257
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,750
Hang in there.

258
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,590
Next.

259
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,720
Wang Ruyi.

260
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,090
How is he so good?

261
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,250
Of course.

262
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,120
Sun Bao

263
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,190
used to be a scout in the army.

264
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,890
No one can beat him.

265
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,510
There won't be a good outcome

266
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,970
to this martial arts test.

267
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,600
He said it was an assessment.

268
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,990
But he made everyone in the Court of Judicial Review

269
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,090
his opponent.

270
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,880
He thinks he's good at martial arts

271
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,190
so he lets his opponents

272
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,390
choose anything they want to fight in.

273
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,750
As long as you win him, you can be considered outstsanding.

274
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,070
And you won't have to take

275
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,350
the martial arts test next year.

276
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,760
How arrogant!

277
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,230
Ridiculous!

278
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,710
Nonsensical!

279
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,980
Expose oneself to ridicule?

280
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,750
That's right.

281
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,350
Next.

282
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,190
It's only once a year.

283
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,070
Look at him.

284
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,550
Well,

285
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,910
has no one won

286
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,810
Mr. Sun before?

287
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,790
No.

288
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,610
Sun Bao is amazing.

289
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,760
Next!

290
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,550
Cui Bei.

291
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,470
My hands are numb.

292
00:15:59,270 --> 00:15:59,870
Cui Bei.

293
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,630
Cui Bei.

294
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,130
What do you choose?

295
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,230
I...

296
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,540
I give up.

297
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,150
Why did you give up?

298
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:22,910
What else can I do?

299
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,590
Why?

300
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,910
Where is your dark cloud magic?

301
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,750
Dark cloud?

302
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,000
It's gone.

303
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,190
Next one.

304
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,720
Wang Qi, it's your turn.

305
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,610
Why is it my turn?

306
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,790
It is your turn.

307
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,710
Only you guys are left.

308
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,230
Friend.

309
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,670
It's your turn.

310
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,040
It's time for me, the outstanding horse's turn.

311
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,080
What are you choosing, friend?

312
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,630
He's looking confident.

313
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,310
Yeah.

314
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,830
Wrestling!

315
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,750
Wrestling?

316
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,310
You dare to fight a close combat with me?

317
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,150
You're not just brave.

318
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,250
Cut the crap.

319
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,590
Don't talk all big.

320
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,510
Bring it on. Come on.

321
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,250
Behind you!

322
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,869
Wang Qi!

323
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,359
He can't beat him at all.

324
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,780
Use more strength.

325
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,869
Why did you choose wrestling if you couldn't defeat me?

326
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,510
Wang Qi.

327
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,690
Wang Qi!

328
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,099
Release me!

329
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,599
What is this?

330
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,569
Good.

331
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,589
Wang Qi!

332
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,550
Wang Qi! Wang Qi! Wang Qi!

333
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,030
Sir! Sir!

334
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,170
Please show mercy.

335
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,850
Bao is the best.

336
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,680
Not bad.

337
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,670
When I taught Chen Shi,

338
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,210
you must've peeped.

339
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,540
You found my weakness

340
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,870
and counter-attacked.

341
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,310
You've put in a lot of effort.

342
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,410
What a pity.

343
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,100
Wang Qi lost.

344
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,120
Next,

345
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,240
Alibaba.

346
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,890
What do you choose?

347
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,110
The Six Arts.

348
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,330
Rites, music, dance, archery, horse riding, calligraphy, and mathematics.

349
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,760
You don't know that?

350
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,380
Today,

351
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,390
I'll battle with you.

352
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,970
Archery and horseriding.

353
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,630
The wind is blowing.

354
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,190
That's wrong.

355
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,560
It's inauspicious to say this now.

356
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,740
Ready.

357
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,760
Alibaba!

358
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,400
Alibaba, come on!

359
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,470
Alibaba, come on!

360
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,990
Alibaba! Alibaba!

361
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,320
Nice! Nice!

362
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,030
Nice shot!

363
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,070
Good!

364
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,350
Nice shot!

365
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,030
There's a chance.

366
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,030
There's a chance!

367
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,070
Bravo! Bravo!

368
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,870
Hold it.

369
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,690
Alibaba!

370
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,500
Are you okay?

371
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,990
Alibaba.

372
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:01,930
Here.

373
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,990
I didn't expect this.

374
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,920
Your archery and horse riding skills

375
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,890
are good.

376
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,650
Why didn't I notice it before?

377
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,320
I...

378
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,170
I just practiced it.

379
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,070
Unfortunately,

380
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,520
you were a little impatien

381
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,020
about the last arrow

382
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,670
and made a mistake in controlling the horses.

383
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,470
Our horses in the Central Plain

384
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,350
don't understand your nonsense.

385
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,830
In that case,

386
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,960
I shall announce

387
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,670
no one has passed the

388
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,590
martial arts test this year.

389
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,190
Wait.

390
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,710
Wait.

391
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,800
There's me left.

392
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,350
This happens every year.

393
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,810
I really missed you.

394
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,590
But

395
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,510
you haven't officially entered the court yet.

396
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,160
You can't win anyway.

397
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,100
How about we just forget it?

398
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,590
What?

399
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,730
I-I mean

400
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,190
I am a member of Mingjing Hall too.

401
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,230
You can't leave me behind.

402
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,030
Forget it.

403
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,710
Us superior beings

404
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,110
have already lost.

405
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,020
Chen Shi.

406
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,500
Why humiliate yourself?

407
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,110
I've been waiting for so long.

408
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,510
How–

409
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,270
What do you want to choose, Chen Shi?

410
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,510
I can't win you in a physical fight.

411
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,630
How about

412
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,830
ar-

413
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,190
archery?

414
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,350
You want to compete in archery with me?

415
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,570
I haven't taught you this yet

416
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,070
and you want to compete with me in this?

417
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,870
But not with this thing.

418
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,550
Can we use this?

419
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,110
A slingshot?

420
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,800
Sure.

421
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,160
A-Also.

422
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,150
We won't ride the horse.

423
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,590
I'm not good at that.

424
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,040
Shall we shoot the bell?

425
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,900
Shoot the bell.

426
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,720
Bell?

427
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,750
A still target?

428
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,230
Sure. Let's do it.

429
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:25,870
Okay.

430
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,440
Let's go.

431
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,150
Let's go and take a look.

432
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:28,950
This is interesting.

433
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,870
Yes, this is interesting.

434
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,310
Yeah.

435
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:30,990
This one.

436
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,110
What is this?

437
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,510
Isn't this a joke?

438
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,390
Ready...

439
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,950
I knew it.

440
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,740
Chen Shi, I haven’t blown the whistle yet.

441
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,200
Why are you in such a hurry?

442
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,910
The whistle hasn't been blown yet.

443
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,510
You can do it again.

444
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,750
Chen Shi, you can do it.

445
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,190
Chen Shi, stay calm.

446
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,280
Don't panic.

447
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,000
Stay calm.

448
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,090
Come on.

449
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:51,910
Are you ready?

450
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,810
Ready...

451
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,030
Not bad, Chen Shi.

452
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,790
He hit it!

453
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,750
Chen Shi,

454
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,650
where did you learn this from?

455
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,750
When I was

456
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,420
in my hometown, I shoot down fruits

457
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,710
on the mountain with slingshots.

458
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,630
I got good at it after using it frequently.

459
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,950
That counts, right?

460
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,870
Yes.

461
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,230
Of course.

462
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,350
You are the only one who could draw

463
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,650
with me in these years.

464
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,160
Excellent!

465
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,070
Chen Shi.

466
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,400
You're amazing.

467
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,310
I announce

468
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,650
you are exempted from the test next year.

469
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,270
Okay, that's it.

470
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,550
W-Wait for me.

471
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,910
I think...

472
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,590
I think it's unfair.

473
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,680
Unfair?

474
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,720
How is it unfair?

475
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:40,750
Mr. Sun,

476
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,250
you're skilled.

477
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,630
Super skilled.

478
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,470
But everyone in the Court of Judicial Review

479
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,960
have different talents

480
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,990
and they have their own specialties.

481
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,230
No one is a martial arts practitioner

482
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,360
like you are.

483
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,110
I got that just by luck.

484
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,360
Otherwise,

485
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,560
I couldn't have beaten you.

486
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,670
If they never beat you,

487
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,750
they will never pass.

488
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,110
You mean...

489
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,190
Exactly.

490
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,680
I'm picking on everyone?

491
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,500
Chen Shi, you're bold.

492
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,110
So Sun Bao is using this

493
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,740
to look cool?

494
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,200
No.

495
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,590
That's not what I mean.

496
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,960
I just want think

497
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,510
if it's possible,

498
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,520
can you change the test method?

499
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,840
What you said

500
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,880
makes sense.

501
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,310
But if you want to change the rules,

502
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,790
you have to defeat me first.

503
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,260
How about this?

504
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,460
Let's compete again.

505
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,720
We've practiced these.

506
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,990
Overcome this obstacle

507
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,120
and touch that bell.

508
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,550
Beat me first.

509
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,360
How's that?

510
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,150
Chen Shi.

511
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,710
Sure!

512
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:37,670
Let's go.

513
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,200
Let's go.

514
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,750
We're counting on you.

515
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,430
Ready...

516
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,590
Go, Chen Shi!

517
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,270
-Chen Shi! -Chen Shi!

518
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,750
Quick!

519
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,320
Chen Shi!

520
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,760
Quick!

521
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,780
Quick!

522
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,430
Quick!

523
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,950
Chen Shi!

524
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,770
Chen Shi!

525
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,970
Stay calm!

526
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,070
-Good! -Good!

527
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,440
Go!

528
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,190
Go!

529
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,870
Just a little more!

530
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,670
Hang in there.

531
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,000
Chen Shi, go!

532
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,110
Go! Go!

533
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,130
Chen Shi...

534
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,800
Chen Shi.

535
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,700
Are you okay?

536
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,120
Are you okay?

537
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,420
It was so close.

538
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,710
Sorry.

539
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,740
I lost.

540
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,350
Chen Shi.

541
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,520
You didn't lose.

542
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,230
I didn't teach you

543
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,470
how to touch the bell.

544
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,010
But you didn't win either.

545
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,040
The three of them helped you too.

546
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,910
If the four of you work together against me,

547
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,630
it means that I, the martial arts test judge,

548
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,030
is really disliked.

549
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,390
Next year, I'll try another test method.

550
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,070
I

551
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,740
won't stand out anymore.

552
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,310
Well,

553
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,550
what about this year?

554
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,340
This year?

555
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,350
This year,

556
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,870
all of you passed!

557
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,880
[Guiding drug] [Du Zixu] [Yi Zhi Hua] [Minister of Rites]

558
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,970
[Guiding drug] [Du Zixu] [Yi Zhi Hua] [Minister of Rites]

559
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,540
[Jiashen 27]

560
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:24,890
[My slave]

561
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,310
[I'll wait for you at the slave camp.]

562
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,980
[Guiding drug] [Du Zixu] [Yi Zhi Hua] [Minister of Rites]

563
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,450
[Dragon King Temple]

564
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,140
[Guiding drug]

565
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,820
I don't know if it's true.

566
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Young Master, let me accompany you.

567
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,750
Come on, Sir.

568
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,550
Young Master.

569
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:35,600
Do you remember it?

570
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,190
Boss.

571
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,550
One bowl of noodles.

572
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,350
Okay.

573
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,910
Here are the noodles.

574
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,550
Please enjoy.

575
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,510
What about you?

576
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,160
Same as me.

577
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,150
Vice Minister Li.

578
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,340
What a coincidence.

579
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,480
Although you've change into commoner clothes,

580
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,150
but the callus from your tough training

581
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,150
is still there.

582
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,000
Bandits?

583
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,010
A fugitive.

584
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,430
He has a knife on him.

585
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,670
There's a child next to him too.

586
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,910
It's really troublesome.

587
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,830
This fugitive

588
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,110
has some experience in the martial world.

589
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,510
He knows it wouldn't be easy to deal with him

590
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,860
when he has a hostage in hand.

591
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,230
It's not like we've

592
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:39,910
never been met with

593
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,570
a situation like this before.

594
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,490
What are you doing?

595
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,200
It's him!

596
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,910
Take him.

597
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,830
Don't talk.

598
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,770
Let go of me!

599
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,810
Don't move!

600
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,020
Take him away.

601
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,360
Let's go.

602
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,910
D-Don't cry.

603
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,770
Don't...

604
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,420
Don't cry.

605
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,140
I...

606
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,540
Wait.

607
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,160
A sugar man please.

608
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,350
How much is it?

609
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,150
One wen.

610
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,150
Here.

611
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,380
Look.

612
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,310
Don't cry.

613
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,550
Check his background

614
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,580
and send him back.

615
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,480
Yes.

616
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,150
Search along the tavern.

617
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,210
It won't be too far.

618
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,770
This child looks clean.

619
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,630
He should have been abducted not long ago.

620
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,790
Why the tavern?

621
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,310
Your lord

622
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,340
made you this clay figurine,

623
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,020
right?

624
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,910
Look, it's made with white glue

625
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,030
and root powder.

626
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,070
This type of clay is used

627
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,200
in sealing alcohol.

628
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,550
Go.

629
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,190
Let's go.

630
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,640
Let's go.

631
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,440
You are indeed different

632
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,790
from before.

633
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,470
With different things and people I'm meeting,

634
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,870
naturally I've changed.

635
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,470
But I still have to thank you

636
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,510
for your help.

637
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,600
You're welcome.

638
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,030
It's not a coincidence for us to meet

639
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,960
at this noodle restaurant, right?

640
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,030
I'm here for you.

641
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,230
What is it?

642
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,320
I'm looking for someone.

643
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,030
Who is it?

644
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,310
A woman from the Western Regions.

645
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,840
She ran a casino in the city south previously.

646
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,020
This description is quite vague.

647
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,140
Since I came to you,

648
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,710
I'm sure you know her.

649
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,030
She is a spy from a small country.

650
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,950
She came to Shendu to spy on military information.

651
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,310
But Jinwu Guards

652
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,440
has controlled her.

653
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,590
We have to reinvestigate

654
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,830
everyone who has had

655
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,520
close contact with her.

656
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,430
Okay.

657
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,590
I will take

658
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,760
your word for it.

659
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,430
Do you know her well?

660
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,910
She's a key witness to one of my important cases.

661
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,910
What if I were to ask

662
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,710
what case it is?

663
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,230
That is a secret

664
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,780
of the Court of Judicial Review.

665
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,240
I can't tell you anything.

666
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,200
I have to investigate her properly then.

667
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,710
You...

668
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,380
I wonder what happened to you

669
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,450
that you have

670
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,520
become like this?

671
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,070
Vice Minister Li.

672
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:35,990
What is it?

673
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,000
Mr. Sun.

674
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,570
You're amazing.

675
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,990
Just so so.

676
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,290
You're not bad. You climbed pretty fast.

677
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,000
You're acting all cool now?

678
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,220
Mr. Sun

679
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,390
was a scout

680
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,470
when he was in the army.

681
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,950
How can we compete?

682
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,770
He only gets to stand out once a year

683
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,790
of course he'd take the opportunity to.

684
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,630
He doesn't leave us with any ounce of pride.

685
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,090
We basically die together

686
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,960
and fight to our death.

687
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,390
I've already toned it down.

688
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,500
You just lack training.

689
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,670
If you were in the army,

690
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,830
all of you would be kicked out.

691
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,830
-Got it?
-Mr. Sun.

692
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:05,950
If you keep training me,

693
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,230
I will definitely practice hard.

694
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,200
You are really talented.

695
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,110
You're way better than them.

696
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,910
You can definitely be cultivated in the army.

697
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,400
Really?

698
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,110
Were you really great in the military

699
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,230
back then?

700
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,430
I was nothing.

701
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,630
You were nothing?

702
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,070
What's wrong,

703
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,630
Mr. Sun?

704
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,650
This is an old injury.

705
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,580
I stretched it today.

706
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:21,990
Are you okay?

707
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,900
I'm fine.

708
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,040
Are you okay?

709
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,790
Our Assistant Minister

710
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,200
is inviting everyone from Mingjing Hall.

711
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,030
There's a case?

712
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,470
Yes.

713
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,230
Lead the way.

714
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,070
-Let’s go.
-This way, please.

715
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,740
Let's go.

716
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,550
Bai came ahead of us.

717
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,710
Mr. Li.

718
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,900
Vice Minister.

719
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,100
Assistant Minister.

720
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,700
Sir.

721
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,160
This person

722
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,710
suffered a lot before their death.

723
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,430
His body is covered with injuries.

724
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,690
But they are not fatal.

725
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,130
The only fatal blow

726
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,790
is the one here.

727
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,130
He was strangled to death.

728
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,780
But there are more than one strangling marks.

729
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,830
Judging from how

730
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,230
he was tortured for a long time

731
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,490
and strangled to be suffocated to death,

732
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,990
it doesn't seem like

733
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,590
they want the victim's life.

734
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,550
It's more like...

735
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,590
They're torturing him for information.

736
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,590
Who is the victim?

737
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,920
The victim's name is Zhao Ruyi.

738
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,270
He used to be a thief.

739
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,710
He's a veteran.

740
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,870
He likes to steal from

741
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,390
trading shops and warehouses.

742
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,450
He'ss especially good at unlocking.

743
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,870
He was known as the best in the industry.

744
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,580
But he went to jail

745
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,910
because of a mistake.

746
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,230
After he came out,

747
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,070
he has been quiet.

748
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,310
I didn't expect him to die here.

749
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,790
Are there any trading shops

750
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,920
or storages facilities that were stolen from recently?

751
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,540
When did that happen?

752
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,000
About half a month ago.

753
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,190
This hole

754
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,270
was dug from a private house

755
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,350
on the neighboring street.

756
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,990
This thief

757
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,320
worked really hard.

758
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,590
Don't you have people patroling the warehouses normally?

759
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,550
It's such a big hole.

760
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,620
It can't be dug in just

761
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,420
a day or two.

762
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,070
How could no one know?

763
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,270
Here's the thing.

764
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,270
Look.

765
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,710
That day,

766
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,070
a customer came to collect money.

767
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,110
It was then we found that

768
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,510
his storage was touched.

769
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,120
Officers,

770
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:21,909
look.

771
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,310
This is our lock in this storage facility.

772
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,040
That day,

773
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,790
the customer was about to open the door

774
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,449
but found a broken key inside.

775
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,030
There's obviously something wrong with it.

776
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,290
So we investigated it.

777
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,610
Then we found

778
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,489
it was empty under this floor.

779
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,870
It was when we opened up the floor

780
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,070
that we saw this hole.

781
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,310
Sun Bao.

782
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,510
Yes, Sir.

783
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,590
Mr. Sun.

784
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,389
Mr. Sun.

785
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,040
The torch.

786
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,250
Did you lose anything?

787
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,790
No money was missing from the storage.

788
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,790
None was missing?

789
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,449
Robbers never leave empty-handed.

790
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,679
This is odd.

791
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:55,600
Could it be that

792
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,830
the thief couldn't open the lock

793
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,030
and ran away

794
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,440
because he felt guilty?

795
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,330
Not bad. You know idioms now.

796
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,670
He opened the lock.

797
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,510
The locks in our storage facility

798
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,570
are custom-made to prevent thieves.

799
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,030
After inserting the key,

800
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,050
turn in the right sequence

801
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,590
and you can unlock the lock.

802
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,630
It's the same for pulling out the key.

803
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,390
Now that the key

804
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,650
is broken at this spot,

805
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,280
it shows that the lock has been unlocked.

806
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,990
You mean

807
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,690
the thief opened the lock,

808
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,190
didn't take the money insidem

809
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,650
and locked the lock again.

810
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,670
Isn't that unnecessary?

811
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,960
Judging from the situation,

812
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,390
that can be the only explanation.

813
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,430
I find it strange too.

814
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,510
To open this lock,

815
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,660
you need two keys.

816
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,470
That's right.

817
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,950
So,

818
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,280
to be extra safe,

819
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,710
one of the keys is with the storage facility,

820
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,640
and the other is with the customer.

821
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,590
The key in the storage facility

822
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,670
is kept by me.

823
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,070
No one has touched it.

824
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,110
I'm not sure about the one

825
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,170
with the customer.

826
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,110
How's it?

827
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,070
Sir.

828
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,470
there is a well

829
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,730
not far from this hole.

830
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,030
There's a waterway down there

831
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,360
that goes straight to the storage facility.

832
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,710
It's not hard to dig this.

833
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,590
But it takes a lot of effort

834
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,750
to devise this.

835
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,110
But it's strange.

836
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,210
What is he looking for if not money

837
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,000
since he took so much effort to dig this hole?

838
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,790
I remember our village,

839
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,500
we often dig up cellars.

840
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,930
Other than putting money in them,

841
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,590
we also put some other things.

842
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,030
Sometimes, when it's been too long,

843
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,830
we can't even remember what we put in there ourselves.

844
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,510
Do you think

845
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,630
there's something else

846
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,550
in the storage

847
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,490
that the boss doesn't know about?

848
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,470
There are two keys to the storage facility.

849
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,040
One is kept by the boss

850
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,070
and the other is in the customer's hands.

851
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,310
When customers lock it,

852
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,750
they usually do it themselves.

853
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,740
In order to avoid suspicion,

854
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,310
the boss wouldn't stand around to check.

855
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,110
So,

856
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,080
if the customer put something in

857
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,310
secretly when locking it up,

858
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,830
if there's something wrong with this item,

859
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,790
even if it's lost,

860
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,310
they wouldn't tell the boss about it.

861
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,630
The key to the storage facility

862
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,230
has always been in the boss's hands.

863
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,590
Then there must be someone

864
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,790
who's good at picking locks among them.

865
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,150
It could be Zhao Ruyi.

866
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,030
Assistant Minister of Justice Lord Feng Jian once said

867
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,020
he's an expert in unlocking.

868
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,150
He's also known for it in the industry.

869
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,240
But he lost a thumb.

870
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,350
It's such a huge hole.

871
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,750
He can't dig it out by himself.

872
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,550
He has to survey the terrain too.

873
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,110
He has an accomplice?

874
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,630
This is an internal conflict?

875
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,760
They all make sense.

876
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,810
One more thing.

877
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,760
Since the storage door

878
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,710
has been opened,

879
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,550
the tunnel has been covered up,

880
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,990
and lock has been locked up again,

881
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,950
one can think of it as

882
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,110
they don't want the storage facility to find out about it,

883
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,800
but...

884
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,720
By deliberately breaking the key in the lock,

885
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,230
they want the owner to

886
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,830
find out his storage was touched

887
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,150
when he comes.

888
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:31,820
Where is the owner?

889
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,150
He's already invited to Mingjing Hall.

890
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,750
All right.

891
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,690
Wang Qi, Cui Bei.

892
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,870
You two go to Zhao Ruyi's house

893
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,360
and see if there's anything.

894
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,640
Alibaba, Sun Bao.

895
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,830
Go and ask

896
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:44,630
people who have criminal records

897
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,190
and see if

898
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,350
there is anything suspicious.

899
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:46,880
Go ahead.

900
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,620
Yes.

901
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,990
Mr. Sun. Mr. Sun.

902
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:50,910
Mr. Sun!

903
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,590
-Give it to me.
-Okay.

904
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:10,910
Sun Bao.

905
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,300
Are you up to something?

906
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,950
When Vice Minister was talking about the case,

907
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,750
you wanted to say something but stopped yourself.

908
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,550
I just think

909
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,470
the way this thief worked

910
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,460
is similar to that of a scout's.

911
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,390
What do you mean?

912
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,570
When we scout

913
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,300
to spy on the enemy camp,

914
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,270
we'd sometimes

915
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,270
leave some traces

916
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,070
to make the enemy suspect

917
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,690
their deployment

918
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,210
and lead the enemy to make a judgment.

919
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,610
So that lock...

920
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,890
Why didn't you tell Vice Minister that earlier?

921
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,200
How could a thief be related

922
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,050
to a scout?

923
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,950
You're right.

924
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,540
Wait for me.

925
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,910
When I met Ruyi,

926
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,320
he was no longer a thief.

927
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,220
Our dyehouse is doing very well.

928
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,390
But you know he used to be one?

929
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,470
Yes.

930
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,830
He didn't hide anything about his past from me.

931
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,190
He's a nice person

932
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,260
but happened to be a thief.

933
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,230
I used to be in the brothel.

934
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,880
It was him who redeemed me.

935
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,390
He is a good man.

936
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,870
Even if he stole,

937
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,080
he stole from those that should be stolen from.

938
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,590
Besides,

939
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,190
he chopped this off himself.

[Court of Judicial Review]
