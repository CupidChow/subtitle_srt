Alibaba.

5
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,870
Why are you looking through my bookshelf?

6
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,800
I-I'm looking for the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

7
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,170
That's not part of the Mandarin Level 8 Exam.

8
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,370
I've never seen it. I just want to see it.

9
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,530
Making trouble out of nothing. What's wrong?

10
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,360
Nothing.

11
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,180
What are you holding?

12
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,910
My notes.

13
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,470
It's personal.

14
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,990
It's raining so heavily.

15
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,670
What are you doing?

16
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,270
N-Nothing.

17
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,710
Where have you been?

18
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,160
Nothing.

19
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,440
I haven't seen you for days.

20
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,470
We don't know

21
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,510
what you did too.

22
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,950
I haven't seen you too

23
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,870
these days.

24
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,590
Mr. Li.

25
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,310
Mr. Li.

26
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,180
It's me.

27
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,710
Mr. Li.

28
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,830
Mr. Li.

29
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,830
Eat something warm. Don't catch a cold.

30
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,710
Here.

31
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,990
M-Mr. Li. Your hand.

32
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,030
Mr. Li.

33
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,700
I haven't seen you lately.

34
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,570
Everyone has been weird.

35
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,030
Since I came back,

36
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,870
we seem to be led by others

37
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,210
for all our cases.

38
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,860
Who are you talking about, Mr. Li?

39
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,990
Yi Zhi Hua.

40
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:10,770
He...

41
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,710
Wasn't he burned to death?

42
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,760
I don't think he's dead.

43
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,950
He just stopped showing up.

44
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,840
After the wharf case,

45
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,820
he has been hiding

46
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,720
behind us,

47
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,560
leaving only a trace.

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
I remember his scent.

49
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,250
It must be him behind this.

50
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,860
This is what I found

51
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,240
in Sun Xiaoying's hand.

52
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,210
Then...

53
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,810
What is this?

54
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,930
It's Du Zixu's guide drug.

55
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,190
G-Guide drug?

56
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,550
On top of that,

57
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,920
it's what Lu Chenghuang is hiding,

58
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,270
what Lu from the wharf wants to find,

59
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,710
and somethign that has appeared in

60
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,240
the War of Huangsha Valley.

61
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,390
All these cases

62
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,390
are the same case.

63
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,150
As someone within this, Yi Zhi Hua

64
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,090
also wants to find the answer.

65
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,490
He pushed the clues to me little by little

66
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,710
because he wanted to use me

67
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,800
to find the truth.

68
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,030
And he might...

69
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,900
He might what?

70
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,880
Stop asking.

71
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,270
M-M-Mr. Li.

72
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,360
Mr. Li.

73
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,230
This...

74
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,830
Mr. Li.

75
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,950
Are you okay?

76
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,050
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,780
N-No.

78
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,190
Don't be.

79
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,990
Mr. Li.

80
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,100
I just want to help you.

81
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,890
I will only ask

82
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,520
and won't do anything else.

83
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,159
It's not your fault.

84
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,210
It's my own business.

85
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,110
It's not your own business.

86
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,950
How about

87
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,190
we tell everyone about this?

88
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,090
I'm stupid.

89
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,360
But everyone is smarter than me–

90
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,950
No.

91
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,670
Why not?

92
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,180
Chen Shi.

93
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,380
What am I?

94
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,440
If they

95
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,410
see me like that,

96
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,370
what would they think of me?

97
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,480
No one will believe that

98
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,130
humans can age backwards

99
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,070
and become a cat.

100
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,420
So this case

101
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,600
can only be investigated by me.

102
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,990
The answer

103
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,620
can only be found out by me.

104
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,640
When I found the body,

105
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,920
I saw a note.

106
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,230
It was written with blood.

107
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,190
It states that I should look for

108
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,320
those at the Court of Judicial Review.

109
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,260
Look, here it is.

110
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,690
This case can only be solved by

111
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,290
the Court of Judicial Review's Mingjing Hall.

112
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,550
Mr. Li!

113
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,270
Sir.

114
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,540
Have... you seen the dead?

115
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,070
No.

116
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,150
Sir.

117
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,690
The victim's teeth were broken.

118
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,230
It's the same state as that mason

119
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,060
who died

120
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,870
in jail.

121
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,340
[Court of Judicial Review]

122
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,510
The victim is a butcher. His last name is Zhao.

123
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,870
They call him Butcher Zhao.

124
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,669
His business was in the city south.

125
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,470
Their business was good before.

126
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,240
But somehow

127
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,200
he died in an inn

128
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,080
in the north.

129
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,260
According to the owner of the inn,

130
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,990
he didn't bring a luggage

131
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,260
and only paid for a room for a day.

132
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,990
He only paid for a room for a day?

133
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,530
This is so strange.

134
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,320
Why would a local

135
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,230
live in an inn for no reason?

136
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,190
It's half a city away too.

137
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,430
Could it be...

138
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,260
he wants to

139
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,190
do things or meet someone

140
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,260
that's inconvenient for him to normally.

141
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,790
More or less, that's right.

142
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,040
If that's the case,

143
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,340
the person he met is extraordinary.

144
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,310
Why do you say so?

145
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,390
The victim was clearly murdered.

146
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,510
But there was no trace

147
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,590
of murder at the scene.

148
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,190
Besides,

149
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,920
the victim died peacefully.

150
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,190
That inn's wall

151
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,550
is just a plank.

152
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,600
But those in the left and right room

153
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,190
didn't hear any unusual movement.

154
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,980
Killing someone so quietly

155
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,620
is not something ordinary people can do.

156
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,810
Could it be the one

157
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,430
who killed the mason?

158
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,430
Didn't Vice Minister

159
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,670
see him die

160
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,630
in the fire?

161
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,550
Sir?

162
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:42,860
What?

163
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:45,990
Everyone...

164
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,850
I'm listening.

165
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,680
What you said makes sense.

166
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,980
I told you not to follow me.

167
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,150
Go back.

168
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,030
Madam.

169
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,250
Jinwu Guards are here.

170
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,360
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

171
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,090
What is it?

172
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,310
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

173
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,180
Vice Minister Li.

174
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,870
Everyone,

175
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,070
I'm just here to inform you.

176
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,350
The murder in

177
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,390
city south today

178
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,140
is under the jurisdiction of Jinwu Guards.

179
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,200
The Court of Judicial Review

180
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,440
should stay out of it.

181
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,750
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

182
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,670
Why are you Jinwu Guards

183
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,070
getting involved again?

184
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,590
Why do you snatch every case?

185
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,350
This case was

186
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,470
given to us first.

187
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,070
It's written on the note.

188
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,020
Calm down.

189
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,660
All the more we should avoid suspicion.

190
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,670
The victim of this case

191
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,110
has something to do with a case

192
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,090
that Jinwu Guards are investigating.

193
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,730
Don't think too much.

194
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,900

229
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,780
If I let other people in the Court of Judicial Review

230
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,660

231
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,990

237
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,780

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,710
You've improved a lot in Mingjing Hall.

385
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,900
At least you're better at

386
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,230
idioms than Alibaba is.

387
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,300
Of course.

388
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,640
Yes.

389
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,310
It's all fate.

390
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,450
Before I came to the Shendu, I thought

391
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,900
Shendu

392
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,550
must be an amazing place.

393
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,410
I dare not even dream about it.

394
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,170
On my way here,

395
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,040
my heart was pounding.

396
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,070
I was afraid something would happen.

397
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,230
But I was hoping something would happen too.

398
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,870
Who knew?

399
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,910
I met a wild cat.

400
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,690
And set off fireworks.

401
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,790
And solved a case.

402
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,510
That's something I wouldn't even dare dream of.

403
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,940
Are you confident in the

404
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,640
court's test tomorrow?

405
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,670
I...

406
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,110
I don't know.

407
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,790
Wh-Who knows?

408
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,130
I don't care.

409
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,900
I told you before.

410
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,830
You are suited to stay in the Court of Judicial Review.

411
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,430
Don't let me down.

412
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,790
Chen Shi.

413
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,950
No matter what the result

414
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,950
of this case is,

415
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,960
and no matter when

416
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,020
find your brother,

417
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,510
I really hope

418
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,390
you can stay in the

419
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,650
Court of Judicial Review to solve cases.

420
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,830
I have to find my brother...

421
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,920
If I find my brother,

422
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:55,030
I'll take the test to join the Court of Judicial Review with my brother.

423
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,670
I...

424
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,040
By the way, Mr. Li,

425
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,470
I still have a question I can't figure out.

426
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,110
What is it?

427
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,450
Why don't we investigate this together?

428
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,470
I already told you.

429
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,070
The Demon Cat Case

430
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,690
was investigated by all of us.

431
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,470
The cases from then

432
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,530
were investigated by all of us.

433
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,110
But why not this case?

434
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,440
I think

435
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,680
if you trust me,

436
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,170
you should trust them.

437
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,950
It was you who gathered us

438
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,950
and rebuilt Mingjing Hall.

439
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,080
If you don't trust them,

440
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,110
then the Court of Judicial Review

441
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,240
is not trustworthy.

442
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,130
What's wrong, Mr. Li?

443
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,530
Someone is following us.

444
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,190
Mr. Li!

445
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,380
They're from Jingwu Guards.

446
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,630
Remove the horse from the thill.

447
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,560
We have to hurry.

448
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,470
Got it.

449
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,390
How can Vice Minister

450
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,910
leave just like that?

451
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:48,620
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

452
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,390
Don't you

453
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,100
think

454
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,910
our vice minister doesn't mean it?

455
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,090
What do you mean?

456
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,050
Alibaba.

457
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,360
What...

458
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,870
What are you trying to say?

459
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,670
I...

460
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,470
I'm not trying to say anything.

461
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,430
I just think it's vague.

462
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,730
What does that mean?

463
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,220
I'm just saying what my intuition tells me.

464
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,880
Why are you pushing your luck?

465
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,870
You're up to no good.

466
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,510
What... What did I do?

467
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,670
If all of you are not saying it,

468
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,910
I shall.

469
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,820
Vice Minister

470
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,250
didn't go back to his hometown to worship

471
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,850
but to investigate the case.

472
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,310
Cui Bei,

473
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,950
do you have any evidence?

474
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,990
The butcher who died today

475
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,510
was an executioner.

476
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,660
Later, he was a prison guard

477
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,890
in the death row jail.

478
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,910
Vice Minister probably already knows about this.

479
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,640
He has been keeping a case

480
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,590
from us.

481
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,550
What else do you know?

482
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,860
It's a long story.

483
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,150
Y-Young Miss.

484
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,040
Young Miss.

485
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,430
Why haven't you been

486
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,340
bringing me by your side recently?

487
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,540
You keep avoiding me.

488
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,750
You should know it yourself.

489
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,710
Actually, Master

490
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,830
asked me to help you

491
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,070
because he cares

492
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,190
for you.

you are the eyes of my father

495
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,670
in the Court of Judicial Review.

496
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,430
I'm afraid

497
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,800
you're not the only one.

498
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,320
Who knows if

499
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,110
there are his nose, eyebrows,

500
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,840
beard and whatnot around here?

501
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,090
Let me tell you.

502
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,230
I really don't know

503
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,190
what Li Bing and the others are investigating.

504
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,580
It's useless to follow me.

505
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,350
I just want to protect you.

506
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,470
I am the Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review.

00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,010
I have many things to do.

508

If you keep

509
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,110
getting in my way,

510
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,710
don't blame me for being rude to you.

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,710

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,570
Why is this stage station so deserted?

521
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,860
This is an ancient road.

522
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,060
The road is so remote.

523
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,290
You can imagine what's it like at the stage station.

524
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,830

535
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,100
It feels familiar.

00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,090
We can't stay here for long.

537
00:28:59,090 --> 00:28:59,650
Let's go.

538
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,080

[Taixing]

542
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,220
These are my notes.

543
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,590
So you've been

544
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,100
suspecting Vice Minister.

545
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,200
You can't say that.

546
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,130
I was just curious

547
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,270
about some suspicious things

548
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,460
of the cases.

549
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,950
So I started to look for

550
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,620
clues in the past dossiers.

551
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,120
For example,

552
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,490
the teeth of the mason.

553
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,650
Though Vice Minister said

554
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,110
the killer who killed the mason

555
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,230
has died in a fire,

556
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,770
but I

557
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,020
still wanted to investigate.

558
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,920
I once read this in the

559
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,700
miscellaneous notes.

560
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,030
There was an outlaw

561
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
called Yi Zhi Hua.

562
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,570
He murdered and stole.

563
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,970
He also liked to take the victim's teeth.

564
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,230
Then he was put on a death row.

565
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,080
That was probably after

566
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,110
the war three years ago.

567
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,070
Also!

568
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,680

00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,080
What are you doing?

576
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,790
The minister was seriously ill with a chronic ilness back then.

577
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,850
He was about to die.

578
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,310
But somehow,

579
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,910
he was cured.

580
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,390
Healer Zhao cured him?

581
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,750
It was exactly because

582
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,190
Healer Zhao couldn't cure the minister

583
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,830
so he stopped practicing medicine.

584
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,230
The person who cured the minister was called

585
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,170
Du Zixu.

586
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,720
Rumor has it that

587
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,870
Du Zixu came from outside the territory.

588
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,530
He gave the minister an elixir

589
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,400
and cured the dying minister.

590
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,110
Also,

591
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,020
not only did he cure the minister,

592
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,420
he also helped the minister age backwards.

593
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,710
Elixir...

594
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,710
Qin Wan?

595
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,780
Age backwards, Wang Zhi.

596
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,530
The rumor that the minister was cured

597
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,410
should be true.

598
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,870
It's just that

599
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,590
few people

600
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,950
met Du Zixu.

601
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,150
The time Minister was cured

602
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,230
about four years ago.

603
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,400
At that time,

604
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,990
there was no clue to the war yet.

605
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,590
Later,

606
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,270
Du Zixu was even named as an

607
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,560
immortal in the notes.

608
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,880
It's said that he went out to sea

609
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,550
and went on a trip to the immortal realm.

610
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,270
The time was also

611
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,070
after the national war three years ago.

612
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,510
Three years ago?

613
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,140
Three years ago again?

614
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,070
When I read these,

615
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:47,990
I thought

616
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,930
they were just some Shendu myths.

617
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,430
It was till...

618
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,590
The vampire case.

619
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,620
It seems

620
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,430
you also noticed that.

621
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,170
Wang Zhi was also convicted and put in death row

622
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,230
three years ago after the war.

623
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,810
Yi Zhi Hua also appeared

624
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,790
and was imprisoned at this time.

625
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,550
Du Zixu passed away at the same time too.

626
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,430
Wang Zhi.

627
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,000
If the murderer of the vampire case

628
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,070
really wants to

629
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,970
age backwards,

630
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,110
it must have something to do with Du Zixu.

631
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,770
And the butcher who died today

632
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,110
was an executioner.

633
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,510
He was also

634
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,680
a prison guard in the death row.

635
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,780
Could it be that

636
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,980
Du Zixu disappeared

637
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,510
because he was in death row?

638
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,200
That might be so.

639
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,830
Also,

640
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,970
three years ago,

641
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,710
another big thing happened.

642
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,760
The former Minister of Judicial Review,

643
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,800
also

644
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,070
our Vice Minister's father,

645
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,910
was murdered.

646
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,520
Isn't that case

647
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,530
closed long ago?

648
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,670
All the possibilities

649
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,730
we just talked about

650
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,350
were also

651
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,850
initially brushed aside.

652
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,850
Besides, rumor has it that

653
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,430
the former Minister of Judicial Review

654
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,590
was killed by a death row prisoner who escaped the prison.

655
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,920
It's personal revenge.

656
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,580
This death row prisoner

657
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,510
is still missing.

658
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,500
But given the capabilities of our Vice Minister,

659
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,490
if this prisoner

660
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,190
really wanted to take revenge on someone,

661
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,590
we would have caught him.

662
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,300
It's unbelievable.

663
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,640
This case is quite something.

664
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,270
There's the murder of his dad involved.

665
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,920
No wonder he didn't tell us about it.

666
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,780
But now we know.

667
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,230
This is not only the case of Vice Minister,

668
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,070
but also the case of the Court of Judicial Review.

669
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,510
Mr. Li.

670
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,640
Are you okay?

671
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,790
Yes.

672
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,030
Is he one of Jinwu Guards?

673
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,960
Impossible.

674
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,320
Now only I know the clue.

675
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,850
Jinwu Guards can't be faster than me.

676
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,750
So...

677
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,480
it's Yi Zhi Hua?

678
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,239
I don't think so.

679
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,830
This person arrived

680
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,840
at the 18 li stage station

681
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,670
and couldn't find any clues,

682
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,620
so he hid in the well

683
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,230
and wanted to ambush

684
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,670
those who come to look for clues after them.

685
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,330
But what I don't understand is

686
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,230
why he left

687
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,400
without fighting?

688
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
So...

689
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,949
Other than you and Jinwu Guards,

690
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,370
there are other people who know about it.

691
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,270
Three years ago,

692
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,150
something big that cannot be know to outsiders

693
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,870
must have happened in Shendu.

694
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,739
But nothing can be a secret.

695
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,909
Because these secrets

696
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:41,710
were leaked,

697
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,880
it led to

698
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,010
a series of changes.

699
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,230
Yi Zhi Hua should be

700
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,429
the biggest insider.

701
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:47,870
That's why he led us

702
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,199
to keep investigating.

703
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,960
What is his purpose?

704
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,830
Qiu Qingzhi must be involved.

705
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,360
The more one wants to hide a secret,

706
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,270
the more secrets you'd create.

707
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,160
It'd even involve more people.

708
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,410
For example, Hu Ji.

709
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,670
So Hu Ji

710
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,370
was captured by Jinwu Guards?

711
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,070
I can only try to

712
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,230
find more secrets

713
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,160
before things get worse.

714
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,470
Fortunately,

715
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,760
at least in this case,

716
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,610
we have

717
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,470
the next clue.

718
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,950
We have a clue?

719
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,550
Wh-What clue is it?

720
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,080
The sign of that stage station.

721
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,910
[Taixing]

722
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,070
Those shells are barnacles.

723
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,910
B-Barnacles?

724
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,750
Barnacles are found in the sea.

725
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,310
Why is it in the well water?

726
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,000
So I think it's a

727
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,310
hint left on purpose.

728
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:46,770
So,

729
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,750
what does the stage station

730
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,590
have to do with it?

731
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,770
There's a barnacle on that board too.

732
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,430
It probably was

733
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,510
a part of a ship

734
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,180
and was put up later on.

735
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,710
When a sea ship has travelled in the waters for long,

736
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,790
the ship's body will be filled with barnacles.

737
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,070
That board is a clue.

738
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,820
[Taixing]

739
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,060
So now,

740
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,790
we have to look for that boat

741
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,120
called Taixing.

742
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,020
God it.

743
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,990
We have no idea what Vice Minister is investigating,

744
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,360
and how he is investigating.

745
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,310
But since Jinwu Guards

746
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,390
are also investigating this,

747
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,510
we can just follow them.

748
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,610
I'm good at this.

749
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,470
If Du Zixu and his men

750
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,830
are all in the death row,

751
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,670
in order to cover this up,

752
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,430
someone must have

753
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,090
replaced relevant dossiers.

754
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:32,940
But death row

755
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,350
can't be easily entered.

756
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,390
All prisoners

757
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,890
have a record in the Court of Judicial Review.

758
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,090
There must be traces.

759
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,510
However,

760
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,910
to eliminate them one by one

761
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,370
would be a little complex.

762
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,220
Leave it to me.

763
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,350
Let me remind you.

764
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,190
This thing

765
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,620
might go very deep.

00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,350
You looked suspicious

00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,470
Without your Vice Minister Li around,

778
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,790
you're not working on cases anymore?

779
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,590
We have a case?

780
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,690
It's not a big case.

781
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,040
But we need a few people to help.

Before Vice Minister Li left,

787
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,800
he gave us a mission.

788
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,190
What mission is it?

789
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,950
Wang Qi,

790
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,290

The board is full of barnacles.

00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,520
It must be under the water line.

we should keep a distance?

To talk about it,

857
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,530
it's not a big deal.

858

It's just a little strange.

859
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,190
What is it?

860
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
Here's the thing.

861
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,590
People in our line of business

862
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,970
rarely go out.

863

When we're free,

864
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,830
we can only lean on the window

865
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,670
and look out

866
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,380
to entertain ourselves.

867
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,330
Because we always do this,

868
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,640
we tend to notice some things.

869
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,030
What is it?

870
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,030
Pigeon.

871
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,580
Pigeon?

872
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,760
Every morning and evening,

873
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,130
a group of pigeons will fly past here.

874
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,310
They fly freely.

875
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,790
I envy them.

876
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,580
After watching it for a long time,

877
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,350
it has become something

878
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,800
I look forward to everyday.

879
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,200
When the pigeon is not around when it rains,

880
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,040
I feel

881
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,580
empty.

882
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,160
Do you understand, officer?

883
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,710
You... You're not done talking.

884
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,560
Don't look at me. Go on.

885
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,230
One day,

886
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,690
I opened the window.

00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,860
There was

888
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,950
a dead pigeon on the window.

889
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,110
I think it was killed by a cat.

890
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,310
I was shocked.

891
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,660
I didn't know what to do.

892
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,430
I dare not touch it.

893
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,790
I was about to call for help.

894
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,670
Then I suddenly saw that

895
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,940
there was something tied

896
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,450
to the pigeon's leg.
