to work with Vice Minister Shangguan.

11
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,630
Shouldn't we

00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,000
please feel free to ask.

66
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,520

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,390
Probably...

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,820
at noontime yesterday?

75
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,700
No.

76
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,080
The store was closed

77
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,410
after noon yesterday.

78
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,100

79
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,670
Boss.

80
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,110
Is anyone collecting

81
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,970
the remaining crushed ice today?

82
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,270
Looks like

83
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,600
no one wants it today.

84
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,380
What a pity.

85
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,290
Just clear it.

86
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:21,910
Okay.

87
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:22,900
Wait.

88
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,190
Madam, please wait.

89
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,630
Let me just ask a few more questions.

90
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,110
Boss,

91
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,990
what is this crushed ice?

92
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,110
Sir,

93
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,390
smaller-sized ice

94
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,660
is sold by the barrel.

95
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,590
Once the barrel is opened,

96
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,320
the whole barrel has to be sold.

97
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,560
Otherwise, there won't be enough ice

98
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,890
for it to even melt.

99
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,070
So those who want to buy ice,

100
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,470
have to place an order in advance.

101
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,909
When we have gathered enough orders for a barrel,

102
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,790
we'll then make a barrel of ice.

103
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,990
But,

104
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,630
this is just the general idea.

105
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,890
There are also some ice

106
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,310
that's left behind.

107
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,510
The gritty, leftover ice

108
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,630
is crushed ice.

109
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,590
I heard that shop assistant mention that

110
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,550
someone actually bought the crushed ice?

111
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,750
As for the crushed ice,

112
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,110
I'll usually sell it for cheap.

113
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,980
Some will wait for this good deal.

114
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,710
Did anyone

115
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,560
bought crushed ice yesterday?

116
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,560
Yes.

117
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,230
An umbrella maker named Du Cheng.

118
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,290
An umbrella maker?

119
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,400
Why would an umbrella maker need ice?

120
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,870
Officer,

121
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,110
he's a drug addict.

122
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,270
Drug?

123
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,520
It's Five Minerals Powder.

124
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,870
Thank you, Boss.

125
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,630
Thank you, Sir.

126
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:00,860

Lord Qin.

130
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,430
Greetings, Lord Qin.

132
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,750
Sir, are you here for the matter regarding Qin Wan?

133
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,840
My condolences, Lord Qin.

134
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,590
That wouldn't be necessary.

135
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,480
Qin Wan

136
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,159
was evicted from this house,

137
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,090
and had nothing to do with us anymore.

138
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,150
He was no longer a member of my family.

139
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,750
Even if he

140
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,420
stirred up trouble outside,

141
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,350
caused disorder, or lost his life,

142
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,210
it's his own business.

143
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,690
Feel free to investigate it, Sir.

144
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,230
But for myself,

145
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,370
I have nothing else to say.

146
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,310
In that case...

147
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,440
Anything else, Sir?

148
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,020
None.

149
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,910
I'll be back if I have to.

150
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,260
Uncle Wu.

151
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,310
Yes, Sir.

153
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,470

155
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,190
Please.

156
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,040
Uncle Wu.

157
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,530
You look rather worried.

158
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,830
Is something bothering you?

159
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,950
Nothing.

160
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,570
We are here today

161
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,390
to investigate the matter regarding Second Young Master Qin.

162
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:06,790
So...

163
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,960
So do you know

164
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,630
who killed Second Young Master?

165
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,030
We’re investigating it.

166
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,670
Uncle Wu, if it’s convenient for you,

167
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,670
can we have a chat?

168
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,070
This place is remote.

169
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,300
What do you want to ask?

170
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,240
Please tell me.

171
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,110
However,

172
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,920
I still have work to do back at the mansion.

173
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,160
Don’t worry, Uncle Wu.

174
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,220
It won’t take long.

175
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,480
We just want to know

176
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,910
what kind of person

177
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,190
was Second Young Master Qin.

178
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,190
Why was he evicted from the Qin Mansion?

179
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,150
I have watched

180
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,430
Second Young Master since he was a child.

181
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,050
Who would have thought...

182
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,470
My Lord wanted

183
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,380
Second Young Master to be successful.

184
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,710
But Second Young Master

185
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,580
has been weak since he was a child.

186
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,830
He didn't like to study,

187
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,160
and only enjoyed music.

188
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,140
To help him improve,

189
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,150
my Lord

190
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,940
went a little stricter on him.

191
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,700
But the stricter my Lord was,

192
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,070
the more scared Second Young Master became,

193
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,990
and he retreated into himself even more.

194
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,320
Not only did he not improve in his studies,

195
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,580
but he also developed

196
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,510
a habit of stammering.

197
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,510
What?

198
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,730
What illness is that?

199
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,600
It's...

200
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,300
stutter.

201
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,810
Because of that,

202
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,120
he got more shameful.

203
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,580
My Lord

204
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,380
gradually gave up

205
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,210
and let him be.

206
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,490
But later on,

207
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,950
Second Young Master

208
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,810
suddenly got his vitality back,

209
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,380
became more energetic,

210
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,100
and could even study.

211
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,380
Everyone thought

212
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,690
Second Young Master had finally come to his senses.

213
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,350
My Lord was also very pleased.

214
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,480
So he recommended Second Young Master to join the Imperial College,

215
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,400
and even asked the Minister of Rites

216
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,630
to be his referee,

217
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,120
by bringing Second Young Master to pay his respects personally.

218
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,320
But not long after that visit,

219
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,480
my Lord drove Second Young Master

220
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,930
out of the house.

221
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,700
He said that Second Young Master

222
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,710
made a fool of himself at other people's place.

223
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,590
He overdosed.

224
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,870
Only then did my Lord know

225
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,980
Second Young Master

226
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,490
was taking Five Minerals Powder secretly.

227
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,660
All the previous signs

228
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,820
were the result of consuming the drug.

229
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,490
My Lord is a Chancellor

230
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,230
who is in charge of the Imperial College.

231
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,870
One's morality and conduct becomes one's dignity.

232
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,980
After that happened,

233
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,740
it led to...

234
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,670
So what exactly was the scandal

235
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,110
in the past?

236
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,940
Well that...

237
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,340
I don't know.

238
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,590
Then, did you meet with

239
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,920
Second Young Master Qin

240
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,140
after he got kicked out?

241
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,230
I snuck out to see him a couple times.

242
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,470
Poor thing.

243
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,860
After all,

244
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,840
Second Young Master was from a respectable family.

245
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,990
He had nothing to worry about

246
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,510
since he was a child.

247
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,590
But after being kicked out of the mansion,

248
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,930
he went to live in some desolate courtyard,

249
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,630
and had no servant with him.

250
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,150
He was a total mess,

251
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,990
and was in extreme despair.

252
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,710
And without the constraints of his family,

253
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,170
his character became even more outrageous.

254
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,470
He didn't quit consuming the drug either.

255
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,750
To be frank,

256
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,430
he became a complete freak.

257
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,200
Who is it?

258
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,070
Second Young Master.

259
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,990
It's me.

260
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,110
I'm here to see you.

261
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,200
Second Young Master.

262
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,100
Young Master?

263
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,270
You...

264
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,390
called me?

265
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,570
I don't deserve it.

266
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,240
Why are you like this?

267
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,730
Young Master,

268
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,000
are you still taking drugs?

269
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,790
Stop taking it.

270
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,770
It's bad for your health.

271
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,350
Get lost!

272
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:09,990
Leave me alone.

273
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,300
Young Master.

274
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,070
Get out!

275
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,710
Young Master.

276
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,600
Get lost!

277
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,200
It's a pity.

278
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,120
Second Young Master

279
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,500
could not quit the Five-Food Powder.

280
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,110
Otherwise,

281
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,670
my Lord might have

282
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,330
allowed him home.

283
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,990
He wouldn't have

284
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,430
died such a tragic death.

285
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,320
Cui Bei,

286
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,590
didn't you often come in first in exams

287
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,570
when you were at Imperial College?

288
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,510
How about

289
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,020
you interrogate him?

290
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,690
I'm not good at interrogating.

291
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,230
I'll wait for you outside.

292
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,520
Don't you want to see your classmates?

293
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,140
I'll just wait here.

294
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,160
Let's go.

295
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,790
Today's schoolwork is just too much.

296
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,310
Yes.

297
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,200
Actually it wasn't so bad today, right?

298
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,510
Let's go.

299
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,710
I found today's lesson really difficult.

300
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,650
We are from the Court of Judicial Review.

301
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,310
I have a few questions for you.

302
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,830
Do you know Qin Wan?

303
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,120
Qin Wan?

304
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,230
He's the younger brother of the Chancellor, right?

305
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,950
I know.

306
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,950
I don't remember much about him,

307
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,370
besides the fact that he stutters.

308
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,190
Didn't he get married after dropping out?

309
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,070
He died?

310
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Who told you that?

311
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,720
What stone?

312
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,750
I actually met him

313
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,080
on the streets later on.

314
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,260
He changed a lot.

315
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,520
He wasn't stuttering anymore.

316
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,110
I was wondering what happened.

317
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,190
That I don't know.

318
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,820
I don't know.

319
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,390
Stop asking.

320
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,040
Court of Judicial Review?

321
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,230
Are you guys

322
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,850
here with Cui Bei?

323
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,110
Let's go.

324
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,550
Hurry.

325
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,210
No wonder

326
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,960
Cui Bei could rank first when he was here.

327
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,490
Come to think of it,

328
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,890
he seems to be the smartest

329
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,150
and most normal in the Imperial College.

330
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,740
Qin Wan?

331
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,020
I didn't expect...

332
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,150
I really didn't expect that.

333
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,250
When Qin Wan was studying here

334
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,650
at the Imperial College,

335
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,640
what was he like?

336
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:12,840
Well...

337
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,170
We understand that Qin Shu, Lord Qin,

338
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,550
is your boss.

339
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,470
It might be inconvenient for you to speak.

340
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,320
But not to worry.

341
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,870
We

342
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,110
will definitely keep it a secret.

343
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,430
Yes.

344
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,690
Just tell us the truth.

345
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,210
Speaking of Qin Wan...

346
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,750
How should I put it?

347
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,190
Besides the lack of aptitude,

348
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,000
he's good in other aspects.

349
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,620
He's calm and collected by nature,

350
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,950
even though he may not be very sociable.

351
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,870
This was also probably

352
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,670
owing to Lord Qin's discipline.

353
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,470
Did Qin Wan consume drugs

354
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,950
while he was here?

355
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,850
Drugs?

356
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,040
What are you talking about?

357
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,470
Firstly,

358
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,510
what kind of place is the Imperial College?

359
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,310
We would never tolerate such behaviour.

360
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,910
Secondly,

361
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,930
Qin Wan is Lord Qin's younger brother.

362
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,710
How dare he?

363
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,650
Going by what you said,

364
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,470
Qin Wan seems like

365
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,800
a really boring person.

366
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,800
That's not true either.

367
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,800
What do you mean?

368
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,630
Qin Wan

369
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,910
isn't the kind to show off himself.

370
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,200
There was once

371
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,960
I came back for a private matter

372
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,580
on my day off.

373
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,430
I came across someone playing the qin

374
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,470
from the library.

375
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,830
How was Qin Wan's playing?

376
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,600
It was very good.

377
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,390
It sounded smooth and clear,

378
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,950
like water flowing through the mountains on a clear night.

379
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,280
It just sounded very slightly depressed.

380
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,780
It was completely different

381
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,580
from his previous personality.

382
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,230
Sir,

383
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,400
do you know why Qin Wan dropped out?

384
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,290
Well...

385
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,600
It's inconvenient for me to talk about this.

386
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,220

Why would an umbrella maker

use a box made from sandalwood

What's that got to do with the Academy?

505
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,550
I saw the painting he was working on before he died.

509
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,030
Indeed,

510
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,370

512
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,310
According to the dossier,

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,470
and his hands were crippled too.

517
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,870
He could no longer paint,

518
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,640
so he was forced to leave the Academy.

519
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,710
I observed the paintings

520
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,070

521
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,030
They were weak,

522
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,200
dull, and withered.

523
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,170
It fits the story of his injuries.

524
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,990
But...

525
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,590
The painting he worked on right before he died

526
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,920
was totally different.

527
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,270
It's even better than the paintings he drew

528
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,530
before he got injured.

529
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,920
How could this happen?

530
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,950

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,200
he overdosed on

533
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,570
It makes sense to surmise that he overdosed.

534

But I've never heard that

535
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,580

Isn't this just like a magic pill?

Regardless of whether it was

the effect of Five Minerals Powder,

00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,450

A person with no strength in his hands

545
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,670

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,910
on Qin Wan.

548
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,710
In that case,

549
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,550
it means there's an accomplice.

550

558
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,210
I heard from the Qin family's housekeeper that

Qin Wan likes to play the qin?

563
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,910
When we were investigating the case at the Imperial College,

564
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,990
the teacher mentioned about this too.

565
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,150
That makes this moneylender

566
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,150
very suspicious.

567
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,310
If this qin

568
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,350
is very valuable,

569
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,880
the loan shark

570
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,670
may have eyed the qin for money.

571
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,990
He then colluded with Du Cheng,

572
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,920
and killed Qin Wan for his fortune.

573
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,190
I'll check it out.

574
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,890
None of you are to follow me.

575
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,410
I'm talking about you.

576
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,230
I...

577
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,390
Come on.

578
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,640
Go!

579
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,630
Hurry and go!

580
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,180
But...

581
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,390
Vice Minister Shangguan said no one should follow her.

582
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,830
Hurry!

583
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,470
She was talking about Hu Si.

584
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,230
Alibaba.

585
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,770
If you don't go now,

586
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,860
when will you go?

587
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,120
Sir has already given his order. Hurry up.

588
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,070
-That makes sense.
-Go.

589
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,430
Hurry up. Go.

590
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,610
Is that what it means

591
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,190
when we say a noble person

592
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,370
is pursuing his virtuous maiden?

593
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,390
By the way, Sir,

594
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,250
that teacher also mentioned that

595
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,030
if we want to know more about Qin Wan,

596
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,360
we should find the Minister of Rites.

597
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,510
We'll investigate that now.

598
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,370
Okay, go ahead.

599
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,550
Yes.

600
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,550
Mr. Li,

601
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,310
what about us?

602
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,730
With a stroke of the hand,

603
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,790
the sound resonates like a bell.

604
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,390
Why are you reciting poems?

605
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:13,630
No.

606
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,610
Qin Wan's upbringing was very strict.

607
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,750
His only pastime and hobby

608
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,880
was playing the qin.

609
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,020
Who was he playing for?

610
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,000
You mean...

611
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,770
One more thing.

612
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,960
When we were at Qin Mansion,

613
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,990
the housekeeper told us that

614
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,430
after Qin Wan was evicted,

615
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,090
he lived somewhere desolate.

616
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,510
But the last time we went there,

617
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,440
it was clear that

618
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,520
the yard was once vibrant and lively.

619
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,340
Would an evicted junkie

620
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,870
have the heart to take care of the yard?

621
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,600
This doesn't make sense at all.

622
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:42,920
One more thing.

623
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,030
This is the residual of the Five Minerals Powder.

624
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,660
It's the same as the one found at Qin Wan's place.

625
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,520
Well...

626
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,020
It seems we need to find someone

627
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,640
to figure this out.

628
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,160
Thank you, Sir.

629
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,100
It's okay. Just pay for the food.

630
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,760
Take it.

631
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,380
Young man,

632
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,320
be bold when you're in love.

633
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,590
Don't be sneaky.

634
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,340
Don't worry.

635
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,850
The principal sum was 2.7 taels.

636
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,380
The interest was 3 percent.

637
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,290
The period was six months.

638
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,750
The total interest payable is 4.8 taels.

639
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,140
You don't even have enough to pay for the interest.

640
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,000
How about this?

641
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,330
Don't you have

642
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,780
two acres of land?

643
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,840
I don't want your land.

644
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,890
You...

645
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,660
give me your income from the second half of the year.

646
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,030
I'll consider charging you only 3 and a half month's worth of interest.

647
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:07,790
What do you think?

648
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,650
Think about it.

649
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:09,870
Okay.

650
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,350
Let me know as soon as possible.

651
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:14,830
Okay.

652
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,810
Are you Liu Yaoshi?

653
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,510
Yes.

654
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,720
Madam,

655
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,770
how can I help you?

656
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,230
Are you here to pawn or borrow money?

657
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,320
Was this IOU

658
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,780
issued by you?

659
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,150
What's going on?

660
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,790
Qin Wan and Du Cheng are already dead.

661
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,180
I didn't expect that.

662
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,550
What?

663
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,130
You think I killed someone?

664
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,140
That's not necessary.

665
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,580
To be honest,

666
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,690
in this line of business,

667
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,200
Madam,

668
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,650
we can only get our money back from the living.

669
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,710
How are we going to get our money back from the dead?

670
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,420
Besides,

671
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,870
the things that they put down as collateral

672
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,130
is even more peculiar.

673
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,540
What is it?

674
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,620
Could it be...

675
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,150
a qin?

676
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,230
Madam, you want to know what happened?

677
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,430
Say it.

678
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,150
I will,

679
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,570
but not in vain.

680
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,830
Well...

681
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,900
Madam,

682
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,870
you have to show some appreciation.

683
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,270
A token of appreciation?

684
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,010
You want money from me?

685
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,840
How refreshing.

686
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,990
This matter is important to you, right?

687
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,470
As long as something is important,

688
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,670
it becomes valuable.

689
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,390
There's no reason for me to share without anything in return.

690
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,400
Let me tell you.

691
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,940
I am a Vice Minister at the Court of Judicial Review.

692
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,030
The collateral you have

693
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,430
is related to the murder.

694
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,080
It could be very important evidence.

695
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,830
You're supposed to help the Court of Judicial Review solve the case.

696
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,890
Do you understand?

697
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,920
Yes.

698
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,220
The murder case

699
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,190
has nothing to do with me.

700
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,400
I'm just...

701
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,960
a legitimate businessman.

702
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:14,870
I'm a businessman

703
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,270
who knows nothing.

704
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,500
That's not illegal, is it?

705
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,030
You...

706
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,430
Help!

707
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,550
This Vice Minister from the Court of Judicial Review wants to hit me!

708
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,800
What are you doing?

709
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,230
Madam!

710
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,650
-I’ll tell you if you pay.
-Are you crazy?

711
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,190
Let go!

712
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:28,680
Let go of me!

713
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,390
Why should I share if you don't want to pay me?

714
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,460
Just you wait.

715
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,900
How stingy!

716
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,400
Move.

717
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,280
My distinguished customers,

718
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,940
do you want to pawn or borrow money?

719
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,810
This is outrageous.

720
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,440
If I hadn't left in a hurry

721
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,200
without money,

722
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,660
I wouldn't have to tolerate such behaviour.

723
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,160
Madam, wait!

724
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,510
Madam!

725
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,100
What are you doing?

726
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:09,620
I didn't recognize you.

727
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,420
I was being oblivious.

728
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,670
I am not a human.

729
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,870
I am a villain.

730
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,060
I'm a bastard.

731
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,110
I'm a little bastard.

732
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,770
Get up first.

733
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,750
I'm a rascal.

734
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,290
What are you doing? Get up!

735
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,110
I will kneel here

736
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,270
and apologize to you, Madam.

737
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,290
I am a bastard.

738
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,700
I am just a piece of shit.

739
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,920
To be honest,

740
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,820
he did put down a qin as collateral.

741
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,060
But yesterday,

742
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,950
it was redeemed

743
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,060
by a woman.

744
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,110
It was redeemed?

745
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,590
I have no idea

746
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,230
what happened next.

747
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:41,960
But,

748
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,910
that woman left a tassel.

749
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,430
Where is it?

750
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,580
A tassel?

751
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,040
Is this it?

752
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,120
I dropped it on the way.

753
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,090
Madam, please have a look.

754
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,150
This was the thing

755
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:56,950
left behind by that woman.

756
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,280
I kept it away secretly.

757
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,810
Madam.

758
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,150
Please don't be angry anymore.

759
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,020
Get up and talk.

760
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,750
Madam, then...

761
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,260
I shall leave now.

762
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,530
I will get lost.

763
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,290
Please forgive me.

764
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,050
I'll get lost.

765
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,910
I'll get lost.

766
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,970
Come on.

767
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,110
Let's go.

768
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,630
Yes.

769
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,220
What is this place, Mr. Li?

770
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,910
What a rare guest.

771
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,930
I'm taking you to meet an informant.

772
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,510
An informant?

773
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,230
Okay.

774
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,750
He is...

775
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,720
My...

776
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,100
My name is Chen Shi.

777
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,230
It's okay for him

778
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,630
to know all of my matters.

779
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,950
Don't worry.

780
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:18,790
What is it?

781
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,340
Do you know what this is?

782
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,350
Where did you get this from?

783
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,390
You tell me first.

784
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,720
Do you know what this is?

785
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,240
Except for the fact that it's missing its guiding drug,

786
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,920
this is Du Zixu's prescription.

787
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,480
It's very similar.

788
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,390
Guiding drug?

789
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,470
Isn't that the thing

790
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,330
you were looking for previously?

791
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,290
Lord Qin.

792
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,400
His family is pretty unfortunate.

793
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,590
Sir,

794
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,600
we are here to ask you

795
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,690
if it's true that Lord Qin came to you

796
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,720
and asked you

797
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,160
to be Qin Wan's referee?

798
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:04,410
Yes.

799
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,580
Sir,

800
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,980
we want to know

801
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,250
what happened on that day

802
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,050
when he came to pay his respects.

803
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,470
Well...

804
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,610
We look forward to your guidance, Sir.

805
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,560
Fine.

806
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,690
Speaking of which,

807
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,710
it was really quite a mess.

808
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,630
That day,

809
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,610
Lord Qin brought Qin Wan over.

810
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,190
If we went by the rules,

811
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,630
there should have been an exam.

812
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,810
It was an interview,

813
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,750
where I asked him about his regular homework,

814
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,480
and evaluated his upbringing.

815
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,260
As the saying goes,

816
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,100
only those who are deserving gets the chance.

817
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,360
But Qin Wan

818
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,090
seemed very nervous.

819
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,310
He was stuttering.

820
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,470
It took him very long to give a single answer.

821
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,070
It was really awkward.

822
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,250
Lord Qin

823
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,990
also looked extra terrible.

824
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,150
Seeing that he seemed so unsure,

825
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,730
I didn't ask anymore.

826
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,360
But Lord Qin insisted.

827
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,540
He insisted that Qin Wan recite

828
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,630
an essay he had memorized

829
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,470
to me.

830
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,090
Seeing his insistence,

831
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,790
I didn't say anything either.

832
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,970
But after Qin Wan

833
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,460
heard Lord Qin's request,

834
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,420
he went out to do something.

835
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,469
What did he do?

836
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,469
He asked to use the bathroom

837
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,800
as an excuse to step out.

838
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,270
He took the chance to go into hiding?

839
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,840
No.

840
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,830
After he came back,

841
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,530
Qin Wan looked totally different.

842
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,860
He looked very excited,

843
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,710
and wasn't cowering anymore.

844
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,530
I'll recite.

845
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,080
It was as if someone passed by in the corner of that mountain,

846
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,540
clad in a bed of flowers.

847
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,230
How beautifully you gazed with affection and smiled coquettishly,

848
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,870
as I envied your grace and poise.

849
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,600
Ridiculous!

850
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,429
Is this

851
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,620
what I asked you to recite?

852
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:55,920
I...

853
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,520
I am in a secluded bamboo grove

854
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,800
where I don't see the light of day.

855
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,030
The road is treacherous,

856
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,560
and I am here all alone.

857
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,770
People of the mountains

858
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,430
are like fragrant herbs,

859
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,470
who drinks from the mouth of the rocky springs,

860
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,100
and seek cover among the pines.

861
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,870
That day,

862
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,100
he was reciting "The Mountain Spirit".

863
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,560
He recited the whole passage in a mess.

864
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,780
Anyone could tell something was wrong.

865
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,910
But he seemed to be oblivious.

866
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,220
I didn't know how to end it nicely.

867
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,220
At this moment...

868
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,870
Qin Wan!

869
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,100
I picked some life-enhancing herbs

870
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,560
from among the mountains.

871
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,890
but it was rocky...

872
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,630
Sir,

873
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,090
what exactly happened to him?

874
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,470
He...

875
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,450
He was incontinent.

876
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,830
What? Incontinent?

877
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:50,450
Incontinent?

878
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,050
If it weren't for the murder,

879
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,070
I would never

880
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,420
tell anyone about this.

881
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,260
Lord Qin is too prideful.

882
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,040
And he was overly strict

883
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,570
when disciplining Qin Wan.

884
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:00,930
I'm afraid

885
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,050
he might've been a little too strict.

886
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,310
At that time,

887
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,550
do you think he might have taken Five Minerals Powder?

888
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,810
Now to think of it,

889
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,150
I think he did.

890
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,700
However,

891
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
I thought they could

892
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,770
bury the hatchet.

893
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,690
Sir, why do you say that?

894
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,560
A month ago,

895
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,160
Qin Wan came to see me.

896
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,250
What was he like

897
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,730
when he came to you?

898
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,190
He looked normal.

899
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,440
Although he was still stuttering,

900
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,910
he seemed more magnanimous.

901
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,830
He also said

902
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,520
he was no longer taking drugs.

903
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,290
He wanted me to be a middleman

904
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,110
and asked me to speak to Lord Qin,

905
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,840
so that he can return home soon.

906
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,160
I was

907
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,630
actually happy to help.

908
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,310
Does that mean

909
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,230
the two brothers

910
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,760
actually met again?

911
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,380
Yes.

912
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,560
But now that I think about it,

913
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,060
I think Lord Qin didn't agree

914
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,610
to let Qin Wan return home.

915
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,700
What is the guiding drug?

916
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,790
I don't know.

917
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,150
Almost no one knows.

918
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,090
But it's the key.

919
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,900
Without it,

920
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,620
it becomes Five Minerals Powder.

921
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,660
Only with it,

922
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,810
it becomes Du Zixu's magic medicine.

923
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,260
It is said

924
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,800
to be the bone of an animal.

925
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,650
It has an incredible effect.

926
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,750
Can it enable

927
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,190
a person with crippled hands

928
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,520
pick up the brush again?

929
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,460
I think so.

930
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,110
Where did you get this bottle of medicine?

931
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,570
From the place of a junkie.

932
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,510
Where is he?

933
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,310
He's dead.

934
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,030
Then his death

935
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,380
must be related to the making of this drug.

936
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,030
You don't know how many people

937
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,530
tried to crack Du Zixu's prescription,

938
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,930
but no one has succeeded.

939
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,230
What you brought

940
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,320
is the closest

941
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,230
I've ever seen.

942
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,100
Why are you looking for this medicine?

943
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,360
Is it for money

944
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,530
or for treatment?

945
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,900
It's not for anti-aging purposes, right?

946
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,710
Currently, this drug

947
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,240
has caused too many deaths.

948
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,430
You have to give me

949
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,960
a reasonable explanation.

950
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,350
I don't want to have to ask you

951
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,410
to come to the Court of Judicial Review.

952
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,140
Sir, you don't have to scare me.

953
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,670
I can tell you.

954
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,670
I'm looking for

955
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,550
my father's murderer.

956
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,390
My father had a boat.

957
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,930
He picked up odd jobs

958
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,010
from time to time.

959
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,020
For example?

960
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,220
For example, transporting

961
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,020
things or people that aren't all that legitimate.

962
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,020
Three years ago,

963
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,830
he took up this job

964
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,270
where he had to pick up just one person.

965
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,910
Then, he was killed

966
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,370
along with the passenger.

967
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,430
And that passenger

968
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,920
was Du Zixu.

969
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,510
I see.

970
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,350
Then why have you been

971
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,810
investigating Yi Zhi Hua?

972
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,100
Because he and Du Zixu

973
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,100
were previously in the same prison.

974
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,660
Well then, Vice Minister Li, what are you investigating?

975
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,470
A case that

976
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,390
my late father had previously solved,

977
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,050
and shares many similarities

978
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,430
with the matter you are looking into.

979
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,510
Don't mention it, Vice Minister Li.

980
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,280
I'm telling you this

981
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,110
because I trust your abilities.

982
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,710
If you find out the murderer,

983
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,450
or find that thing...

984
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,710
I'll let you know right away.

Anyone there?

988
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,610
Just thinking about it makes me sad.

989
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,490
What must he have been driven to

990
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,920
in order to wet his pants?

If you don't like it,

992
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,320
just don't do it.

993
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,810
It's not that simple.

994
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,540
Human nature is divided into those who are strong, and those who are weak.

995
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,350
Some people just like to

996
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,230
impose their standards

997
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,180
onto others.

998
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:16,890
There are also some

999
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,890
who would compromise without a second thought.

1000
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,190
They wouldn't even think that those who are stronger could be wrong.

1001
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,050
Instead, they blame themselves.

1002
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,550
It's not something that happens overnight.

1003
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,350
Qin Wan was disciplined strictly

1004
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,790
by his brother ever since he was a child.

1005
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,390
His personality was already deformed.

1006
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,070
That's why

1007
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,360
he turned to drugs.

1008
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,480
Wang Qi, you said that

1009
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,990
after Qin Wan was evicted,

1010
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,180
he actually went to find

1011
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,390
the Minister of Rites once more.

1012
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,750
He looked normal back then,

1013
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,290
and he said he was no longer taking drugs?

1014
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:45,770
Yes.

1015
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,370
It must be very hard

1016
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,970
for a drug addict to quit.

1017
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,230
If we go with what Cui Bei mentioned,

1018
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,010
where he took the drug

1019
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,750
because of the stress he received as a result of his deformed character,

1020
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,550
and needed the drug to destress,

1021
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,190
that's a mental illness.

1022
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,900
If that was not cured,

1023
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,270
how could he have broken free from his addiction?

1024
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,510
I think so too.

1025
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,230
Maybe...

1026
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,390
Qin Wan was lying?

1027
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,830
Not necessarily.
