1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,750
Before enlightenment, nobody knew there was a tree.

3
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,950
A clear mirror is not a stage either.

4
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,070
If you have something in mind,

5
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,470
the divinatory sign will come naturally.

6
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,789
Start the divination.

7
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,480
Yang.

8
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,590
Yin.

9
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,280
It's a done deal.

10
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,930
The officials are here.

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,360
Sir.

12
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,120
No.

13
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,360
Why are you...

14
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,960
Mr. Yuan, calm down.

15
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,870
Our Vice Minister

16
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,730
just wanted to ask you something.

17
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,070
What is it?

18
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,680
Cui Bei.

19
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,700
Cui Bei?

20
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
Did Cui Bei from the Court of Judicial Review's Mingjing Hall

21
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
came to see you?

22
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,070
I just

23
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,150
briefly read his fortune.

24
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,630
His

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
Ba-Zi is very unique.

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,680
His life is filled with inauspicious influence,

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,160
hence his luck has never been good.

28
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,710
I think you're talking nonsense.

29
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,970
This stall of yours...

30
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,470
S-Sir.

31
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,920
I haven't finished yet.

32
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,010
At that time,

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,160
I told the officer that

34
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,630
there's something unlucky

35
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,120
in everyone's destiny.

36
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,930
I was just comforting him.

37
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,120
But he insisted that

38
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,120
he felt especially unlucky on the day of Qing Ming.

39
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,240
He asked me if I had a solution.

40
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,120
How did you advise him to resolve it?

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,240
I had advised him that

42
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,910
it would be better to stay away from the crowds

43
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,510
on that day during Qing Ming,

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,000
and go to a place where there's a lot of yin.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,590
For example, if he goes to the north side of the mountain,

46
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,590
he will be able to pass the day peacefully.

47
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,400
Actually,

48
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,800
after staying in the house for a long time,

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,930
we should all go out for some fresh air.

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,840
So, you're the reason

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,630
Cui Bei ran away.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Officer, officer.

53
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,680
Actually,

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,560
most of the time when people come to ask for divination,

55
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,400
it doesn't necessarily mean

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,870
they need a solution.

57
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,630
They know

58
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,800
there is no real solution.

59
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,360
Yes.

60
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,470
They are just seeking some comfort.

61
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,030
I...

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,310
I'm helping them.

63
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,120
I get it. You just spew nonsense,

64
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,710
and sweet talk your way through.

65
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,590
You are an officer,

66
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,520
but you're talking in circles.

67
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,910
He's praising me.

68
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,360
It turns out

69
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,210
he deliberately avoided us during Qing Ming

70
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
because he didn't want to affect us.

71
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,800
No wonder he left

72
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,240
without even greeting us.

73
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,310
Have we been ungrateful,

74
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,080
so he betrayed and abandoned us?

75
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,210
How disappointing.

76
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,690
So disappointing indeed.

77
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,830
Cui Bei must have a reason.

78
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,230
Otherwise, why does he only care about Qing Ming?

79
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,750
Did something

80
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,610
happen before?

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,310
Let's go find Mr. Cui.

82
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,779
Since he's hiding,

83
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,950
we just have to go out and find him,

84
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,630
isn't it?

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,190
It's easier said than done.

86
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,480
Where are we going to find him?

87
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,390
We are the face of the Court of Judicial Review,

88
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,800
and elite soldiers of Mingjing Hall.

89
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,430
Even the most vicious prisoners

90
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,720
can't escape from us,

91
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,560
let alone

92
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,430
a small Cui Bei.

93
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,040
With our Vice Minister,

94
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
it's like having one Zhuge Liang

95
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,500
and four stinky cobblers.

96
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,560
Well then...

97
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,690
Hurry up and search.

98
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,600
Okay, let's go.

99
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
Take a look if there's any clues.

100
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,430
Check the top of the bookshelf.

101
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes, Sir.

102
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,830
Chen Shi,

103
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,680
what else is in his cabinet?

104
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,970
In the middle...

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,860
Vice Minister,

106
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,800
you've really hit the jackpot.

107
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,690
He only mentioned going to the mountains,

108
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,150
but he didn't tell us which mountain it was.

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,760
We didn't ask him either.

110
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,190
He took two sets of clothes

111
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,160
and packed a bag.

112
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,180
Was he planning to spend the night there?

113
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,760
Last year, he also came back

114
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,120
only after Qing Ming.

115
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,800
I remembered

116
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,040
when he came back,

117
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,860
his boots were wet.

118
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,870
They must have been stained by the morning dew.

119
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,360
There aren't many places you can go on foot

120
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,870
within one day and night.

121
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,810
Tianchi Mountain!

122
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,990
Vice Minister Li.

123
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,320
What is it?

124
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Vice Minister Li,

125
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,600
I know today is supposed to be your off day,

126
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,630
and I shouldn't be troubling you

127
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,920
with chasing a fugitive.

128
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,600
But the fugitive

129
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
has escaped into the mountains.

130
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,680
Vice Minister Shangguan

131
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,000
is currently not in office either.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,630
So,

133
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,430
I still need you to give an order,

134
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,630
so that we can search the mountains.

135
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,190
Where did the fugitive come from?

136
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,990
A few days ago,

137
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,430
somehow,

138
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,190
there was a thunderbolt on a sunny day.

139
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,630
The prison wing of the Ministry of Justice then collapsed.

140
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,630
Many important criminals escaped.

141
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,640
What happened?

142
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,190
It's thundering?

143
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,250
What's that sound?

144
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,390
But most of them

145
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,680
have been arrested.

146
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,680
Only one has been on the run.

147
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,920
What crimes did he commit before?

148
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,080
He's a robber

149
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,680
and a bandit.

150
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
He had robbed a lot of official silver.

151
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,210
and killed many officials.

152
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,390
But we still haven't found

153
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,390
the stolen goods,

154
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,920
and there were no sign of any accomplices.

155
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,040
That's why he's been imprisoned all this time.

156
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,070
Since he is a fugitive, we should arrest him

157
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,200
as soon as possible.

158
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,800
Yes, Sir.

159
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,830
Wait.

160
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,070
Yes, Vice Minister?

161
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,190
You mentioned that the fugitive went up the mountains.

162
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,450
Which mountain was it?

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,390
Tianchi Mountain in the east.

164
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,240
Oh no, it's exactly it!

165
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,750
Hurry.

166
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,070
Are you sure he went up the mountain?

167
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,310
He snatched a bullock cart

168
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,240
and abandoned the cart at the foot of the mountain.

169
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,800
He probably was there to enter the mountain.

170
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Get the horses ready.

171
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,270
Tell your men not to search the mountain just yet.

172
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,430
We'll search it ourselves.

173
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,950
Hurry up and go.

174
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,810
Let me help you.

175
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,270
Yes.

176
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,870
How are you all not done putting on your shoes?

177
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,830
Let's go to Tianchi Mountain.

178
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,390
Let's go.

179
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,980
Do it yourself.

180
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:16,840
Hurry up.

181
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,830
Wait for me.

182
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,150
This is where

183
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,810
we lost the fugitive's trail.

184
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,040
There are three roads up the mountain.

185
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,100
I wonder which road

186
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,240
Cui Bei took.

187
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,680
We're not looking for Cui Bei.

188
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,030
We're looking for the fugitive.

189
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,510
Cui Bei went up the mountain this morning.

190
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,750
We definitely won't be able to catch up with him.

191
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,210
But, the fugitive just went up the mountain.

192
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,270
So,

193
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,560
as long as we catch up with the fugitive,

194
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,120
he won't be able to hurt others,

195
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,980
or meet Mr. Cui.

196
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,720
In order to avoid being tracked,

197
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,600
the fugitive would definitely not choose the main road.

198
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,070
He must also be physically exhausted from running away.

199
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,800
That road is too steep,

200
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,720
so he wouldn't choose that either.

201
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,520
That means...

202
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,480
It's this one.

203
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,010
Let's go.

204
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,920
Vice Minister, we...

205
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
I am not done.

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,630
Why are you stopping me?

207
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,840
I know what you want to say.

208
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,270
Sir has already mentioned that

209
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,000
he doesn't believe in bad luck. Why would you still mention it?

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,720
You're simply asking for trouble.

211
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,789
Well, I'm afraid of accidents.

212
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,280
It's fine.

213
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,200
Maybe Vice Minister has a

214
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,669
tenacious life, just like I do.

215
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,150
We might just end up safe and sound.

216
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,600
Impossible.

217
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,130
Let's go.

218
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,270
Slow down.

219
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,150
Sir,

220
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,600
you'd better use a stick to probe the way ahead.

221
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,870
It's okay. I'll take the lead.

222
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,360
Keep up.

223
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,080
This...

224
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,000
No.

225
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,910
-Vice Minister, Sir.
-Hold on.

226
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,150
What a shabby place!

227
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,480
Mr. Li!

228
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,320
Mr. Li! Mr. Li!

229
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,470
Mr. Li!

230
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,840
I...

231
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,750
What's wrong?

232
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,550
I've checked. There's no snake.

233
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,840
No.

234
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,550
What is this?

235
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,450
It's horse manure.

236
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,210
It's the smell of horse manure.

237
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,480
Argh!

238
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,870
What on earth did Vice Minister

239
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,530
stepped on?

240
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
These are mushrooms.

241
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,440
It's great as herbs for medicine.

242
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,900
It's just a little stinky.

243
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,840
Is there a smell?

244
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,320
I can't smell it though.

245
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,120
Vice Minister,

246
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,870
don't you have a cold?

247
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,270
It's normal that you can't smell it.

248
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,270
Yes, it's normal.

249
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,120
Shoo, shoo!

250
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,010
How about now? Is it better?

251
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,880
Much better, Mr. Li.

252
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:11,840
Let's go.

253
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,240
Wait.

254
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,130
How many have I stepped on?

255
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,480
One, two...

256
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,000
Two, Mr. Li.

257
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,720
Haven't you guys stepped on one yet?

258
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,790
So Sir, you are indeed very unlucky.

259
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,320
I'm not talking about that.

260
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,270
Look here.

261
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,600
Other than us,

262
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,430
someone else have stepped on it.

263
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,840
Sir, do you mean...

264
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,620
a fugitive?

265
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,000
That means the fugitive

266
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,260
indeed did go this way.

267
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,960
We made the right choice. Let's go.

268
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,480
Okay.

269
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,740
How about this?

270
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,480
Sir.

271
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,840
Sir.

272
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Why don't we change

273
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,200
who's taking the lead?

274
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,720
I'm not afraid. What are you afraid of?

275
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,150
Look.

276
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,000
Are you afraid I'll affect you?

277
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,960
Of course not.

278
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,240
If someone's unlucky, it will only be that person.

279
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,030
I'm worried about you.

280
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,560
What are you worried about?

281
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,200
Suspicion breeds contempt.

282
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,400
Don't worry about me.

283
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,960
H-Here, Sir.

284
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,050
Sir, over here.

285
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,200
We can go up the mountain from here.

286
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,610
Let's go.

287
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:09,910
Go.

288
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,880
Be careful.

289
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,700
Vice Minister.

290
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,240
Mr. Li!

291
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,120
Run!

292
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,440
Hurry up and run!

293
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,600
Move!

294
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,630
Get up.

295
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,630
The bees are gone.

296
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,970
Luckily,

297
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,180
I didn't get stung.

298
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,750
That's a relief in this misfortune.

299
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,320
Vice Minister.

300
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,270
Y-You...

301
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,370
Was it still only Sir who got stung?

302
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,880
It must have been because

303
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,870
I was closer to the hornets' nest.

304
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,800
So, it's not the matter of bad luck.

305
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,510
Sir,

306
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,200
you don't have to explain to us.

307
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,550
I...

308
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,670
I...

309
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,840
I'm just telling the truth.

310
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,240
Do you guys think

311
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,200
that hornets' nest

312
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,240
was a bit strange?

313
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,580
Could it be that

314
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,040
someone planted it there on purpose?

315
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,630
Otherwise,

316
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,670
why would it have fallen for no reason,

317
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,870
when we were just walking past it?

318
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,390
Yes.

319
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,600
I was too focused on hiding,

320
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,660
so I didn't notice.

321
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,030
The fugitive must have planted it there.

322
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,120
If someone chases him,

323
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,390
he will be attacked by bees.

324
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,080
Those who chase him can only go up the mountain.

325
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,880
But that instead reminds us that

326
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,850
he followed this path upwards.

327
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,730
Let's go.

328
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,560
Let's go.

329
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,570
I'm good. Let's go.

330
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,750
Let's go.

331
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,170
Mr. Cui, you are here again this year.

332
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,840
I've reserved a room for you.

333
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,510
It's the same room you stayed in last year.

334
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,170
There's vegetarian food too.

335
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,830
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

336
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,770
You're welcome.

337
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,200
Are we first going to dispel the bad luck,

338
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,910
or...

339
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,440
Let me settle down first.

340
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,480
I will trouble you to

341
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,440
carry out the ritual

342
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,270
later on.

343
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,960
All right.

344
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,680
By the way,

345
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,360
I just found this

346
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,270
at the entrance to the mountain.

347
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:08,920
I reckoned

348
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,440
it could have been yours,

349
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,700
so I brought it with me.

350
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,250
Was it outside the mountain entrance?

351
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,670
Yes.

352
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
It's really mine.

353
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,630
This is all thanks to you, Mr. Cui.

354
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,320
Otherwise,

355
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,680
I might have forgotten about it myself.

356
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,440
I have to go to the forest

357
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,000
to collect some herbs later.

358
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,200
If you don't mind,

359
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,550
it would be best

360
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,450
if we carry out the ritual soon.

361
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,790
Just let me know

362
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,870
when you are done.

363
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,910
Mr. Cui,

364
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,720
I'm ready.

365
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,720
Mr. Zhang,

366
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,520
I'll be right there.

367
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,320
Okay.

368
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,790
Bow!

369
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,430
It's all done.

370
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,270
That's...

371
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,670
the end of it?

372
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,720
The ritual seems to be even simpler

373
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
than last year's.

374
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,510
Don't worry, Mr. Cui.

375
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,200
It is just as effective at dispelling bad luck.

376
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,030
Mr. Zhang.

377
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,670
I...

378
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,240
I'm a few taels short

379
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,570
of the money I promised.

380
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,440
Will there be any impact?

381
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,120
Mr. Cui it's okay.

382
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,270
These things are normal in the wild.

383
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,069
Don't always talk about ghosts.

384
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,920
But it's been twice,

385
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,750
and both incidents were targeted at you, Sir.

386
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,069
Why don't you believe me?

387
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,030
What do you mean?

388
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,880
It's normal that these things happen once or twice,

389
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,750
but it's unlikely to happen the third or forth time.

390
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,200
Sir,

391
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,560
you must not say that!

392
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,480
It's okay.

393
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,589
But...

394
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,589
We can't see anything

395
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,119
with these trees in the way.

396
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,030
We need to find

397
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,160
higher ground.

398
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,200
Sir,

399
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,730
please let me lead the way.

400
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,640
Sir!

401
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,200
I'm fine.

402
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,310
I'm fine.

403
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,400
Mr. Li,

404
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,800
you'd better be careful.

405
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,000
Sir!

406
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,680
Be careful, Mr. Li.

407
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,310
Let me do it.

408
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:49,960
No need.

409
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,020
Be careful, Mr. Li.

410
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,530
It should be pretty strong.

411
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,550
Sir!

412
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,990
Mr. Li!

413
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,000
Sir, slow down.

414
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,370
Sir, be careful.

415
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,730
Be careful.

416
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,110
How is it?

417
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,540
Nothing happened.

418
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,550
No.

419
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,880
I'm not a cat.

420
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,830
Shoo, go away.

421
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,790
Go away!

422
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,070
Sir!

423
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,720
Sir?

424
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,750
Well, that's it. Something really went wrong.

425
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,310
I have already warned against

426
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,550
Vice Minister jinxing it with his words,

427
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,200
but he refused.

428
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,640
And look!

429
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,240
I'm fine.

430
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,880
There was a cat!

431
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,550
Why did you fall from the tree?

432
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:06,830
Sir,

433
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,290
are you hallucinating?

434
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,130
We are in the middle of nowhere.

435
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:10,960
Oh!

436
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,320
There's really a cat.

437
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,050
This cat

438
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,870
seems to like you very much, Sir.

439
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,880
I know where Cui Bei went.

440
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,760
This cat is raised by humans.

441
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,960
Yes, it's quite clean.

442
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,030
It doesn't look like a wild cat.

443
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,160
Since it's raised by humans,

444
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,720
its owner

445
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,790
should be nearby.

446
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,200
When I was up there...

447
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,130
Look over there.

448
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,080
There is a Taoist temple.

449
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,680
A temple gathers yin.

450
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,160
That must be where Cui Bei went.

451
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,510
Yes.

452
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,400
Mr. Cui previously

453
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,640
asked me to buy some stiff yellow paper for him.

454
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,310
It must be for copying scriptures.

455
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,840
Let's go.

456
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,600
Let's go.

457
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,640
Who are you?

458
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,150
I'm looking for someone.

459
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
There is only Mr. Zhang in this temple.

460
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,530
Are you here for him?

461
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,920
Mr. Zhang

462
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,270
went to the back of the temple to collect herbs.

463
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,000
I don't think he'll be back until later.

464
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'll wait for him.

465
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,270
This way, please.

466
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,030
There's tea in the hall.

467
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,030
Please wait here.

468
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,220
What are you doing?

469
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,620
That hurts!

470
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,850
That hurts so much!

471
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,680
I didn't expect

472
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,940
you'd touch it either.

473
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,960
You have to use cold water on burns.

474
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,550
Please wait.

475
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,550
Hurry up.

476
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:32,880
Here.

477
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,680
Are you feeling better?

478
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,720
What's that stuff you put on me?

479
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,350
It's just clear water.

480
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,640
Is this water?

481
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,000
Why does it burn?

482
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,110
I just got the cloth from the kitchen.

483
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,960
I think it was used to wrapped pepper.

484
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,720
Are you kidding me?

485
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:51,920
I...

486
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,960
I really didn't mean it.

487
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,480
I'll get you some more.

488
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,310
No need.

489
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,640
It's late.

490
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,790
I'm sleepy.

491
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,710
Is there a place to sleep?

492
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,880
Yes.

493
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,550
Please follow me.

494
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,310
Hurry up.

495
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,790
I'm also staying at the temple.

496
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,640
Call me if you need anything.

497
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,510
Call you?

498
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,560
Aren't you annoying enough?

499
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,550
Hurry up.

500
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,070
Yes.

501
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,590
This way, please.

502
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,270
Be careful.

503
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,080
This way.

504
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,590
Here.

505
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,200
Was it because I don't have enough money for the offerings,

506
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,680
that caused the dispelling of bad luck

507
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,940
to not be as effective?

508
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,000
T-This is...

509
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,590
I-I don't know

510
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,320
how it started burning either.

511
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,650
There's another guest inside.

512
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,760
T-This...

513
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,480
What should we do?

514
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,100
We'll think of something.

515
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,030
Hurry.

516
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,510
Hurry.

517
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,350
Pour water on me.

518
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,350
Okay.

519
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,110
Come.

520
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,170
Be careful.

521
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,560
This way.

522
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,510
Hurry.

523
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,270
Hurry!

524
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,680
Hurry!

525
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,550
Mr. Cui!

526
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,160
Come on.

527
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,880
Take him to the main hall first,

528
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
and feed him some water.

529
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,200
He'll wake up soon.

530
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,200
Yes, Sir.

531
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,750
One, two, go.

532
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,440
Watch him.

533
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,400
Got it.

534
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,840
Get up.

535
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,910
Come on. Let's go.

536
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,440
Let's go.

537
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,450
Don't blame yourself, Mr. Cui.

538
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
It's not your fault.

539
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,510
Even so,

540
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,440
if I had discovered

541
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,550
sooner,

542
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,920
maybe it wouldn't have burned so badly.

543
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,350
If I wasn't here yesterday,

544
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,250
this big fire wouldn't have happened.

545
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,790
We wouldn't know.

546
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,750
Why do you think so, Mr. Cui?

547
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,060
Vice Minister.

548
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,310
I wonder

549
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,160
if you could take us

550
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,590
to the room where the fire started?

551
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,640
Of course.

552
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Please.

553
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,880
Please.

554
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,280
This was where the fire started?

555
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,490
What was the setup like?

556
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,000
This room

557
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,190
is basically the same as

558
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,370
the room I stayed at.

559
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,510
The bed

560
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,790
faces East.

561
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,640
The closest window is at the end of the bed.

562
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,750
Isn't that strange?

563
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,000
Sir, what do you mean?

564
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,000
By placing the lamp at the end of the bed,

565
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,660
wouldn't that hurt your eyes?

566
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,510
Yes.

567
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,350
It hurts your eyes when you lie down,

568
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,790
and it's inconvenient to put it out.

569
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,630
The lamp should be placed by the bedside.

570
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,880
Maybe this resident

571
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,340
has more peculiar habits.

572
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,680
It's hard to tell.

573
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,350
Really?

574
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,640
Sirs,

575
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,030
it's too dusty here.

576
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,590
Let's talk outside.

577
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,270
Okay.

578
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:54,730
Please.

579
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,480
I lost my mind for a moment.

580
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,920
Thank you.

581
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,480
Mr. Zhang, please don't be sad.

582
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,830
There are many Taoist temples in Shendu.

583
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,830
If you don't mind,

584
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,060
I can recommend you

585
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,350
to seek refuge with other temples.

586
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,150
Don't bother.

587
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,480
I still have what it takes

588
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,070
to take care of

589
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,330
a small Taoist temple.

590
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,210
If it were somewhere else,

591
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,640
I might not be used to it.

592
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,740
You're too modest.

593
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,310
But are you really not going to be used to it,

594
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,040
or is it simply inconvenience?

595
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,550
Sir,

596
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,110
what do you mean?

597
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,640
I don't quite catch you.

598
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,070
If you really want to

599
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,160
hide

600
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,440
in the wilderness,

601
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,280
you shouldn't have set the fire.

602
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,350
Set the fire?

603
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,310
Are you saying that I set the fire?

604
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,390
How could I

605
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,880
burn my own temple?

606
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,730
What if you were forced to?

607
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,890
He was the prisoner

608
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,380
who escaped a few days ago.

609
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,680
Why did he come

610
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,080
all the way to your place?

611
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,790
You clearly know why, don't you?

612
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,510
A fugitive?

613
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,830
He's here for you.

614
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,440
You know each other?

615
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,200
It's more than just acquaintances, isn't it?

616
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,960
You two must be pretty close.

617
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,160
If I'm not mistaken,

618
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,140
you must be an accomplice of the old case.

619
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,090
Having hid here,

620
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,450
no wonder the authorities couldn't find you.

621
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,310
Is there a misunderstanding?

622
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,750
Did I misunderstand?

623
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,040
You can explain after I finish.

624
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,030
You two

625
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,200
robbed a batch of official silver.

626
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,920
When you guys were splitting the loot,

627
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,780
he was arrested

628
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,070
while you escaped,

629
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,440
and you took all of the silver

630
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,170
and hid here.

631
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,510
You then became a priest in the wild.

632
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,350
Am I wrong?

633
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,550
Sir,

634
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,550
this story sounds great.

635
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,240
But...

636
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,510
do you have any proof?

637
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,110
We've made a lot of discoveries

638
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,640
on our way up this mountain.

639
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,480
For example, the stolen silver.

640
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,270
My money.

641
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,440
My money!

642
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,160
My money!

643
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,950
Don't move!

644
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,550
My money!

645
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
Watch carefully.

646
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,260
This is this year's newly minted silver.

647
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,440
The Court of Judicial Review just paid our salaries.

648
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,640
I lied to you.

649
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,240
You...

650
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:12,930
Don't move!

651
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,260
Take them away.

652
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,310
My money!

653
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,000
Move! Move it!

654
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
My money!

655
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,820
Vice Minister.

656
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,920
You guys...

657
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,650
What are you doing up here on your own?

658
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,070
We should be sending people to search the mountain

659
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,000
if we are chasing after a fugitive.

660
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,000
Aren't we on leave anyway?

661
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,400
There's nothing else to do, so I'll just take that I was going for a walk.

662
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,030
Really?

663
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,150
Even if we weren't here to apprehend the fugitive,

664
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,080
we still have to go up the mountain.

665
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,830
We're here for Mr. Cui.

666
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,720
Me?

667
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,440
You left without a word.

668
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,790
We haven't heard from you.

669
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,190
We searched everywhere.

670
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,400
I thought you...

671
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,740
What did you think?

672
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,960
Nothing.

673
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,360
At this time of the year,

674
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,560
the scenery on the mountain is beautiful.

675
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,210
We'd be wasting Qing Ming away if we don't come out for a walk.

676
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,030
I recall...

677
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,000
My father

678
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,480
used to take me for walks

679
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,030
during Qing Ming Festival.

680
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,960
It's been more than ten years.

681
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,630
It's been a long time since

682
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,090
I've seen views like this.

683
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,360
Thank you for coming to look for me.

684
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,280
I'm always afraid that others might think that

685
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,510
I'm unlucky.

686
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,110
So,

687
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,140
I would always try to avoid people

688
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,030
before they even comment.

689
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,360
I wanted to keep a distance from everyone,

690
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,420
and hence even up till when I left the Imperial College,

691
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,150
I was all alone.

692
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,630
Father.

693
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,280
Don't go.

694
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,960
This is official business.

695
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,880
The refugees are still waiting

696
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,340
for relief from the court.

697
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,960
You mustn't go!

698
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,510
I don't let you go!

699
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,110
Don't come back if you leave.

700
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,770
What are you doing?

701
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
This is the famous

702
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,920
the famous demon, Cui Bei.

703
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,920
I heard he got the first place again.

704
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,140
Perhaps the reason why

705
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,880
someone like him could have such good grades,

706
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,190
is because everyone was affected by him,

707
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,110
and became

708
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,080
really unlucky.

709
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,800
Exactly.

710
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,240
The teacher is here.

711
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,750
I often dream of them.

712
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,510
But every time,

713
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,550
I can only see their backs.

714
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,280
Don't go.

715
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,570
I was wondering...

716
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,920
Don't go.

717
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,280
Were they

718
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,660
unwilling to meet me in my dreams,

719
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,590
because they resented me?

720
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,670
People like me

721
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,230
are born to attract disaster.

722
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:14,800
Is it really suitable for me to stay in the Court of Judicial Review?

723
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,240
What are you talking about?

724
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,030
After listening to you,

725
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,070
I think

726
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,450
your parents loved you very much.

727
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,110
How could you say that

728
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,110
they hate you?

729
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,550
I was a little worried.

730
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,590
Do you think

731
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,850
it's because of us that

732
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,180
you almost got killed?

733
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,590
After all, if it wasn't because you were worried about us,

734
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,710
you wouldn't have gone up the mountain alone.

735
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,150
If you hadn't gone up the mountain alone,

736
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,840
you wouldn't have encountered those bandits,

737
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,900
and be implicated.

738
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,510
How?

739
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,930
Why would I think so?

740
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,760
That's good.

741
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,690
Any evil aura and bad luck,

742
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,920
it all comes from your heart.

743
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,190
There was a fire in the temple today.

744
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,630
So?

745
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,230
Are you going to blame yourself

746
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,960
for not predicting the future?

747
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,160
But if it weren't for you,

748
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,000
that guest

749
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,530
would have died in the fire.

750
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,710
To him,

751
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,090
you're a lucky star.

752
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,890
You always say you're unlucky

753
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,720
and bring harm to others.

754
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,060
Well, think of it another way.

755
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,920
If it weren't for the fact that you're always in danger,

756
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,880
you wouldn't have known

757
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,920
how to

758
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,280
stay calm,

759
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,330
and resolve the situation at hand.

760
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,510
You...

761
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,320
are familiar with all kinds of texts.

762
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,070
You can recite

763
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,200
the details of any peculiar or important cases by heart.

764
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,800
But this case file,

765
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,920
which is obviously from many years ago,

766
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,160
has been sitting on your desk all this time.

767
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,690
Judging from the traces...

768
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,150
Why hadn't you open it?

769
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,670
Is it because it recorded

770
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,530
the cause of your father's death,

771
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,050
and you're afraid to look?

772
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,550
You're afraid that it's a record

773
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,680
of the catastrophe,

774
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,580
of how you killed your father.

775
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,960
So you've been staring at this case file

776
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,890
year after year,

777
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,590
in order to remind yourself that

778
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,190
life and death are destined,

779
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,350
and struggle with letting it go.

780
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,670
In that case,

781
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,570
why don't you open and take a look?

782
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,860
How about this?

783
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,400
As the Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review,

784
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,480
I order Cui Bei,

785
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,680
to verify the merits of this case file.

786
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,490
If there is any error or omission,

787
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,230
you are to find out the truth.
