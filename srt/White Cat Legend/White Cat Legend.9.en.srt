Let me tell you.

In my hometown,

there are many fun things.

11
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,430

The room was a bit messy,

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,260
This is...

388
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,720
Li Bing from the Court of Judicial Review.

389
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,200
Vice Minister Li who cracked the Demon Cat Case.

390
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,110
The son of the former Minister of Judicial Review, Li Bing.

391
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,110
That is me.

392
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,430
Vice Minister Li.

393
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,150
What can I do for you?

394
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,100
The Court of Judicial Review made a wrong judgment.

395
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,550
The review shouldn't be finalized.

396
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,210
We need to reinvestigate the Councilor's case.

397
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,640
You want a reinvestigation?

398
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,510
This...

399
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,710
Sir, this is it.

400
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,110
Goodbye.

401
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,390
Goodbye.

402
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,750
You...

403
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,650
Sir.

404
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,550
Go away.

405
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,990
This...

406
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,590
They really treat the Ministry of Justice

407
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,910
as a fair.

408
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,950
Where is night watchman,

409
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,830
Zhang Da, now?

410
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,150
He suddenly had an illness

411
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,000
and was not feeling well

412
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,800
so he took a leave to return home.

413
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,240
Don't touch that flask!

414
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,060
Our vice minister just wants to take a look at it.

415
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,210
This flask has been fixed before.

416
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,390
Someone used mercury

417
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,850
to tamper with this flask.

418
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,310
That caused the night watchman to misjudge

419
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,970
and the time could be altered.

420
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,390
Zhang Da must have

421
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,250
accidentally become a witness with face evidence.

422
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,190
Besides, mercury is poisonous.

423
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,830
It seems that Zhang Da's illness

424
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,140
definitely has something to do with mercury.

425
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,790
I'll go look for the craftsman

426
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,050
who repaired the roof.

427
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,350
Wait, wait, wait.

428
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,510
Why are you stopping me?

429
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,710
This craftsman is probably not home

430
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,780
but at the Court of Judicial Review.

431
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,310
When I was investigating the case,

432
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,070
I saw that the craftsman was good

433
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,860
so I asked him to go to the Court of Judicial Review

434
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,920
to repair the roof.

435
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,270
How is it?

436
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,610
It's all right!

437
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,110
Take your time!

438
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,670
Don't worry!

439
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,590
I'm holding this for you!

440
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,790
All right!

441
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,390
It'll be fine after airing it for a few more days.

442
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,120
You're done?

443
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,390
Slowly.

444
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,310
Be careful.

445
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,750
I'll catch it.

446
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,810
Take these things.

447
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,590
Okay, okay.

448
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:48,870
Here.

449
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:50,710
Here.

450
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,010
Put it down.

451
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,670
More.

452
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,710
I got it.

453
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,430
Yes, okay.

454
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,390
More. More.

455
00:23:59,310 --> 00:23:59,710
Okay.

456
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,030
Come down.

457
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,430
Okay.

458
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,790
I'm holding it for you.

459
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,190
Okay.

460
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,430
Slowly. Be careful.

461
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,890
Be careful.

462
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:18,870
Okay.

463
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,200
Okay.

464
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,630
It's done.

465
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,510
It's good now.

466
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,750
I'm thirsty.

467
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,610
Can you give me some water?

468
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,390
Sorry.

469
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,750
I forgot about that. Sorry.

470
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,080
I'll bring it to you now.

471
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,560
C-Come here.

472
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,590
Stand here.

473
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,340
Don't run around.

474
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,400
I'll be right back.

475
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,910
Don't move!

476
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,430
Don't move!

477
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,240
Who are you telling not to move?

478
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,190
Mr. Wang! Mr. Wang!

479
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,070
I’m in trouble.

480
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,830
Don't move!

481
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,510
Cut the crap!

482
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,070
Give her to me.

483
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,800
And I'll let this fool go.

484
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,030
Who are you calling a fool?

485
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,150
A soldier can be killed but not humiliated.

486
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,870
Shut up, fool.

487
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,230
You!

488
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,120
I...

489
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,830
Don't move.

490
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,960
This is impossible.

491
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,250
Let's change the conditions.

492
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,430
Let him go.

493
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,090
And I'll let you go.

494
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,700
I...

495
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,280
I let him go and you let me go?

496
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,950
Do you think I'm afraid of death?

497
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,870
It seems that

498
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,570
you don't know the situation yet.

499
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,480
Let me tell you.

500
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,070
Since I did it,

501
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,360
I'm not afraid of you–

502
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,150
Who is a fool? Who is a fool?

503
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,910
Who is a fool?

504
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,710
Who?

505
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,710
[Court of Judicial Review]

506
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,730
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

507
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,310
Do you have anything else to say?

508
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,030
No.

509
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,350
So you admit

510
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,720
you had planned to kill him.

511
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,390
Why are you looking for the Councilor's sister

512
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,590
after killing him?

513
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,430
Is the grudge between you two

514
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,380
this deep?

515
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,270
So deep you won't even spare his family.

516
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,030
He bullied me first.

517
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,910
I hate him so much!

518
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,870
I want to kill both siblings.

519
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,670
What about it?

520
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,110
If the happenings of the case and motive

521
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,950
are clear,

522
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,170
I have only one question left.

523
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,450
Vice Minister,

524
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,190
he's obviously talking nonsense.

525
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,850
Since I'm interrogating him,

526
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,310
listen to me.

527
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,230
Yes.

528
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,550
[Integrity; Prudence; Diligence]

529
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,770
One last question.

530
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,070
Since it was murder first,

531
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,830
then making it look like a suicide,

532
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,110
it's hard to make the way the victim looked when he died

533
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,550
exactly the same as a he hung himself.

534
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,720
And to hang the dead body

535
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,550
on the beam of the house

536
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,750
was not an easy thing.

537
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:47,950
How did you do it?

538
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,710
Like he hung himself?

539
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,840
That's because he was hanged to death.

540
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,710
I just coaxed him to go up.

541
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,710
It's easy.

542
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:19,860
Sir,

543
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,630
this should be fine.

544
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,470
Help me get the tools up.

545
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,070
Please tie it for me.

546
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,230
Okay.

547
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,790
Good.

548
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,070
Sir,

549
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,710
I think it's almost done.

550
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,560
Why don't you come up and take a look?

551
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,670
I think the rain

552
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,350
won't stop any time soon.

553
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,630
If there's any problem,

554
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,840
I can fix it immediately.

555
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,700
Okay, I'll come up to check it out.

556
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,790
Be careful.

557
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,430
Sir, be careful.

558
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,790
Yes.

559
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,950
Look, that's the only place.

560
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,140
It's on the left.

561
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,080
More towards the left.

562
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,590
You can only blame him

563
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,590
for being stubborn and suspicious.

564
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,950
On top of that,

565
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,920
you also tampered with the kettle.

566
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,650
It's quite a coincidence.

567
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,240
But unfortunately,

568
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,370
you didn't find

569
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,590
what you wanted to find

570
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,790
at his place, right?

571
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,270
I wasn't sure

572
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,390
why you wanted

573
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,270
to

574
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:49,950
kill him.

575
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,390
But to be able to come up with

576
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,390
such a meticulous plan to murder,

577
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,390

579
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,870
for a moment of hatred.

580
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,080
So you have other intentions?

581
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,630
You later looked for

582
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,510
the victim's sister.

583
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,950
That means you haven't found

584
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,350
what you're looking for.

585
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,040
What is it?

586
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,830
Forget it.

587
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,930

He solved a class A case.

595
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,140
What he says is quite useful.

596
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,240
Madam,

597
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,870
Vice Minister Li said...

598
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,030
He asked you to take it back,

599
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,690
and you did.

600
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,230
You listen to him so well.

601
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,370
At least leave some for him.

602
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,380
You brought all of them back.

603
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,870
I have lead you to solve the case by myself.

604
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,080
How long will it take?

605
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,070

609
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,190
I-I wanted to

610
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,310
tell you this just now

611
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,660
but you interrupted.

612
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,670

Vice Minister Li

617
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,900

00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,670

00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,280
you can give it to him. It doesn't matter.

as before the coming-of-age ceremony.

so we can't tell the difference.

647

I thought you hung yourself.

662

about the coming-of-age ceremony,

She may be thin,

673
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,590
but she can eat a lot.

674
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,230
She's picky too.

675
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,510
She doesn't eat green onion and garlic.

676
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,909
She's especially afraid of hot things.

677
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,400
So when she eats and drinks water,

678
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,199
they have to be cooled off first.

679
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,179

00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:34,670

00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,240
don’t say anything.

770
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,750
No.

771
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,400
Mr. Li.

772
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,230
Mr. Wang is smart.

773
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,690
It’s a pity for him to leave like this.

774
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,910
Let me ask you.

775
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,320
What is the most important thing in the Court of Judicial Review?

776
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,760
Law!

777
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,150
That the law is strict

778
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,550
and one can distinguish right from wrong.

779
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,230
You've only been here for a few days

780
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,560
and you already know it.

781
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,310
Wang Qi has been here for more than two years.

782
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,170
but he still doesn't understand.

783
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,120
But...

784
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,960
There's no buts.

785
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,790
But you,

786
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,310
don't think about putting in a good word

787
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,710
for others in the future.

788
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,950
I'm not as Mr. Wang

789
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,490
but I get to stay in the Court of Judicial Review.

790
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,470
What you do

791
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,290
is actually more than what you think.

792
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,030
Do you want to try

793
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,950
joining Mingjing Hall?

794
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,190
You can start from being a non-staff scribe.

795
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,390
Although you don't have a rank,

796
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,550
at least you're not an attendant scribe

797
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,390
or a servant.

798
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,950
You will be a member of the Court of Judicial Review

799
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,140
who can help investigate cases.

800
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,670
If you can

801
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,930
pass the test later on,

802
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,910
you can also officially join the Court of Judicial Review.

803
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,310
I can investigate cases?

804
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,870
And go out with you?

805
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,350
Yes.

806
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,200
I want to do it!

807
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,950
Lower your voice.

808
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:17,790
I can hear you.

809
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,750
Sorry.

810
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,950
I want to do it.

811
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,470
The first thing to do is...

812
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,540
Is...

813
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,430
What is it?

814
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,330
Within a month,

815
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,230
memorize all these words.

816
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,530
Th-This...

817
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:37,990
Mr. Li!

818
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,310
Th-This...

819
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,570
This is too much Mr. Li!

820
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,030
Wait!

821
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,590
Mr. Li!

822
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,490
Th-This...

823
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,030
Can you give me more time?

824
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,830
Mr. Li!

825
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:46,990
