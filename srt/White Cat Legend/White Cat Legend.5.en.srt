[Episode 5]

4
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,039
You are good at framing people.

5
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,979
Bringing justice to people,

6
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,539
now that's new.

7
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,110
Since you're here to arrest me,

8
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,060
the solution is easy.

9
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,910
Three years ago,

10
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,830
a troupe disappeared in Shendu.

11
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,590
You mean

12
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,140
the missing troupe members

13
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,730
turned into vengeful ghosts and came back for revenge?

14
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,710
Touch wood.

15
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,220
Touch wood.

16
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,270
There is no demon cat in this world,

17
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,200
only illusions.

18
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,730
The demon cat from three years ago

19
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,060
could also be an illusion.

20
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,620
Cui Bei.

21
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,150
Think again.

22
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,510
How much do you remember

23
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,590
about that troupe

24
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,910
from three years ago?

25
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,710
I remember...

26
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,550
The owner's surname was Meng.

27
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,170
The location was...

28
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,840
near the repair shop in the city south.

29
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,400
Let's go.

30
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,150
Let's go.

31
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,600
You're suspended.

32
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,070
Where are you going?

33
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,150
We are suspended.

34
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,520
Why do you care?

35
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,470
Do you have

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,980
any clues about this case?

37
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,350
This case...

38
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,230
Forget it.

39
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,320
You don't have to explain to me.

40
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,990
To be honest,

41
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,130
I have low expectations for you guys.

42
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,010
But let me remind you kindly.

43
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,310
Once you leave the Court of Judicial Review,

44
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,040
you may not be able to come back.

45
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,890
Thank you for your low expectations.

46
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,290
Just go.

47
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,970
I didn't see anything.

48
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,060
I didn't see anything at all.

49
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,670
Let's go.

50
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,610
I didn't see anything.

51
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,210
I didn't see anything at all.

52
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,990
They really left.

53
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,910
So this was how the body

54
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,550
flew onto the Zhuque Gate.

55
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,550
You helped me before.

56
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,830
Considering that

57
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,340
you were wronged

58
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,740
and you were nice to Gu's daughter,

59
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,500
I'll give you a chance.

60
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,570
I splashed lamp oil around here.

61
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,580
Once the candle is extinguished,

62
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,150
you can let him out.

63
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,790
Actually, you don't want

64
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,900
to kill us.

65
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,460
Why don't we talk?

66
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,850
You are an official.

67
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,730
I'm just a commoner

68
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,070
who earns a living

69
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,030
with my skills.

70
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,760
What is there to talk about

71
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,200
between us?

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,170
How about the Demon Cat Case from three years ago?

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,170
You are a murderer,

74
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,730
but also a witness.

75
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,890
I came to you

76
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,560
not just to find

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,390
the murderer of the current case,

78
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,260
but also to find out

79
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,990
the truth from three years ago.

80
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,590
It's too late.

81
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,520
If three years ago, when my parents died,

82
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,390
and I had no one to rely on

83
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,430
and nowhere to seek justice,

84
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,360
someone had wanted to talk to me...

85
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,290
If two years ago,

86
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,360
when I slept on the streets, pretended to be a psychic,

87
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,350
and was bullied by people

88
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,470
on the street,

89
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,830
someone had wanted to talk to me...

90
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,710
If one year ago,

91
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,430
when I failed to make a Kongming lantern

92
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,310
and almost burned down

93
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,600
the troupe theater,

94
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,480
someone had wanted to talk to me...

95
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,409
Maybe it would have been possible.

96
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,670
But it's too late

97
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,790
to talk about it now.

98
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,850
No matter how long has passed,

99
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,280
the truth will always be the truth.

100
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,460
Although the dead can't be revived,

101
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,390
it doesn't mean the case

102
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,520
can be closed without an explanation.

103
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,600
Even if we have to make up for it,

104
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,070
we should find out

105
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,240
the truth.

106
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,300
You said your parents died tragically.

107
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,900
Then they did not go missing.

108
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,790
But it's related to the Demon Cat Case.

109
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,180
Three years ago, the demon cat appeared.

110
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,910
Many people saw it themselves.

111
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,090
I don't think the scene

112
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,810
was entirely fabricated.

113
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,390
Three years later,

114
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,170
you can create a demon cat.

115
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,200
Was that one three years ago

116
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,350
also created by you?

117
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,040
You're smart.

118
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,290
But you overestimated me.

119
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,150
It wasn't me three years ago,

120
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,390
but my parents.

121
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,950
This theater

122
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,310
belonged to my family.

123
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,990
I grew up learning theater tricks

124
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,990
from my parents.

125
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,710
There are many talents in Shendu.

126
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,270
Our family was able

127
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,670
to stand firm and survive

128
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,660
because we had a secret

129
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,820
tiger-taming technique.

130
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,520
Our family was famous

131
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,520
in this street.

132
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,560
This theater was also popular.

133
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,950
I once thought

134
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,490
of taking over the theater

135
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,490
after I returned.

136
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,670
Return?

137
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,640
I joined the army

138
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,330
during the war a few years ago.

139
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,720
I've traveled a long way

140
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,970
and survived countless battles.

141
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,330
Every day, I thought of how

142
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,350
I could live a peaceful life

143
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,810
if I could survive

144
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,960
and make it home.

145
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,290
Finally, I returned one day.

146
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,850
Three years ago,

147
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,190
I came back from the battlefield.

148
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,510
An official,

149
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,430
also known as the senior military officer

150
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,380
who was hung on the Zhuque Gate a few days ago,

151
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
came to my father.

152
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,470
He said he fancied our skills

153
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,530
and asked us to be the final act

154
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,140
for the upcoming festival.

155
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,940
He wanted it to be a surprise for

156
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,240
the civilians and high officials at the festival.

157
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,840
But we had to keep it a secret.

158
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,740
Once it was done,

159
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,590
he promised us three times the usual payment.

160
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,570
At the festival,

161
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,190
we dressed our tigress as a demon cat

162
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,070
and began the finale on a foggy stage.

163
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,110
The people and high officials were intrigued.

164
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,309
They had never seen such a trick before.

165
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,930
My parents waited for the fog to disperse

166
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,330
so the real tiger performance could begin.

167
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,160
And yet,

168
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,410
The people and high officials ran away.

169
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,090
Out of nowhere,

170
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,570
a team of soldiers emerged

171
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,530
and surrounded the theater.

172
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:28,870
Move!

173
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,420
Hurry!

174
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,930
They killed my parents

175
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,080
without saying a word.

176
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,030
Mother!

177
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,310
I knew some kung fu

178
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,010
from my days on the battlefield

179
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,750
and escaped from the theater.

180
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,140
But the senior military officer hunted me down.

181
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,190
If he hadn't aimed too much

182
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,150
to the right,

183
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,470
I would have been killed by him.

184
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,830
Not long after,

185
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,350
I sneaked back.

186
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,850
But I found the theater empty

187
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,320
and abandoned.

188
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,350
Only a month-old tiger cub

189
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,770
was left behind.

190
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,070
The so-called demon cat was shot dead

191
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,330
in front of the people,

192
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,870
and the Court of Judicial Review closed the case.

193
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,900
How could the Court of Judicial Review close the case just like that?

194
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,870
Who can let

195
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,140
a whole theater's worth of people

196
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,400

197
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,100

201

Not only me

202
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,430
but also the families

203

of those that went missing.

204
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,710
Many people couldn't accept

205

206
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,190
The government made such a ridiculous excuse

207
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,410
to close the case hastily.

208
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,920
The court can't escape the blame

209
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,250

Your purpose was to attract the victims' relatives

219

220
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,210

221
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,630

222

What did the senior military officer say before he died?

00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,870
That's what you said last time

384
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,260
before you locked me up.

385
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:50,950
You...

386
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,550
I don't want to listen to you.

387
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,870
Think carefully.

388
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I don't want to listen to you either.

389
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,640
Chen Shi.

390
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,270
Watch your mouth.

391
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,770
Yes.

392
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,380
We are on the same side.

393
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,970
No, Chen Shi.

394
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,510
You...

395
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,030
Think carefully before you speak.

396
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,630
Who's on the same side as you?

397
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,590
We are on the same side.

398
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,610
Don't talk nonsense.

399
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,560
This is the court

400
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,430
of justice.

401
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,850
How could you slander me?

402
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,710
How are we on the

403
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,270
same side as you?

404
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,010
Who's on your side?

405
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,870
Whose side are you on?

406
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,040
You mean,

407
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,290
they are

408
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,730
your accomplices?

409
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,670
Yes.

410
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,990
No!

411
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,400
Do you know what an accomplice is?

412
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,390
Chen Shi, if you're not sure,

413
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,270
you can't talk nonsense.

414
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,930
He doesn't mean what he said.

415
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,080
Come.

416
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,470
Explain it to me.

417
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,260
Are they

418
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,390
related to you?

419
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,530
Not just the three of them,

420
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,600
but also him.

421
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,980
We are all on the same side.

422
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,420
I...

423
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,090
Chen Shi!

424
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,320
Don't talk nonsense!

425
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,150
What are you talking about?

426
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,950
In the abandoned theater in the city south,

427
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,680
we found all kinds of evidence.

428
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,940
One of the murderers was executed.

429
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,710
And Chen Shi

430
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,470
was with the murderer at that time.

431
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,670
Chen Shi is the prime suspect

432
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,920
determined by the Court of Judicial Review.

433
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,350
Vice Minister Shangguan,

434
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,300
am I right?

435
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,140
Since you're a prime suspect,

436
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,470
is what you said just now

437
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,240
an identification in court?

438
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,190
Make yourself clear.

439
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,560
Yes.

440
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,470
Make yourself clear.

441
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,030
Say it! Say it!

442
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,070
Since it's an identification in court,

443
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,580
you are all suspects.

444
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,590
Guards!

445
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,570
Yes.

446
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,190
Take him away.

447
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,550
Yes.

448
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,120
Stop!

449
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,930
Vice Minister Shangguan, do you have a problem?

450
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,520
This is the Court of Judicial Review.

451
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,650
The Jinwu Guards need not be bothered.

452
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,460
Guards!

453
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,300
Yes.

454
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,950
Hu Si.

455
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,820
Yes.

456
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,170
Take them away.

457
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,620
My Lord.

458
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,520
All of them?

459
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,780
All of them.

460
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,050
To the dungeon.

461
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,340
Yes.

462
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,980
Take them away.

463
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,870
Go.

464
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,930
What does it have to do with me?

465
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,310
No.

466
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,570
How could this happen?

467
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,470
Chen Shi!

468
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,390
Chen Shi!

469
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,640
My Lord! My Lord!

470
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,120
I'm innocent. We...

471
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,710
My Lord!

472
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,520
Sir.

473
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,260
General Qiu.

474
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,720
This case

475
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,630
requires more discussion.

476
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,030
The case has been solved.

477
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,750
There’s nothing to discuss.

478
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,470
But I have to remind you, Vice Minister Shangguan.

479
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,660
You sent the arrest warrant yourself.

480
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,400
Now the result

481
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,870
is for your own good.

482
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,570
In that case,

483
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,970
the case is closed.

484
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,880
Let's go.

485
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,510
Hurry up!

486
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,670
Shove them in.

487
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,220
Get in.

488
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,770
I can walk on my own.

489
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,430
I'll handle it myself.

490
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,010
You may leave.

491
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,630
Yes.

492
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,170
Hu Si.

493
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,680
Brother Si.

494
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,520
We're all friends.

495
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,240
Yes.

496
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,300
We've been slandered.

497
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,410
I have no power or authority.

498
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,470
I can only do my job.

499
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,010
Take care of yourselves.

500
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:12,850
Brother Si.

501
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:13,960
Hu Si. Hu Si.

502
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,820
Hu Si!

503
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,070
Chen Shi, I...

504
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,140
I'll kill you!

505
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,630
I'll kill you now!

506
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,350
I have something to show you!

507
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,190
All right.

508
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,350
Come here.

509
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,590
Enough.

510
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,760
Calm down.

511
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,700
This is...

512
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,320
This is...

513
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,910
A joint petition by the families of the missing victims

514
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,510
of the Demon Cat Case three years ago.

515
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,570
It's reporting...

516
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,100
The Minister of Rites.

517
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,000
How could this be?

518
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,280
Three years ago,

519
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,010
to cover up the disappearance case,

520
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,230
the Minister of Rites ordered the senior military officer

521
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,850
to fool the owner of the trope into

522
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,660
creating the illusion of subduing the demon cat.

523
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,540
After that,

524
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,750
to cover up the traces,

525
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,750
he killed the troupe members.

526
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,750
In the end, the Court of Judicial Review

527
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,910
had to convict the demon cat.

528
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,090
These people couldn't push through with reason.

529
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,090
So they could only

530
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,750
commit revenge killing.

531
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,410
I've never seen the names of

532
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,370
these people on the files.

533
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,050
Now,

534
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,000
I finally know who they are.

535
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,750
Mr. Li said

536
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,030
we're on the same side.

537
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,830
I trust you.

538
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,150
Mr. Li trusts you too.

539
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,430
Looks like

540
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,360
we can't escape from this case now.

541
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,050
What else did this Mr. Li say?

542
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,110
The Zhuque Gate.

543
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,430
Mr. Li said

544
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,050
everyone was at Zhuque Gate.

545
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,490
Report this to the Vice Minister.

546
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,140
Let's go.

547
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,770
Let's go.

548
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,440
What now?

549
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,890
I'm just reminding you.

550
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,150
We're still locked up here.

551
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,990
It's useless.

552
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,750
We finally got ourselves

553
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,200
such a big case to solve.

554
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,550
But we somehow landed in prison.

555
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,590
Who will we reason with now?

556
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,220
We've drawn ourselves into a prison.

557
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,180
If it were just a drawing, it would have been great.

558
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,360
Sorry, everyone.

559
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,900
It's all my fault.

560
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,190
Don't be sorry.

561
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,480
It's not your fault.

562
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,470
You...

563
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,370
What did I do now?

564
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,870
Last time,

565
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,590
you were locked in this cell too.

566
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,060
How did you get out?

567
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,880
I...

568
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,400
Remember...

569
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,260
Last time, the door was...

570
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,390
It's open!

571
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,070
Hurry.

572
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,240
Hurry up.

573
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,990
Hurry up. Let's go.

574
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,950
Okay.

575
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,320
Let's go.

576
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,390
What's wrong?

577
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,070
Officer.

578
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,910
Come back.

579
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,790
Come back!

580
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,550
Hurry!

581
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,870
The door is opened so easily.

582
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,250
It must be a trap!

583
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,470
Even if it's a trap, we have to go.

584
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,670
Did you do as I said?

585
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,810
Yes.

586
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,890
Let's leave it as it is.

587
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,160
Bad things won't happen thrice in a row.

588
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,820
My Lord,

589
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,450
are you letting things go just like that?

590
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,250
What else can we do?

591
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,870
It's all Qiu Qingzhi's fault.

592
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,740
If he hadn't seized this weakness,

593
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,470
there might have been a chance to turn the tables.

594
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,470
I do feel sorry

595
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,490
for those guys.

596
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,950
This is all I can do.

597
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,590
I hope they won't come back.

598
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,120
Have you sorted everything out?

599
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,380
As you expected,

600
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,060
I found Meng Kui

601
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,400
at the abandoned theater

602
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,830
and shot him on the spot.

603
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,470
The murderer is dead.

604
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,450
Although Chen Shi and his gang

605
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,110
have nothing to do with the case,

606
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,000
the Court of Judicial Review has agreed to convict them.

607
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,990
We have given The Court of Judicial Review

608
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,450
a chance to save its grace.

609
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,760
Good.

610
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,580
They really don't know anything?

611
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,950
Yes.

612
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,530
About your trip to the old theater...

613
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,690
Apart from Meng Kui and Chen Shi,

614
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,390
no one else knew about this,

615
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,530
right?

616
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,380
Yes.

617
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,180
Are you sure?

618
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,060
Yes.

619
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,150
Okay.

620
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,770
Well done.

621
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,550
In three days,

622
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:31,910
no more, no less.

623
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,270
I can hold the ceremony in peace.

624
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,800
After the ceremony,

625
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,640
we can talk about

626
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,970
the Court of Judicial Review.

627
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,350
Understood.

628
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,110
[Li's Residence]

629
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,340
Come on.

630
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,910
Come out.

631
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,380
Don't step on me!

632
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,540
Come here.

633
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,460
Here.

634
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,040
I didn't expect it to lead to this place.

635
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,700
This is the Minster's Mansion of the Court of Judicial Review.

636
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,430
I've long heard that there are mysteries inside.

637
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,160
Chen Shi,

638
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,820
the Mr. Li you mentioned...

639
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,350
He was trying to protect me.

640
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,990
He fell off

641
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,940
from such a high place.

642
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,710
What a pity.

643
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,430
It's okay.

644
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,700
I'm sure he's fine.

645
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,310
We just need to wait for the

646
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,370
fireworks signal.

647
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,230
If they plan to exact revenge

648
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,480
before the minister holds the ceremony,

649
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,170
and will be ambushing near the Zhuque Gate,

650
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,150
then we have to take action

651
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:28,830
before them.

652
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,750
But we are now suspects,

653
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,540
and escaped criminals.

654
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,230
I'm afraid we won't be able to explain ourselves.

655
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,430
There's no other way.

656
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,410
It's now a matter of time.

657
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,730
Solving the case is the top priority.

658
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,830
I didn't expect you to...

659
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,340
There are many things you won't expect.

660
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,120
You nerd.

661
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,130
So, what do you all think?

662
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:44,980
Great.

663
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,290
We'll die together!

664
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,160
Touch wood, touch wood!

665
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,380
I knew it.

666
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,580
Why does that sound so familiar?

667
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,500
What are you surprised about?

668
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,190
Chen Shi.

669
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,670
Aren't we on the same side?

670
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:58,860
Here.

671
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,390
Look!

672
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,180
Go to Zhuque Gate now.

673
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,550
I’ll go back to the Court of Judicial Review to get reinforcements.

674
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,210
Okay. Got it.

675
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:07,650
Come with me.

676
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,110
Hurry!

677
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,770
Hurry up.

678
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,340
What happened?

679
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,730
Why did you stop?

680
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,990
Who's playing tricks here?

681
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,220
Playing tricks?

682
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,260
How fitting of you

683
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,910
to say that,

684
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,060
Minister of Rites.

685
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,260
Who are you?

686
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,530
You don't need to know who I am.

687
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,950
You just need to know that I'm here on behalf

688
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,750
of the Court of Judicial Review.

689
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,460
The Court of Judicial Review?

690
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,870
What do you want?

691
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,600
About the Demon Cat Case three years ago,

692
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,330
please give us an explanation.

693
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,220
What does this case have to do with me?

694
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,310
No need to pretend

695
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,110
in front of me.

696
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,230
The demon cat was just an illusion.

697
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,810
And you were the magician behind it.

698
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,590
Nonsense!

699
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,310
How dare you!

700
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,430
Who ordered you

701
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,130
to hijack a high official?

702
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,220
Do you know how serious an offense this is?

703
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,990
I'm afraid it's nowhere

704
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,410
as serious as your offense.

705
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,150
Three years ago, you secretly ordered the senior military officer

706
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,530
to kidnap Meng's troupe

707
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,930
and made up the demon cat hoax

708
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:23,830
to cover up

709
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,760
the disappearance case in Shendu.

710
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,720
As for the reason behind that

711
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,720
and the lives of the missing people,

712
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,520
you must give us an explanation today.

713
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,630
Why?

714
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,640
You are so fearless.

715
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,660
Could it be that you're confident you have

716
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,320
completely erased the witnesses and evidence?

717
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,680
I'm holding a grand ceremony today.

718
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,410
If I don't show up,

719
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,500
all the Imperial Guards in the city

720
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,900
will come looking for me.

721
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,390
I wonder

722
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,400
if you have considered the consequences?

723
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,400
The Imperial Guards won't make it in time.

724
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,470
What do you plan to do?

725
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,620
Minister,

726
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,210
the plaintiff of the case is still alive.

727
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,110
It is not only the plaintiff

728
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,420
but also a witness.

729
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,390
Let it question you.

730
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,910
Since the demon cat's existence

731
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,180
started from you,

732
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,230
I'm sure no one would pursue it

733
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,270
if you were killed by the demon cat.

734
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,490
I'm not familiar with this tiger.

735
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,210
But I can still do something within ten steps.

736
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,840
My Lord, please hasten.

737
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,960
The Court of Judicial Review adheres to standards.

738
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,970
Law is its leash,

739
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,390
and evidence is its priority.

740
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,510
But there is karma outside the law.

741
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,790
You have

742
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,340
taken so many lives.

743
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,770
Aren't you afraid of

744
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,470
being haunted and punished?

745
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,670
Go!

746
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,970
I admit it!

747
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:56,570
I admit it!

748
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,190
I admit it!

749
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,630
Fine.

750
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,380
I admit it...

751
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,320
Let me ask you.

752
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,600
Was the demon cat

753
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,270
made up?

754
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,230
Yes.

755
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,510
Did you secretly order

756
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,480
the kidnapping of the Meng's troupe?

757
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,030
Yes.

758
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,170
What happened after that?

759
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:09,630
I...

760
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,270
What happened?

761
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,560
I've killed them all.

762
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,760
What are you doing?

763
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:28,790
Put me down!

764
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,590
My Lord.

765
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,870
To prevent the tiger from scaring you,

766
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,489
Let me go!

767
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,969
I'll hang you here for now.

768
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,469
You...

769
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,150
Alright.

770
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,010
Don't be angry.

771
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,510
Take it away.

772
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,840
Hu Zi.

773
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,400
Let's go.

774
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,719
[Prosperity and Peace]

775
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,030
Have you recorded it?

776
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,230
Yes.

777
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,910
It's written in black and white.

778
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,470
Good.

779
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,230
You...

780
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,500
You...

781
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,350
My Lord.

782
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,270
Qiu Qingzhi.

783
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,890
Qiu Qingzhi, you came at the right time.

784
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,390
Help me!

785
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,470
Arrest them all!

786
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,750
General Qiu.

787
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,550
Li Bing.

788
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,600
Long time no see.

789
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,430
Qiu Qingzhi.

790
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,710
Put me down.

791
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,640
Qiu Qingzhi.

792
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,510
Qiu Qingzhi!

793
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,390
He is the real suspect

794
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,560
in the Demon Cat Case.

795
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,840
He has pleaded guilty.

796
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,390
What are you waiting for?

797
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,870
Do you really want to listen to him?

798
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,190
Arrest them all!

799
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,540
I only know

800
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,090
there is a grand ceremony today.

801
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,110
You kidnapped the minister of rites in public

802
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,120
and delayed the ceremony.

803
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,320
It is against the law.

804
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,760
As for the other case you mentioned,

805
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,960
I don't know about it.

806
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,000
Guards!

807
00:35:59,230 --> 00:35:59,960
Arrest them.

808
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,840
Here is the imperial edict!

809
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,140
[Zhuque Gate]

810
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,620
As the emperor, I reviewed the

811
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,270
disappearance case from three years ago

812
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,670
and found discrepancies

813
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,190
in the Demon Cat Case.

814
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,060
I hereby order the case

815
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,440
to be investigated again.

816
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,640
The Minister of Rites will be suspended

817
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,370
and wait for trial in the Ministry of Justice.

818
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:41,900
Also,

819
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,670
I summon the son of the former Minister of Judicial Review,

820
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,230
Li Bing,

821
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,980
to the palace.

822
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,980
Long live the empress!

823
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,870
So you were

824
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,960
the senior before.

825
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,800
Meeting someone is better than hearing about them.

826
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,300
Accept the decree.

827
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,700
This decree

828
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,530
is not just for me.

829
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,590
Everyone,

830
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,220
come out.

831
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,930
Who are these people?

832
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,070
They are the nameless people

833
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,000
on the blood vow.

834
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,210
Commoner Li Bing,

835
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,870
on behalf of the 33 family members

836
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,550
of the nameless innocent victims,

837
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,950
Thank you, Your Majesty.

838
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,190
Thank you, Your Majesty.

839
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,180
All rise.

840
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,990
One more thing.

841
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,370
What is it?

842
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,120
There's another person

843
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,920
who is also related to this case.

844
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,550
I know you must be here.

845
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,680
Now the truth is clear.

846
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,450
But the law must be adhered to.

847
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,750
If you surrender,

848
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,170
you will surely face a lighter sentence.

849
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,890
If you disappear now,

850
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,070
you must hide and be on the run

851
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,470
for the rest of your life.

852
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,360
I'm willing to be punished.

853
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,350
Father!

854
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,540
Father!

855
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,170
Xiaohuan!

856
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,630
Walk slowly. Don't fall.

857
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,840
Father.

858
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,430
Xiaohuan.

859
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,690
Father.

860
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,720
You are my Xiaohuan.

861
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,310
Father.

862
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,100
You're still alive.

863
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,350
Xiaohuan.

864
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,190
I've been looking for you.

865
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,590
My good daughter.

866
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,710
Xiaohuan.

867
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,190
Xiaohuan.

868
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,390
You're back.

869
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,590
-Xiaohuan.
-Take it.

870
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,450
Brother.

871
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,990
I only want Father.

872
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,950
I'll give you the rattle drum.

873
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,990
Please don't take him away,

874
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,000
okay?

875
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,210
Xiaohuan.

876
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,340
My Xiaohuan.

877
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,610
Let's not make things difficult for the officer.

878
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,210
Okay?

879
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,960
It was my fault.

880
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:11,990
Father.

881
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,030
Don't cry.

882
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,540
Father!

883
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,270
Xiaohuan.

884
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:34,670
As the

885
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,630
Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review,

886
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,680
I promise you.

887
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,800
Your father won't leave you for too long.

888
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,920
Thank you, officer.

889
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,360
Thank you, officer.

890
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,870
[Court of Judicial Review]
