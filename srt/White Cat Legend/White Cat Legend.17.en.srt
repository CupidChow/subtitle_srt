[Episode 17]

4
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,670
It must be hard

5
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,710
for an addict to quit, right?

6
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,470
If it's as Cui Bei said

7
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,390
and he only took the drug

8
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,150
because pressure distorted his personality

9
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,150
and he needed the drug to resolve it,

10
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,030
then it's a psychological condition.

11
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,910
If the psychological condition illness wasn't cured,

12
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,670
how could he stop using the drug?

13
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,000
That's what I think too.

14
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,669
Maybe

15
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,710
Qin Wan was lying.

16
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,230
Not necessarily.

17
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,310
You mean...

18
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,230
If...

19
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,590
If he really stopped...

20
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,710
Alibaba?

21
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,870
Why are you alone?

22
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,840
Where is Vice Minister Shangguan?

23
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,510
I lost her.

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,150
No.

25
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,250
How can you be so careless?

26
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,590
What if she

27
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,650
runs into trouble?

28
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,270
I didn't want this to happen.

29
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,960
You're useless even if you're given the chance.

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,980
You can't be saved.

31
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,950
Who said that?

32
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,110
Vice Minister.

33
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,460
Clues have been found.

34
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,070
What?

35
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,790
What’s your name?

36
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,590
I’m Ms. Kou.

37
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,560
Qin Wan pawned a qin

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,360
at Liu Yaoshi's place for a loan.

39
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,530
You redeemed it

40
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,760
and then the qin was stolen？

41
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,190
Yes.

42
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,610
Du Cheng asked me to redeem it.

43
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,270
He gave me the money.

44
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,750
What’s your relationship with Du Cheng?

45
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,079
He is my...

46
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,440
What qin was it?

47
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,400
I don't know,

48
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,430
but it seemed very valuable.

49
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,190
Du Cheng is just

50
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,670
a down-and-out umbrella maker.

51
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,420
How could he have

52
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,090
the money for you to redeem the qin?

53
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,790
I don't know

54
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,360
where he got the money from.

55
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,350
He asked me to redeem the qin,

56
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,430
so I did it.

57
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,440
Did you know Du Cheng took drugs?

58
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,460
Yes.

59
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,070
You knew,

60
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,130
but you still stayed with him?

61
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,590
As a weak woman,

62
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,220
I've submitted to him,

63
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,450
so what else could I do?

64
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,630
Besides, I always thought he could change.

65
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,829
Entrusting yourself

66
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,990
to the wrong person would waste

67
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,829
your life.

68
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:19,810
Ms. Kou,

69
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,230
did you know Qin Wan?

70
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,050
Du Cheng mentioned him before.

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,290
How much do you know

72
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,520
about their relationship?

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,720
I only know

74
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,070
they often

75
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,830
took drugs together before.

76
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,950
Before?

77
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,710
Yes.

78
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,640
At Qin Wan's place?

79
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,440
Du Cheng didn't have much money.

80
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,740
Some time ago,

81
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,510
he tried to get closer to Qin Wan.

82
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,120
He said that Qin Wan's Five Minerals Powder

83
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,320
was better and purer.

84
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,070
I can't believe people would freeload powder.

85
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,120
Du Cheng said

86
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,750
Qin Wan's Five Minerals Powder

87
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,350
seemed to be made by himself.

88
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,720
Qin Wan

89
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,000
made the Five Minerals Powder himself?

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,470
Yes.

91
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,510
Du Cheng said

92
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,870
Qin Wan was treating

93
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,350
the Five Minerals Powder as medicine.

94
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,250
He thought it could cure his own illness.

95
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,910
Then what?

96
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,110
Then

97
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,690
Qin Wan and Du Cheng

98
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,290
gradually drifted apart.

99
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,490
Why?

100
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,800
It seemed that a drug dealer

101
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,560
wanted to buy Qin Wan's formula

102
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,580
and asked Du Cheng to be the middle man.

103
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,510
Qin Wan refused,

104
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,870
so—

105
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,510
Yes.

106
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,110
It must be that this drug dealer failed

107
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,170
to get the formula,

108
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,170
so he killed Qin Wan with Du Cheng.

109
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,790
Then he killed Du Cheng to silence him.

110
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,750
I found that Du Cheng went to

111
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,590
a drug dealer before to get medicine

112
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,710
for his waist injury.

113
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,370
It was a healer surnamed Zhao.

114
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,800
The Five Minerals Powder near Shengping Mansion

115
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,980
all came from him.

116
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,850
So the accomplice is here?

117
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,440
Let's investigate now.

118
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,490
Soar into the sky and become an immortal.

119
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,120
Shangguan.

120
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,150
Soar into the sky and become an immortal.

121
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,390
I alone am revered.

122
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,490
Soar into the sky and become an immortal.

123
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,390
I alone am revered.

124
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,790
Soar into the sky and become an immortal.

125
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,430
I alone am revered.

126
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,550
Soar into the sky.

127
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,520
You are the so-called Healer Zhao?

128
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,030
Who are you?

129
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,770
How dare you stop me from inviting the deity in the daytime?

130
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,030
The immortal descends to the mortal world.

131
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,120
The one to welcome him has arrived.

132
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,430
He subdues dragons and tigers,

133
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,130
extracts the yang and fill in the yin.

134
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,350
Today,

135
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,160
he will succeed.

136
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,120
Become an immortal.

137
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,090
Five Minerals Powder.

138
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,230
Arrest him!

139
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,230
Go!

140
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,460
How is he so strong?

141
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,340
I haven't become an immortal yet. The medicine isn't enough.

142
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,160
Again.

143
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,520
Sun Bao, use more strength.

144
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,460
He's so heavy.

145
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,200
I didn’t expect that this time,

146
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,030
Vice Minister Shangguan would steal the show.

147
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:02,970
How are you?

148
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,200
Vice Minister Shangguan.

149
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,670
Qin Wan hid the Five Minerals Powder

150
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,470
in the qin.

151
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,990
This is the residual powder.

152
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,120
It seems

153
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,060
that they really killed him

154
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,840
for the Five Minerals Powder.

155
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,059
Maybe the case can be closed now.

156
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,070
What's wrong?

157
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:41,919
Nothing.

158
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,480
You are the top contributor

159
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,160
in solving this case.

160
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,710
Of course.

161
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,550

162
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,920
the vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review for many years.

Solving a case

164
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,410
is nothing difficult.

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,510
Mr. Li,

166
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,190
what are you thinking about?

167
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,900
This case

168
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,030
seems to make sense,

169
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,110
but it still feels

170
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,640
like something is missing.

171
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,100
Mr. Li, don't move.

172
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,760
Don't move.

173
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,510
Look at this.

174
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,350
Look.

175
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,070

178
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,470
The case is closed.

179
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,530
You can go back now.

180
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,710
Yes, Madam.

181
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,650
Go back and rest well.

188
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,880
Since you saw

189
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,390
the qin when investigating,

190
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,030
did you see a qin tassel?

191
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,750

Thank you, Madam.

Why was your tassel

202
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,970
on Qin Wan's qin?

203
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,670
Back then, Du Cheng wanted to win Qin Wan over,

204
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,830
so he wanted to use this to please him.

205
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,630

on this qin tassel?

209
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,950
It's a pollia flower.

210
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,990
I simply think

211
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,110
that it's pretty.

It doesn't mean anything.

Later, you were expelled from the Qin Mansion

because Qin Shu believed

He was good.

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,680
He played the qin well

314
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,990
playing the qin well,

There was nothing

Because of him,

00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,910
Wan's personality gradually changed.

330
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,600

331
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,630
He became less and less efficient too.

Sometimes,

333
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,690
he couldn't even play the qin

334
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,710
because his hand

335
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,640
was too swollen from the beatings.

336
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,170
That wasn't all.

337
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,480
Qin Shu even smashed his qin.

That was why

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,400
I acted against him.

343
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,319
That day,

344
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,339
he came in, hugging his qin.

345
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,589
His clothes were all torn

346
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,990
and his face was bruised.

347
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,260
I could barely recognize him.

348
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,830
Only then did I know

349
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,520
that he was expelled from the family.

350
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,510
The debt collectors were after him and he had nowhere to go.

351
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,910
That was why he came to me.

352
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,510
I was angry and heartbroken,

353
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,030
so I locked him in the room

354
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,430
for seven days

355
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,130

356
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,120
I even helped him pay off his debt.

00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,020
Compared to his life,

361
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,790
his qin was nothing.

362
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,390
Later, I took him

363
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,360
to live in his side yard.

364
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,700
We planted flowers one by one,

raised fish,

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,830
and planted bamboo.

367
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,210
Gradually,

368
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,470
it became somewhere

369
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,000
suitable for one to live in.

370
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,000
I liked Wan very much.

371
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,230
He liked me too.

372
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,030
He even said he would marry me

373
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,540
and be my husband.

374
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,360
So,

375
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,590
when the people from the Imperial College said he was married,

376
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,590
it wasn't a lie.

377
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,030
But in the end,

378
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,430
Wan died because of me.

379
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,280
After he recovered,

380
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,450
he asked the Minister of Rites to intercede

381
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,200
and went home

382
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,240
to see Qin Shu.

383
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,830
He wanted to ask Qin Shu to forgive himself.

384
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,920
Wan didn't have

385
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
any other wishes.

386
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,270
He just hoped

00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,640
that when he married me,

388
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,170
Qin Shu could officiate the wedding.

389
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,350
Wan still couldn't forget

390
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,190
his admiration for his brother.

391
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,110
He was such

392
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,910
a kind person,

393
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,820
but Qin Shu ignored him.

394
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,590
I thought it didn't matter.

395
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,510
I thought that as long as

396
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,790
we could live together peacefully,

397
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,030
it would be enough.

398
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,630
But one day,

399
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,640
Wan suddenly said

400
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,670
that he wanted to review his studies

401
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,670
and return to the Imperial College.

402
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,470
He wanted to seek fame

403
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,470
and build a future for us.

404
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,680
He wanted Qin Shu to give him recognition.

405
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,390
He said he needed to study without distractions

406
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,590
and I supported that,

407
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,430
so I didn't go to the side yard anymore

408
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,290
to disturb him.

409
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,450
After a few days,

410
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,240
I still felt worried.

411
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,720
When I went to visit him,

412
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,350
I found him

413
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,410
making drugs.

414
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,670
The Five Minerals Powder?

415
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,110
Yes.

416
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,360
He lied to me.

417
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,670
I was furious.

418
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,490
I asked him why he lied.

419
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
He said Du Cheng and that drug dealer

420
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,550
came to him

421
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,350
immediately after he went home.

422
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,670
They forced him to produce the Five Minerals Powder again.

423
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,240
Otherwise, they would harm me

424
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,680
and expel me from Shendu.

425
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,520
He gave in to them

426
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,700
in order to protect you?

427
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,790
That wasn't all.

428
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,620
Qin Wan wanted to escape,

429
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,670
but they recaptured him

430
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,130
and chained him in the yard

431
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,030
like a dog.

432
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,130
They forbade him from leaving

433
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,850
until he surrendered.

434
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,120
After I learned of the whole story,

435
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,620
I wanted to take him away,

436
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,830
away from that yard

437
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,860
and Shendu,

438
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,430
but at that time,

439
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,660
Qin Shu came again.

440
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,670
You really can't imagine

441
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,620
how vulgar and horrible

442
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,540
the words

443
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,190
of a noble Chancellor

444
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,910
could be.

445
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,000
He even told Qin Wan to insult me together.

446
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,870
What did Qin Wan do?

447
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,170
He told me to leave.

448
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,730
He told me to leave Shendu.

449
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,290
This is your stuff.

450
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,680
Get lost.

451
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,670
Wan,

452
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,720
why are you doing this to me?

453
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,610
Destroy it.

454
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,030
Go.

455
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,270
Go!

456
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,130
Get lost!

457
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,260
Get lost!

458
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,110
Get out!

459
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,950
Get out of here!

460
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,170
After I left,

461
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,130
I was upset

462
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,950
but also pondered

463
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,060
what he meant.

464
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,950
Had Qin Wan already

465
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,010
produced the drug?

466
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,170
I vaguely figured something out,

467
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,350
so I went back.

468
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,760
It was suicide?

469
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,390
In order to force him to make the drugs,

470
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,620
it wasn't enough to use me to threaten him.

471
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,330
They even forced him to take the Five Minerals Powder again.

472
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,680
Wan once told me

473
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,340
that if he took it again,

474
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,740
he would commit suicide.

475
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,220
I even asked him to make a vow.

476
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,610
Who would have thought

477
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,930
that it would come true?

478
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,630
When I looked at Wan at the time,

479
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,830
I actually

480
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,270
didn't feel any sadness.

481
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,840
I was full of hatred.

482
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,210
So you wanted to take revenge?

483
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,240
At first,

484
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,590
I just found it strange.

485
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,180
Why did Du Cheng and the drug dealer

486
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,420
go to the residence as soon as

487
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,660
Qin Wan went home?

488
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,930
So, I found Du Cheng

489
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,190
and used the drugs left by Qin Wan

490
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,920
to lure him to reveal the truth.

491
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,110
I didn’t expect

492
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,670
that the one

493
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,930
who ordered Du Cheng and that drug dealer

494
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,670
was Qin Shu.

495
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,150
The one who

496
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,830
gave Qin Wan the drug in the first place

497
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,830
was also Qin Shu.

498
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,230
Eat this

499
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,410
when you're scared.

500
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,450
What Qin Shu gave him

501
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,210
was the Five Minerals Powder

502
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,410
that he usually took.

503
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,130
After Qin Wan left home,

504
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,670
Qin Shu kept watching him.

505
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,960
Du Cheng was his spy.

506
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,790
That drug dealer

507
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,910
was the person

508
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,460
who made the Five Minerals Powder for him.

509
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,530
What a beast.

510
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,920
A wolf in sheep's clothing.

511
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,140
Qin Wan was the fool.

512
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,940
He always thought

513
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,830
that Qin Shu did all this for his own good.

514
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,370
Even after he left home,

515
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,820
he produced the Five Minerals Powder

516
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,030
because he wanted to make the medicine

517
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,960
to cure himself.

518
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,070
In reality,

519
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,470
he wasn't sick at all

520
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,590
and the so-called medicine

521
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,140
was poison.

522
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,250
You were Qin Wan's medicine.

523
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,960
Qin Shu just wanted to control Qin Wan.

524
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,490
That's why he used such an evil method.

525
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,780
It's unbelievable.

526
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,260
This kind of person indeed deserves to die.

527
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,490
I didn't kill them.

528
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,990
I sprinkled the drug

529
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,010
in the qin handkerchief and gave it to Du Cheng.

530
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,070
He took it himself.

531
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,310
Healer Zhao couldn't find the drug,

532
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,110
so he stole the qin from me again.

533
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,020
They said the drug was medicine.

534
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,000
A magic pill.

535
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,540
Become an immortal.

536
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,550
Qin Shu thought so too.

537
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,640
Then,

538
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,570
what was with the drugs in the qin?

539
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,390
I told them

540
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,280
it was hidden in the qin.

541
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,740
That way, they would believe

542
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,630
that it was made by Qin Wan.

543
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,710
They were eager to take it.

544
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,270
Vice Ministers,

545
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,830
the Chancellor,

546
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,960
Lord Qin Shu,

547
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,310
has passed away.

548
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,250
It indeed is not medicine.

549
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,790
It's poison.

770
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,600
Light it up.

771
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,210
Light it.

772
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,020
Mr. Li,

773
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,080
you must have eavesdropped.

774
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,110
I didn't.

775
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,420
How did you know it was a ghost story?

776
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,190
I guessed.

777
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,230
Guess?

778
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,430
Let's go.

779
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,310
You guessed?

780
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,690
Vice Minister.

781
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,950
Mr. Cui.

782
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,690
[Court of Judicial Review]

783
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,350
What's wrong with him?

784
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,430
If you have the time to listen to their nonsense,

785
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,570
why don't you spend more time

786
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,570
learning to read?

787
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,240
Mr. Li,

788
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,660
I did.

789
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,520
I even wrote five pages.

790
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,540
But listening to them

791
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,780
teaches me a lot too.

792
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,470
Mr. Li,

793
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,390
do ferocious spirits really exist?

794
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,310
A gentleman doesn't talk about superstitions.

795
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,140
But Mr. Wang and the others

796
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,350
talked like it was all true.

797
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,110
They talked as if it was all true,

798
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,070
but you can't believe it all.

799
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,000
You can become a cat.

800
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,460
What else can't I believe?

801
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,310
Mr. Li, what if

802
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,060
we run into a ferocious spirit?

803
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,080
Suspicion breeds problems, understand?

804
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,280
No, I don't understand. What does it mean?

805
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,520
You will only see ghosts

806
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,080
if you feel fear inside.

807
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,440
I get it.

808
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,250
So,

809
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,750
as long as I'm not afraid,

810
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,760
I won't run into ferocious spirits.

811
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,870
Well,

812
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,600
I guess you can say that.

813
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,240
It's getting late. Get some rest.

814
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,830
Got it.

815
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,650
Then it's all good.

816
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,980
Mr. Li.

817
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,430
I'm still a little scared.

818
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,900
Go to bed.

819
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,470
Okay.

820
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,510
Mr. Li.

821
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:38,670
Mr. Li.

822
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,750
Mr. Li, you...

823
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:49,950
You...

824
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,330
Mr. Li,

825
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,290
you seem to have caught a cold.

826
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,510
No.

827
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,470
What's going on?

828
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,270
The window...

829
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,750
Why is it leaking air?

830
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,110
I remember

831
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,950
I closed it last night.

832
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:07,470
No.

833
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,560
I'll make some ginger soup.

834
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,400
Chen Shi.

835
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,430
Add some shredded radish to the ginger soup.

836
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,630
It can remove the heat

837
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,590
and expel the cold.

838
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,030
Okay.

839
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,510
-It expels the cold.
-Thank you, Uncle Cai.

840
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,240
It's enough.

841
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,350
No, put more in.

842
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,030
All of it?

843
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,790
Yes.

844
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,660
Okay.

845
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,920
That's right.

846
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,510
Okay.

847
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,190
Thank you, Uncle Cai.

848
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,100
Weird.

849
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,320
There's a heavy ginger smell.

850
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,140
No.

851
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,020
Why are you making this

852
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,350
so early in the morning?

853
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,430
Well,

854
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,230
Mr. Li caught a cold.

855
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,300
What were you murmuring about?

856
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,590
I just think

857
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,670
Mr. Li's illness is a bit strange.

858
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,870
I clearly shut the window

859
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,600
when I left last night,

860
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,660
but Mr. Li still caught a cold.

861
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,590
Did he run into Cui Bei?

862
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,460
How did you know, Mr. Sun?

863
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,060
Really?

864
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,090
You don't know,

865
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,020
but when we went out,

866
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,290
we happened to run into Mr. Cui.

867
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,110
He had his head lowered

868
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,510
and didn't say anything.

869
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,650
Let me tell you.

870
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,990
I want to know too.

871
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:30,990
M—

872
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,800
Mr. Li.

873
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,470
Sir.

874
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,350
Actually, Cui Bei is the one in the story

875
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,670
who is haunted by the ferocious spirit,

876
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,520
so you must be careful today.

877
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,230
Do you think I'll believe you?

878
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:50,870
It's true.

879
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,850
We're saying this because we have

880
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,780
experienced it.

881
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,830
Ask them if you don't believe me.

882
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,580
I guess

883
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,030
it's a little.

884
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,150
I didn't say that.

885
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,350
I have a strong fate.

886
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,510
Ordinary strange things

887
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,630
can't get close to me.

888
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,310
Then why did you ward off the bad luck with me?

889
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:05,750
I...

890
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,710
It's just in case.

891
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,320
Because Cui Bei

892
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,610
always acts weird

893
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,050
during Qing Ming.

894
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,750
-Qing Ming?
-Yes.

895
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,020
Do you remember

896
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,870
Qing Ming two years ago?

897
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,190
Yes.

898
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,390
It was the year we joined the Court of Judicial Review together.

899
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,190
It was

900
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,880
also the night of Qing Ming.

901
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,910
Don't go.

902
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,110
Don't go.

903
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,920
Don't go.

904
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,030
Don't go.

905
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,230
Don't go!

906
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,130
I didn't go!

907
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,910
What happened? Did you have a nightmare?

908
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:46,990
I'm fine.

909
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,780
When we woke up the next day,

910
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,310
all of us

911
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,430
were groggy,

912
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,600
like we'd been haunted.

913
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,260
We could barely get out of bed.

914
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,790
Only Cui Bei was fine.

915
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,290
What is it?

916
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,120
Last time...

917
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,750
Last time we investigated in the Imperial College,

918
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,510
one of Cui Bei's old classmates

919
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,750
said many weird things.

920
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,430
Alright.

921
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,440
It's all nonsense.

922
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,790
You sound more and more ridiculous.

923
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,410
Sir,

924
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,020
we're not targeting Cui Bei.

925
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,150
Cui Bei was the one who told us

926
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,750
the story of the ferocious spirit.

927
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,920
He also told us

928
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,670
to stay away from him

929
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,670
during Qing Ming.

930
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,150
He said it himself?

931
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,680
I remember that.

932
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,870
Cui Bei said that when we were approaching Qing Ming

933
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:34,860
last year.

934
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,990
However, he wasn't here

935
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,280
on the day of Qing Ming.

936
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,880
Speaking of which,

937
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,440
I haven't seen Mr. Cui today.

938
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,960
He went out early in the morning.

939
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,430
When I saw him last night,

940
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,470
he seemed sneaky.

941
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
He's purposely avoiding us.

942
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,120
Why?

943
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,570
He asked Mr. Yuan for his Ba-Zi before.

944
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,480
Could it be related to this?

945
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,700
[Court of Judicial Review]
