[Episode 1]

4
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,850
During the reign of His Majesty,

5
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,180
the Emperor traveled to Shendu

6
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,680
and all nations came to the court.

7
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,880
During prosperous times,

8
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,490
there will always be turbulence.

9
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,380
Fortunately, there is the Court of Judicial Review

10
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,550
to be in charge of all prisons

11
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,130
and uphold justice.

12
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,729
Unexpectedly,

13
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,140
three years ago,

14
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,770
[Court of Judicial Review]

15
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,079
the Minister of Judicial Review was assassinated and died.

16
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,940
With that, the Court of Judicial Review has been on the decline.

17
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,120
The situation got more chaotic...

18
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,970
Right now,

19
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,300
there's even a rumor going around about a demon cat

20
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,900
murdering people in Shendu.

21
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,670
Sir, come in.

22
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,030
Sir, come in.

23
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,430
Come and play.

24
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,070
Good!

25
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,829
Let me accompany you.

26
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,790
Sir.

27
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,710
Let me hug you.

28
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,960
Why did it stop?

29
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,020
My Lord,

30
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,710
it's time to cross the bridge.

31
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,620
Go then!

32
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,590
My Lord.

33
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,829
Th-This is a little strange.

34

My Lord,

35
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,450
there's something wrong with the horse too.

36
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,030
How about

37
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,350
we go back to the pavilion first?

38
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,150
Why is the fog

39
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,650
so strange?

40
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,640
It's none of your business.

41
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,550
Go inside.

42
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,350
The night curfew is coming.

43
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,940
I'm on duty tonight.

44
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,930
It's just fog.

45
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,250
Go!

46
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,190
Okay, My Lord.

48
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,770
Wait for me.

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,560

What is this?

124
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,630
It's so fascinating.

125
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,150
Who left this here?

126
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,480
What is this?

127
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,970
It's... blood?

128
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,200
You're quite powerful.

But...

133
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,240
But I'm illiterate.

134

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,860
Well...

You're quite something.

Come again if it was good.

144
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,480
Take care.

145
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,590
It's late. The shop is closed.

146
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,620
Come again next time.

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,270
Madam,

148
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,380
have you seen

149
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,510
a little girl?

150
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,560
I didn't see her.

151
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,510
She's right there!

152
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,630
She not only ate my buns,

153
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,710
but also stole my money.

154
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,230
Little girl, you...

155
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,670
Look at you.

156
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,430
I was wondering where your bun

157
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:18,950
came from.

158
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,410
Did you take his money too?

159
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,770
Forget it.

160
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,390
Madam.

161
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
She's so young.

162
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,900
You can't

163
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,910
steal again.

164
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,490
Especially not money.

165
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,110
Got it?

166
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,770
Give him the money.

We aren't going to receive other guests anyway.

I'll serve you a bowl of good wine

171
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,230
as an apology to the little girl.

172
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,190
No, no, no.

173
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:46,830
Don't stand on ceremony.

174
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,550
No need.

175
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,180
Who is it?

176
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,840
The shop is closed. We are not–

Of course we are still receiving guests.

178
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,220
We can't turn you away.

179
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,160
Sir,

180
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,640
you are so magnificent.

181
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,030
Where are you from?

182
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,380
Please have a seat.

183
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,250
Have a seat.

184
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,440
Come on.

185
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,090
Sit.

186
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,240
I am the Prince of Persia.

187
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,380
A friend from afar

188
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,040
is not easy to take care off.

189
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,870
This is

190
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,600
the Prince of Persia from afar.

191
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,830
He will be attending

192
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,430
Meng Chun ritual in a few days.

193
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,540
If you don't treat him well,

194
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,750
you won't be able to afford it.

195
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,870
If you want to cover it up,

196
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,710
just don't speak.

197
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,190
This official's Mandarin

198
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,950
is really...

199
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,790
unique!

200
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,480
Really?

201
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,310
So I have a chance

202
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,910
at getting level 8 in Mandarin?

203
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,270
What does that mean?

204
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,330
Keep a low profile.

205
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,230
This is a royal secret.

206
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:37,910
Don't ask.

207
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,620
Prince, you must be tired from the long journey.

208
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,380
I'll serve you some good wine.

209
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,420
Well...

210
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,230
Prince, we still have a long way to go.

211
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,370
What are you doing?

212
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,150
Where are you from?

213
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,800
Golden hair, high nose.

214
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,130
Your eyes...

215
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,840
Why

216
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,510
is it yellow?

217
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,950
Haven't you seen a foreigner?

218
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,150
There are all types of people.

219
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,550
Don't make a fuss.

220
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,590
But I'm just curious

221
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,910
how your hair grew.

222
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,150
It's curly.

223
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,990
Why is it like this?

224
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,520
Just look, don't touch.

225
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,500
Sirs, here.

226
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
Good wine is here.

227
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,530
It's cold outside.

228
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,450
Drink some wine to warm your body.

229
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,300
Here.

230
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:26,830
Drink it.

231
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,520
Drink, gentlemen.

232
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,570
Sir,

233
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,830
is it cooling outside?

234
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,030
Yes.

235
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,830
Then

236
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,370
stay where it's cooling.

237
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,870
All right.

238
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,060
Sir, it's fine. Drink it.

239
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,400
Madam!

240
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,340
I have something to tell you.

241
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,490
There's a garment among

242
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,250
the grass outside. Whose is it?

243
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,700
It's my old clothes.

244
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,850
I was going to throw it away.

245
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,430
Maybe

246
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,980
a stray cat brought it back.

247
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,040
But there's blood

248
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,140
on the clothes.

249
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,680
What's going on?

250
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,340
There are many stray cats nearby.

251
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,070
A few days ago, I was chased by a stray cat

252
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,930
and got scratched several times.

253
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,430
Sirs, please drink.

254
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,330
It's fine.

255
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,160
Warm yourself up.

256
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,120
That wild cat

257
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,800
looked quite sensible.

258
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,750
How could it scratch you?

259
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,100
Madam.

260
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,950
Wait a minute.

261
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,600
Let me look for something for you.

262
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,800
Madam,

263
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,390
before I left the village,

264
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,640
I brought this.

265
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,300
Thinking it might be useful some day.

266
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,690
It can heal cat stratches.

267
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,870
This is for taking, and this is for applying.

268
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,000
It's common for cats to scratch and dogs to bite in my village.

269
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,460
Use it as soon as possible.

270
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,650
Young man, you look like a good man.

271
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,290
I won't hold you up.

272
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,820
I'll be on my way then.

273
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,610
Take care.

274
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,440
Okay.

275
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,910
No, no, no.

276
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,750
What now?

277
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,610
One more thing.

278
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,710
Go ahead.

279
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,590
Fireworks.

280
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,880
What fireworks?

281
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,350
Isn't there fireworks

282
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,570
in the clothes at the door?

283
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,060
I didn't know what it was at first,

284
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,310
so I set it off.

285
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,970
Madam.

286
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,270
They have knives on them.

287
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,510
I'm afraid they are robbers.

288
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,810
Why is Shendu

289
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,440
so messy?

290
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
None of you can get out today.

291
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,270
You little wench.

292
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,270
I am the judge of the Court of Judicial Review,

293
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,030
Alibaba.

294
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,790
I am the judicial commissioner of the Court of Judicial Review, Sun Bao.

295
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,270
I'm here to investigate the case and capture the culprit.

296
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,890
[Sun Bao] [Alibaba]

297
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,030
Surrender now.

298
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,150
The Court of Judicial Review?

299
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,470
What? Are you scared?

300
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,460
Where are the people you kidnapped?

301
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,000
Where are you going?

302
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,950
I'm not a bad person.

303
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,870
I'm not a bad person.

304
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,300
I know you're not.

305
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,200
You have to be the witness.

306
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,790
If this case is solved,

307
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,850
you'll get a share.

308
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,770
Isn't that your daughter?

309
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,040
What daughter?

310
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,030
She's just a thief I use

311
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,230
to lure in customers.

312
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,130
Don't move.

313
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,119
Useless!

314
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,720
Put down the knife.

315
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,550
You want to be a hero?

316
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,170
I'll kill you first.

317
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,900
Put down the knife.

318
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,230
Wild cat!

319
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,630
Bastard!

320
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,750
Don't move!

321
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,840
[Shangguan Qin]

322
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,890
[Hu Si]

323
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,700
Is this how

324
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,650
the two of you solve cases?

325
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,470
Vice Minister Shangguan.

326
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,990
Wh-Why are you here?

327
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,310
Look at your outfits.

328
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,310
You look nothing like

329
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,890
an official of the Court of Judicial Review.

330
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,220
This is nonsense.

331
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,830
I...

332
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,270
I...

333
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,020
Vice Minister,

334
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,390
don't scold him.

335
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,930
He can't stand it.

336
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,720
Today is really a bad day.

337
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,490
We're just following orders.

338
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,590
You set off

339
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,030
the Court of Judicial Review signal fireworks

340
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,990
at the gate too?

341
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,670
At least you're not that stupid.

342
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,870
You know how to leave yourself a way out.

343
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,490
Take them all away!

344
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,710
Wild cat?

345
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,020
Cat?

346
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,560
Chen Shi.

347
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,110
Listen.

348
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,870
This is the Court of Judicial Review

349
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,340
where justice is upheld and evils are punished.

350
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,270
You have to tell me the truth.

351
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:26,870
If you lie,

352
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,130
I will not forgive you!

353
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,230
I told you everything.

354
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,860
I didn't lie.

355
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,060
You were the one who kept smacking that–

356
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,350
You're still saying you didn't lie?

357
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,680
You said cats can write?

358
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,540
It's true.

359
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,750
I don't know what word it was.

360
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,270
But it just looked like it...

361
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
Looked like what?

362
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm illiterate.

363
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,420
So it just looked like it.

364
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,680
There's no lie in this.

365
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,880
What word was it?

366
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,350
I just remember it was something like...

367
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,950
Like...

368
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,790
Like...

369
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,310
Like!

370
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,370
[Go]

371
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,040
Madam,

372
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,680
it seems to be a word "walk."

373
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,080
I don't need you to tell me that.

374
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,950
According to you,

375
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,320
the Court of Judicial Review signal fireworks

376
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,070
was also set off

377
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,030
by this wild cat?

378
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,710
Madam,

379
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,280
you finally believe me!

380
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,080
Ridiculous!

381
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,110
Please calm down, Madam.

382
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:44,830
Wang Qi,

383
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,270
I was going to hold you accountable.

384
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,550
What's wrong with them?

385
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,710
Madam is great in every other aspect

386
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,190
except the fact that she likes to smack the gavel too often.

387
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,270
She broke four pieces this month.

388
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,070
You are right.

389
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:52,950
Does Vice Minister Shangguan

390
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,550
like to listen to loud things?

391
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,480
I'll buy some firecrackers in Meng Chun in a few days–

392
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,750
Madam,

393
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,870
I received reports last June

394
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,260
that foreigners went missing

395
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,030
in Shendu.

396
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,830
I suspect

397
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,750
someone is hiding in the markets

398
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,830
to chose outsiders

399
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,430
to harvest from them,

400
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,110
hide them, and sell them off.

401
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,040
They kill people and steal goods.

402
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,170
It's unforgivable.

403
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,910
I...

404
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,310
received a tip-off.

405
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,990
The perpetrator is highly likely

406
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,780
to be a pair of male and female bandits.

407
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,630
To solve this case,

408
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,350
I made a detailed

409
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,060
and thorough plan.

410
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,320
As expected of him.

411
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,830
He's good at making up stories.

412
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,710
Go on.

413
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,430
According to the information I gathered

414
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,100
of the missing before they disappeared,

415
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,910
I have basically confirmed the area they went missing in.

416
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,290
It is somewhere in that alley.

417
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,540
So I decided

418
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,790
to lure the snake out of its hole.

419
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,510
Cui Bei.

420
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,140
Tell me about it.

421
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,760
[Cui Bei]

422
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,000
Yesterday morning,

423
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,110
we held a meeting at Mingjing Hall.

424
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,830
Wang Qi said,

425
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,890
"Sun Bao, Alibaba,

426
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,430
in order to solve the case,

427
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,560
go be the bait."

428
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,280
Alibaba said,

429
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,980
"Why don't you go?"

430
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,490
Sun Bao said, "Exactly."

431
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,110
Wang Qi said, "I...

432
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,070
have to stay to deal with

433
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,600
Vice Minister Shangguan–"

434
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,940
Vice Minister Shangguan

435
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,670
is wise.

436
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,030
You can't stand even a single grain of sand in your eyes.

437
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,350
Cui Bei.

438
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,830
I told you not to note down useless things.

439
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,300
Madam.

440
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,590
This is my plan.

441
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,620
First, let Sun Bao and Alibaba

442
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,260
disguise as rich fat sheep,

443
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,390
luring the male and female bandits to take action

444
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,390
while I take both of them down.

445
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,590
You said I'm a prince?

446
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,750
You wish!

447
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,230
I asked you to act as

448
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,550
the Prince of Persia.

449
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,350
As for Sun Bao...

450
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,470
You can act as...

451
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,350
a servant of a prince.

452
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,270
Servant?

453
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,210
As for Cui Bei,

454
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,630
you can act as a study partner.

455
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,470
Me?

456
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,830
Are you sure?

457
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,440
On October 8,

458
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,570
Hu Si escorted a criminal to Mingjing Hall.

459
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,060
I was washing my inkstone at the hall.

460
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,110
My fingers slipped

461
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,340
and the inkstone hit Hu Si.

462
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,030
Hu Si was in a coma for three days.

463
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,550
The criminal was crushed by Hu Si

464
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,670
and fractured his arm.

465
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,230
He still hasn't recovered yet.

466
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,560
On the 5th of this month,

467
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,310
Alibaba invited you, me, and Sun Bao

468
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,870
to visit Zuixian Residence.

469
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,270
I just left the Court of Judicial Review...

470
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,460
It was really strange.

471
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,270
It's already winter now.

472
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,670
Yet it suddenly started raining so heavily.

473
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,990
It was raining and snowing.

474
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,270
And went on for two to three days.

475
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,030
Even the water level in the moat has risen.

476
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,830
Alibaba and I

477
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,630
were drenched

478
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,670
and had a high fever for days.

479
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,000
Wang Qi was fine though.

480
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,950
Don't mention this anymore.

481
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,790
I feel cold whenever I mention it.

482
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,850
I was thoughtless.

483
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,470
Cui Bei.

484
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,060
You don't have to go.

485
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,430
You're so capable

486
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,570
of bringing disaster.

487
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,310
You may very well

488
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,590
never come back.

489
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,510
You might die

490
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,000
with those bandits accidentally.

491
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,730
In that case, Alibaba, Sun Bao,

492
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,630
a prince, and a servant,

493
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,350
it should be enough.

494
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,630
Having me to disguise as a prince

495
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,550
is ridiculous

496
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,270
and would bring harm.

497
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,630
You have money anyway.

498
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,310
You can buy a set of nice clothes

499
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,590
and get the chance to enjoy being a prince.

500
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,750
What's wrong with that?

501
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,630
Soon,

502
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,270
the Meng Chun ritual is coming.

503
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:55,790
Who knows?

504
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,630
Some foreign princes might come

505
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,710
to join in the fun.

506
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,330
Foreigners are always fascinating.

507
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,670
These human traffickers

508
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,840
can't help themselves but take action

509
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,360
when they see such fat sheep.

510
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,000
Besides,

511
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,080
the assessment is coming.

512
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,000
Don't you want to make a great contribution

513
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,070
and let Mingjing Hall

514
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,330
get noticed by Vice Minister Shangguan?

515
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,600
Also, Alibaba.

516
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,740
Think about it.

517
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,630
You wearing a whole set of clothes

518
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,430
that of the Prince of Persia...

519
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,020
What are you talking about?

520
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,430
Why isn't he charging us?

521
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,710
Persian people are welcomed here.

522
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,460
And he treats us like brothers.

523
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,350
The boss is nice.

524
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,330
Let's go.

525
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,430
Where are we going?

526
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,070
Let's go.

527
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,140
Wait, you...

528
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,100
I...

529
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,030
I've paid.

530
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,300
Don't worry.

531
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,640
Let's go.

532
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:12,890
This way.

533
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,710
Apprehending two major criminals

534
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,970
and showing up in front of Vice Minister Shangguan...

535
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,590
How mighty would that be!

536
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,880
I'm willing to do that!

537
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,270
I'll cooperate.

538
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,830
Madam,

539
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,130
although this plan is simple,

540
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,630
it's still a success.

541
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,510
If it's really a success,

542
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,470
would there still be a need for me

543
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,000
to clean up the mess for you?

544
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,630
In any way,

545
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,910
we still caught the suspect.

546
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,470
Wang Qi.

547
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,690
This is not easy.

548
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,670
This is the first time

549
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,330
Mingjing Hall has solved a case.

550
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,860
Yet you want to take credit?

551
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,000
Of course.

552
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,810
No, no...

553
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,590
But in my opinion,

554
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,550
this case,

555
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,240
If it weren't for this...

556
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,350
Chen Shi.

557
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,020
If it weren't for Chen Shi,

558
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,920
and that cat,

559
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,240
I'm afraid it wouldn't get cracked.

560
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,060
Vice Minister,

561
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,070
you can't say that.

562
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,900
Although that cat

563
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,760
helped us a lot,

564
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,310
this...

565
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,550
But to crack this case,

566
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,260
it required my flawless

567
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,040
and detailed plan.

568
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,390
I still have my suspicions about this case.

569
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,000
If what Chen Shi said is true,

570
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,790
that he was accidentally involved,

571
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,470
could a cat do so many things?

572
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,690
That wild cat is really something.

573
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,950
I've never seen such a magical cat.

574
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,310
No matter how powerful it is, it's still a cat.

575
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,240
Did you catch it?

576
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,510
-In the prison.
-In the prison.

577
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,150
Madam,

578
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,230
it's in the prison.

579
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,830
All right.

580
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,060
Throw him in it too.

581
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,690
Okay, huh?

582
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,550
He is a good man.

583
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,510
But he is a good man.

584
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,370
He's a good man.

585
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,520
I really am not–

586
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,550
Wang Qi!

587
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,270
Madam,

588
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,070
why?

589
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,070
A cat can solve cases, write,

590
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,440
and can do so many things.

591
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,960
If this Chen Shi isn't making stuff up,

592
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,470
there must be someone who has ordered him to do so.

593
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,310
I suspect...

594
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,190
No.

595
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,150
There must be something wrong here.

596
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,150
Something wrong?

597
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,110
What can be wrong?

598
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,590
I'm telling the truth.

599
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,670
Madam, I...

600
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,300
The two of them can be the witness.

601
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,750
Yes.

602
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,310
We can be witness.

603
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,630
Can I believe your words?

604
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,630
It's been two years.

605
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,140
Mingjing Hall

606
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,800
hasn't solve any proper case.

607
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,170
Just as the Meng Chun ritual is about to come

608
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,190
as well as the Court of Judicial Review's official assessment,

609
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,990
and that people are about to be dismissed,

610
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,230
you solved a case.

611
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,480
Who knows if

612
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,810
there's something up your sleeves.

613
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:08,950
Although these two criminals

614
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,870
have been arrested,

615
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,590
it'd be difficult for you Mingjing Hall

616
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,790
to claim this credit.

617
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,710
I advise you

618
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,270
don't do such things

619
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,940
and focus on serious things.

620
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,710

621
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,180

622
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,030
Madam,

623
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,180
this is targeting us.

624
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,160
What did you say?

625
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,550
Madam, please investigate it clearly.

626
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,870
Fine.

627
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,160
Take him away then.

628
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,430
-Yes.
-Yes.

629
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,110
Let's go.

630
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,860
I'm the witness.

631
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,670
Let's go.

632
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,350
Go.

633
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,870
What's that sound?

634
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,540
It sounds so creepy.

635
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,960
I don't know.

636
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,150
I don't want to know either.

637
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:09,880
Don't ask me.

638
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,880
It's that wild cat.

639
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,510
The wild cat?

640
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,460
Go in by yourselves.

641
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,380
Wild cat!

642
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,750
Where are you?

643
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,560
Wild cat!

644
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,680

00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,890
It's me, wild cat.

00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,490
Wild cat!

648
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,430
Don't be afraid. It's me.

649
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:47,650
Wild cat!

650
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,140
It's me, wild cat.

651
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,310
Why did this wild cat become so fierce?

652
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,740
It got drugged by the human traffickers.

653
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,730
Don't be afraid, wild cat.

654
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,330

655
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,030
Come here.

656
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,230

659
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,590
Sorry.

660
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,230
We'll release you immediately

661
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,910
as soon as there's a result to the case.

662
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,430
He's making the act become real and mistaking good with bad.

663
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,420
He has no choice.

664
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,580
This is the only way.

665
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,320

666
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,030
why are you locking me up?

667
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,750
Friend.

668
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,430
Are you a good person?

669
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,690
I am.

670
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,440
That's good.

671
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,560
As long as you are a good person,

00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,070
whether you are being locked up or not

673
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,560
won't change this fact.

674
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,590
Right?

675
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,420
Don't worry, the Court of Judicial Review

676
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,820
won't wrong a good person

677
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,350
nor let go of a bad guy.

679
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,870
Let's go.

680
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,360
That makes sense. Just lock me up.

681
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,830
Sun Bao, be careful.

682
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,820
Well...

My apologies.

684
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,950
I've never seen

685
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,950
such a fierce cat.

686
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,490
What if it keeps shrieking like this?

687
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,510
Officer,

688
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,790
why don't you lock us up

689
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,630
together?

690
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,320
I'll be the wild cat's companion. How's that?

691
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,870
Okay.

692
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,080
Let's go.

697
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,350
It's true.

698

Very well.

699
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,950
Since Wang Qi and his men's words were true,

700
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,490
the case can be closed.

701
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,730
As for the rest,

702

you can deal with it.

703
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,030
It will be considered a merit too.

704
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,530
Got it. I understand.

705
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,990
We can't let those rascals at

710
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,870
It was once glorious.

711
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,030
It's just unfortunate that

712
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,310
after the minister of the previous Court of Judicial Review left,

713
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,630
most left or retired.

00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,830

They aren't proper enough to even appear on the court.

00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,850
By the way,

721
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,200
is the cat they brought back

00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,750
locked up?

723
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,070
Yes.

724
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,310
I suspect this cat

725
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,990
is related to another strange case.

727
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,630
That's right.

729
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,430
I've heard

730
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,730
many rumors recently.

731
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,590

732
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,950
Demon Cat Murder Case?

733
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,310
Ten days ago, at midnight,

734
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,820
a trembling woman was found

00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,430

00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,620
It's midnight,

738
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,410
why are you wandering around?

739
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,090
There's a demon...

740
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,110
What did you say?

741
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,040
There's a demon!

Since then,

00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,250
the Demon Cat Murder Case started to spread.

749
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,830
But

750
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,420
we can't conclude that it was

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,510
a demon cat that did the killing

752
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,170

00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,350
it's just an official who went missing.

00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,950
annoying things here.

773
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,470
Who would have thought

774
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,150
this is how Vice Minister Shangguan deals with this case?

775
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,950
Besides,

776
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,150
when Vice Minister said to lock up Chen Shi,

777
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,630
you didn’t say a single thing.

778
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,870
In front of Vice Minister Shangguan,

779
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,350
you are the judicial commissioner of Mingjing Hall.

780
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,630
I'm just a judge.

781
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,470
You are the person in charge of this case.

782
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,320
As you're replying to Vice Minister Shangguan,

783
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,990
if I interrupt,

784
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,390
it'd be inappropriate.

785
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,280
I shouldn't look

786
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,140
nor say anything.

787
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,070
All right, Baba.

788
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,440
Now you're putting me in the front.

789
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,440
And you, Cui Bei.

790
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,310
You usually don't say anything.

791
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,060
Why did you take a jab at me

792
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,350
when you decided to open your mouth?

793
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,950
I was just telling the truth.

794
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,040
Fine.

795
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,990
I’m a generous man.

796
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,630
I can’t afford to get mad for nothing with you.

797
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,460
Look at it now.

798
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,100
Not to mention we won't get the credit for this case,

799
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,760
an honest man was wronged too.

800
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,050
Where is Sun Bao?

801
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,180
Why isn't he back yet?

802
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,950
Listen.

803
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,150
Sun Bao

804
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,390
is only tall

805
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,230
but doesn't have guts.

806
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,980
When he's met with problems,

807
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,400
he only knows to pray to gods and buddhas.

808
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,860
He's the most unreliable.

809
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,310
Today, Chen Shi said

810
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,370
that cat can write.

811
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,750
Maybe

812
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,010
Sun Bao went for fortune-telling again.

813
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,710
He's stubborn and does the opposite of what he speaks.

814
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,510
He's as strong as a cow yet as timid as a mouse.

815
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,790
This is also the truth.

816
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,630
Wild cat.

817
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,160
We can't bite.

818
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,910
You are drugged.

819
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,250
Don't be afraid.

820
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,520
Don't be afraid.

821
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,710
It's me.

822
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,470
Wild cat.

823
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,190
We even set off fireworks together.

824
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,260
Do you remember?

825
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,630
All right.

826
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,680
It's okay to bite me.

827
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,220
Don't be afraid, wild cat.

828
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,150
Don’t be afraid.

829
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,090
Who can escape the guards of Zhuque Gate

830
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,310
and hang people on the city gate

831
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,640
without making a sound?

832
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:32,870
Madam.

833
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,960
In that case,

834
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,760
it's really a demon cat killing?

835
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,300
No matter who the murderer is,

836
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,920
as long as we can solve this strange case

837
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,110
and give the court an explanation,

838
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,310
it'd be a great merit.

839
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,870
But if we can't solve it,

840
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,170
the Court of Judicial Review,

841
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,380
including you and me,

842
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,430
won't be able to take responsibility of it.

843
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,450
So remember,

844
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,890
you must keep an eye on

845
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,120
the human and the cat.

846
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,030
If one of them is missing,

847
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,230
you'll be responsible.

848
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,910
Yes.

849
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,640
Don't worry, Vice Minister.

850
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,040
I will complete the task.

851
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,430
This is...

852
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,860
You...

853
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,050
You're awake?

854
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,070
Who are you?

855
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,620
I'm from the Court of Judicial Review.

856
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,950
But I came a little late.

857
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,790
You haven't seen me before.

858
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,830
The Court of Judicial Review?

859
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,320
I remember now!

860
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,520
Wasn't I

861
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,590
in the Court of Judicial Review?

862
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,630
They also

863
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,540
locked me up...

864
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,510
Oh right!

865
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,630
Why am I here?

866
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,270
Where is the wild cat?

867
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,020
Where is the wild cat?

868
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,830
Don't shout.

869
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,790
You mean that cat?

870
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,390
I let it go.

871
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,760
From now on,

872
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,190
I'll take over your case.

873
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,870
It’s finally my turn.

874
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,010
[Li Bing]

875
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,470
Your name is Chen Shi?

876
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Me? Yes.

877
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,440
