00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,270
Why does the corpse

6
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,550
look so odd?

7
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,700
Because it was

8
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,230
originally hidden in the Dragon King statue.

9
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,940
Sir, please.

[Dragon King Temple]

11
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,550
Hurry. We're almost there.

12
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,550
I know. I know.

13
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
This is the place,

14
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,630
isn't it?

15
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,030
This morning from seven to nine,

16
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,560
some boatmen came to worship the Dragon King.

17
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,970
Come on. Worship the Dragon King.

18
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,670
Sure. Sure.

19
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,230
I'm telling you guys,

20
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,470
those fellas had better

21
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,070
not show up in front me again.

22
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,829
Who do they think they are?

23
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,890
If I see them again,

24
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,750
I'll teach them a lesson!

25
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,310
I told you not to drink so much.

26
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,410
Look,

27
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,600
it's so bright outside,

28
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,590
but you're still groggy!

29
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,990
Just leave him alone.

30
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,310
In a year, the number of the days when he's sober

31
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,880
is smaller than ten!

32
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,310
Hurry up. Let's worship the god.

33
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,050
We are on the same boat.

34
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,840
The least you can do is get up

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,830
and worship the god.

36
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,360
Should an accident happen,

37
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,920
who's gonna take the blame?

38
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,270
Don't talk nonsense!

39
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,090
Let's worship the Dragon King.

40
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,190
Dragon King, bless us.

41
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,450
Dragon King, bless us.

42
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,090
Dragon King, bless us.

43
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,550
Why is there rain leaking from the roof of this broken temple?

44
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,520
It's blood!

45
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,070
The Dragon King is bleeding!

46
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,670
The Dragon King is bleeding!

47
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,170
The Dragon King...

48
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,770
The Dragon King is bleeding!

49
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,950
Those boatmen

50
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,340
were badly frightened.

51
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,510
They immediately reported it to the government office.

52
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,190
Then,

53
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,030
the corpse was found.

54
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,690
This temple looks shabby.

55
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,310
Incense is seldom seen here.

56
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,870
Why would anyone come to worship the god here?

57
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,070
It's true that in the past there wasn't much incense here.

58
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,190
But for the past six months,

59
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,710
since the downstream waterway has silted up,

60
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,640
ships can't make their way up here,

61
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,390
so this area has suffered a huge loss of business.

62
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,080
Worse still,

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,260
some wells have even dried up.

64
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,209
It makes people realize that they should worship the Dragon King.

65
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,589
The state of the corpse suggests

66
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,360
that the victim died two or three days ago.

67
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,830
As for the cause of death,

68
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,740
the victim died from blunt force trauma to the head.

69
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,470
The murder weapon is right here.

70
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,790
Such a rod

71
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,320
is used to unload goods at the wharf.

72
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,370
It can be seen everywhere.

73
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,730
A clue like this

74
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,080
can hardly lead us to the murderer.

75
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,510
What's the victim's identity?

76
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,909
The victim's name is Liu Fu.

77
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,580
He was a watchman at the wharf,

78
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,090
and also a night guard.

79
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,710
It's been two to three years since he came here.

80
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,070
During that period of time,

81
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,190
he had been looking after the wharf.

82
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,720
No one has heard about

83
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,860
his family.

84
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,830
His dead body was first

85
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,650
found on the back of the Dragon King statue.

86
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,230
You...

87
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,250
This case seems peculiar,

88
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,130
but there are some clues about it, right?

89
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,020
It's no wonder

90
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,230
that people call you

91
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,070
Yao Bing, Vice Minister Li.

92
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,970
Sir, over these years,

93
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,409
Jinwu Guards have been

94
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,150
poking their noses where they don't belong, haven't they?

95
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,950
They even meddle with the cases

96
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,159
that the Ministry of Justice handles.

97
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,670
Now, Sir, you're back to the Court of Judicial Review.

98
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,830
Why don't we team up to knock

99
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,390
Jinwu Guards down to size?

100
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,880
It'll make us both happy, won't it?

101
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,830
Sir, if you take an interest in my idea,

102
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,200
then this case

103
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,350
will be handed over to you.

104
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,680
Alright!

105
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,140
It's all settled,

106
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,150
The case is yours now, Vice Minister Li.

107
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,150
We have taken over

108
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,159
this case now.

109
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,920
What are your opinions?

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,260
The boatmen were here to worship the god.

111
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,180
Maybe

112
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,470
someone tried to sabotage their plans,

113
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,970
and decided to make an offering out of the victim.

114
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,420
Hiding the corpse in the statue

115
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,510
was a way to complete

116
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,030
some sort of evil

117
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,580
and unspeakable ritual.

118
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,980
The killer...

119
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,170
Who are you?

120
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,450
He thinks he's superior to everyone else,

121
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,940
[Hiss]

122
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,270
that he's the incarnation of the Grim Reaper,

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,600
[Bang]

124
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,750
that he's an emissary from hell,

125
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,410
and that he's a demon who draws the souls and spirits out of people!

126
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,030
Sounds wrong.

127
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,480
What's wrong?

128
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,510
If the murderer had meant to draw the soul and spirit out of the victim,

129
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,300
he wouldn't have bludgeoned the victim to death, right?

130
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,630
Wouldn't he have used a hook or something?

131
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,620
That's right.

132
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,670
Now that you've said it,

133
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,470
I'm also feeling a bit confused.

134
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,020
What?

135
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,630
Isn't it a splendid theory?

136
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,030
It's not splendid at all.

137
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,130
You're just making up a story.

138
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,020
Hold on, Alibaba.

139
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,790
When it comes to telling horror stories,

140
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,550
why are you able to use phrases correctly?

141
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,510
You've heard such stories from other people, right?

142
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,270
Recently, apart from studying for the Mandarin Level 8 Exam,

143
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,670
I've been reading some novels.

144
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,159
Your idea is actually

145
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,350
quite special.

146
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,860
However,

147
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,440
imagination and reasoning

148
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,050
are two different things.

149
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,030
The victim worked in the goods yard

150
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,690
as a watchman and a night guard

151
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,520
who had the duty to patrol and keep the goods safe.

152
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,950
It's very possible that

153
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,750
he found something unusual,

154
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,350
and began fighting an invader,

155
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,010
which led to his tragic death.

156
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,630
As Vice Minister Li pointed out,

157
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,270
this is a deserted temple.

158
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,830
Except those who are rather familiar

159
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,000
with the goods yard,

160
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,820
no one would think of this temple as a place to hide a corpse in.

161
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,830
So I think

162
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,390
the murderer is probably a habitual thief.

163
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,030
After he stole something,

164
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,630
he was spotted by a new guard.

165
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,870
In the heat of the moment,

166
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,950
the thief killed the guard,

167
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,770
and hid his body here.

168
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,539
Plus, a wooden rod

169
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,950
is not a handy weapon.

170
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,429
So I don't think the murderer prepared this rod for the crime.

171
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,590
In the goods yard, such a rod

172
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,039
is used to unload goods.

173
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,080
The murderer

174
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,410
probably works in the goods yard.

175
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,430
But...

176
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,750
If it hadn't been for the purpose of stopping people from worshiping the god,

177
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,590
why would the murderer have hidden the corpse

178
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,050
in the Dragon King statue?

179
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,470
The murderer chose to hide the corpse.

180
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,990
To do that, he even dug a hole in the Dragon King statue.

181
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,150
Wasn't he trying too hard,

182
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,150
and going to extraordinary "widths" for that?

183
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,550
Chen Shi, you...

184
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,150
You...

185
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,990
What are you doing?

186
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,560
I-I-I am

187
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,260
just wondering

188
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,960
if something is missing

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,910
from the hands

190
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,370
of the Dragon King statue.

191
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,500
Maybe it's a board,

192
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,720
or a...

193
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,750
There should be a hu token.

194
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,670
The Dragon King writes on it to send a message

195
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,070
to heaven to ask for rain.

196
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,910
Here it is.

197
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,380
I guess it fell off when the Dragon King statue

198
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,040
-was moved.
-Be careful, Sir.

199
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,370
There is indeed a thief in the goods yard.

200
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,150
The Dragon King statue

201
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,280
is where the stolen goods are stashed.

202
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,730
Look over here.

203
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,710
These are marks of dragging and pulling.

204
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,670
It takes months or years

205
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,270
for these marks to be formed.

206
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,620
Besides,

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,100
cloves and nutmeg

208
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,900
are expensive spices.

209
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,790
These are

210
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,860
highly valuable goods.

211
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,700
The murderer is indeed a habitual thief.

212
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,230
What a surprising coincidence it is

213
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,750
that my guess is the same as yours, Sir!

214
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,380
It's such an honor for me.

215
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
I promise I'll keep up the good work.

216
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,110
There isn't just one habitual thief.

217
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,750
It's probable that this person has accomplices.

218
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,070
There are thieves in the goods yard.

219
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,150
Liu Fu worked here for nearly three years.

220
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,610
How could he not know that?

221
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,010
It means Liu Fu stole the goods he was supposed to guard!

222
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,390
That makes sense.

He said among the ships in this goods yard,

338
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,700
since the river silted up

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,510

Nonetheless,

every time the theft happened, the loss was small.

Everyone knows that?

377
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,190
Yeah.

378
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,110
Then, who are

379
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,510
these thieves?

380
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,270
I don't know.

381
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,720
What if I offer you more money to buy liquor?

382
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,970
Officer,

383
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,030
even if you offer me

384
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,030
an entire tavern,

385
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,240
I still don't know who the thieves are.

386
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,000
But...

387
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,970
Officer,

388
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,070
I can say one thing for sure.

389
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,490
At this wharf, whoever you ask about this matter

390
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,270
will give you the same answer.

391
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,190
Everyone knows it,

392
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,070
but everyone denies knowing it.

393
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,710
Officer,

394
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,460
when you go to the place Liu Fu worked in,

395
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,600
and take a look,

396
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,000
you will understand.

397
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,070
It's right there, where the bell rings.

398
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,590
The waterway has silted up.

399
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,300
People are having a hard time.

400
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,970
There aren't enough resources for everyone.

401
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,280
Why not be a thief?

402
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,800
If it weren't for my limp,

403
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,790
I would become a thief too.

404
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,580
What's good about being a scavenger?

405
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,830
What's picked up on the streets

406
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,230
can't be as worthy as what's stolen, right?

407
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,990
Who painted all over these?

408
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,520
Whoever did this is wicked.

409
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,790
There must be something

410
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,250
recorded on these tokens.

411
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,820
The man who covered them with paint

412
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,910
must be the one who struck the bell just now

413
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,910
and distracted all the workers at the wharf.

414
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,970
Let me get through!

415
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,440
The Court of Judicial Review and the Ministry of Justice

416
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,110
are investigating around the Dragon King Temple.

417
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,150
It's understandable

418
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,280
that the murderer would become alert.

419
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,850
Mr. Li!

420
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:32,880
Who's there?

421
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,750
Mr. Li!

422
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,870
Mr. Li! Mr. Li!

423
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,680
Wait up, Mr. Li!

424
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,110
Make way!

425
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,870
Mr. Li! Mr. Li!

426
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,180
Jinwu Guards?

427
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,590
Why are they everywhere?

428
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,430
They're like flies

429
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,030
that people can't get rid of!

430
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,270
Let's go!

431
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,400
It's you?

432
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,350
She...

433
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,590
You're Li Bing, a Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review.

434
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,520
Long time no see.

435
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,400
It seems you're also secretly investigating me.

436
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,620
What brought you here?

437
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,310
Don't move!

438
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,630
Sir!

439
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,430
You won't be able to get away.

440
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,110
Sir!

441
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,920
Jinwu Guards! Jin...

442
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,630
Vice Minister Li.

443
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,440
General Qiu.

444
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,150
What are you doing here?

445
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,710
I heard there was a murder at the wharf this morning.

446
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,430
Jinwu Guards are obligated to protect the safety of Shendu.

447
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,560
Of course I need to look into this case.

448
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,790
Soon after we arrived at the wharf,

449
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,960
we saw a warning signal

450
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,830
fired by the Court of Judicial Review.

451
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,550
Knowing that you're in trouble,

452
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,750
we Jinwu Guards would lend you a helping hand by all means.

453
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,430
Vice Minister Li, do you have a difficulty?

454
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,430
Thank you for your kindness, General Qiu.

455
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,990
The Court of Judicial Review

456
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,520
has its own duty to fulfill.

457
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,780
We don't need help from Jinwu Guards.

458
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,950
I remember telling you

459
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,270
not to poke your noses where they don't belong.

460
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,120
Let's go back to the Court of Judicial Review.

461
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,710
The Dragon King Temple

462
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,570
is where stolen goods are hidden.

463
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,430
There are thieves in the goods yard,

464
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,290
and they are habitual offenders.

465
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,470
The victim Liu Fu and these habitual thieves

466
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,530
were in collusion,

467
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,830
and he ended up being killed by them.

468
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,820
These are the obvious facts.

469
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,470
Liu Fu was a watchman in the goods yard.

470
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,990
He supervised the activities about ships docking at the wharf.

471
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,280
[Xintan Wharf]

472
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,340
So he clearly knew

473
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,910
which of the ships had valuable items.

474
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,070
Then he gave the information to the thieves

475
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,230
to yield benefits.

476
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,390
At the wharf, the plates

477
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,670
that have been covered with white paint

478
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,050
[Boat tokens
The positions and arrival dates of the ships are recorded on these plates]

479
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,950
should be boat tokens.

480
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,790
Information about the arrivals and locations

481
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,920
of the ships should be written on them.

482
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,490
The merchants

483
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,790
wouldn't cooperate with us in our inquiries.

484
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,270
The moment they realized

485
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,510
we were officers,

486
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,020
they became very defensive.

487
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,750
So did the workers in the goods yard.

488
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,590
It's the first time

489
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,750
I've had such a thorny issue

490
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,230
when I ask someone about a case.

491
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,950
The people in the tavern behaved the same.

492
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,250
Then there's only one possibility.

493
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:17,930
They

494
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,510
are accomplices.

495
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,580
We'll get back to work later.

496
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,710
Eat some more, guys!

497
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,430
I've found that the liquor

498
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,550
sold by the tavern...

499
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,030
It should be the same kind of liquor

500
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,110
as that spilled on the ground of the Dragon King Temple.

501
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,510
It's impossible that a small tavern like that

502
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,440
would sell such expensive liquor.

503
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,090
How are the boatmen supposed to afford it?

504
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,750
Plus, judging from how hard

505
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,210
the tavern owner tried to avoid this matter,

506
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,100
there must be something wrong with the liquor.

507
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,150
Either it has been bought at a low price

508
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,810
from the thieves who stole it,

509
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,950
or it has been placed in the tavern's

510
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,550
storage facility by the thieves.

511
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,390
All the people at the wharf

512
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,250
are in cahoots.

513
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,670
The merchants

514
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,790
don't want to irritate them,

515
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,250
or talk about the problem.

516
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,670
The workers are hostile to us

517
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,230
because they've got benefits

518
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,510
from the thieves.

519
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,590
And this!

520
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,400
It must be the proof

521
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,530
of their collusion with the thieves.

522
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,950
That's why that beggar said,

523
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,160
"Everyone knows it,

524
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,530
but everyone denies knowing it."

525
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,470
The waterway has silted up.

526
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,230
Everyone is having a hard time.

527
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,510
So they have turned to work for the thieves.

528
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,270
They are supposed to be

529
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,270
getting along.

530
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,860
Liu Fu sided with the thieves.

531
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,090
I suppose on the day he was killed,

532
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,390
something happened,

533
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,870
and caused an internal conflict.

534
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,030
A fellow countryman of mine told me

535
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,550
that on the night before last, a ship

536
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,470
sneakily

537
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,830
stayed at the wharf for a while and left.

538
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,090
It's very suspicious.

539
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,070
That exactly proves my guess.

540
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,990
The ship probably contained

541
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,590
something highly valuable.

542
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,750
On the night before last,

543
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,410
the thieves stole that thing,

544
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,390
and then had an internal fight.

545
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,270
That means

546
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,030
the purpose of covering the boat tokens with paint

547
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,950
is not to conceal

548
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,630
the marks that the thieves have left,

549
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,550
but to conceal

550
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,010
the fact that this ship has been to the wharf.

551
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:58,750
Sir,

552
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,510
it means the person you were chasing today

553
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,110
is very likely the murderer.

554
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,910
The person who covered the boat tokens with paint

555
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,150
might also be her.

556
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,460
It's a strong possibility.

557
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,230
Besides, I've always had a hunch

558
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,110
that there is more than one criminal.

559
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,790
If our deductions are correct,

560
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,430
the whole thing

561
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,560
can't be pulled off by just one person.

562
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,470
Such a shame.

563
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,430
What a shame!

564
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,270
If we had caught that person,

565
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,830
we would've discovered the truth.

566
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,150
We were just one step away from the truth.

567
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,390
Just one tiny step!

568
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,830
Hey, Chen Shi,

569
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,000
what were the odds of you

570
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,790
being held by that person as hostage?

571
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,870
If it hadn't been for you...

572
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,350
Cui Bei,

573
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,300
have you written down what we've said?

574
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,990
Yes.

575
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,630
Good.

576
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,790
I need you to give the dossier of this case

577
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,390
to Vice Minister Shangguan.

578
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,910
Tell her that it's a request made by the Ministry of Justice,

579
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,190
so we need to give them an official notice.

580
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,790
This case

581
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,830
will be in the charge of Mingjing Hall.

582
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,430
Yes.

583
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,750
Since the motive for the murder

584
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,350
is relevant to a stolen item,

585
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,120
you should try figuring out

586
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,590
the item's whereabouts.

587
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,520
I'll have a background check on that ship.

588
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,950
Go and do it now.

589
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,510
Yes.

590
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,600
Anything wrong?

591
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,910
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

592
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,030
It's all my fault.

593
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,200
If it hadn't been for me,

594
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,870
we might have caught that criminal.

595
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,670
Don't overthink it.

596
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,790
Everything happened out of a sudden.

597
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,520
Who would've seen that coming?

598
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,430
It's not that.

599
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,950
I'm just too stupid

600
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,390
to learn anything well.

601
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,310
Whatever I do would end up causing you trouble.

602
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,240
As long as you're willing to learn,

603
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,950
I'm sure you'll get the hang of everything.

604
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,810
Don't always belittle yourself.

605
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,390
Mr. Li,

606
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,830
I have work to do.

607
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,530
I should get going.

608
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,900
[Rank 7]

609
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,930
What happened today was such a shame!

610
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,480
If it hadn't been for Chen Shi, we would...

611
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,310
Forget it.

612
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,020
Chen Shi is a good person,

613
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,480
but he's not very smart.

614
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,430
Chen Shi

615
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,760
is indeed a good person,

616
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,830
but he's not very agile.

617
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,250
Chen Shi is a good person,

618
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,310
but he's not pushing himself hard enough.

619
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,990
Chen Shi is blessed with a good heart,

620
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,550
but not with a good ability to calculate.

621
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,310
Then why would Vice Minister Li

622
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,550
keep him around?

623
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,790
Just because he's a good person?

624
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,110
Maybe he has got used to Chen Shi being around.

625
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,310
When I was in the army,

626
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,190
a general

627
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,390
liked taking a particular assistant general

628
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,780
with him, who always came in handy.

629
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,870
This assistant general

630
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,390
might not be a martial master or a brilliant strategist,

631
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,150
but after all,

632
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,680
he had worked with the general for a long time.

633
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,920
Maybe it's destiny.

634
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,160
The general just found that person nice to be around.

635
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,440
Mister!

636
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,990
It's hard to believe a Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review

637
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,120
would break into someone else's room.

638
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,510
Weren't you afraid that when you turned around,

639
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,750
I would stab and kill you?

640
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,470
No. Because you invited me here.

641
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,670
You left this behind.

642
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,870
Given that you're injured,

643
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,670
you'd better not drink alcohol.

644
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,540
We foreigners

645
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,890
recover faster after we consume alcohol.

646
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,230
Did you kill Liu Fu?

647
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,630
No.

648
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,590
Then why would you

649
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,990
appear in the goods yard?

650
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,070
What's your thought, Vice Minister Li?

651
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,440
There is a group of thieves in the goods yard.

652
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,970
They've been stealing goods there for years.

653
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,110
Because of one stolen item,

654
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,030
an internal dispute happened among them,

655
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,560
and finally caused a death.

656
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,420
You foreigners have your own business.

657
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,350
You would by no means engage in

658
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,810
the business at the wharf.

659
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:34,990
That means your previous presence

660
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,720
was related to the stolen item.

661
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,390
On the boat tokens,

662
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,970
some details of a ship have been wiped off.

663
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,190
Is that ship yours?

664
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,150
No.

665
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,210
But the ship contained something I want.

666
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,990
That thing

667
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,110
was supposed to be brought by Liu Fu

668
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,150
to me.

669
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,120
But he didn't show up.

670
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,000
It was not until today did I find

671
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,400
that he had already died.

672
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,790
I went to the goods yard

673
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,550
just to see

674
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,150
if there were any clues left.

675
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,910
Liu Fu was a watchman in the goods yard.

676
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,190
He could help transport many things

677
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,000
that legal channels couldn't.

678
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,070
What did you lose?

679
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,590
Liu Fu was probably killed because of it.

680
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,390
Is it something valuable?

681
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,130
Your shoulder got injured

682
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,710
at the wharf today.

683
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,710
That means you ran into

684
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,870
the person who put paint on the boat tokens.

685
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,130
The one who injured you

686
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,670
is very likely the murderer.

687
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,980
They outnumbered me.

688
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,150
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

689
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,430
been injured by them.

690
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:47,910
Did you catch a clear look

691
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,150
at their faces?

692
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,910
No.

693
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,750
What on earth

694
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,230
was stolen from you?

695
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,590
You wouldn't want me to take you back

696
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,270
to the Court of Judicial Review

697
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,470
so I can treat you harshly as I interrogate you, would you?

698
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,030
If that was your plan,

699
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,690
you wouldn't come here alone.

700
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,280
Then at least tell me

701
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,670
if this thing

702
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,070
and the Jiazitou you're looking for,

703
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,310
namely Yi Zhi Hua,

704
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,800
are related in any way?

705
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,850
It's you who asked me to come here.

706
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,719
If you need my help, just let me know.

707
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,070
You're injured.

708
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:37,270
It's hard for you to find what you want on your own.

709
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,469
I can help you find it,

710
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,110
and I promise to return it to you.

711
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,909
But

712
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,310
when that happens, you must tell me

713
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,580
why you're looking for Yi Zhi Hua.

714
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,179
Plus, I'm more curious about

715
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,370
the connection

716
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,510
between this thing and Yi Zhi Hua.

717
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,510
What do you think?

718
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:54,630
It all depends on

719
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,160
how good you are at your job, Vice Minister Li.

720
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,770
It's settled then.

721
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,470
Speaking of the direction,

722
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:21,270
it should be the north of your house, where there is stuff made of wood.

723
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,070
Mr. Yuan!

724
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,990
Look into the wooden boxes in the north of your house.

725
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,590
Just look into them. You'll find what you want.

726
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,400
I was just

727
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,360
looking for you.

728
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,510
Give me a moment.

729
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,670
Go home and check if the thing is in

730
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,910
one of the wooden boxes or clay pots.

731
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,790
Just look into them. I'm sure you'll find it.

732
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,750
If not, come back to me.

733
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,390
Okay.

734
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:35,870
Alright. Thank you.

735
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,330
I was just looking for you.

736
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,800
There's a letter for you.

737
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,030
What? What letter?

738
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,750
What are you eagerly looking for

739
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,390
and have asked me to help with?

740
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,980
I...

741
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,620
I'm looking for my older brother.

742
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,670
Is there a letter from my brother?

743
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,510
Just now,

744
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,970
someone came here for divination.

745
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,970
He tried to find a man named Chen Shi.

746
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,860
Then I asked him for more details.

747
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,630
It turned out that he wanted to give you a letter written by Chen Jiu.

748
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,550
Really?

749
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,660
[To my brother Shi]

750
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,300
I charged him 30 wen.

751
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,470
That wasn't too much, was it?

752
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,710
Really?

753
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,300
I've found my brother!

754
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,040
I've gotta tell Mr. Li about it!

755
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,750
It's great news!

756
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,670
Don't run so fast.

757
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,190
Mr. Li,

758
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,530
I've found my brother!

759
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,990
He looks so happy and excited.

760
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,140
How wonderful!

761
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,100
Come here for divination!

762
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,710
Mr. Li! Mr. Li!

763
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,340
What's up?

764
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,750
What happened?

765
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,540
My brother... My brother...

766
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,190
Have you found your brother?

767
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,430
Not yet.

768
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,690
[To my brother Shi]

769
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,170
He has written me a letter.

770
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,120
Someone went to Mr. Yuan

771
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,630
and gave him this letter, saying

772
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,700
that it's from my brother to me!

773
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,030
Would you read it for me?

774
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,230
What's written in it?

775
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,140
Shi,

776
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,360
I'm all fine.

777
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,520
Don't worry.

778
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:02,950
Chen Jiu.

779
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,870
Nothing else?

780
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,390
N-Nothing else.

781
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,370
I’ve asked Mr. Yuan.

782
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,710
He got this letter

783
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,950
from an ordinary man.

784
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,610
So I haven't paid much attention to that.

785
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,990
I thought

786
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,760
if I took this letter to you,

787
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,870
you would be able to find out

788
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,870
who delivered it.

789
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,370
He definitely knows where my brother lives.

790
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,840
When you find your brother,

791
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,550
what will you do?

792
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,150
It depends.

793
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,630
If my brother is leading a peaceful

794
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,670
and comfortable life,

795
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,730
I'll stay with him.

796
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,840
You'll leave the Court of Judicial Review then?

797
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,210
I'm too stupid.

798
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,710
Don't underestimate yourself anymore.

799
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,910
You're really a good fit for the Court of Judicial Review.

800
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,470
Mr. Li,

801
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,870
let's just play it by ear.

802
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,190
Can you find out

803
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,880
who delivered this letter?

804
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,040
[To my brother Shi]

805
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,310
It...

806
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,670
It truly is just an ordinary piece

807
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,580
of notepaper.

808
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,070
I don't see anything special about it.

809
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:13,830
Can I

810
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,060
take a leave?

811
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,390
Anyway, in this murder case,

812
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,990
I'm not being helpful at all.

813
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,310
Now that I've finally got a letter from my brother,

814
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,190
I want to...

815
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,710
if you insist,

816
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:27,750
then go.

817
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,190
Thank you, Mr. Li.

818
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,750
I'm leaving then.

819
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,470
Please let us get through.

820
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,190
Zhao Huazi!

821
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,760
Vice Minister Li,

822
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,380
[Chun Huai House]

823
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,360
someone found him here.

824
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,230
His death was caused by blunt force trauma.

825
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,960
This wound

826
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,790
and the one in Liu Fu's head,

827
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,830
which has been recorded by

828
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,830
the coroner of the Ministry of Justice,

829
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,830
are very similar.

830
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,500
I suspect

831
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,000
it's done by the same murderer.

832
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:23,960
Let's go.

833
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,610
We'll check out the place where he lived.

834
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,610
[Chun Huai House]

835
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,730
Get him out of here.

836
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,450
Thanks, Officers.

837
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,420
Why would the murderer kill a beggar?

838
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,710
Sun Bao!

839
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,630
Maybe because he revealed

840
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,950
the truth about the goods yard,

841
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,550
and said many things to Vice Minister Li,

842
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,550
the murderer killed him as revenge.

843
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,510
What a vicious

844
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,910
and heartless murderer!

845
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,070
However, he told me nothing

846
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,330
but just a fact that's known to everyone.

847
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,090
I guess the murderer killed him for a different reason.

848
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,750
He came here to look for something.

849
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,880
Look for something?

850
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,030
Guys, look.

851
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,550
The tiles

852
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,810
are stacked up neatly.

853
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,750
Also, there are obvious traces

854
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,410
indicating that they've been given a good wipe.

855
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,680
In the beginning, the house

856
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,280
wasn't as messy as it is now.

857
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,510
After someone broke in

858
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,230
and rummaged in here,

859
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:38,950
the house became a mess

860
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,210
that we're seeing now.

861
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,390
How did a beggar

862
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,510
get so much money?

863
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,550
I gave it

864
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,260
to him when I asked him questions yesterday.

865
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,870
Since the murderer didn't take a dime,

866
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,000
it means he didn't come here for money.

867
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,280
The beggar was a scavenger

868
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,720
with a limp.

869
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,150
It means he could only collect trash

870
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,080
within the perimeter of this area.

871
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,350
Scavengers usually collect trash

872
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,350
at midnight or in the early morning.

873
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,310
These are the exact

874
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,510
time slots when thieves go out to steal.

875
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,790
The waterway has silted up.

876
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,570
People are having a hard time.

877
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,320
There aren't enough resources for everyone.

878
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,110
Why not be a thief?

879
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,600
What's picked up on the streets can't be as worthy as what's stolen, right?

880
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,910
We might as well make a bold assumption.

881
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,190
Maybe the murderer

882
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,470
was looking for the item

883
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,510
that was stolen on that day.

884
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,830
Vice Minister Li is implying the item

885
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,190
that had caused an internal dispute among the thieves that night,

886
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,550
and led to Liu Fu's death,

887
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,680
went missing again,

888
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,180
and was picked up by this beggar.

889
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,190
What could that item be?

890
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,790
It has contributed to two crimes

891
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,190
and cost two human lives!

892
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,260
[Court of Judicial Review]
