00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,110
[Episode 21]

4
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,759
What a miserable death.

5
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,550
What a big grudge.

6
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,310
It's the same as

7
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,370
Zhao Ruyi's death.

8
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,710
Why did he die here?

9
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,950
The Jinwu Guards interrogated him.

10
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,360
The Jinwu Guards thought

11
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,720
he was innocent,

12
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,789
so they let him go.

13
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,580
No one expected

14
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,840
him to be killed too.

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,100
Vice Minister.

16
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,030
Now that this has happened,

17
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,350
should Sun Bao

18
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,910
be interrogated?

19
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,030
I've been on edge ever since.

20
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,310
What a tragic death.

21
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:24,940
Exactly.

22
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,470
Make way.

23
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,910
Come on.

24
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,440
Make way.

25
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,390
We're going back to the Court of Judicial Review first.

26
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,550
Thank you.

27
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,990
No matter what,

28
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,120
we have to find Xu Hu first.

29
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,320
I think he's not dead.

30
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,830
I have a question.

31
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,080
Who were those people who came

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,210
to collect the body?

33
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,329
People from the morgue, of course.

34
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,870
I remember Yang said

35
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,240
he personally collected

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,510
Xu Hu's body.

37
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,670
Yang is from the morgue.

38
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,990
Are you okay?

39
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,780
Hold on.

40
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,490
If Xu Hu faked his death,

41
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,870
that body is the key.

42
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,300
Yang switched bodies.

43
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,510
And Xu Hu wanted to hide his whereabouts.

44
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,430
As the name suggests...

45
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,100
The morgue.

46
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,790
For a dead person

47
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,590
and a scout,

48
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,730
that is the best hiding place.

49
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,710
Let's go.

50
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,160
Brother.

51
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,310
Come on.

52
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,010
You must be hungry. Have a bun.

53
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,030
No.

54
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,120
Do we have wine here?

55
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,350
This is a prison.

56
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,760
I know.

57
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,990
I'm staying temporarily.

58
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,070
We're all friends.

59
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,630
Don't be such a stranger.

60
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,320
Help me

61
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,590
and fetch me some wine.

62
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,050
No hurry. Anytime is fine.

63
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,630
Sorry, let me help you.

64
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,710
Xu Hu?

65
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,510
Bao.

[Xu Hu]

67
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,840
You are still alive.

68
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,110
I...

69
00:06:59,390 --> 00:06:59,940
Stop!

70
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,450
Why are you running away?

71
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,150
I'm not running away.

72
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,630
You're not running away?

73
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,390
Then why did you pretend to die behind my back?

74
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,190
Are you working

75
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,100
for Lu Chenghuang now?

76
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,350
Did you kill Zhao Ruyi?

77
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,990
Tell me.

78
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,390
I didn't kill him.

79
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,860
Fine.

80
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,230
Go back to the Court of Judicial Review with me

81
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,230
and make it clear.

82
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,680
How could you wave your knife at me?

83
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,710
Come with me.

84
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,060
Your wolf's head pendant is still here.

85
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,390
It has always been here.

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
I didn't kill anyone.

87
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,430
You have to give me an explanation.

88
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,130
You're really something.

89
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,950
I've set so many traps.

90
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,750
But you bypassed all of them.

91
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,030
Despite joining the Court of Judicial Review,

92
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,310
you haven't grown rusty.

93
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,070
Of course.

94
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,350
Now, tell me.

95
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,360
What happened to Zhao Ruyi?

96
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,990
I did ask him

97
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,870
to steal something from Lu Chenghuang.

98
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,070
But we didn't steal anything in the end.

99
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,710
I didn't find what I was looking for

100
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,110
in the storage facility.

101
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,710
Do you remember Huangsha Valley?

102
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:33,909
Of course.

103
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,549
I remember

104
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,840
we were attacked there.

105
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,030
I took an arrow in the leg.

106
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,530
Thank goodness, you saved me.

107
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,990
After the attack, I settled you down

108
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,410
and went back to investigate the matter.

109
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,180
I found out that

110
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,830
the troops that attacked us belonged to our army.

111
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,550
What?

112
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,110
That troop belonged to our army?

113
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,120
Then why did they

114
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,970
attack us?

115
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,490
Who killed them?

116
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,800
I don't know.

117
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,380
But...

118
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,360
I found

119
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,460
something strange

120
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,480
there.

121
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,900
So,

122
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,030
they might have been

123
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,310
secretly transporting that stone coffin

124
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,040
when they unexpectedly met us.

125
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,020
To silence us,

126
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,470
they had no choice but to kill their allies.

127
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,190
I also saw traces of the bodies being searched.

128
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,470
Lu Chenghuang?

129
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,610
Did he kill them?

130
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,200
That's impossible.

131
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,750
He was just a small fry, he was not capable enough.

132
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,670
But he probably

133
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,150
found something.

134
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,470
Thanks to that something,

135
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,750
he returned to Shendu

136
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,550
and became Lu Chenghuang today.

137
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,070
What exactly

138
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,220
was in that box?

139
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,000
Do you remember the Zixu soldiers?

140
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,150
They were not aggressive

141
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,010
and even lacked fighting spirit.

142
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,110
I don't believe they had the guts

143
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,910
to initiate an invasion.

144
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,090
So, I have a vague feeling that

145
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,980
the thing in the stone coffin

146
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,090
is the real reason

147
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,090
that war broke out.

148
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,970
So you've been investigating Lu Chenghuang all along?

149
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,300
I'm also investigating

150
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,330
what he got

151
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,630
on the battlefield.

152
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,750
But he hid it well.

153
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,620
He was just a punk in the past.

154
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,920
No matter how successful he is,

155
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,430
he can't possibly control everything.

156
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,260
Back then, the gangs in Shendu

157
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,860
were mostly disbanded by us.

158
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,890
But why is he doing so well?

159
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,320
All these years,

160
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,420
it seems that

161
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,670
someone is secretly helping him

162
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,070
get rid of his opponents.

163
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,390
That's why I decided

164
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,550
to fake my death.

165
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,940
Back then, there was a case

166
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,730
related to Lu Huangchong.

167
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,470
When I was investigating the case,

168
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,400
I fell into a trap

169
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,460
and almost died.

170
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,630
In other words,

171
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,470
someone knew that I was investigating Lu Huangchong

172
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,510
and set a trap

173
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,650
for me to walk into.

174
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,070
So I played into the trap and asked Yang

175
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,000
to fake my death.

176
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,750
I slipped away like a cicada shedding its skin.

177
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,910
There's a mole in the government office?

178
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,680
Yes.

179
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

180
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,870
It's not easy for us

181
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,170
to survive on the battlefield.

182
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,370
One person on the case

183
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,840
is enough.

184
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,720
You don't treat me as your brother.

185
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,680
No, it's because I treat you as my brother.

186
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,160
Hu.

187
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,780
I'm not alone anymore.

188
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,590
I have many friends

189
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,350
and the Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review.

190
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,810
They are all trustworthy.

191
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,990
They can help you.

192
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,320
Something's not right.

193
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,630
The knockout drops.

194
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,480
Yang.

195
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,680
Hu Zi, Bao Zi.

196
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,710
I'm sorry.

197
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm useless.

198
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,040
They found you.

199
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,420
Who are you?

200
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,490
Yang!

201
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,850
Yang.

202
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,690
I'm not like you.

203
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,110
You're like leopards

204
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,270
and tigers.

205
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,630
I'm old.

206
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,990
But

207
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,870
even a rabbit bites

208
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,990
when it's threatened.

209
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,710
Yang!

210
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,870
Yang!

211
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,140
Yang!

212
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,820
Sun Bao!

213
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,370
Mr. Sun!

214
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,140
Sun Bao!

215
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,270
Mr. Sun!

216
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,200
Give it to me.

217
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,150
What?

218
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,350
You always have a backup plan.

219
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,080
Give it to me.

220
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:29,910
Sun Bao!

221
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,470
Sun Bao!

222
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,150
Run!

223
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,870
Sun Bao!

224
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,630
Run!

225
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,270
Mr. Sun! Sun Bao!

226
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,710
Sun Bao!

227
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,270
Mr. Sun!

228
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,190
Sun Bao.

229
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,750
Sir.

230
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,180
I'm innocent.

231
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,030
Trust me.

232
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,790
Vice Minister Li.

233
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,230
Assistant Minister.

234
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,680
Arrest him.

235
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,550
Sun Bao escaped from prison.

236
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,510
It proves that he colluded

237
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,550
with the suspect.

238
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,710
Now, another person is dead.

239
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,000
What should we do?

240
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,850
If you won't say anything,

241
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,950
that means you're acknowledging it.

242
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,540
Then I shall do things

243
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,370
by the book.

244
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,210
By then,

245
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,950
we'll have to torture him.

246
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,980
What?

247
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,700
Mr. Li, this...

248
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,360
Aren't you trying to set us up?

249
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,650
Sun Bao used to be a scout.

250
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,670
He's also from the Court of Judicial Review.

251
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,930
If he refuses to speak,

252
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,430
we have no choice

253
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,590
but to torture him.

254
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,410
So,

255
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,990
you'll have to pardon us.

256
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,790
Take him away.

257
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,390
Sir. Sir.

258
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,030
Mr. Li.

259
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,540
Sun Bao broke the law.

260
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,430
The Ministry of Justice only followed the rules.

261
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,740
[Court of Judicial Review]

262
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,070
Don't talk.

263
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,000
Let me think.

264
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,020
My Lord.

265
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,500
He's too stubborn.

266
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,340
If it doesn't work,

267
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,140
we have to hit him hard.

268
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,270
Yes.

269
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,590
Consultant Lai.

270
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,910
Consultant Lai.

271
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,630
Lord Feng.

272
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,910
What brings you

273
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,770
to the Ministry of Justice today?

274
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,030
You may leave.

275
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,270
Yes.

276
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,290
Lord Feng.

277
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,900
Xu Hu faked his death for so many years

278
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,349
and killed many people who worked for Lu Chenghuang.

279
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,470
Even though I also think

280
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,670
they deserved to die,

281
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,829
it is after all

282
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,940
against the law.

283
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,950
So, arresting Xu Hu

284
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,839
is also the Jinwu Guards' case.

285
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,630
Lord Feng.

286
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,420
Sun Bao

287
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,630
is a tough man.

288
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,069
No matter how you interrogate him,

289
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,599
he won't tell you anything.

290
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,190
But Sun Bao will definitely

291
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,190
tell everything to

292
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,550
Li Bing, the vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review.

293
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,589
And Vice Minister Li will do his best

294
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,690
to find Xu Hu

295
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,120
to clear Sun Bao's name.

296
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,950
At this point,

297
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,270
a conflict between the Ministry of Justice

298
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,070
and the Court of Judicial Review

299
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,390
is now inevitable.

300
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,420
What do you

301
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,470
want to tell me today?

302
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,490
Lord Feng.

303
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,620
I'm here

304
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,790
to deliver a message in General Qiu's stead.

305
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,510
The Jinwu Guards

306
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,630
know where Xu Hu is.

307
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,820
The Jinwu Guards

308
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,230
have our own spies.

309
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,380
After all, we don't want

310
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,640
Xu Hu to fall into the hands of the Court of Judicial Review.

311
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,870
Lord Feng.

312
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,990
This matter

313
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,830
was also General Qiu's idea.

314
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,690
Vice Minister.

315
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,490
Are you sure?

316
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,570
After Zhao Ruyi died,

317
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,740
his wife also left.

318
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,920
Ordinary people wouldn't think

319
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,200
to investigate this place again.

320
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,120
So I guess

321
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,250
Xu Hu might be hiding here.

322
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,430
Let's go.

323
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,770
Let me do it.

324
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:54,850
Be careful.

325
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,510
There are traps here.

326
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,810
Come with me.

327
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,940
Thank you.

328
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,930
You're welcome.

329
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,120
-Sir!
-Mr. Li!

330
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:01,910
Sir!

331
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,790
-Xu Hu.
-Mr. Li!

332
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:03,990
Mr. Li.

333
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,740
Mr. Li.

334
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,480
Are you alright, Mr. Li?

335
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,340
Vice Minister.

336
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,390
Vice Minister.

337
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,350
-Sir!
-Mr. Li!

338
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,230
It's okay.

339
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,190
Mr. Li!

340
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,050
Vice Minister.

341
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,130
Vice Minister.

342
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,910
Mr. Li.

343
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,510
What should we do?

344
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:26,870
Smash!

345
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,070
My waist...

346
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,590
My waist...

347
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,390
Fine.

348
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,590
Assistant Minister.

349
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,550
You're indeed amazing, Vice Minister.

350
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,750
But...

351
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,680
Xu Hu

352
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,440
must come with me.

353
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,460
Why?

354
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,530
We caught him.

355
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,870
Sorry.

356
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,170
This case belongs to the Ministry of Justice.

357
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:07,810
No, you...

358
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,730
Vice Minister.

359
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,930
Assistant Minister, do you intend

360
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,060
to go against the Court of Judicial Review

361
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,860
by doing this?

362
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,260
The law is merciless.

363
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,590
Today,

364
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,590
I must take him away.

365
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,310
Please

366
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,670
don't stop me.

367
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,030
Get up.

368
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,790
This...

369
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,440
This...

370
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,590
Mr. Li.

371
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,060
It's Man'er.

372
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,410
Hu.

373
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,320
Hu!

374
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,990
Hu!

375
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,820
Hu!

376
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,390
Assistant Minister.

377
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,550
Vice Minister Li.

378
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,750
Are you here to plead for Sun Bao again?

379
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,150
About Sun Bao,

380
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,260
we'll know

381
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,920
after we interrogate Xu Hu.

382
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,590
Your visit this time...

383
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,840
What will we know?

384
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,990
In your heart,

385
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,510
shouldn't they both be dead?

386
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,110
I didn't expect

387
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,530
you to be Lu Chenghuang's backer.

388
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,020
You...

389
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,280
What did you say?

390
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,180
Li... Li Bing.

391
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:00,910
You...

392
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,990
You're slandering me!

393
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,280
In order to locate Xu Hu

394
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,070
and keep the secret between you and Lu Chenghuang,

395
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,910
you even killed

396
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,040
Zhao Ruyi and Wu Liu.

397
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,590
Then, you framed it on Xu Hu.

398
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,290
Wu Liu was originally your man.

399
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,830
You hinted to him

400
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,110
to tell me about Xu Hu.

401
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,000
Say it.

402
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,500
If you don't,

403
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,370
I'll let you experience our torture methods.

404
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,050
I'll say it.

405
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,160
They asked me

406
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,000
if I knew someone

407
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,070
named Xu Hu.

408
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,990
Xu Hu?

409
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,550
You locked him in prison

410
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,670
to keep an eye on Zhao Ruyi.

411
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,830
So when Zhao Ruyi

412
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,770
went to see him,

413
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,510
you found him immediately

414
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,500
and got involved in this case.

415
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,070
As for why

416
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,390
you got the Court of Judicial Review involved,

417
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,390
I'm afraid you wanted to use me

418
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,270
and Sun Bao

419
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,470
to find Xu Hu.

420
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,990
But you knew

421
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,270
you couldn't handle them both

422
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,510
on your own.

423
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,420
Who are you?

424
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,910
So you arranged for the

425
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,260
Ministry of Justice's constables to be on standby,

426
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,630
and you showed up as the assistant minister

427
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,750
of the Ministry of Justice.

428
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,830
This way, you had the right

429
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,830
to take them away.

430
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,520
Am I right?

431
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,230
Assistant Minister.

432
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,190
No matter what,

433
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,710
Sun Bao and Xu Hu

434
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,190
have been arrested.

435
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,010
Who else can prove

436
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,630
what you have

437
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,030
just said?

438
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,950
Xu... Xu Hu?

439
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,000
Guards!

440
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,350
Li Bing is colluding with the criminal!

441
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,920
You're breaking the law!

442
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,250
You are framing me.

443
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,400
I advise you not to call the guards.

444
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,610
Actually, you've never met Xu Hu,

445
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,400
right?

446
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,160
You can only refer to the arrest warrant for his appearance.

447
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,500
Hu!

448
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,820
You...

449
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,550
Qiu Qingzhi.

450
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,470
You...

451
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,110
You...

452
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,390
You didn't expect

453
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,740
we'd work together.

454
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,090
Thank you, General Qiu.

455
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,310
Xu Hu is not the murderer.

456
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,810
The reason you're looking for him

457
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,010
is because of what he is investigating.

458
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,990
I know where he is

459
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,910
and where he is going

460
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,110
to find what he wants.

461
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,310
Vice Minister Li.

462
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,010
What do you want?

463
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,030
I hope

464
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,230
we can work together.

465
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,310
Just like before.

466
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,250
Do me a favor.

467
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,950
I'll give you

468
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,750
what he found.

469
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,590
Sun Bao is from the Court of Judicial Review.

470
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,920
I can't leave him alone.

471
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,590
Sir.

472
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,650
I've written it all down.

473
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,750
Assistant Minister.

474
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,790
Time for your visit to the

475
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,790
Court of Judicial Review's prison.

476
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,830
Get up.

477
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,510
Vice Minister Li.

478
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,640
About what you promised me...

479
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,470
I...

480
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,510
I'm going back on my word.

481
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,210
Thank you, Alibaba.

482
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,190
The greatest gratitude is action.

483
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,030
By the way,

484
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,830
this is from your dorm.

485
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,310
Sir asked me to give it to you.

486
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,860
What?

487
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,550
Are you going to see Xu Hu?

488
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,430
Change your clothes first.

489
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,910
Go.

490
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,660
We'll just sit back and watch.

491
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,230
You really don't need help?

492
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,990
No, no, no.

493
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,870
Are you...

494
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,830
all right?

495
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,390
One against five.

496
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,100
No problem.

497
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,990
Xu Hu and Lu Chenghuang's thieving

498
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,850
was actually a trap set up by Xu Hu.

499
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,230
He didn't know where Lu Chenghuang

500
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,270
hid the item,

501
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,810
so he could only trick him.

502
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,170
He opened the lock

503
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,830
and left half a key inside.

504
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,090
This way, it showcased his ability

505
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,230
and created an illusion of uncertainty.

506
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,270
Lu Chenghuang felt threatened by this.

507
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,930
Once people feel threatened,

508
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,950
they will go to their item-hiding spot

509
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,150
to check if it is safe.

510
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,430
This way, one can figure out

511
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,630
where he hid the item.

512
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,550
It was a good idea.

513
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,140
But Lu Chenghuang

514
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,910
must have hidden the item

515
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,110
in his warehouse.

516
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,890
That place is filled with junk.

517
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,020
Excluding himself,

518
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,560
no one else can find it.

519
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,070
The key focus

520
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,980
is to make sure

521
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,150
no one can alert him.

522
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,320
So we had to arrest Feng Jian

523
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,110
and let them

524
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,090
find the item in peace.

525
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,740
That's about it.

526
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,700
I didn't ask you anything.

527
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,910
Vice Minister Li.

528
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,010
Why did you break your promise

529
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,190
and suddenly feel guilty about it?

530
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,860
You can't say that.

531
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,030
Maybe,

532
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,700
after I acquire the item

533
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,100
and figure out what it is,

534
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,850
I will still give it to you.

535
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,330
You, on the other hand.

536
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,150
You set up so many traps

537
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,190
in the dyehouse.

538
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,310
It was really dangerous.

539
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,840
Since we had to put up a show,

540
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,590
I had to make sure it was believable.

541
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,850
Vice Minister Li.

542
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,140
your skills are much better than before.

543
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,510
It's been three years.

544
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,450
Many things have changed.

545
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,400
I've figured it out.

546
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,310
I've been tailing

547
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,670
Lu Huangchong in secret.

548
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,340
When he found out we were caught,

549
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,590
he couldn't resist checking

550
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,990
the hiding spot himself.

551
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,770
Let’s go.
Let’s go.

552
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,400
You don't seem anxious at all.

553
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,210
Why would I?

554
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,340
Do you already know

555
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,650
what they're looking for?

556
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,840
Before Sun Bao was arrested,

557
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,040
he left me a wax pill.

558
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,610
He said it was Xu Hu's backup plan.

559
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,600
Give it to me.

560
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,830
What?

561
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,190
You always have a backup plan.

562
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,920
Give it to me!

563
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,270
Sir.

564
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,790
I'm innocent.

565
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,540
Trust me.

566
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,040
It is a record of

567
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,020
what Xu Hu has been investigating for these two years.

568
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,680
There is also a story in there.

569
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,540
The story is about his experience

570
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,670
during the war in the Western Regions.

571
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,270
You...

572
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,190
At that time, the war was almost over.

573
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,980
The scouting team led by Xu Hu

574
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,810
was returning after gathering enemy intel.

575
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,870
When they passed by Huangsha Valley,

576
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,160
they came across a troop

577
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,360
of our army soldiers.

578
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,740
Without warning,

579
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,420
they launched an attack on his group.

580
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,880
They were caught off guard

581
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,910
and the whole team was wiped out.

582
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,840
Only Xu Hu and Sun Bao survived.

583
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,110
Sun Bao was injured because of that.

584
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,920
After Xu Hu settled Sun Bao,

585
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,590
he grew suspicious of the situation.

586
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,520
So he sneaked back to investigate.

587
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,590
He didn't understand why

588
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,250
allies would kill each other.

589
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,780
But when he went back,

590
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,150
he found that the troop

591
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,910
was annihilated.

592
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,470
No one survived.

593
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,100
After the shock,

594
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,950
Xu Hu found that

595
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,670
they were transporting

596
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,870
a giant stone coffin.

597
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,300
But the stone coffin was empty

598
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,360
and the item inside had disappeared.

599
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,840
Xu Hu speculated that

600
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,350
this troop was specially tasked

601
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,070
to transport the stone coffin.

602
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,110
And their death

603
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,040
was also related to the thing in the stone coffin.

604
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,160
Then he found

605
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,210
traces of someone passing by.

606
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,230
It was a man who followed the troops and scavenged dead bodies.

607
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,350
Lu Huangchong.

608
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,640
Nowadays, he's called Lu Chenghuang.

609
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,400
You've been on the battlefield before.

610
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,070
Do you know this story?

611
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,150
You slave soldier

612
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,810
retreated from the frontline

613
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,150
and willingly became deserters.

614
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,190
In that case,

615
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,150
we have to follow the military law.

616
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:42,990
Dig deeper.

617
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,690
If you're not buried deep enough,

618
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,590
you might be eaten by dogs.

619
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,720
I've never heard of it before.

620
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,500
I don't know what that item is.

621
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,820
It's almost time, right?

622
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,330
Almost time? For what?

623
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,010
You're stalling for time here

624
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,400
to let Sun Bao and Xu Hu

625
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,440
go to Lu Chenghuang's place

626
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,500
and retrieve the item you mentioned.

627
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,990
I think

628
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,540
they should be almost done.

629
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,140
Come on.

630
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,760
Let's go and have a look.

631
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,270
If the two of you

632
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,550
are here,

633
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,960
it means that Feng Jian, Assistant Minister of Justice,

634
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,280
must be doomed.

635
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,720
Lu Chenghuang.

636
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,430
No.

637
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,850
Lu Huangchong.

638
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,820
You'd better be obedient.

639
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:54,900
You want to catch me?

640
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,710
Impossible.

641
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,550
I crawled out

642
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,700
from the pile of corpses.

643
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,730
I won't be a prisoner again.

644
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,620
Give me the box.

645
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,040
Lu Huangchong.

646
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,469
Do you think

647
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,790
you can defeat us?

648
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,310
No.

649
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,510
But the shelves

650
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,110
to your left and right

651
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,110
are covered with gunpowder.

652
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,670
You don't believe me?

653
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,449
What is in this box?

654
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,750
The box?

655
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,310
That's my protective talisman.

656
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,330
As long as this box is here,

657
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,570
I'll be fine.

658
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,330
Was it from Huangsha Valley?

659
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,870
You've found out

660
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,870
a lot about it.

661
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,120
I can't tell you.

662
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,830
You won't believe me anyway.

663
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,389
Give me the box.

664
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,270
Come on.

665
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,489
Then,

666
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,190
we'll open it.

667
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,370
Vice Minister.

668
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,240
Sun Bao.

669
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,550
Here.

670
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,650
These are...

671
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,790
Detailed records of

672
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,190
the collusion between

673
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,220
Lu Chenghuang and Feng Jian.

674
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,510
Lu Chenghuang and Feng Jian of the Ministry of Justice

675
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,870
colluded with each other for personal gains. The evidence is right here.

676
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,270
We can close the case now.

677
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,310
Let's go.

678
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,410
Where do you plan to go?

679
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,640
I think I'll send Yang home first.

680
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,510
He had been wandering for years.

681
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,310
It's time for him to return to his hometown.

682
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,990
Yes.

683
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,730
After all that investigation,

684
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,630
I didn't expect this to be it.

685
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,230
But...

686
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,020
we found a corrupt official

687
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,620
and defeated Lu Huangchong.

688
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,630
It's worth it.

689
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,710
Worth it, alright.

690
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,090
♫Time is like a song♫

691
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,630
Alright.

692
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,780
You can stop here.

693
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,810

00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,870

♫The remaining sparks♫

700
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,270

Sir.

717

Xu Hu has left?

718
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,580
Sir.

719
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,910
There's something strange.

720
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,510
What is it?

721
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:33,510
Xu Hu and I

722
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,350
did not land any hits on Lu Chenghuang.

723
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,680
He shouldn't have died.

724
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,570
One more thing.

725
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,710
In the warehouse,

726
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,110
other than me, Xu Hu,

727
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,660
and Lu Chenghuang's men,

728
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,800
there seemed to be another person.

729
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,000
But there was no trace

730
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,800
of anyone else in the warehouse.

731
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,150
And Lu Chenghuang died accidentally.

732
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,880
This matter can't be verified.

733
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,270
Sir,

734
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,230
why aren't you surprised

735
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,790
by what I said?

736
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,230
Now that the case is like this,

737
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,110
there's nothing to be surprised about.

738
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,170
The case is closed.

739
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,220
Thank you.

740
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,460
Get some rest.

741
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,700
Yes.

742
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,090
[My slave]

743
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,710
Mr. Li.

744
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,350
Why did war break out

745
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,860
three years ago?

746
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,060
It's my treat today.

747
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,760
You're always treating us.

748
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,390
We finally got a raise

749
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,430
and solved a few big cases in a row.

750
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,960
This time, we'll treat you.

751
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,310
The more, the better.

752
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,810
What do you want to eat?

753
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,870
I'm not hungry.

754
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,790
No need to bother.

755
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,990
Have you guys

756
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,110
noticed something?

757
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,550
Since we started working for Sir,

758
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,750
we have kept encountering big cases.

759
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,840
Don't say that.

760
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,310
Why do you sound like

761
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,870
the cases are chasing after Sir?

762
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,200
That's not what I meant.

763
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,550
In the past,

764
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,590
when there were no cases,

765
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,520
I always wished for some cases.

766
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,920
Now that there are more cases,

767
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,190
it feels kind of ominous.

768
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,290
This morning,

769
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,020
my right eyelid kept twitching.

770
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,490
I feel like something is going to happen.

771
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,070
This is bad.

772
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,230
Don't be superstitious.

773
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,790
Don't be superstitious.

774
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,910
You're right,  don't be superstitious.

775
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,610
Where are Chen Shi and Cui Bei?

776
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,970
Cui Bei, that nerd,

777
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,050
must be reading the dossiers.

778
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,270
Chen Shi went grocery shopping.

779
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,670
Left eyelid twitching means good fortune.

780
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,090
Good fortune.

781
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,360
It's good.

782
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,730
This signifies great fortune.

783
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,830
Thank you, master.

784
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,700
See you.

785
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,620
Alright.

786
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,100
Slow down. Don't fall.

787
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,870
Got it.

788
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,710
Kick it to me.

789
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,770
The cat ate people.

790
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,230
Thieves left empty-handed.

791
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,440
The medicine failed.

792
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,940
Blood filled the cup.

793
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,120
The cat ate people.

794
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,550
Thieves left empty-handed.

795
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,590
The cat ate people.

796
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,310
Thieves left empty-handed.

797
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,790
The medicine failed.

798
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,350
Blood filled the cup.

799
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,150
It's my turn.

800
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,310
Handsome,

801
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,240
please hurry up.

802
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,750
Everyone is waiting to eat.

803
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,830
Okay, Chen Shi.

804
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:57,940
It's all gone.

805
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
What should we do?

806
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,770
Don't worry.

807
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,990
We just imported a new batch of salt.

808
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:01,700
It's enough.

809
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,630
I'll get it now.

810
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,950
That's great. Hurry up.

811
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,510
Okay.

812
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,070
I have plenty of salt in the back.

813
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,630
It's enough.

814
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,150
Okay.

815
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:30,830
Someone's dead!

816
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,590
Murder!

817
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,810
Murder!

818
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:33,840
Someone's dead!

819
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,840
Someone's dead!
