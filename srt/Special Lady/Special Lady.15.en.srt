[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,590
[Episode 15]

4
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,509
Se...

5
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,150
Miss Zhu.

6
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,470
I didn't expect

7
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,010
I would hear you call me that at such a time.

8
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,810
Did you think it was Mr. Xiao just now?

9
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,420
Even if he called me,

10
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,030
it must have been out of frustration.

11
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,750
After all, I caused the trouble.

12
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,140
Or

13
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,220
he didn't even want to talk to me.

14
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,450
It's all my fault.

15
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,260
I'm sorry for Xiao Yu

16
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,280
and you.

17
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,560
Although I always say that he's wrong,

18
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,130
and I always go against him,

19
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,470
I never expected him

20
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,690
to bear the consequences

21
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,460
of my mistakes.

22
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,530
You didn't want it

23
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,200
to come to this.

24
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,070
Miss Zhu.

25
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,860
Don't blame yourself.

26
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,680
You were the role model of the students.

27
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,620
But because of my willfulness,

28
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,780
you were punished, too.

29
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,210
Now you're even comforting me.

30
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,000
Junior Zhou.

31
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,520
Thank you.

32
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,720
You don't have to thank me. We're friends.

33
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,370
Also,

34
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,500
I don't think Mr. Xiao will blame you.

35
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,180
We are all friends.

36
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,690
So you don't have to thank us

37
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,250
or apologize to us.

38
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,010
Friends?

39
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,850
Aren't we friends?

40
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,130
Why are there so many delicious foods today?

41
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,580
Young Master.

42
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,470
What are you eating?

43
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,770
Without the Green Silk Rose,

44
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,320
don't you think it's cloying?

45
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,260
You don't like these usually.

46
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,870
Why are you...

47
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,650
You're right.

48
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,190
I don't like these usually.

49
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,450
Maybe

50
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
it's because people change.

51
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,050
Young Master, you're becoming more and more casual.

52
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,900
Well,

53
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,280
is it a good thing or a bad thing?

54
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,880
Of course, it's a good thing.

55
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,460
You'll be safer at Song's Academy.

56
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,370
Uncle Hu.

57
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,280
Today,

58
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,520
I've been dropped out of school.

59
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,280
You know what?

60
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,640
I've been the most naughty child

61
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,950
in my family.

62
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,860
My big brother and second brother

63
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,780
often get punished for my mistakes.

64
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,790
But

65
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,990
I've never felt guilty.

66
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,000
It's your blessing to have so many people

67
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,570
taking care of and loving you.

68
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,670
I think Mr. Xiao

69
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,770
would prefer to see you being carefree.

70
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,310
If today's events have taught you anything,

71
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,460
you have to pull yourself together.

72
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,140
Don't blame yourself.

73
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:21,870
You should do better.

74
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:28,880
I understand.

75
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,640
It's my pleasure to share your burden.

76
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,100
During my stay in the academy,

77
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,900
I feel satisfied to have met confidants

78
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,770
like Mr. Xiao

79
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,270
and you.

80
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,370
Well, since

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,870
you said I'm your confidant,

82
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
don't be so polite.

83
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,430
Call me Yueniang.

84
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,350
Yueniang?

85
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,310
Yueniang is your nickname.

86
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,070
How can I be impolite?

87
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,100
I'd better call you Lady Zhu.

88
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,850
Besides,

89
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,440
friendship isn't measured

90
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,390
in terms of titles.

91
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,330
Am I right?

92
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,320
Since you said so,

93
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,720
you can call me whatever you want.

94
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,480
Now I understand.

95
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,240
You were dropped out of school

96
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,990
because of someone else's matter.

97
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,300
Uncle Hu.

98
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,020
Don't say anything harsh.

99
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,320
Anyway, I know everything

100
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,420
about both Song's Academy and Song Mansion.

101
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,350
I know my way around.

102
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,150
We can sneak over

103
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,330
to find the secret letter tonight.

104
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,540
Fine.

105
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,620
Let it be.

106
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,780
The Crown Prince wants you to go back anyway.

107
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,820
He wants me to go back?

108
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,560
He's looking for you everywhere.

109
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,710
He told you to go back.

110
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,630
But...

111
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,610
I haven't found the secret letter yet.

112
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,840
If Song Xun wanted to use it to attack the Crown Prince,

113
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,760
the secret letter would have been made public.

114
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,419
For such a long time,

115
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,750
we haven't heard anything about the secret letter.

116
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,049
It means

117
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,169
Song Xu already knows

118
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,920
the importance of the secret letter.

119
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,630
He'll deal with it properly.

120
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:49,840
Well...

121
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,990
The ledger...

122
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,900
We haven't found the ledger yet.

123
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,170
The Crown Prince didn't say anything about the ledger.

124
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,380
He just wants you to go back early.

125
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,640
No.

126
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,170
I won't go back unless I find the secret letter.

127
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,950
When have I ever given up halfway?

128
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,240
Young Master.

129
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,250
I've made up my mind.

130
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,960
Are you not leaving

131
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,760
because of someone else?

132
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,710
What are you talking about?

133
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,280
Young Master.

134
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,390
I have a kind reminder.

135
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,750
I don't know if I should tell you.

136
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:40,870
You shouldn't.

137
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,410
Young Master.

138
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,170
I'll tell you even if I shouldn't.

139
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,390
Xiao Yu can have feelings for Miss Zhu.

140
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,420
You cannot.

141
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,060
I knew

142
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,890
that if I didn't go out, you would talk nonsense.

143
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,880
If you say no, then no.

144
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,310
Just eat.

145
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,300
You're so hungry that you've lost your mind.

146
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,900
[Han Mansion]

147
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,390
Everyone,

148
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,500
please take a seat.

149
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,270
Please have a seat.

150
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,810
Today is Mr. Han's birthday.

151
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,150
On behalf of the Wenshang Academy of Luoyang,

152
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,830
I'd like to make a toast to Mr. Han.

153
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,400
On behalf of Hanbo Academy, I propose a toast to Mr. Han.

154
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:19,890
Thank you.

155
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,670
On behalf of Meisen Academy,

156
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,000
I propose a toast to Mr. Han.

157
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,730
Thank you.

158
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,770
Thank you for coming to the banquet.

159
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,220
It's my honor.

160
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,410
A toast to you all.

161
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,040
Come on.

162
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,220
Come on.

163
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,220
A toast to Mr. Han.

164
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,250
Everyone.

165
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,950
Please sit down.

166
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,370
Sit.

167
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,120
Sit down.

168
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,230
It's rare.

169
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,540
Dean Song's presence is extremely rare.

170
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,780
If it weren't for Mr. Han's birthday,

171
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,120
it would be hard to have Dean Song present.

172
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,510
Exactly.

173
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,020
Everyone knows that since the establishment of Yiyang Academy several years ago,

174
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,410
the academies in Luoyang that used to be famous

175
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,660
lost the limelight.

176
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,920
More than ten years have passed.

177
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,070
Yiyang Academy has become a revered institution

178
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,310
in the minds of the students.

179
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,550
All these years,

180
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,820
many virtuous disciples have gone to Yiyang Academy to study.

181
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,360
It's almost turning into the Yiyang School of Thought.

182
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,670
It's just idle talk.

183
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,420
Don't take it seriously.

184
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,610
My sole purpose in starting the school

185
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,810
was to offer education without bias.

186
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,010
I dare not say

187
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,740
that I've created a School of Thought.

188
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,060
Speaking of which,

189
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,430
I haven't been to Yiyang for a long time.

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,760
I miss it so much.

191
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:44,890
Mr. Han.

192
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,410
I have a suggestion.

193
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,330
Why don't the three academies of ours

194
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,490
have a competition against Yiyang Academy?

195
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,860
We'll invite you to host the competition.

196
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,230
Meanwhile, you can visit Yiyang. What do you think?

197
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,270
It's good.

198
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,580
Academies should have more interactions

199
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,070
and hold more competitions like this.

200
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,360
Such competitions allow students to exchange knowledge,

201
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,820
benefiting both their minds and bodies.

202
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,560
It's a good thing.

203
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,780
It's good.

204
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,980
Mr. Han is right.

205
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,740
But the exams are coming.

206
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,280
It will distract the students.

207
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,200
Dean Song, you're wrong.

208
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,240
Yiyang Academy has always taken both literature and martial arts as its foundation.

209
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,550
You even created a Women's Academy, which is a precedence.

210
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,360
The students of such an open-minded academic institution

211
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,880
should be adaptable in both action and stillness.

212
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,470
Exactly.

213
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,400
Yes.

214
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,680
It's a rare opportunity

215
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,390
to learn from Dean Song's school philosophy.

216
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,340
Yes.

217
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,270
Well,

218
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,860
since everyone agrees,

219
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,010
I think it's settled.

220
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,740
Okay.

221
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,660
Since you are so passionate about it,

222
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,110
in a few days, after I return to Yiyang,

223
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,140
I'll prepare for it.

224
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,580
Yueniang.

225
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,900
Where is it?

226
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,180
Over there.

227
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:12,870
Yueniang.

228
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,420
Is my hair messy?

229
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:17,990
It looks very nice.

230
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,550
Let's go.

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,840
Wait.

232
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,540
What about my makeup?

233
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,600
Did my makeup go off?

234
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,450
Does it look good?

235
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,050
You look so beautiful.

236
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,790
That's good.

237
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,070
I'm going to knock.

238
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,310
Go.

239
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,640
Just go.

240
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,470
Miss Song Zhu?

241
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,210
Lady Yan.

242
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,210
Please come in.

243
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,260
Let's go.

244
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,780
Why are you here?

245
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,900
Ladies,

246
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,660
have some water.

247
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,670
I'd better go out.

248
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,930
I'll leave you alone.

249
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,070
Well.

250
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,630
You guys talk.

251
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,020
-Well.
-I’ll leave you alone.

252
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,670
Don't...

253
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,040
Hurry up.

254
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:50,830
Say it.

255
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,410
You say it.

256
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,880
Mr. Xiao.

257
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,740
How about this?

258
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,700
I'll go back and ask my father for help.

259
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,750
Maybe he can help you return to the academy.

260
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,350
Lady Yan. I appreciate your kindness.

261
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,930
Let's put an end to this matter.

262
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,900
Mr. Xiao,

263
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,590
will you take the exam again next year?

264
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,590
Lady Zhu.

265
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,030
Will I take the exam again next year?

266
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,750
Why do you ask me

267
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,850
since it's your business?

268
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,640
Mr. Xiao,

269
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,520
you must take the exam again.

270
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,440
I won't.

271
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,190
You won't?

272
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,900
Why?

273
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,290
Yiyang Academy is just an experience

274
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,530
for me.

275
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,440
Since you've made up your mind,

276
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,140
I hope you can take

277
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,360
this gift

278
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,700
as a souvenir.

279
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,310
Whatever.

280
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,600
Mr. Xiao.

281
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,800
This is a little gift from me.

282
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,370
Keep it as a souvenir.

283
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,640
If you come to Yiyang again,

284
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,820
remember to come to Qinruo and me.

285
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,180
Although we can't be classmates,

286
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,849
we're still friends.

287
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,690
You're right.

288
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,369
I'm leaving so soon.

289
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,340
At this point,

290
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,950
I have to finish the task and leave as soon as possible.

291
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,550
However,

292
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,800
whether I can find the study

293
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,150
is up to fate.

294
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,210
It's so dark.

295
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,800
Why are people coming here so late?

296
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,240
Darling, why didn't you rest for a night

297
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,300
and come back tomorrow?

298
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,780
Several deans in Luoyang

299
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,120
plan to hold a competition against our academy.

300
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,170
I came back early to prepare for it.

301
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,070
Are the three academies jointly against Yiyang Academy?

302
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,660
I think

303
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,340
they are up to no good.

304
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,370
Darling.

305
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,520
Why don't you try to reject it?

306
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,180
Don't worry.

307
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,940
It's just an ordinary exchange.

308
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,210
It's good for the students.

309
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,750
They just

310
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,860
want to join hands

311
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,050
to damage the reputation of Yiyang Academy.

312
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,110
Praise and criticism are subjective.

313
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,320
As long as I have a clear conscience, that's all that matters.

314
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,890
I hope the students in our academy can sleep all before one

315
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,230
and win the tournament.

316
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,850
Are you going to say "sweeping all before one"?

317
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,620
Are they different?

318
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,210
Winning or losing doesn't matter.

319
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,920
Be it "sleeping all before one"

320
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,450
or "sweeping all before one",

321
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,490
happiness is the most important.

322
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,570
By the way, Darling.

323
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,510
Xiao Yu has been expelled by Mr. Zhang.

324
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,780
Why?

325
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,480
It seemed that he had hurt someone.

326
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,890
In fact, it was just

327
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,580
kids playing around.

328
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,910
It would be fine to ask him to do the cleaning as punishment.

329
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,300
I'm wondering if the punishment is too heavy.

330
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,640
What should we tell Chuanzhong?

331
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,470
Don't worry.

332
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,940
I'll go and find out the truth tomorrow morning.

333
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,590
If Xiao Yu did break the school rules,

334
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,020
I believe Chuanzhong would understand.

335
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,110
Don't worry.

336
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,510
Darling.

337
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,940
Why are you still reading at this hour?

338
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,000
The affairs of the academy are important,

339
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,230
but so is your well-being.

340
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,150
All right.

341
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,270
I will stop.

342
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,310
I'll listen to you.

343
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,820
Let's go to sleep.

344
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,420
Okay.

345
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,220
Let's go.

346
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,390
Even if it's three against one,

347
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,740
even if those three academies are up to no good,

348
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,790
it has nothing to do with you.

349
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,980
You're leaving.

350
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,290
I know.

351
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,540
It has nothing to do with me.

352
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,510
But I haven't got the secret letter yet.

353
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,770
Besides, the exams are coming.

354
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,590
Such a thing happened suddenly.

355
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,050
Those three academies are indeed suspicious.

356
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,070
I can't let them

357
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,180
affect my plan.

358
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,260
Am I right?

359
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,390
Young Master.

360
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,670
No matter what you say,

361
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,480
it has nothing to do with you.

362
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,190
Go investigate them as I say.

363
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,280
Are you disobeying my order?

364
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:14,650
I dare not.

365
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,030
Check the three academies in Luoyang.

366
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,720
Get to know their background

367
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,380
and their purpose.

368
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,350
Young Master.

369
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,050
Mind your identity

370
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,790
and what you should do.

371
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,240
Uncle Hu.

372
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,800
Mind your identity.

373
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,050
Yes.

374
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,470
Go ahead to investigate.

375
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,350
Immediately.

376
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,230
Why in such a hurry?

377
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,870
Go.

378
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,550
Yes.

379
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,670
Xiao Yu almost made a huge mistake.

380
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,720
I think there's nothing wrong with his punishment.

381
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,340
When it comes to the magnitude of the mistake

382
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,430
and who made it,

383
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,630
judgments should not be made hastily.

384
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,940
I believe

385
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,630
that different perspectives

386
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,670
lead to different understandings of things.

387
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,740
According to Mr. Chen,

388
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,020
the school rules will be empty.

389
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,250
It's written clearly in the school rules.

390
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,750
Those who hurt others will be expelled.

391
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,630
I was just following the school rules.

392
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,030
Mr. Zhang has always been obedient.

393
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,410
Even if...

394
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,430
He's wrong.

395
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,590
No rules, no order.

396
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,940
Since the rules are still in effect,

397
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,860
we should follow the rules.

398
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,100
Songzhi, don't worry.

399
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,670
I've figured it out.

400
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,500
Juntang.

401
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,780
Stop talking.

402
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,470
Dean.

403
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,390
Then Xiao Yu...

404
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,940
After we plant a seed,

405
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,280
we just water and fertilize it

406
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,630
and let it grow on its own.

407
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,830
Although we can't leave it completely alone,

408
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,740
we can't help it grow by pulling it up.

409
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,080
Juntang, you went to the farm with me every spring.

410
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,450
You should understand that.

411
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,070
I understand.

412
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,500
Dean.

413
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,780
I invited you here for an announcement.

414
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,800
At the recent birthday banquet for Mr. Han in Luoyang,

415
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,020
several deans in Luoyang suggested

416
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,670
organizing a Literature and Martial Arts Tournament,

417
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,430
providing students with an opportunity

418
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,720
for exchange and learning.

419
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,490
To hold a Literature and Martial Arts Tournament?

420
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,670
But the exams are coming up soon.

421
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,540
A tournament at this time of the year

422
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,410
would disturb the minds of the students.

423
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,140
Mr. Zhang.

424
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,480
Students need to develop both literature and martial arts.

425
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,950
Should all the students participate?

426
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,540
Yes.

427
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,270
Both men and women should compete.

428
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,050
It'll look so lively.

429
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,260
I thought examinations were solely about testing theory,

430
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,260
but only practical application truly stood out.

431
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,410
It's good to

432
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,660
let female students take this opportunity

433
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,900
to participate.

434
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,530
What system is it for women

435
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,830
to show their faces in public?

436
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,570
Mr. Zhang.

437
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,280
You're wrong.

438
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,550
The date of the competition has been set.

439
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,870
It's in seven days.

440
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,090
You can start preparing.

441
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,480
Yes.

442
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,480
Yes, Dean.

443
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,860
Sincerity is the foundation of sages.

444
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,370
[Joyful Melody]

445
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,620
Great is the Qian element, the origin of all things.

446
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,560
It's the source of sincerity.

447
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,180
The Qian changes, allowing each to fulfill its nature.

448
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:57,220
Kindness, simplicity, and surplus joy;

449
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,030
returning home feels like a dream.

450
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,560
Sincerity stands therein.

451
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,930
The epitome of pure goodness.

452
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,700
Therefore, it's said that the combination of Yin and Yang is the Tao.

453
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,730
Those who follow are virtuous.

454
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,020
Those who accomplish are of inherent nature.

455
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,220
To be fluent from the beginning is the embodiment of sincerity.

456
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,590
The auspicious outcome is a result of sincerity.

457
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:24,000
Once the clear scenery is lost, it's difficult to emulate.

458
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,780
That's all for today.

459
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,750
Goodbye, Sir.

460
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,670
Don't worry.

461
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,480
I have one more thing to announce.

462
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,260
Luoyang's Hanbo Academy,

463
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,780
Meisen Academy,

464
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,140
and Wenshang Academy

465
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,030
have formed a team.

466
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,560
They've invited our academy

467
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,630
to hold a Literature and Martial Arts Tournament together.

468
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,970
The time is set for seven days from now.

469
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,150
Please get ready for the competition.

470
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,260
Why are they three against one?

471
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,790
It's obvious that they want us to lose.

472
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,350
With me, this talented prodigy here,

473
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,430
how can we lose?

474
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:02,840
You're right.

475
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,310
Be confident, okay?

476
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,060
We'll count on you, the talented prodigy Li.

477
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,500
I'll keep a low profile.

478
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,440
We have Li.

479
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,510
You are not confident at all.

480
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,700
Young Master, with you here, we will win.

481
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,160
One thing needs to be highlighted.

482
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,920
This competition is different from before.

483
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,890
These are all the items in this tournament.

484
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,200
Everyone goes back to rest and recuperates.

485
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,550
Tomorrow we'll start preparing for the competition.

486
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,670
Sir.

487
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,910
Don't be absent.

488
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,950
Train hard.

489
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,270
Training?

490
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,990
I have to protect my face.

491
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,310
Do your best.

492
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,480
It's all about participation.

493
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,710
-Okay.
-But...

494
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,320
This is related to the reputation of Yiyang Academy.

495
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,190
The Women's Academy should unite

496
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,300
and overcome difficulties.

497
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,190
Yes.

498
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,100
All right.

499
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,810
Okay.

500
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,590
Rest early today.

501
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,490
Dismissed.

502
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,710
Let's go back.

503
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,630
Let's go back and have a good rest.

504
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:05,910
Mr. Song.

505
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,660
Greetings, Mr. Song.

506
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,260
I just came back last night

507
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,040
and found out about your matter.

508
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,830
I feel guilty

509
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,800
for letting you down.

510
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:22,790
Come here.

511
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,550
What do you plan to do in the future?

512
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,100
I'll go home first.

513
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,000
I haven't visited my parents for a long time.

514
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:44,830
Good.

515
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,030
When I was in Luoyang,

516
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,660
Uncle Wang asked me about you.

517
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,830
Uncle Wang?

518
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,070
Who is Uncle Wang?

519
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,610
What?

520
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,280
You don't remember him?

521
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,920
You were clingy to him when you were young.

522
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,600
You always asked him to hold you.

523
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,270
Uncle Wang.

524
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,750
I remember him.

525
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,650
How is he?

526
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,670
He's fine.

527
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,750
We are both old.

528
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,260
You're not old at all.

529
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,360
You're still young.

530
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,620
Go back and tell your father

531
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,390
that I miss him.

532
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,270
He can come to Yiyang anytime.

533
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,550
Actually,

534
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,880
I'm still reluctant

535
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,880
to leave the academy.

536
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,790
So, you must pass the entrance exam for the academy next year.

537
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,670
I will remember your advice.

538
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,970
If you need anything,

539
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,490
you can ask Uncle Dai to help.

540
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,670
Thank you, Sir.

541
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,270
I have very little luggage.

542
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,230
Don't bother.

543
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,910
Have you decided when you're leaving?

544
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,250
Not yet.

545
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,470
I want to stay in Yiyang and travel for some more time

546
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,240
before making a decision.

547
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,920
The academy is going to hold the Literature and Martial Arts Tournament.

548
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,800
You can stay and watch.

549
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,060
I'm glad to.

550
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,070
By the way,

551
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,930
what do you think of the pattern of this screen?

552
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,400
The s...

553
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,380
Scr...

554
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,590
Screen?

555
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,000
Last night,

556
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,270
I suddenly felt

557
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,470
the pattern of this screen was a bit outdated.

558
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,310
It's time to change it.

559
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,960
It's good to change it.

560
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,850
It can change one's mood.

561
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,910
If there's nothing special,

562
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,630
come back for a meal before you leave.

563
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,650
I have something for your father.

564
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,490
I'll do as you say.

565
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,780
That was close.

566
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,770
Young Master.

567
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,640
Have you found out anything?

568
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,530
I almost ended up revealing something when Mr. Song was probing me.

569
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,230
By the way, Uncle Hu.

570
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,610
Who is Uncle Wang?

571
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,060
Uncle Wang?

572
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,030
I've never heard of him.

573
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,410
I'll look into it later.

574
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,260
How is the matter I asked you to investigate?

575
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,390
The three great academies in Luoyang are

576
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,110
Hanbo Academy,

577
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,750
Meisen Academy, and Wenshang Academy.

578
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,950
These three academies are equally renowned in Luoyang.

579
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,180
However, the total number of candidates who pass the imperial examinations

580
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,450
from these three academies every year

581
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,550
is not as high as that of Yiyang Academy alone.

582
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,000
So the three academies

583
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,270
basically don't have any contact with Yiyang Academy,

584
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,640
let alone academic communication.

585
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,110
Then it makes it

586
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,000
even stranger for the three academies

587
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,910
to invite Yiyang Academy to hold

588
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,340
the Literature and Martial Arts Tournament together.

589
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,900
I learned that

590
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,910
these three academies

591
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,280
are working together to fight against Yiyang Academy.

592
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,750
The competition format has been changed to mixed-gender.

593
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,030
But only Yiyang Academy has a Women's Academy.

594
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,750
When I was investigating this,

595
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,460
I found something else.

596
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,940
I wonder if it has something to do with the tournament.

597
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,800
The city of Yiyang is not bad.

598
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,820
It's my first time here.

599
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:48,570
Me too.

600
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,480
Come and register.

601
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,000
Let me see.

602
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,940
My name is Yang Qian.

603
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,300
Go.

604
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,000
Okay.

605
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:58,710
Next.

606
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,730
Let me see.

607
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,440
This is...

608
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,280
This is the token of our academy.

609
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,110
You're from the Imperial College.

610
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,610
You are talented.

611
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,740
I'm flattered.

612
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:09,720
Next.

613
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,260
The stuff.

614
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,900
Please.

615
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,990
Right now is a busy time for students to study.

616
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,060
Students in the Imperial College

617
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,350
should pay more attention

618
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,650
than those from other academies.

619
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,820
Why did they come to Yiyang?

620
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,870
I found it strange too.

621
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,200
So I followed them.

622
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,540
I found that Li Yi

623
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,670
from Luoyang's Wenshang Academy came to pick them up.

624
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,630
Did these three academies

625
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,180
invite people from the Imperial College to cheat?

626
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,950
But how can those three deans

627
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,470
hire people from the Imperial College?

628
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,270
The imperial court values scholars.

629
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,500
Even Duke Yue

630
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,560
won't dare to act recklessly to the people in the Imperial College.

631
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,710
It may be related to the Bureau of Military Affairs.

632
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,590
The Bureau of Military Affairs?

633
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,060
Have you forgotten the letters we found in the Dean's Room

634
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,470
between Song Xu and the Bureau of Military Affairs?

635
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,790
If the Bureau of Military Affairs is behind this,

636
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,070
we need to know more

637
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,340
about Yiyang Academy.

638
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,820
Go and investigate

639
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,900
the purpose of the people from the Imperial College coming here.

640
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,170
Yes.

641
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:54,710
Second Sister.

642
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,830
I've been disciplining you for so many years. I'm tired.

643
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,470
Suit yourself.

644
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,190
I've been restricting you

645
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,280
and strict with you.

646
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,430
But you are my sister.

647
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,620
I care a lot about you.

648
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,650
Second Sister.

649
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,620
Xiao Yu left.

650
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,060
You must be very sad.

651
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,800
Does this have anything to do with you?

652
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:26,900
Second Sister.

653
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,630
Actually,

654
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,380
I...

655
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,980
Although you are naughty,

656
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,310
you're kind.

657
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,330
I know if Xiao Yu's dismissal is related to you,

658
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,020
you must be sad and guilty.

659
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,300
Second Sister, you know me.

660
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,350
I don't like to suffer losses.

661
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,980
The feeling that others owed me used to be the most upsetting.

662
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,620
But now I feel

663
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,180
the most pain when I owe others.

664
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,740
I found

665
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,060
my sister has grown up.

666
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,110
Second Sister, don't make fun of me.

667
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,370
Since Xiao Yu entered Yiyang Academy,

668
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,030
haven't you been trying to drive him away?

669
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,820
Second Sister, you...

670
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,450
You know that?

671
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,430
To be exact,

672
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,230
Father knows.

673
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,280
How would Father know?

674
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,310
Your little trick

675
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,000
can't escape Father's eyes.

676
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,460
He dotes on you,

677
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,210
so he allows you to mess around.

678
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,310
It turns out...

679
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,540
How did you know?

680
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,220
Mother told me.

681
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,010
It turns out that Mother dotes on you more.

682
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,420
She told you everything.

683
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,620
Alright, stop being jealous.

684
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,100
Second Sister.

685
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,340
I have something to tell you.

686
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,200
But can you not punish me?

687
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,260
I've really been holding this inside, feeling incredibly choked up about it.

688
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,220
Yueniang.

689
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,450
I think

690
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,290
you should tell Father.

691
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,100
You should take your responsibility.

692
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,620
That's what the children of the Song family should do.

693
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,690
Yueniang, come in.

694
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,400
Father.

695
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,800
You're still up?

696
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,660
What's wrong?

697
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,840
I...

698
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,820
I...

699
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,060
Father.

700
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,550
I'll

701
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,550
tell you the truth.

702
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:37,280
Actually, the ghost incident earlier

703
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,920
was initiated by me.

704
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,520
Xiao Yu hit someone

705
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,690
to help me.

706
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,950
He...

707
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,620
He took all the blame

708
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,830
to help me protect the reputation of the Song family.

709
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,160
Father.

710
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,790
I'm sorry.

711
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,990
You should say this to the person who helped you.

712
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,800
But...

713
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,040
Yueniang.

714
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,570
The real incident that dishonored our family's reputation was the unwillingness to take responsibility.

715
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,980
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.

716
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,020
To recognize one's mistakes and correct them

717
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,550
is the greatest virtue.

718
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,050
Father.

719
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,290
Can you let Xiao Yu return to the academy?

720
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,390
The rule in Song's Academy is

721
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,960
to obey the rules.

722
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,920
Father.

723
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,080
Go back and copy the school rules

724
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,520
100 times.

725
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,990
Hand it in to me tomorrow morning.

726
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,380
I have training tomorrow.

727
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,460
Anything else?

728
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,020
No.

729
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,530
Father, rest early.

730
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,920
I'll take my leave.

731
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,510
Come in. The door isn't locked.

732
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,940
Uncle Hu, I said the door isn't locked.

733
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,170
You can open it yourself.

734
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,170
Why do you want me to...
