00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,930
[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,810
[Episode 23]

4
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:41,720
Greetings, My Lord.

5
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,630
Is everything done this month?

6
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,590
Yes.

7
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,410
Li Shancai has already distributed the donations

8
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,000
to various merchants.

9
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,640
But he is

10
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,320
too arrogant and domineering.

11
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,990
I'm afraid

12
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,610
we have to abandon him later.

13
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,220
Ignore him.

14
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,510
If something happens to him,

15
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,190
someone will take care of it.

16
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,240
No wonder you

17
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,980
never let me touch the ledger.

18
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,820
You are different from them.

19
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,940
Thank you for your kindness.

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,310
Don't let me down.

21
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,070
Yes, My Lord.

22
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,890
I will do my best for you.

23
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,270
By the way,

24
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,900
Zhao Wenlang sent a message.

25
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,200
As you guessed,

26
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,070
the previous information was not about Xiao Yu.

27
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,180
But I've already asked Zhao Wenlang

28
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,880
to get the latest portrait of Xiao Yu

29
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,340
to see if he is the son of Xiao Chuanzhong.

30
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,630
It’s not accurate.

31
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,700
-Check it again.
-It's true.

32
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,110
Take another look.

33
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,070
Mr. Xiao.

34
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,100
Why are you here?

35
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,650
I know you like crickets.

36
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,760
I happened to catch one at the back mountain.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,390
-Here you are.
-Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,920
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

39
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,470
What are you doing?

40
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,370
Fortune-telling.

41
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,660
Mr. Xiao.

42
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,360
Let me tell you your fortune.

43
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,590
Come on.

44
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,090
You really can?

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,280
Tell me your birth information.

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,590
Okay.

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,080
Wait for me.

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,550
Go away.

49
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,560
Mr. Xiao.

50
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,900
Is the birth information you told me accurate?

51
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,470
Yes.

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,510
What's wrong?

53
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,630
Your marital relationship

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,710
will be very tumultuous.

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,350
Is it accurate?

56
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,180
If your birth information is right,

57
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,040
based on my skills passed down from my ancestors, I wouldn't have made mistakes.

58
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,500
Tell me how tumultuous it will be.

59
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,480
Your parents and your spouse will conflict.

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,230
Mr. Xiao,

61
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,270
the one you marry in the future

62
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,230
will be opposed by your family.

63
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:51,560
This...

64
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,090
This...

65
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,200
What are you talking about?

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,320
Since she's the destined one,

67
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,940
my parents should like her.

68
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,510
It's strange.

69
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,070
Right?

70
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,150
Mr. Xiao,

71
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,210
Your destiny is ruled by the Purple Star,

72
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,540
your physical being is governed by the Celestial Ruler Star,

73
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,610
and even the Palace of Fortune and Virtue is filled with auspicious stars.

74
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,030
You must either be the emperor or a prince.

75
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,230
Mr. Xiao,

76
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,940
is your birth information really accurate?

77
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,050
Look.

78
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,940
I told you it wouldn't be accurate.

79
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,390
What?

80
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,029
Let me see.

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,670
My father is Marquis Haiwang.

82
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,250
A relative by marriage of the royal family.

83
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,740
Not a member of the royal family.

84
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:24,600
The relationship is distant.

85
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,150
Mr. Xue.

86
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,320
I heard that your family runs the business.

87
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,130
Businessmen are good people.

88
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,550
I also heard that many merchants

89
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,050
are donating and doing good deeds.

90
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,150
Yes.

91
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,380
My father often donated money.

92
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,100
I heard that he also sponsored poor students.

93
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,090
Uncle Xue is a good man.

94
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,590
But...

95
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,120
how can we donate?

96
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,300
Seems to be through a charity foundation organized by Duke Yue.

97
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,110
Once received,

98
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,670
the donations will be distributed to the students.

99
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,470
Just like

100
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,860
how Mr. Zhou's sister received the fund.

101
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,080
Is Duke Yue in charge of the charity foundation?

102
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,300
I'm not sure.

103
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,380
My dad told me that once.

104
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,630
I think I know.

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,710
The donation from the charity foundation

106
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,900
will be sent to four academies.

107
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,250
I don't know which four.

108
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,030
Anyhow, Yiyang Academy is involved.

109
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,240
You can ask Instructor Shen.

110
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,730
Every year, he's in charge of

111
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,590
distributing the donations to the poor students.

112
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,690
Junior Zhou.

113
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,680
Miss Zhu.

114
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,450
You're early.

115
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,120
I just got here.

116
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,350
The books here smell so good.

117
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,870
Miss Zhu.

118
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,450
Let's study together.

119
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,800
-I’ll go find a book.
-Okay.

120
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,070
By the way, Junior Zhou,

121
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,020
do you know?

122
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,940
After I heard that you're going to sell paintings again,

123
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,540
the girls at our Women's Academy were so excited.

124
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,480
I still remember

125
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,280
I could almost

126
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,650
buy your painting.

127
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,270
But I didn't get it.

128
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,000
What a pity.

129
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
My painting is not a rare treasure.

130
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,720
You don't need to consider it a regret.

131
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,850
No.

132
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,110
You have no idea.

133
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,010
The process was really complicated.

134
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:40,680
I caused some trouble.

135
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,760
If you like it,

136
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,280
I can paint one exclusively for you.

137
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,530
Really?

138
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,730
Let's go now.

139
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,520
Let’s go.

140
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,850
Mr. Zhou is holding my hand.

141
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,530
At this moment,

142
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,980
my heart should pound like crazy.

143
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,010
Strange.

144
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,290
Isn't it written in those novels

145
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,130
as having a heart beating like a startled deer?

146
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,490
Isn’t it too stable?

147
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,930
I am indeed sufficiently steady and composed.

148
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,040
It’s such a great joy.

149
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,720
But I still can stay calm.

150
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,970
Junior Zhou.

151
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,810
Aren't you drawing me?

152
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,210
Yes, I am.

153
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,960
Why didn't you look at me?

154
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:01,960
Miss Zhu, you are

155
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,080
really cute.

156
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,130
Shouldn't portrait paintings all be drawn like this?

157
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,160
You don't have to stand there.

158
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,450
Go read some books.

159
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,260
Just a moment.

160
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,560
Okay.

161
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:36,809
Look.

162
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,450
Look for it.

163
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,409
Let's go.

164
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,280
Put it away.

165
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,039
Not this book.

166
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,610
It's this one.

167
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,460
I've never seen a cricket I caught this time.

168
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,280
Check it out.

169
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,250
Check it.

170
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,040
Really? Let me see.

171
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,650
Here.

172
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,450
Looks like this cricket.

173
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,400
Is it this one?

174
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,730
Not right.

175
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,970
Look, the legs are different.

176
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,410
In that case...

177
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,440
Search again.

178
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,840
In that case...

179
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,160
It's done.

180
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,400
This...

181
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,850
This is the scene where we first met.

182
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,840
I didn't expect you to remember it.

183
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:32,800
Of course, I remember.

184
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,090
My cricket.

185
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,610
Mr. Zhou.

186
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,010
Don’t move.

187
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,870
Watch your step.

188
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,090
Watch your step.

189
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,400
Watch your step.

190
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,370
Over there.

191
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,320
Don't move.

192
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,040
Don't move.

193
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,640
Over there.

194
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,330
Sorry.

195
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,450
Lift your leg.

196
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,130
Which one?

197
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,210
The right one.

198
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,800
Senior Song.

199
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,100
My cricket.

200
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,780
My condolences.

201
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,760
-It took me a lot of effort to catch it.
-Sorry for your loss.

202
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,330
Junior Zhou,

203
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,930
didn’t you say you wanted to have lunch?

204
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,680
I'll go with you.

205
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,770
The cricket is gone.

206
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,770
-Let's go.
-Senior Song.

207
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,380
Senior Song!

208
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,330
Senior Song, I want to draw a cricket to curse you.

209
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,600
My cricket.

210
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,950
Master is here.

211
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,410
Rise the sedan.

212
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,850
Lord Zuo visits here more often

213
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,560
than he attends the court.

214
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,100
Young Master.

215
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:00,950
Uncle Hu.

216
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,350
Where have you been?

217
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,640
I followed Li Shancai.

218
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,050
I found that Lord Zuo went to Li Mansion again.

219
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,800
It seems they have a special relationship.

220
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,810
Young Master.

221
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,930
Did you find anything in the academy?

222
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,330
I heard that all donations

223
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,800
were raised by Duke Yue.

224
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,000
Raised by Duke Yue?

225
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,730
It's normal for merchants

226
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,980
to make donations.

227
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,090
Duke Yue is a noble person in Luoyang.

228
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,600
He wouldn't worry about such a trivial matter himself.

229
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,920
Why does he care so much about the donation?

230
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,540
Keep investigating.

231
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,040
Yes.

232
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,160
Let's have tea in the dorm later.

233
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,060
Today's needlework class is so hard.

234
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,340
Yes.

235
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,710
I haven't learned it yet.

236
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,200
This flower is so hard to embroider.

237
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:11,840
Yes.

238
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,780
You guys go first.

239
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,650
I'll be right back.

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,860
Let’s go there first.

241
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,770
Feiniang.

242
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:23,840
What happened?

243
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,400
Feiniang, what happened?

244
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,010
Did someone bully you?

245
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,170
You're crying.

246
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,330
Why don't you tell me?

247
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,970
If you don't tell me,

248
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,250
I'll go to your brother.

249
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,150
No, Miss Yan.

250
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,920
My brother doesn't want anyone to know about this.

251
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,050
Is it about your family?

252
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,610
Enough.

253
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,760
My mother is seriously ill.

254
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,610
We have no money for treatment.

255
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,650
I'm afraid...

256
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,390
Don't worry.

257
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,080
Everything that can be solved with money is not difficult to handle.

258
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,660
I'll help you.

259
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,250
Really, Miss Yan?

260
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,890
Of course.

261
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,250
Thank you, Miss Yan.

262
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,890
Okay, don't worry.

263
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,810
Right.

264
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,560
I should let my brother know about this.

265
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,640
Otherwise, he will scold me again.

266
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,340
It's easy.

267
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,730
I'll tell your brother about it.

268
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,330
Okay?

269
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,800
Mr. Zhou.

270
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,150
Morning.

271
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,550
Morning.

272
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,840
Mr. Zhou.

273
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,050
You usually read and write.

274
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,570
You haven't drawn for a long time.

275
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,930
Why are you in the mood to draw today?

276
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,560
Did something happen in your family?

277
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,680
I've been tired from learning recently.

278
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,280
I want to relax.

279
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,720
Greetings, Teaching Assistant Xiao.

280
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,540
Why are you here?

281
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,040
Brother.

282
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,370
Come with me to meet someone.

283
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,210
Who?

284
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,860
Stop asking.

285
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,140
You'll know when you get there.

286
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,400
Mr. Zhou.

287
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,080
What’s up?

288
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:36,930
Nothing.

289
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,310
I'll go out for a while.

290
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,960
Let's go.

291
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,480
Feiniang.

292
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,600
Where are you taking me?

293
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,260
Stop asking.

294
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,330
You’ll know when you arrive.

295
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,990
Feiniang.

296
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,840
Tell me the truth.

297
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,000
Otherwise, I won't go.

298
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,130
Miss Yan is waiting for us at the back mountain.

299
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,090
She brought us the money to treat our mother.

300
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,200
How did you...

301
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,130
Why did you tell her?

302
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,640
I didn't mean to tell her.

303
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,070
She saw me...

304
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,730
She saw me crying.

305
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,930
I really didn't know how to hide it from her.

306
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,810
You...

307
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,000
You cried?

308
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,810
Brother, I didn't tell her.

309
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,520
I don't think Miss Yan would tell anyone else

310
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,330
that we need money.

311
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,700
Junior Zhou, you're here.

312
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,290
Senior Yan.

313
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,320
How is your mother now?

314
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,970
Is everything alright?

315
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,650
Thank you, Senior Yan.

316
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,990
The situation

317
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,580
is not good.

318
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,880
Junior Zhou.

319
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,100
We are friends now.

320
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,880
You don't have to hide anything.

321
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,690
If you want to say it,

322
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,490
I'm willing to listen to you today.

323
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,250
I hope you can keep it a secret for me.

324
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,840
Of course.

325
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,330
Zhou Ji and Yan Qinruo?

326
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,620
Why are they together?

327
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,090
Feiniang didn't know the boundary.

328
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,950
If she said anything wrong,

329
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,090
please forgive her.

330
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,010
Take the money.

331
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,730
This is...

332
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,680
Don't blame Feiniang.

333
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,850
I forced her to tell me.

334
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,050
I know I shouldn't meddle in your family matters.

335
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,660
But your mother is in an emergency.

336
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,400
Don't blame me for being nosy.

337
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,250
Senior, I can't take the money.

338
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,730
I'll take care of my family.

339
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,050
Just accept it.

340
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,060
What happened

341
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,720
between them?

342
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,089
Your mother's health is more important.

343
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,160
Take it.

344
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,490
Senior Yan.

345
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,210
I will try to pay you back as soon as possible.

346
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,450
But...

347
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,240
I understand.

348
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,130
But don't worry.

349
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,680
What happened today

350
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,490
is between us.

351
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,240
I won't tell anyone else.

352
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,490
Don't worry.

353
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,260
Cure your mother first.

354
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,000
Mr. Zhou.

355
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,200
Mr. Xiao.

356
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,930
Mr. Zhou, why did you stay out so late

357
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,680
on such a cold day?

358
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,560
I studied at Wenjing Hall.

359
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,400
I forgot the time.

360
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,760
At Wenjing Hall?

361
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,190
Isn't Wenjing Hall closed at night?

362
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,460
As you know,

363
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,890
my test results are not good these days.

364
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,720
So I asked the teachers for a long time

365
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,090
so they allowed me to study at Wenjing Hall at night.

366
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,120
Mr. Xiao.

367
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,180
How about you?

368
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,090
Why did you leave early and come home late these days?

369
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,460
You asked the teachers to do you a favor.

370
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,930
I was asked to organize the teaching materials by the teachers.

371
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,210
We have different lives.

372
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,880
Yes, we have different lives.

373
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,570
Here you are. Will you go to Luoyang with me

374
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,120
the day after tomorrow?

375
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,730
It'll be my birthday.

376
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,520
Come to visit my family.

377
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,790
It will be Lady Yan's birthday?

378
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,160
Why didn't you tell me?

379
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,690
-Are you blaming Lady Yan for noticing you late?
-Feiniang.

380
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,090
Is something bothering you?

381
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,140
Lady Yan invited us...

382
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,220
-Is already a gift.
-I don’t know whether I should go.

383
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,530
I was too anxious just now...

384
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,240
I didn't receive the invitation either.

385
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,210
Forgive me for being careless.

386
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,040
Don't take it to heart.

387
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,770
Lady Yan. Please don't blame me.

388
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,040
It's okay.

389
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,120
We are sisters.

390
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,160
Stop talking nonsense.

391
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,490
And you, Lady Qi.

392
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,850
Don't call it a gift.

393
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,090
That's too much.

394
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,650
Yes.

395
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,570
You should slap me.

396
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,890
Not loud enough.

397
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,440
You...

398
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,280
I've arranged a carriage to fetch you

399
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,650
the day after tomorrow.

400
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,800
Remember to get ready earlier.

401
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,400
Okay.

402
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,610
So sweet.

403
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,520
Yeah.

404
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:04,700
What about you?

405
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,770
Of course, I'm going to attend your birthday party.

406
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,290
Lady Zhao.

407
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,530
We must dress up nicely.

408
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,920
Yes, I think so.

409
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,050
Feiniang, come with me.

410
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,680
Yes, that's right.

411
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,160
Lady Zhao, come here.

412
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,570
Miss Yan.

413
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,210
It's not my say

414
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,170
whether I can go to your house.

415
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,520
I know.

416
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,050
But don't worry.

417
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,680
I've told your brother in advance.

418
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,360
Let's have fun together.

419
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,880
Thank you, Miss Yan.

420
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,310
You're so nice.

421
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,290
Take it.

422
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,330
Silly girl.

423
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,040
Go.

424
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,370
See? I'm going too.

425
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:40,920
Yueniang.

426
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,250
Second Sister

427
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,010
Yueniang.

428
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,690
The day after tomorrow is my birthday.

429
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,170
I've already told the other girls.

430
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,170
They will all come to have a bowl of longevity noodles.

431
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,210
Come with your Second Sister.

432
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,010
I will go.

433
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,040
Anyone can be absent, but I won't.

434
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,290
Do I have to go too?

435
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,870
Second Sister, just go.

436
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,340
We need to discuss this with our parents.

437
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,030
We should ask for their permission.

438
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,560
Well, Yueniang.

439
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,840
Take this invitation letter

440
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,040
to tell your mother.

441
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,570
Tell her that

442
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,850
my repeated requests

443
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,880
have led you to want to go to Luoyang.

444
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,080
If it doesn't work,

445
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,250
I'll pay a visit.

446
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,810
Not bad, Qinruo.

447
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,530
You're well prepared.

448
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,800
Second Sister.

449
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,640
Let's go back and ask our parents.

450
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:32,910
Yueniang.

451
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,940
I'll wait for your good news.

452
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,250
Second Sister,

453
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,570
help me and talk nicely

454
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,610
in front of Mother.

455
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,200
Why hasn't Mr. Xiao come yet?

456
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:56,890
Yueniang,

457
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,040
do you really want to go?

458
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,410
I'll listen to Second Sister.

459
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,240
If Second Sister wants to go, I'll go.

460
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,940
If Second Sister doesn't want to go,

461
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:08,810
I won't go.

462
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,540
It's a long journey.

463
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,590
Just to attend a birthday party is too much of a hassle

464
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,770
I don't want to go.

465
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,530
Second Sister is right.

466
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,170
It's a long journey.

467
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,360
There's no point

468
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,690
in going.

469
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,220
At most, Qinruo will be mad at me.

470
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,880
I'll coax her.

471
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,730
I'm always shameless.

472
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,800
At worst, I'll offend her.

473
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,650
Besides, it's not convenient for a girl

474
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,530
to go out for a long trip.

475
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,650
Although according to Qinruo, Luoyang is a bustling city,

476
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,760
and I'm really interested.

477
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,290
And I really want to

478
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,280
express my congratulations on Qinruo's birthday party.

479
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,170
But if both Mother and Second Sister think it's inappropriate,

480
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,530
I won't go.

481
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,090
I won't feel wronged.

482
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,120
It makes sense.

483
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,010
Enough.

484
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:18,850
You know

485
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,840
your mother and your sister will be persuaded by you in this way.

486
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,720
We don't want to trap you at home.

487
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,930
Go if you want.

488
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,010
But

489
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,750
don't be rude.

490
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,600
Really?

491
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,690
It's good to go out and learn more.

492
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,360
Go.

493
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,330
Great!

494
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,410
Look at her.

495
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,960
She's both happy and sad.

496
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,260
Mother.

497
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,360
I will study hard.

498
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,420
I won't suffer the loss of being uneducated.

499
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,930
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

500
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
Anyway,

501
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,520
this is a great thing.

502
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:58,970
Mother,

503
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,400
this is really a great thing.

504
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:06,360
Sir.

505
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,180
Why do we

506
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,090
take so many girls' stuff to class?

507
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,320
If you want to be a decent person, you should pay attention to etiquette.

508
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,810
Dressing is also a form of expression.

509
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,450
This time,

510
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,040
Lady Yan invites all the girls to celebrate her birthday.

511
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:20,920
I want to

512
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,330
teach them some dressing manners.

513
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,800
Luoyang is not like Yiyang.

514
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,770
There's more etiquette there.

515
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,370
I don't want the girls to lose face.

516
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,010
Come on.

517
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,510
Mr. Chen, you're so thoughtful.

518
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,330
Yueniang, you're scaring me again.

519
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,340
Yueniang.

520
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,330
You can go to Luoyang with me.

521
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,810
Of course.

522
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,550
I tried so hard to persuade my family.

523
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,690
To celebrate your birthday,

524
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,920
I spent a lot of effort.

525
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,840
Yueniang.

526
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,060
Why are you so nice?

527
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,690
But don't worry.

528
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,490
When you go to my house,

529
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,900
I'll treat you well.

530
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,230
By the way,

531
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,890
my second sister doesn't like lively places.

532
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,870
So she won't go.

533
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,390
Don't blame her.

534
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,410
I won't.

535
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,560
It's great that you can come.

536
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,590
Show me before you continue to draw.

537
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,380
Let me see.

538
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,120
Lady Yan.

539
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,020
I haven't finished yet.

540
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,120
Thank you for letting us go to your birthday party.

541
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,960
Yes, I can go too. I'm so happy.

542
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,360
Lady Yan! Lady Yan!

543
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,290
-Stop right there!
-It's okay.

544
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,850
I drew so well.

545
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,200
Stop right there!

546
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,600
Lady Jin.

547
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,640
Sis, I can really...

548
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,480
Lady Jin.

549
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,450
Lady Jin!

550
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,850
What's wrong?

551
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,840
Lady Jin.

552
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,450
I found a portrait

553
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,850
at the gate of the academy.

554
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,080
It seems to be Teaching Assistant Xiao on it.

555
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,370
You are the best at drawing portraits in this school.

556
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,170
Did you lose this?

557
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,490
Teaching Assistant Xiao?

558
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,320
Let me see.

559
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,200
What color will you wear?

560
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,530
Let me think.

561
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,030
I think yellow suits me better.

562
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,490
This...

563
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,970
This is Xiao Yu?

564
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,250
Zhen.

565
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,320
Please send Xiao Yu's portrait to me.

566
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,890
Lady Jin.

567
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,830
You've lost too much of your drawing skills.

568
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,870
Look at this ugly guy.

569
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,290
Is this ugly guy Mr. Xiao?

570
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,520
Jin Xiaoyue, let me tell you.

571
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,820
I'm going to get mad at you.

572
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,680
I didn't draw it.

573
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,290
Miss Yan.

574
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,250
It couldn't be me.

575
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,600
Didn't you draw it?

576
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,210
-Alright.
-Not me.

577
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,370
You drew Mr. Xiao so ugly.

578
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,800
I didn't.

579
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,770
All right.

580
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,530
It's so ugly.

581
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,650
Show me if you dare.

582
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,930
Fine.

583
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,850
Gosh, this is so ugly.

584
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:56,870
If this gets out,

585
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,050
it'll disgrace my reputation.

586
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,970
You drew it.

587
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,250
All right.

588
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,400
Look.

589
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,880
The portraits that Lady Jin usually paints

590
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,530
are really exquisite.

591
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,810
This painting

592
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,690
doesn't look like Lady Jin's style.

593
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,050
Exactly.

594
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,980
Yueniang.

595
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,970
-Stop it, Qinruo.
-Come on.

596
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,290
I'll show you

597
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,790
what vividness is.

598
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,690
In case someone

599
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,860
insults my eyes with this kind of ugly painting.

600
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,850
Okay.

601
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,850
Look over there.

602
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,650
Look over there.

603
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,600
Miss Jin, here you are.

604
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,940
Look carefully.

605
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,050
This is my level.

606
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,000
-Let me see.
-Are they the same?

607
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,890
Are they?

608
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,960
Did you really not draw this ugly thing?

609
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,240
Stop it.

610
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,300
I told you I didn't draw this.

611
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,280
-Don't you have to... 
-Let me see.

612
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,360
Get ready for class before the teacher shows up?

613
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,490
Let's go.

614
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,770
What does Mr. Chen want to do...

615
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,800
The feathers of mayflies

616
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,320
are like sharp and gorgeous clothes.

617
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,730
According to Guan Zi - Situation,

618
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,050
"If words are faithful,

619
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,960
actions are solemn.

620
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,130
If the clothes are correct,

621
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,720
the ministers will be solemn.

622
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,250
Morality and righteousness...

623
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,040
Yes.

624
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,090
This class is about what to wear when going to Duke Yue's Mansion.

625
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,440
I must listen carefully.

626
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,790
Cannot be achieved without the practice of ritual.

627
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,050
Disputes and legal cases

628
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,530
rely on the proper application of etiquette for resolution.

629
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,050
The relationships between rulers and subjects,

630
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,440
parents and children, and siblings

631
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,210
depend on the observance of proper conduct to establish their roles.

632
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,090
In the pursuit of knowledge and discipleship,

633
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,450
a respectful and courteous attitude is necessary for a close bond between teacher and student.

634
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,800
In matters of governance, military discipline,

635
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,520
and law enforcement,

636
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,960
the absence of proper etiquette results in the loss of authority.

637
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,720
In matters of worship

638
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,960
and ritual,

639
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,410
a lack of proper decorum diminishes devotion and solemnity.

640
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,970
Huangdi, Yao, and Shun, who governed the world by wearing proper clothes,

641
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,890
took their inspiration from the heavens and earth,

642
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,810
and all emphasized etiquette.

643
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,690
Sir.

644
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,160
Lady Zhu, go ahead.

645
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,000
Sir.

646
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,620
Can you teach us how to dress first,

647
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,850
and then teach us why to wear like this?

648
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,850
The theory of dressing is so obscure and difficult to understand.

649
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,330
But as for how to wear it,

650
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,850
just let Teaching Assistant Xiao put the clothes on his body,

651
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,360
and we will be able to see it at a glance.

652
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,380
Now there's something interesting.

653
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,360
Yueniang.

654
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,920
In a few days,

655
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,600
we're going to Duke Yue's Mansion to celebrate Qinruo's birthday.

656
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,850
If we could learn it earlier,

657
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,040
it would be useful.

658
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,450
What do you think, Sir?

659
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,810
Well...

660
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,130
Well...

661
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,310
This

662
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,520
is inappropriate.

663
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,850
He's coming.

664
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,390
Do you remember what the teacher said today?

665
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,130
Yes.

666
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,440
I've read it several times.

667
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,520
Have you read this book?

668
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,000
Why do I read it? I'll go back to catch crickets.

669
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,070
You only know crickets.

670
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,610
I'm sorry.

671
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,270
Hurry up.

672
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,210
Wait for me.

673
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,330
Mr. Zhou.

674
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:48,950
Mr. Zhou.

675
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,410
Let's go.

676
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:50,890
Let's go.

677
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,570
Why isn’t Junior Zhou here?

678
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,530
Miss Zhu. What do you want from me?

679
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,490
Junior Zhou.

680
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,300
When were you behind me?

681
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,880
I have been here

682
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,490
since you came running joyfully

683
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,290
just now.

684
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

685
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,120
It's my fault.

686
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,170
I apologize to you.

687
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,360
No, no.

688
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,410
Junior Zhou.

689
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:32,360
I...

690
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,610
I want to ask you...

691
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:36,570
Junior Zhou.

692
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,880
Did you receive Qinruo's birthday invitation?

693
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,370
Yes.

694
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:43,850
So,

695
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,400
will you go?

696
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,140
Do you want me to go?

697
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,090
Of course!

698
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,480
Of course, I want to know if you want to go.

699
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,130
If you want me to go,

700
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:02,970
I'll go.

701
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:03,730
Really?

702
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,400
That's great.

703
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,050
Actually...

704
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,920
By the way, Junior Zhou,

705
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,800
I want to buy a dress for the birthday banquet

706
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,040
after the class.

707
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,050
Do you have time to go with me?

708
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:23,800
Sure.

709
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,360
See you at the gate after school.

710
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,050
I'll go to class first.

711
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,760
See you at the gate after school.

712
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,130
I've spent all my money.

713
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,400
How can I buy clothes?

714
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,890
Teaching Assistant Xiao. Why are you running?

715
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,090
Stop!

716
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:10,570
Come back!

717
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,900
Xiao Yu.

718
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,270
Stop!

719
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,250
I'll kill you when I catch you.

720
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,360
Stop!

721
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:21,929
Xiao Yu!

722
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:24,880
Why were you running?

723
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:26,969
I don't know.

724
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,370
But my instinct told me

725
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:29,199
I had to run.

726
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,270
My intuition tells me

727
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,600
you still owe me something.

728
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,800
What do I owe you?

729
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:34,840
Pay my money back.

730
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,760
What money?

731
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:37,690
Stop pretending.

732
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,489
My money!

733
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,320
It's mine!

734
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:40,820
Pay me back!

735
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,560
My money!

736
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,130
Pay me back!

737
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,130
You are an adult now.

738
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,739
How could you come to my house to cheat?

739
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:52,880
I pity you.

740
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,340
Don't do this again.

741
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,239
Well.

742
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,889
Be a good man.

743
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,040
Don't cheat again.

744
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,610
Do I have to pay back because I have money?

745
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,770
Of course.

746
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,930
Do you think you're a bully?

747
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:05,520
I...

748
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,800
Sit down.

749
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,050
Move.

750
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,760
Give me the money.

751
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:16,810
Five taels.

752
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,450
Five taels are interest.

753
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:18,930
Well.

754
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,840
Well, five taels...

755
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:20,930
Why is there interest?

756
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,520
It's an emergency.

757
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:23,730
Well.

758
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,970
Are you a bully?

759
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,650
Where are you going with the money?

760
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,370
I’m going to buy clothes

761
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,520
with Junior Zhou.

762
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,110
Stubborn.

763
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,410
What color goes with what color?

764
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,250
Red goes with green?

765
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,080
Are you sure?

766
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,850
Isn't it a bit strange?

767
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,330
Right.

768
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,130
What if red alone?

769
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,640
Would it be more cheerful?

770
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,930
I'm afraid you'll steal the limelight of the host.

771
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,520
You're right.

772
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,240
What about all white?

773
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,040
Is it more elegant?

774
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,200
All white?

775
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,280
It's inauspicious.

776
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:24,850
Right.

777
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,650
How about pink?

778
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,690
Pink with blue.

779
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,280
I think it's okay.

780
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,440
I can tell you didn't listen carefully in class.

781
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,280
Mr. Xiao.

782
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:36,890
Mr. Zhou.

783
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,950
You again?

784
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,060
You should be glad that I'm here.

785
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,350
Ridiculous.

786
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,670
Ignorant.

787
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,480
Mr. Zhou.

788
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,250
I want to buy some fabrics to make clothes.

789
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,020
Can you pick one for me?

790
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,650
Okay.

791
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,000
Mr. Zhou. This looks good on you.

792
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:00,940
The fabric is good.

793
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:01,960
It suits you.

794
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,220
Green and white.

795
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,640
This one is also okay.

796
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,210
Lady Zhao.

797
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,170
What are you doing?

798
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,240
You scared me.

799
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,080
I saw a flash from afar just now.

800
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,210
I wondered what it was.

801
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,650
When I came closer,

802
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,900
it turned out to be your beautiful face

803
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,040
in the mirror.

804
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,790
But Lady Zhao,

805
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,890
why are you speaking so quietly today?

806
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
Are you afraid...

807
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,360
I knew it.

808
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,740
The truth is always annoying.

809
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,640
And my beauty is just like the truth.

810
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,010
It's right there.

811
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,040
But no one dares to touch it.

812
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:15,880
Lady Jin.

813
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,760
Actually, I'm here today

814
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,980
to ask you for a favor.

815
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,800
The teacher came in a hurry last time.

816
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,410
I didn't have time

817
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,690
to appreciate your talented painting skills

818
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,170
before you took back your painting.

819
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,370
Can I have a look now?

820
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,570
Lady Zhao.

821
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,160
I see that you're always dignified.

822
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,120
I didn't expect you to like this too.

823
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,250
Wait for me.

824
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,640
I have all kinds of portraits here.

825
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,530
Whose one do you want to see?

826
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,050
Do you have the one of Teaching Assistant Xiao?

827
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,090
Lady Zhao.

828
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:54,360
I didn't expect you to be so tricky.

829
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,540
How dare you steal Lady Yan's man

830
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,570
in front of her?

831
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,550
Hush.

832
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,220
It's not like I want it.

833
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,890
No need to explain.

834
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,880
We're both women. I understand.

835
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,400
Don't worry.

836
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,010
I'll keep the secret for you.

837
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,290
However,

838
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,280
there is only one portrait

839
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,520
of Teaching Assistant Xiao.

840
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
Lady Jin.

841
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,330
I want it.

842
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,190
My lord,

843
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,200
this is the portrait of Xiao Yu

844
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,840
from Zhao Wenlang's daughter.

845
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,900
It's him.

846
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,130
Has the Crown Prince taken action?

847
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,210
What should we do now?

848
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,930
He's not easy to deal with.

849
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,580
Why don't we

850
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,280
borrow a knife?

851
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,650
Borrow a knife?

852
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,090
I heard that Prince Fu

853
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,840
sent all the masters in his mansion to look for him.

854
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,200
Why don't I do him a favor?

855
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,330
My Lord, you are wise.

856
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,400
Young Master.

857
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,330
I just found an important piece of information.

858
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,050
On the 15th of this month,

859
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,610
Duke Yue will raise donations in his mansion.

860
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,930
The donations will arrive in Yiyang on the 16th.

861
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,230
15th?

862
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,650
If we can investigate the source of the donation

863
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,200
and follow the whereabouts of the donation,

864
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,800
I believe the truth will be revealed soon.

865
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,650
But Duke Yue

866
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,040
always raises donations in his mansion.

867
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,610
We have no reason

868
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,440
to investigate in his mansion.

869
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,850
How can we enter Duke Yue's Mansion?

870
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,240
How about

871
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,930
I go to the birthday party?

872
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,130
Young Master, what time is it?

873
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,050
How can you still think about nonsense?

874
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,770
Let's get down to business.

875
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,920
We need to investigate the corruption case

876
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,440
and the whereabouts of the donation.

877
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,970
It's the youngest daughter of Duke Yue, Yan Qinruo.

878
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,590
15th is her birthday.

879
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,400
You shouldn't attend anyone's birthday party.

880
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:22,850
Who?

881
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,490
The youngest daughter of Duke Yue?

882
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,490
This is a great opportunity

883
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,860
to enter Duke Yue's Mansion.

884
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,730
No, Young Master.

885
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,740
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

886
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,400
Duke Yue knows you.

887
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,810
If you meet him,

888
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,400
you'll be in trouble.

889
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,730
You can't go.

890
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,760
This is a great opportunity to enter Duke Yue's Mansion.
