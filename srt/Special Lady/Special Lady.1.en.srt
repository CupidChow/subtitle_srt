190
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,190
At the age of 18,

191
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,060
he became a Number Three Scholar.

192
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,150
His theory of aligning with the natural order and understanding human nature

193
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,230
thoroughly explains the concept of the relationship between heaven's principles

194
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,630
and human emotions.

195
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,030
Yes.

196
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,640

197
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,700
has become a place where many students want to enter.

198
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,330
You're right.

199

Sir, look.

200
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,710
This lucky pouch is of the same style as the one owned by the children of the Song family.

201
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,750
It's the same.

202
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,230
If you buy this lucky pouch,

203
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,400
you'll be able to become a Number One Scholar like the second son of the Song family.

Young Master, be careful.

What's this?

214
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,620
This...

215
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,070
It might be a tradition.

216
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,780
What tradition?

217
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,520
Hurry up. Don't let them take him.

218
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,410
Capture the son-in-law with sticks.

219
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,290
Capture the son-in-law with sticks?

220
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,280
Did you see these people holding sticks?

221
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,130
If the Number One Scholar can stand their hits,

222
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,590
he can marry any one

223
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,860
of these girls as he wishes.

224
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,130
As he wishes?

225
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,740
So he can select consorts like an emperor?

226
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,950
But he needs to be able to withstand these hits first.

227
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,450
This is a good tradition.

228
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,340

259
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,460

Landlord Liu is not knowledgeable.

264
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,780
He's known for being rude and discourteous.

265
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,610
Sometimes he dominates the market and bullies people.

266

His daughter, Miss Liu, is as strong as a cow.

267
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,040
She can't read and is rude.

Well...

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,950
Everyone,

378
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,350
calm down.

379
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,010
Fortunately,

380
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,600
they haven't finished the ceremony yet.

381
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,950
Miss Liu's reputation is safe now.

382
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,870
Yes.

383
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,500
-It’s safe.
-By the way,

384
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,140
if you capture the Number One Scholar today,

385
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,690
it would be even worse.

386
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,410
Look.

387
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,160
The six ceremonial rites are incomplete and there's no matchmaker.

388
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,160
Even if the Number One Scholar's here,

389
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,400
he certainly won't be willing to perform the ritual.

390
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,670
That's right.

391
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,000
You disregard propriety and disrespect scholars.

392
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,210
How should you be punished?

393
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,630
I...

394
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,590
Don't do that.

395
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,470
What are you doing?

396
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,870
Father, I don't care.

397
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,910
I insist on him!

398
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,030
Wait.

399
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,130
-Mother, say something.
-Wait.

400
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,330
-My daughter. -You almost got me confused.

401
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,060
I asked you who you were,

402
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,030
but you couldn't tell me.

403
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,070
Now you're talking nonsense.

404
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,170
What do you want?

405
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,100
That's right.

406
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,800
Landlord Liu, I almost forgot it if you didn't remind me.

407
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,270
Report to the government.

408
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,170
I'll report to the government now!

409
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,440
Why would you report to the government?

410
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,950
Don't report to the government.

411
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,660
Landlord Liu,

412
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,700
what happened today can be a big deal.

413
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,790
If this goes to the government,

414
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,470
what is this?

415
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,470
This is a human trafficking.

416
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,550
Let go.

417
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,340
It's not that serious.

418
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,520
Human trafficking is the most serious crime.

419
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,320
Light offenders get three years in prison,

420
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,490
while serious ones face the death penalty

421
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,760
by hanging.

422
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,370
-It's an accident. It's not that serious.
-It’s not that serious.

423
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,760
But it can be

424
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,380
a small deal.

425
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,620
It's just a mistake.

426
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,280
Since it's a mistake,

427
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,970
of course,

428
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,460
it's just a misunderstanding.

429
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,900
-Yes.
-It's a misunderstanding.

430
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,030
A mistake.

431
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,590
-But...
-What misunderstanding?

432
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:12,790
Look.

433
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,220
Both of us are severely injured.

434
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,990
It hurts so much.

435
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,000
If you want to settle it privately...

436
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,670
Mother.

437
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,800
Yes.

438
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,230
Let's settle it privately.

439
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,080
Please accept ten taels of silver.

440
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,530
Thank you.

441
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,110
Let's go.

442
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,160
No. No.

443
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,350
I want him!

444
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,910
My daughter.

445
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,400
-Stop it.
-Stop crying.

446
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,550
-I have a headache.
-Enough.

447
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,800
I don't care. I want him.

448
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,370
Stop!

449
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,540
I still have things to settle with you.

450
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,000
Forget it.

451
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,790
I saved you from suffering.

452
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,550
If it weren't for me,

453
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,210
you would be Landlord Liu's son-in-law now.

454
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,520
How dare you say that?

455
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,890
If it weren't for you...

456
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,410
Come here.

457
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,230
If it weren't for you,

458
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,730
I wouldn't have been caught here.

459
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:04,740
Also,

460
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,690
let me ask you.

461
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,790
Why did you deceive people for money?

462
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,580
Stop it.

463
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,360
This is not deceiving people for money.

464
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,640
Mother.

465
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,450
-Stop crying.
-I don’t care.

466
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,830
-I just want him.
-I’ll find you a good one.

467
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,020
The Number One Scholar uniform is genuine.

468
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,190
Landlord Liu

469
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,140
openly kidnapped people in broad daylight for marriage.

470
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,420
It's inherently unreasonable.

471
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,620
How is he different from the robbers?

472
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,870
I was born with a kind heart.

473
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,800
I didn't want to see the Number One Scholar humiliated.

474
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,210
That's why I did this.

475
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,040
As for you...

476
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,990
It's your luck to engage in chivalrous acts

477
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,220
with me.

478
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,090
As for the money,

479
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,470
I'll give it to you if you want it.

480
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,070
Reach out your hand.

481
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,750
Am I talking about money?

482
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,540
I'll give it to you.

483
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,390
Hurry up. Reach out your hand.

484
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,230
They are in cahoots.

485
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,070
Guards!

486
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,850
Hurry! Catch them!

487
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,600
It's him.

488
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:58,690
After them!

489
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,360
Go!

490
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:00,870
Stop!

491
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,600
You...

492
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,440
Don't follow me.

493
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,590
Don't block me.

494
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,710
You caused them to come here.

495
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,790
-Go that way. -Stop talking nonsense.

496
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,150
You caused them to come here.

497
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,230
Why should I run?

498
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,150
You're the scammer.

499
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,550
See if they believe you.

500
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,160
What do you mean?

501
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,450
Over there! Stop! Stop!

502
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,560
-Over there.
-Stop! Get them!

503
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,600
I'd better run.

504
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,400
Stop!

505
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,330
Split up!

506
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,120
Stop! Catch him!

507
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,400
Stop! Stop!

508
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,930
Stop!

509
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,230
Stop!

510
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,100
Why are you running?

511
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,650
I'm the fastest on this street.

512
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,170
-Move.
-I’ve never met a rival like you.

513
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,590
Excuse me.

514
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,280
What are you doing?

515
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,270
Excuse me!

516
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,560
Get out of the way!

517
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,520
Stop! Catch her!

518
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,390
Where are you going?

519
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,850
Come and hold my hand.

520
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,830
-Master. -Catch her!

521
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,010
Why do you follow me?

522
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,600
You're in cahoots with them and you're here to stop me?

523
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,840
Why can't it be you who is in cahoots with them

524
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,750
and you're here to stop me?

525
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,490
I can't even go that way.

526
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,190
Hurry up!

527
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,750
Why aren't you running?

528
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,070
Why did you stop?

529
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:17,740
You...

530
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,840
Capture them.

531
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,690
Take them away.

532
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,110
Go to the government now!

533
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:32,840
[Clear Mirror Hanging High]

534
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,150
Who is kneeling?

535
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,910
I'm Liu Yiwei. Greetings, My Lord.

536
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,750
Why aren't you two kneeling?

537
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,480
Kneel to you?

538
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,180
How dare you!

539
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,710
My Lord, look at these two villains.

540
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,720
They are so arrogant.

541
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,980
They conspired against me.

542
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,270
Especially that man.

543
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,790
He used a seduction scheme involving my daughter.

544
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,270
Have you eaten too much?

545
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,060
You...

546
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,120
Silence!

547
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,010
Go on.

548
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,950
Yes.

549
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,620
My Lord.

550
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,230
This man seduced my daughter

551
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,300
to marry him with his good look.

552
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,000
He's talking about you.

553
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,080
At this critical moment,

554
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,750
that woman suddenly stepped up

555
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,920
She said she wanted to threaten me for plundering.

556
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,010
She even asked me for money.

557
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,850
Luckily, I caught them red-handed

558
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,470
when they were dividing the spoils.

559
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,130
Good story.

560
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:23,860
Who is this?

561
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,430
The one kneeling is Landlord Liu.

562
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,770
He's rich.

563
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,460
Is he sensible?

564
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,240
He offers tribute to you every year.

565
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,590
How dare you!

566
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,720
How dare you pretend to be the Number One Scholar

567
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,750
and colluded in fraud!

568
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,840
Press them on their knees

569
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,240
and flog each of them thirty times.

570
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,740
How dare you!

571
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,800
-Yes.
-How dare you!

572
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,230
Try it.

573
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:46,810
-Don't touch me. -Kneel down.

574
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,090
I'll show you if I dare.

575
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,010
-Kneel down.
-Are you going to convict us based solely on this?

576
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,560
Go away!

577
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,000
My Lord, how can you convict us

578
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,140
based solely on his words?

579
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,890
How can you convince the public by passing judgments

580
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,630
without distinguishing between right and wrong?

581
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,590
Am I right?

582
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,740
How can you convince the public?

583
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,800
You're sharp-tongued.

584
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,150
Guards.

585
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:05,860
Slap her.

586
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,510
Slap her.

587
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,120
How dare you!

588
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:07,980
-Sir, please wait.
-Slap her!

589
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,680
This girl looks like

590
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,820
the third daughter of the Song family.

591
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,520
I don't care who she is.

592
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,610
I'm the head of the county.

593
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,690
Let go!

594
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,820
Her father is Dean Song.

595
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,470
Isn't your son planning to apply for enrollment in his academy?

596
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,320
Let go!

597
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,070
Behave yourself.

598
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,670
In this case, the situation is different, right?

599
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,880
They haven't slapped her.

600
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,910
There's still room for turn.

601
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,680
Let go of me!

602
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,430
Let go!

603
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,360
Leave them.

604
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,000
What I did just now

605
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,480
is unacceptable.

606
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,600
I was just demonstrating.

607
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,500
If we solve the case like this, the public will be angry

608
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,660
and it's hard to convince the public.

609
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,310
I am the local official of Yiyang County.

610
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,390
How can I, based solely on Landlord Liu's...

611
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,360
Liu Yiwei.

612
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,000
Liu Yiwei's testimony,

613
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,400
convict both of them?

614
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,440
If I pass judgment without distinguishing right from wrong,

615
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,410
it will be difficult

616
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,400
to convince the public when it spreads.

617
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,460
My Lord, they colluded to extort my money.

618
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,780
How much?

619
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,140
-Ten taels.
-Ten...

620
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,180
How much?

621
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,990
Ten taels.

622
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,590
Just ten taels.

623
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,360
Liu Yiwei.

624
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,740
Catching the Number One Scholar to be the son-in-law

625
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,060
is the custom of Yiyang County.

626
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,040
Even if he pretended to be the Number One Scholar,

627
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,520
it's just for fun.

628
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,970
You...

629
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,240
Just ten taels of silver.

630
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,700
Just settle it privately.

631
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,050
My Lord.

632
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,770
You can't solve the case so hastily.

633
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,510
Court adjourned.

634
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,570
Thank you, My Lord.

635
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,220
If it weren't for this county magistrate's muddled thinking,

636
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,950
if he offended me,

637
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,820
I would ensure his official hat is at risk.

638
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,890
Stop dreaming.

639
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,290
I almost got delayed because of you.

640
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,360
What?

641
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,500
I was here because of you.

642
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,130
What?

643
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,090
You're crazy. Let go.

644
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,360
I was here because of you, you know?

645
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,220
Let go!

646
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:01,950
No.

647
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,800
Do you want to to end up in court again by pulling me?

648
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,010
-Let it be. -Let go.

649
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,870
I'm not afraid of you.

650
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,500
Why...

651
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,810
Why did you bite me?

652
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,140
Young Master, I've been looking for you.

653
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,990
Why are you chasing a girl here?

654
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,230
What's wrong with your eyes?

655
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,530
Am I chasing a girl?

656
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,950
That's just a dog who runs around.

657
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,570
It's not good to say that about a girl.

658
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,320
Young Master, don't forget that we have something important to do.

659
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,170
We're going to the Song family.

660
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,580
Is the item still intact?

661
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,490
Yes.

662
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,030
Let's go.

663
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,550
Young Master, the Song Mansion is over there.

[Calligraphy and Painting Works]

665
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,010
It's going to rain.

666
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:54,920
Boss.

667
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,940
I'm here to get Zhou Ji's painting.

668
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,270
Sorry, Miss.

669
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:58,760
I sold it.

670
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,360
What?

671
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,480
Well, Boss.

672
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,650
I gave you the deposit.

673
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,500
Look at the weather.

674
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,800
It's past three o'clock.

675
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,810
It’s going to rain.

676
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,330
When will there be another painting of Zhou Ji's?

677
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,390
It’s hard to say.

678
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,700
Mr. Zhou doesn't paint often.

679
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,090
This painting was painted six months ago.

680
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,550
OK.

681
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,550
-OK. Go back.
-Thank you, Boss.

682
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,580
It’s all that guy's fault.

683
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,790
I couldn’t buy Mr. Zhou’s painting because of him.

684
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,910
It’s raining.

685
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,630
Hurry up.

686
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,190

Miss.

688
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,140
Take this umbrella.

689
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,330
Be careful not to get wet

690
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,120
and catch a cold.

691
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,220

What's the matter, Sir?

699
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,990
Could you kindly convey a message for us?

700
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,070
My young master

701
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:44,050
Xiao Yu, the son of Xiao Chuanzhong, came to visit Lord Song.

702
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,140
The exam for Yiyang Academy is coming.

703
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,130
Mr. Song is avoiding visitors.

704
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,710
Please forgive him.

705
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,520
Since he won't see my young master,

706
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,870
please bring these two things to Mr. Song.

707
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:56,730
These are the big cherries

708
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,770
we picked this morning.

709
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,710
Look at the dew.

710
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,740
The value of these cherries

711
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,100
is worth one mu of land outside Yiyang County.

712
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,400
This is a token of our young master's appreciation.

713
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,410
I'm really sorry.

714
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,590
My master specifically told me

715
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,740
not to accept any gifts from anyone.

716
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,690
Wait.

00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,400
My master Xiao Chuanzhong is Mr. Song's best friend.

00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,590
Please make an exception.

Look.

720
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,400
They also said that they are my master's best friends.

721
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,040
That's right.

722
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,360
Wait! Wait!

724
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,460
Hurry.

725
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,040
Give this to Mr. Song.

726
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,290
He will change his mind when he sees this.

727
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,910
Mr. Song told me not to accept gifts.

728
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,440
Sorry.

729
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,330
Well...

00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,820
Where is the letter?

732
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,380
I just recalled.

733
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,210
Maybe someone switched the lucky pouch.

734
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,380
Who did it?

735
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,450
Deceitful Woman!

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,200

Second Sister.

738
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,500
I was going to the ancestral hall.

739
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,250
But I saw the pear flowers blooming.

740
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,190
It reminds me of "Spring arrives, and the pear blossoms carry the even deeper meaning".

741
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,190
Second Sister.

742
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,240
Don't you like elegant and fragrant things the most?

743
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,790
So I wanted to pick one for you.

744
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,360
But the tree is too high.

745
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,480
I accidentally fell from it.

746
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,660
It hurts so much.

747
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,900
Second Sister, look.

748
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,610
Look.

749
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,920
Did you fall on the left side of your body or the right side?

750
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,190
Stop pretending.

751
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,400
Your second brother told us when he came back.

752
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:13,830
He...

753
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,699
What a brother.

754
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,380
To save him,

755
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:20,719
I was taken to the government by Landlord Liu.

756
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,310
He's not loyal at all.

757
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,389
He just said

758
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,280
he met you on your way home.

759
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,940
He didn't say anything else?

760
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,940
Now we know.

761
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,760
You make us worried.

762
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,500
Go back and get changed.

763
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,590
OK.

764
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:47,989
Let's go.

765
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:49,520
Let's go.

766
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,780
Go.

767
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,180
The letter is indeed a door-knocking brick to meet Song Xu.

768
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,900
But the brick was locked in the Song Residence.

769
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,680
What should we do?

770
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,420
Just bring the letter back.

771
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,210
What if we can't?

772
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,710
You won't have the appropriate identity to meet Song Xu then.

773
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,230
Didn't that guy just say that the Yiyang Academy is going to have an exam?

774
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,160
If I enter the Yiyang Academy,

775
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,810
I can meet Song Xu as a student.

776
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,690
I heard that Yiyang Academy is extremely difficult to enter.

777
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,500
Young Master, are you confident?

778
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,770
It's fine if we can get the letter back.

779
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,280
If anything goes wrong,

780
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,480
this is the quickest method.

781
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,140
Go and find out

782
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,140
when the Yiyang Academy will hold the exam.

783
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,410
I'll go now.

784
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:43,400
Go.

785
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,670
Yes.

786
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,530
Forget it. We should find a place to stay first.

787
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,090
Take this umbrella.

788
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,650
Be careful not to get wet and catch a cold.

789
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,860
I didn’t expect that Mr. Zhou is not only skilled in painting

790
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,080
and calligraphy,

791
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,510
but also so kind.

792
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,450
Mr. Zhou's portrait

793
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,240
is a bit rough.

794
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,270
The charisma portrayed in the painting falls short of half that of his actual presence.

795
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,720
I'll keep the money

796
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,550
and use it to buy Mr. Zhou’s painting next time.

797
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,480
It must be related to that enemy.

798
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,410
I'm speechless.

799
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,630
Yueniang.

800
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,090
Didn't I ask you to get changed and go to the ancestral hall?

801
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,500
Coming.

802
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,120
Sir, take a look.

803
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,560
And this.

804
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,340
-And this.
-Okay.

805
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:59,320
[Lyu Fu Shop]

806
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,870
Sir. Please have a seat.

807
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,310
-Serve them.
-Here’s the money.

808
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,090
Serve the young master some tea.

809
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,820
Okay.

810
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,310
Sir. Please enjoy.

811
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,850
The look is not good enough.

812
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,290
It's not delicate enough.

813
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,430
It's a small shop. There must be flaws.

814
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:14,580
Waiter!

815
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,140
Sirs, coming.

816
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,610
Sprinkle some Green Silk Rose.

817
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,310
What is Green Silk Rose?

818
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,890
You make pastries, but you don't know Green Silk Rose?

819
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,730
We don't have it.

820
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Then I won't eat the pastry.

821
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,280
Without the Green Silk Rose, the fragrance is reduced.

822
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,580
It will be cloying.

823
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:37,900
Uncle Hu.

824
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,290
Remember to pay them.

825
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,670
I... I did.

826
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,600
Young Master.

827
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,800
First Madam.

828
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,740
Although I caused trouble this time,

829
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,630
it's all for Second Brother.

830
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,670
The Liu family is the one who suffered because I made trouble.

831
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,350
If the Liu family makes trouble,

832
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,460
our family will suffer.

833
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,430
Mother punished me by not allowing me to eat.

834
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,780
My second sister punished me to copy books.

835
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,420
I accepted all these.

836
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,810
I'm willing to do anything for Second Brother.

837
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,110
Yueniang.

838
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,100
Second Brother, why are you here?

839
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,650
I thought it was mom.

840
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,470
Yueniang.

841
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,790
I'm sorry.

842
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,250
Second Brother.

843
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,630
You don't have to blame yourself.

844
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,800
I...

845
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,640
I was just playful.

846
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,400
Waiter.

847
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,550
Get me a room.

848
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:12,840
Coming.

849
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:14,850
Don't move.

850
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,500
It's OK.

851
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,560
You may leave.

852
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,120
This is you, right?

853
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,570
Yes.

854
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,680
I didn't expect you to be Mr. Zhou.

855
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,450
My sister likes you very much.

856
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,310
She said your painting is great.

857
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,400
I'm flattered.

858
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,310
It's all rumours.

859
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,700
And I'm going to take the exam.

860
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,990
Perhaps there won't be time for painting.

861
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,960
Are you going to take the exam for Yiyang Academy?

862
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,280
Yes.

863
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:54,690
How about this?

864
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,240
Please sign this portrait for me.

865
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,300
Please.

866
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,290
Mr. Zhou,

867
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,750
let me get a room for you.

868
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:06,950
Don't move.

869
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:07,940
Let me do it.

870
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:09,960
Let me.

871
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,230
-Thank you.
-Let’s go. This way.

872
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:11,910
Thank you.

873
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,880
Mr. Zhou, come with me.

874
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,510
Young Master.

875
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,220
-Take a seat.
-Watch your step.

876
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:19,970
How is it going?

877
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,020
The exam is in three days.

878
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,470
When does registration start?

879
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,990
What a coincidence.

880
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,820
Tomorrow.

881
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:30,510
OK.

882
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,230
Look, senior sisters are here.

883
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,640
The students of Yiyang Academy are here.

884
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,310
They're gracious and gentle.

885
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:43,930
Look.

886
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,070
Each of the senior sisters is both beautiful and intelligent.

887
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,270
If I can enter,

888
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,830
I must get acquainted with some senior sisters

889
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,980
who have both virtue and talent.

890
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,480
Exactly.

891
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,400
Even if it's for these senior sisters,

892
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,210
I must get into Yiyang Academy.

893
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,010
They're like fairies.

894
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,170
Don't look. It's impolite.

895
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:06,910
You shouldn't do this.

896
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,720
Yes.

897
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,560
In this case,

898
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,410
these applicants may not be interested in studying.

899
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,190
It's hard for them to enter the Academy.

900
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,490
Be careful. I almost fell.

901
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,190
They're so pretty.

902
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,570
I think so too.

903
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,860
Just now,

904
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,810
I passed by the corridor like a fairy.

905
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,970
All the male students were stunned.

906
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,800
You're the prettiest.

907
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:44,340
Yeah.

908
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,280
What's the big deal?

909
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,390
I think

910
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,480
they were all attracted to my nobility.

911
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,410
Be careful, Miss.

912
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,900
My umbrella!

913
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:12,970
Young Master.

914
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,530
-You again?
-You again?

915
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,610
You know each other?

916
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:30,820
Second Sister.

917
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,710
This man is from an unknown background and has a bad character.

918
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,020
He doesn't deserve to go to Yiyang Academy.

919
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,900
We can't let him sign up.

920
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,240
Yueniang, you're so rude.

921
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:40,610
Let me see.

922
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,300
Mr. Xiao Yu?

923
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,930
May I ask if your father is Lord Xiao Chuanzhong?

924
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,630
Yes.

925
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,160
Third Sister.

926
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,280
He is your future husband.
