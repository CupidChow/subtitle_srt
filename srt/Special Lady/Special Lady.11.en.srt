[Episode 11]

4
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,240
A gentleman shouldn't break a lock.

5
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,650
Lady Zhu?

6
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,920
Why are you here at the men's dorm

7
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,430
in the middle of the night?

8
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,120
You...

9
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,820
Instructor Shen.

10
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,690
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

11
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,210
Xiao Yu.

12
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,690
Xiao Yu.

13
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,620
What do you want?

14
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,140
You...

15
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,810
The way of the sage...

16
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,530
Xiao Yu.

17
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,700
Lies in benevolence and righteousness.

18
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,910
The heavens can tolerate everything...

19
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,710
Xiao Yu.

20
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,670
The way of the sage

21
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,280
lies in benevolence...

22
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,200
Senior Song was mumbling to herself

23
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,590
like this unconsciously earlier.

24
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,060
I called her, but she ignored me.

25
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,220
I've seen this in ancient books

26
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,780
that this symptom is called the sleepwalking disorder.

27
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,550
The Milky Way Stars...

28
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,300
The land is huge.

29
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,430
It can nurture all living beings.

30
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,170
Is this the legendary sleepwalking disorder?

31
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,340
Poor child.

32
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,000
I finally saw

33
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,200
a real sleepwalking disorder case today.

34
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,850
Look.

35
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,240
Beneficial for action...

36
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:38,990
She's asleep.

37
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,180
What should we do?

38
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,590
Don't wake up those who are sleepwalking.

39
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,920
Otherwise, they'll be terrified.

40
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,480
Besides, if Senior Song knew

41
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,210
she came to the men's dorm in her sleep,

42
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,320
she would be embarrassed.

43
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,500
But the books also say that people with sleepwalking disorder

44
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,250
will go back to their place.

45
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,630
If you follow Senior Song,

46
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,010
she will eventually return to the Song Mansion.

47
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,310
You go back first.

48
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,470
Don't worry. I'll follow her.

49
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,380
Okay.

50
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,590
I'll send her back.

51
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,520
Well...

52
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,530
Instructor Shen.

53
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,270
Why are you with Lady Zhu

54
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,550
in the middle of the night?

55
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,130
She has a sleepwalking disorder.

56
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,500
She went to the men's dorm alone.

57
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,990
What a coincidence.

58
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,190
Xiao Yu also has a sleepwalking disorder.

59
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,510
He went to Wenjing Hall.

60
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,430
What a coincidence.

61
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,500
I didn't expect you to use such a bad trick.

62
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,000
As if you have the right to laugh at me.

63
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,680
[Song Mansion]

64
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,140
Be careful.

65
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,659
Yueniang...

66
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,440
Come...

67
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,420
Come here.

68
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,360
Let me tell you.

69
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,590
Miss Zhu might have a sleepwalking disorder.

70
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,290
She went to the men's dorm alone.

71
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,640
Sleepwalking?

72
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,409
Keep your voice down.

73
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,700
You can't wake up a patient with such a disease.

74
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,860
So I followed her back.

75
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,140
I'm relieved that she's back.

76
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,020
Thank you, Instructor Shen.

77
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,010
You're welcome. I'll take my leave.

78
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,130
Okay.

79
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,060
Okay.

80
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,790
Take care.

81
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,600
The misunderstanding has finally been explained.

82
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,200
Mr. Zhou will never misunderstand

83
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,800
between me and Xiao Yu.

84
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,200
Well.

85
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,940
Why was that guy so strange?

86
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,320
What was he doing?

87
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,180
Forget it.

88
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,900
I'll go to sleep.

89
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,150
Good morning, Second Sister. I'll go to Wenjing Hall to ground myself.

90
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,440
What's the rush?

91
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,940
Don't you eat breakfast?

92
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,640
I won't.

93
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,600
Father asked me to go to Wenjing Hall at dawn every day.

94
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,610
I'm almost late.

95
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,440
See you, Second Sister.

96
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,960
Mother.

97
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,690
Did Yueniang leave?

98
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,670
She ran away in a hurry.

99
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,630
She is always like a flying arrow.

100
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,300
Mother, we usually say time flies like an arrow.

101
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,860
Yueniang always does things in a short time

102
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,390
and a hurry.

103
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:49,120
You can say that.

104
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,880
Mother, give me the tea.

105
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,470
I want to go in and beg for mercy for Yueniang from Father.

106
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,200
You know your father.

107
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,780
Last night,

108
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,740
Yueniang kneeled in the ancestral hall voluntarily.

109
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,000
I went to beg for mercy from him,

110
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,980
but he scolded me for being a loving mother who spoils her daughter.

111
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,720
If you go,

112
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,110
you'll be scolded for being a loving elder sister who spoils her younger sister.

113
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,390
Mother, I'll give it a try.

114
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,300
Father.

115
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm Yuniang.

116
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,710
Come in.

117
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,370
Put it down.

118
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,240
Let me grind ink for you.

119
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,190
Mother.

120
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,290
Hush.

121
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,230
Yuniang is going to be a loving elder sister.

122
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,260
Let's see if your father will scold her for spoiling her younger sister.

123
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,000
Mother.

124
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,600
What are you talking about?

125
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,010
I told you not to talk.

126
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,680
Come here.

127
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,970
So it's about pleading for Yueniang.

128
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,290
Yueniang is indeed naughty.

129
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,850
It's acceptable to punish her to transcribe books.

130
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,370
But he even confined her to Wenjing Hall.

131
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,820
What is Wenjing Hall?

132
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,940
All the students are studying there.

133
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,270
As a girl,

134
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,840
it'd be embarrassing to her.

135
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,580
Mother, don't worry.

136
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,860
I'll talk to Father.

137
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,690
Okay.

138
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,730
Maybe your father will listen to you.

139
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,690
Go.

140
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,120
Is there something special

141
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,920
hidden in this Wenjing Hall

142
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,110
so that Xiao Yu came here

143
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,010
in the middle of the night?

144
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,110
How are things going?

145
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,190
You also failed?

146
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,980
He wants to turn his back on the whole family.

147
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,640
Mother.

148
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,290
That's too harsh.

149
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,560
No matter how harsh my words are,

150
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,730
they are not as harsh as what he did.

151
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,590
No one can persuade him.

152
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,060
So you're here because of Lady Zhu being grounded.

153
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,520
I have a way to make Mr. Song let go.

154
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,130
Tell us.

155
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,790
Come in.

156
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,760
Mr. Song.

157
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,010
Are you here to plead for Yueniang?

158
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,920
I dare not.

159
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,000
I think

160
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,150
Lady Zhu has always been eccentric and bold.

161
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,420
She doesn't fit in with the young ladies.

162
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,420
You're right to discipline her.

163
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,180
I heard that Lady Zhu caused trouble again, did she?

164
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,550
I don't understand.

165
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,070
Why didn't you punish her but reward her when she caused trouble?

166
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,940
Reward her?

167
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,310
I've been in the Song family for more than 20 years.

168
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,250
I watched Lady Zhu grow up.

169
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,050
I know her well.

170
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,220
I think

171
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,340
it's not a punishment that you don't allow her

172
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,290
to attend classes,

173
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,840
but a reward.

174
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,190
Because Lady Zhu hates studying the most.

175
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,980
You are right.

176
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,860
It seems that

177
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,080
I haven't disciplined Yueniang well lately

178
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,930
so this girl

179
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,870
thinks that way.

180
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,130
Tell Yuniang

181
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,490
to get Yueniang back to school.

182
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:13,880
Yes.

183
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,770
Yes, Father.

184
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,590
How come I gave birth to such a troublemaker

185
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,470
who worries the whole family?

186
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,010
Am I really a loving mother who spoils her child?

187
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,240
I treat all of you equally.

188
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,310
It's not wrong to be a loving mother.

189
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,930
Mother, you're right.

190
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,840
Why did Xiao Yu come to Wenjing Hall?

191
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,480
What's special about this place?

192
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
Morning, Teaching Assistant Xiao.

193
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,870
Good morning, Miss Zhu.

194
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,210
You sneaked into Wenjing Hall last night

195
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,020
and were caught by Mr. Zhang.

196
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,880
I'm just curious

197
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,590
about what's so special about Wenjing Hall.

198
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,860
Why did you sneak into Wenjing Hall in the middle of the night?

199
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,590
Last night, you sneaked into the men's dorm

200
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,180
and were caught by Instructor Shen.

201
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm just curious

202
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,830
about what's so special about the men's dorm.

203
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,860
Why did you go there in the middle of the night?

204
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,150
Thanks to you,

205
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,450
I could only take the risk

206
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,150
to explain to Mr. Zhou.

207
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,630
I see.

208
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,530
But in my opinion,

209
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,560
breaking into the men's dorm at night

210
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,290
isn't something justified.

211
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,420
The more you explain, the more serious it gets.

212
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,090
Yesterday, Mr. Zhou told me...

213
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,030
What did he say?

214
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,420
He told me

215
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,950
that you and I are

216
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,490
quite similar.

217
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,670
What?

218
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,640
He said we are similar?

219
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,560
How?

220
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,420
I don't understand either.

221
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,670
How?

222
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,920
I'm so outstanding.

223
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,050
I'm afraid you're

224
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,450
nothing to compare with even my fingernails.

225
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,680
Are you a dog?

226
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,870
Why did you bite me?

227
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,030
I'm just not convinced.

228
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,170
You said I'm nothing to compare with your finger nails.

229
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:39,910
Then I'll

230
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,030
compete with your finger nails.

231
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,630
But I found

232
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,630
it's true that I'm nothing to compare with your finger nails.

233
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,270
Hurry up.

234
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,740
Urge your family to write a letter to break off the engagement.

235
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,360
Otherwise,

236
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,420
you'll marry a woman who's nothing to compare with

237
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,580
your finger nails.

238
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,340
Yueniang.

239
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,650
I thought you were afraid of nothing.

240
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,910
But when you hear Yueniang,

241
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,270
you're like a rat seeing a cat.

242
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,010
Good morning, Mr. Zhang.

243
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,080
Morning.

244
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,240
How dare you criticize me?

245
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,740
You're like a rat seeing a cat when you see Mr. Zhang.

246
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,830
Lies in benevolence and righteousness...

247
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,650
Yueniang.

248
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,020
Second Sister.

249
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:25,980
Father

250
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,580
lifted your grounding.

251
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,770
Come with me to class.

252
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,480
Father won't punish me?

253
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,500
He won't ground you.

254
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,830
Instead, he punishes you by having you transcribe books.

255
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,090
Okay.

256
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:40,850
Let's go.

257
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,820
Good morning, Mr. Zhang.

258
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,910
Why is there another person here?

259
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,940
Who is it?

260
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,730
You again?

261
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,230
Why are you here at Wenjing Hall again?

262
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,480
I'm here to clean Wenjing Hall.

263
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,730
Good.

264
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,210
Go upstairs with me.

265
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,630
Clean the Dean's Room.

266
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,510
Okay.

267
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,870
Teaching Assistant Xiao, please.

268
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,130
Okay.

269
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,630
Here.

270
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,650
-Okay.
-And Inside.

271
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,030
Wipe it carefully.

272
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,750
Okay.

273
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,579
Yueniang, you're not young anymore.

274
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,230
You should focus on your studies.

275
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,819
Don't always cause trouble

276
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,920
and make parents worry about you.

277
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,319
Yes, I understand.

278
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,560
Let's go.

279
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,890
Okay.

280
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,970
Teaching Assistant Xiao, are you done?

281
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,530
Soon.

282
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:40,900
Done.

283
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,950
Where is he going so late at night?

284
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,560
As the supervisor of the dorm, I have to do my duty

285
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,670
to find out the truth.

286
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,670
[Account book]

287
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,540
Every 16th of the month, Duke Yue

288
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,810
donates large sums of money for no reason.

289
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,080
Is it because of Yan Qinruo?

290
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,960
If the Song's Academy has a culture of favoring students

291
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,430
who bribe,

292
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,450
I wouldn't agree that it serves as a role model for educational institutions.

293
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,160
If you dare to jump, I'll call for help now.

294
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,430
Lady Zhu, why are you still here

295
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,540
at Wenjing Hall in the middle of the night?

296
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,270
Are you waiting for me?

297
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,440
Yes, I was waiting for you.

298
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,540
I was waiting for you, the thief, to reveal your true colors.

299
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,370
What do you mean?

300
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,990
I just

301
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,990
had a sudden urge to come here to read books.

302
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,420
You had a sudden urge?

303
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,620
You climbed over my wall in the middle of the night out of a sudden urge.

304
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,460
You were punished to chase geese.

305
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,800
You enclosed the geese and headed to Wenjing Hall

306
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,960
out of a sudden urge.

307
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,070
While cleaning,

308
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,460
you sneaked into the Dean's Room also out of a sudden urge.

309
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,670
Xiao Yu.

310
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,900
You're so

311
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,290
not good at lying.

312
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,470
Compared to you, I'm indeed much inferior in this field.

313
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,210
Cut the crap.

314
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,900
Come with me to my father now.

315
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,750
Let my father see

316
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,940
the true colors of the person I am engaged to.

317
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,510
And explain to my father

318
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,510
why you came to the Song's Academy,

319
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,120
and what you want

320
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,820
from here.

321
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,630
Let's go.

322
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
If I tell the Dean

323
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,320
that we're meeting privately here

324
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,670
because I said something wrong and made you angry.

325
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,630
What would he think?

326
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,890
Why are you

327
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,500
so shameless?

328
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,990
Fine, if you don't go,

329
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,870
I'll call for help now.

330
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,590
I'm not afraid.

331
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,450
Help!

332
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,100
Hush.

333
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,140
Let me tell you

334
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,050
why I'm here.

335
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,920
It's not that I want to tell the teachers.

336
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,600
It's that the sense of justice makes me do so.

337
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,720
That must be it.

338
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,970
[The Analects of Confucius
Song Xu]

339
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,060
You mean you sneaked into Wenjing Hall in the middle of the night

340
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,180
to get this book?

341
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,180
Yes.

342
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,050
And you want to please Qinruo's father?

343
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,430
Yes.

344
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,980
You like Qinruo?

345
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,340
Yes.

346
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,140
Stop talking nonsense.

347
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,110
If you really like Qinruo,

348
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,120
why have you never treated her

349
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,830
differently from other girls?

350
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,060
I treated you differently from her.

351
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,440
You...

352
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,100
You have the right to remain silent.

353
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,760
But I advise you

354
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,210
to tell me your real purpose.

355
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,340
A gentleman desires to marry a fair lady.

356
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,380
Lady Yan is naturally beautiful and graceful.

357
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,250
I fell in love with her at first sight.

358
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,500
But I know that Duke Yue's Mansion has countless treasures.

359
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,330
Everything I give will be common.

360
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,270
After thinking about it, what I can give,

361
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,490
which the Yan family will also treasure,

362
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,430
is the work of the dean.

363
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,550
I heard that

364
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,090
the Dean's Room holds annotated versions by the Dean.

365
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,610
That's why I sneaked into here

366
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,410
to get one copy

367
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,220
as a gift for Lady Yan's father.

368
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,870
No.

369
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,320
This is still my family's book.

370
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,420
Even if you love Qinruo,

371
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,980
you are still a thief.

372
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,290
Report me then.

373
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,740
You'd better tell Yan Qinruo

374
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,000
and let her know that I like her.

375
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,550
You really like Qinruo?

376
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,820
Yes.

377
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,280
Okay.

378
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,930
For now,

379
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,380
I trust you.

380
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,100
But don't tell anyone

381
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,480
what happened today.

382
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,610
Why?

383
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,420
I care about dignity too.

384
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,020
Do you still care about dignity?

385
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,640
I care about it in front of someone I like.

386
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,580
So don't tell anyone.

387
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,610
Okay, I'll keep it a secret.

388
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,670
But look,

389
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,790
since you really like Qinruo,

390
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,200
and we are engaged.

391
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,340
But you haven't replied to the letter from our home yet.

392
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,960
And the engagement is constraining us.

393
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,140
Maybe before you win Qinruo's heart,

394
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,700
you'll break her heart because of our engagement.

395
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,370
What do you think?

396
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,790
So,

397
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,060
instead of waiting for your doom, you'd better strike first.

398
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,460
Let's cooperate.

399
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,450
Cooperate?

400
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,360
I'll help you chase Qinruo.

401
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,820
You help me chase Junior Zhou.

402
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,900
If we both love someone else,

403
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,310
we can break off the engagement quickly.

404
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,780
What do you think?

405
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,120
Isn't it a good idea?

406
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,300
You've never thought of it, have you?

407
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,540
This...

408
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,390
We're engaged.

409
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,900
It's inappropriate.

410
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,050
It'll affect our reputation.

411
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:31,920
But

412
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:36,190
this engagement has almost crushed me.

413
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,700
This is unfair to Xiao Yu.

414
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,450
Is this fair to me?

415
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,740
Not to me either.

416
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,100
He arranged a marriage for me when I was three.

417
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,030
-It's so unfair!
-What do you want?

418
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,100
I want freedom.

419
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,430
I want you to help me chase Junior Zhou.

420
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,800
Aren't you his roommate?

421
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,180
Based on what you know about him,

422
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,170
it will be much easier for you to do so.

423
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,090
What do you think?

424
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,840
Do you really like Zhou Ji?

425
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,950
I...

426
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,200
I bought all his paintings.

427
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,550
Besides,

428
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,200
he is handsome and knowledgeable.

429
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,280
Many girls like him.

430
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,060
He is also modest and polite.

431
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,770
Will you help me?

432
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,340
Mr. Zhou and I are roommates.

433
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,760
We are like brothers.

434
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,260
Those closer to the waterfront pavilion will get the moonlight first.

435
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,400
I'm that waterfront pavilion.

436
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,500
So I can help you.

437
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:50,790
But

438
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,250
don't tell anyone

439
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,330
what happened today.

440
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,290
Then I'll help you chase Junior Zhou.

441
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,620
Agreed. Deal.

442
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,660
I didn't want to get involved in this.

443
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,940
But I think the academy should be a clean place.

444
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,580
How could such a muddle happen?

445
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,610
You should keep them under control.

446
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,280
Li Wenshu brought Mr. Zhang here.

447
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,900
What should we do?

448
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,380
Don't panic.

449
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,120
Don't forget that I'm a teaching assistant.

450
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:22,830
Let's go.

451
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,290
Did you see

452
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,000
Lady Zhu was alone with Xiao Yu?

453
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,200
I saw it with my own eyes.

454
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,410
Just...

455
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,910
On the second floor.

456
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,010
They're over there.

457
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,860
How inappropriate!

458
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,790
-Let me show you the way.
-Let’s go.

459
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,990
Sir, this way.

460
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,830
Three Whites Foundation Makeup.

461
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,370
Sir! Sir!

462
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,520
-What are Three Whites?
-This way.

463
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,450
Sir!

464
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:48,900
-This way.
-Three Whites refers to

465
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,310
-Sir! Sir!
-your forehead,

466
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,830
chin, and nose.

467
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,400
These three areas need to be highlighted with white makeup.

468
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,980
Lady Zhu, is there anything else you don't understand?

469
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,460
With your guidance,

470
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,270
I understand.

471
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,690
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

472
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,270
I didn't quite understand some of the makeup lessons.

473
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,290
So I came to ask Teaching Assistant Xiao

474
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,470
for advice.

475
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,870
It's inappropriate for a man and a woman to be alone.

476
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,530
Exactly.

477
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,520
It's so late.

478
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,660
And you're still studying?

479
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,340
Gosh.

480
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,510
I wouldn't know if you didn't tell me.

481
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,030
It's already dark.

482
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,390
We've been studying for so long today.

483
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,150
Yes.

484
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,340
When studying,

485
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,180
time will indeed pass more quickly.

486
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,390
How dare you lie

487
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,220
in front of me, the smart talent?

488
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,620
You two are dating in private.

489
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,380
You just...

490
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,030
This smart talent,

491
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,690
why are you so dirty?

492
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,460
I know.

493
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,450
Do you do this often?

494
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,340
I...

495
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,670
After entering the academy.

496
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,000
you should focus on learning.

497
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,910
Why do you keep thinking about

498
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,980
these dirty things?

499
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,980
Hey, you guys...

500
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,200
We were just immersed in the sea of knowledge

501
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:07,830
and forgot the time.

502
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,820
I didn't. He...

503
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:09,970
Lady Zhu.

504
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,490
It's getting late.

505
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,340
Go back and rest.

506
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,660
Thank you for teaching me today.

507
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,600
Goodbye, Teaching Assistant Xiao.

508
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,220
Goodbye, Mr. Zhang.

509
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,880
Mr. Zhang, I'll take my leave too.

510
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,970
Goodbye.

511
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,330
I...

512
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,130
You two...

513
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,350
Sir!

514
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,350
Sir!

515
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,990
They were just quibbling.

516
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,670
As you can see,

517
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,590
they were dating in private.

518
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,410
-I…
-Shut up!

519
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,750
How could a student of the academy

520
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,520
say such dirty things?

521
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,540
No.

522
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,430
I... They...

523
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,040
Go back and rest early.

524
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,370
Remember,

525
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,860
don't slander and spread rumors.

526
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,540
Yes, I shall take my leave.

527
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,990
Young Master.

528
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,050
You want to see me?

529
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,190
"The Thirty-Six Strategies of Love."

530
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,040
Young Master, why are you studying this?

531
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,550
If I hadn't been caught looking for that thing,

532
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,850
I wouldn't have studied this.

533
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,100
You found nothing

534
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,990
but got caught instead.

535
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,160
Young Master, you were careless.

536
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,320
Duke Yue donates 100 taels

537
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,990
to the Song's Academy on the 16th of every month.

538
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,050
Don't you think it's strange?

539
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,820
You mean Song's Academy has a culture of corruption?

540
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,020
Don't forget

541
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,080
that knowing Song's Academy

542
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,900
is one of our purposes for this trip.

543
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,940
In that case, you should not be studying this even more.

544
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,560
You don't know

545
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,030
that Miss Zhu is so shrewd.

546
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,200
If I don't settle her,

547
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,060
it's hard for me to keep

548
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:28,830
investigating.

549
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,810
Young Master, didn't you say

550
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,940
you wouldn't break Lady Zhu's engagement?

551
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,370
If you help her chase after other young masters,

552
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,900
the engagement will be broken naturally.

553
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,350
That's why I came to you.

554
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,290
Tell me.

555
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,420
What is Miss Zhu not good at?

556
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,460
Well.

557
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,320
Musical instruments, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

558
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,480
What else?

559
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,660
Being pretentious.

560
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,350
What else?

561
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,420
What else...

562
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,530
She's not good at anything

563
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,510
that outstanding girls are good at.

564
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,010
Okay.

565
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,280
Let's start with

566
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,680
what the girls are good at.

567
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,560
Make her fail in chasing Mr. Zhou.

568
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,690
But

569
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,440
I'm still a little worried.

570
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,700
About what?

571
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,930
If she falls in love with me

572
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,540
while I am helping her,

573
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,430
I'll be in trouble.

574
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,120
No, Young Master.

575
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,790
Don’t worry about it.

576
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,360
It's absolutely impossible.

577
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,830
Why not?

578
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,960
I'm good-looking,

579
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,450
knowledgeable and broad-minded.

580
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,870
Even Song Xu appreciates me.

581
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,480
Young Master.

582
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,940
You're indeed good-looking and broad-minded.

583
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,990
And Song Xu appreciates you.

584
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,880
But in terms of getting along with girls,

585
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,550
Young Master, you...

586
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,870
You are really not good at it.

587
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,580
Then I’m relieved.

588
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,150
Young Master, you can rest assured.

589
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,640
Think about Miss Zhu.

590
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,600
Every time you met,

591
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,400
she either cursed you hard,

592
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,530
or wanted to kill you.

593
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,980
She would never like you.

594
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,830
Never.

595
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:56,780
I...

596
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,080
This...

597
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,350
Why is this room so messy?

598
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,540
Are the corners of the quilt right angles?

599
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,300
Well.

600
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,620
Look at the dust.

601
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,550
Touch it and my hand is covered in dust.

602
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,310
Clean it.

603
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,360
Listen.

604
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,100
I'll punish you if you can't clean it thoroughly.

605
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,389
I'm so mad!

606
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,960
I'm so mad!

607
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,250
Yueniang.

608
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,170
Yueniang.

609
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,020
Yueniang.

610
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,760
How can you sleep?

611
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,810
I can. It's still early.

612
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,150
Mr. Zhang came at dawn.

613
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,139
Why is Mr. Zhang here?

614
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,070
Men and women cannot sit together,

615
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,810
cannot use the same set of restraints, cannot use the same towel and comb,

616
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,900
and cannot hand objects to each other.

617
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,830
Being hungry is a minor matter, losing one's integrity is a major matter.

618
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,490
You mean they were in the same room alone?

619
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,480
Yes.

620
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,020
Were they harmonious?

621
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,600
When they ran away with excuses,

622
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,660
they were quite harmonious.

623
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,960
Lady Zhu is always naughty.

624
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,060
Don't take it lightly.

625
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,560
By the way,

626
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,390
have you finished the tea

627
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,420
I asked Li to send you?

628
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,370
I'll ask Li to send you some more.

629
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,120
Dean.

630
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,510
Drinking tea is not a big deal.

631
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,610
Songzhi. Don't worry.

632
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,140
I know how to deal with this.

633
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,110
This is not a minor matter.

634
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,340
You must treat it seriously.

635
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:03,840
Songzhi.

636
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,680
Yueniang and Xiao Yu

637
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,890
have long been engaged.

638
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,020
Since they like each other,

639
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,630
I'll find time to visit the Xiao family

640
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,970
to talk about their marriage.

641
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,060
In that case,

642
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,260
I won't

643
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,470
worry anymore.

644
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,430
However,

645
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,790
I suggest sending the marriage proposal early.

646
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,810
It's good for both of them.

647
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,890
That makes sense.

648
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,750
The Mid-Autumn Festival is in a few days.

649
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,010
I'll go to the Xiao family then...

650
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:11,810
Let's go.

651
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,700
Where have you been? I've been looking for you everywhere.

652
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,790
Slow down.

653
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,780
I...

654
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,420
I went to find a way for you.

655
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,990
A way?

656
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,340
What way?

657
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,220
The way to chase Zhou Ji.

658
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,310
We should hurry.

659
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,730
I have bad news.

660
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,700
What's wrong?

661
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,430
Mr. Zhang went to my house this morning

662
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,450
and told my father

663
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,800
that we were alone in Wenjing Hall.

664
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,610
When my father heard the news,

665
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,180
he immediately wanted to propose marriage at your house.

666
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:47,770
What?

667
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,360
Hush.

668
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,010
Luckily,

669
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,250
I used the reason that we needed to get to know each other first to stop him.

670
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,570
But it won't last long.

671
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,050
The engagement is getting more and more troublesome.

672
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,930
Looks like I have to find out Song Xu's attitude as soon as possible.

673
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,050
If he really colludes with Wan Li and Duke Yue,

674
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,010
I have to get out of here as soon as possible.

675
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,010
Why are you frozen?

676
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,400
How about

677
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,730
you help me chase Yan Qinruo first?

678
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,030
Sure.

679
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,020
It will be easier for you to chase Qinruo.

680
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,190
When you two love each other,

681
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,160
I'll ask my father to invite your parents.

682
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,480
You'll be in charge of breaking off the engagement.

683
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,220
What?

684
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,200
When you're with someone you like,

685
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,850
of course, you should talk about breaking off the engagement first.

686
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,020
Forget it.

687
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,270
Let me help you chase Mr. Zhou first.

688
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,500
I'll help you chase Qinruo first.

689
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,120
You chase Mr. Zhou first.

690
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:50,840
Let me help you.

691
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,780
It's easier for you to chase him.

692
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,010
It's easy for a girl to chase a man.

693
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,050
Okay?

694
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,170
Okay.

695
00:38:59,010 --> 00:38:59,880
When shall we start?

696
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,750
Tonight.

697
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,220
The three of us will study together.

698
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,890
In the middle,

699
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,820
I'll find an excuse to leave.

700
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,230
When I leave,

701
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,700
I will accidentally

702
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:14,680
put out

703
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,350
the candle.

704
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,040
Junior Zhou.

705
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:17,900
By then,

706
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,990
you can lean on Mr. Zhou's arm.

707
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,450
Will this work?

708
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,110
Isn't it too hasty?

709
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,910
Under such a wonderful atmosphere,

710
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,590
under such a fragile moonlight,

711
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:42,350
this kind of weak-looking coquetry is most attractive to men.

712
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,910
Will it work?

713
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,140
Trust me.

714
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,310
I'm a man.

715
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:51,850
He's here.

716
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,110
Junior Zhou.

717
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,380
Senior Song.

718
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:58,570
Have a seat.

719
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,290
Senior Song.

720
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:01,960
Let me help you.

721
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:03,890
Thank you.

722
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,720
It's great

723
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,580
to study with you.

724
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,470
I suddenly remembered

725
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,140
I left something in the dorm.

726
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,220
Mr. Zhou,

727
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,330
accompany Lady Zhu to study.

728
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,350
I'll go back first.

729
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,020
Mr. Xiao, I…

730
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:29,980
-Let me get it for you.
-Teaching Assistant Xiao.

731
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,860
Take your time.

732
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,540
Mr. Xiao, let me get it for you.

733
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,580
Thank you. Mr. Zhou.

734
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,790
It's okay.

735
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,420
It's nothing.

736
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,190
I mean it. Just study with Lady Zhu.

737
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,970
It's okay.

738
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,550
Mr. Xiao, you…

739
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,090
Junior Zhou, I’m afraid of the dark.

740
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,280
The candle is lit again.

741
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,030
You're a girl. Stop drinking.

742
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,070
Stop.

743
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,440
Stop drinking.

744
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,900
Don't drink if you can't.

745
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,300
Let's learn our lesson this time.

746
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,450
We won't do it in the room next time

747
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,940
in case the space is narrow

748
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,840
and mistakes are easily made.

749
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,070
Make the wind stronger.

750
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,520
Senior Song.

751
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,780
Senior Song.

752
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,340
Ji.

00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,470
The moon is beautiful tonight.

754
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,010
Shall we admire the moon together?

755
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:13,930
Sure.

756
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,860
Can it work?

757
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,980
Trust me.

758
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,540
I'm a man.
