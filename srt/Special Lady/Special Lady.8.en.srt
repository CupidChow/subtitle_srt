Xiao Yu.

Xiao...

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,670

Xiao Yu.

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,430
Xiao... Xiao Yu.

12
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,300
Xiao...

13
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,330
What happened?

14
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,640
Oh my gosh!

15
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,280
Help!

16
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,710
The kitchen is on fire!

17
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,510
Is anyone inside?

18
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,150
Hurry up!

19
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,950
Someone is inside.

20
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,870
What's going on?

21
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,310
What should we do?

22
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,270
Hurry up!

23
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,000
Put out the fire and save people!

24
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,750
Where is

25
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,230
Mr. Xiao?

26
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,020
Oh no.

27
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,570
Is he still inside?

28
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,110
-Mr. Xiao?
-Mr. Xiao?

29
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,030
Is Mr. Xiao inside?

30
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,760
Did something happen to him?

31
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,790
Mr. Xiao.

32
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,020
-Madam Sun.
-Help!

33
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,990
Go save people!

34
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,830
Put out the fire!

35
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,590
Go get the water ladle and the bucket first.

36
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,110
Idiot!

37
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,790
It's too late.

38
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,870
Stop crying.

39
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,160
Are you alright, Madam Sun?

40
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,750
What are you doing?

41
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,630
Help put out the fire!

42
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,670
I'm thinking of a way.

43
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,230
Save people!

44
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,830
Get more water! Get more water!

45
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,360
Help! Hurry!

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,840
-Help!
-You go find something to put out the fire.

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,790
I'm going in to save people first.

48
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,150
Help put out the fire!

49
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,130
-Hurry!
-Mr. Zhou.

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Mr. Zhou, be careful!

51
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,110
Mr. Xiao.

52
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,630
Come on.

53
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,470
Mr. Zhou.

54
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,050
Get her out.

55
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,470
Help put out the fire!

56
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,150
Water.

57
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,710
Mr. Xiao, the exit is over here.

58
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,829
There's one more.

59
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,910
-Zhou Ji.
-Hurry. This way.

60
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,840
They came out.

61
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,880
Miss Zhu.

62
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,020
Miss Zhu.

63
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,110
-Miss Zhu.
-Miss Zhu.

64
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,800
Take her to the infirmary now.

65
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,820
Did you see Xiao Yu?

66
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,390
Did you see Xiao Yu?

67
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,230
He is still inside.

68
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,100
Zhou Ji, you go to the infirmary too.

69
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,220
I'm fine.

70
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,430
Hurry up.

71
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,180
Mr. Zhou.

72
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,820
Be careful.

73
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,810
The wall is cold.

74
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,470
It seems the fire is not big.

75
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,220
Get water. Hurry.

76
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,750
Hurry.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,110
What should we do?

78
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,390
Mr. Xiao.

79
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,110
Mr. Zhou.

80
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,440
-Xiao Yu.
-Xiao Yu.

81
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,029
-Zhou Ji.
-Are you alright?

82
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,720
-Are you okay?
-He came out.

83
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,230
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,440
I set the kitchen on fire.

85
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,590
-What's wrong with my goose?
-It's fine.

86
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,490
When I went in,

87
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,710
I saw Mr. Xiao holding this goose.

88
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,470
I was wondering if he wanted to die.

89
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,840
At that crucial moment,

90
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,460
you still cared about the goose?

91
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,010
-Goose.
-Just leave it.

92
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,310
Goose!

93
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,190
Take Xiao Yu and Zhou Ji to the infirmary now.

94
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,710
-Yes.
-I'm fine.

95
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,900
Goose, what's wrong with you?

96
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,190
Help! Help!

97
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,390
Help! Take him to the infirmary!

98
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,030
Hurry up!

99
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,870
Save the goose! Save the goose.

100
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,990
Xiao Yu.

101
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,159
Xiao Yu.

102
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,630
Xiao Yu.

103
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,190
Xiao Yu.

104
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,300
Xiao Yu.

105
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,750
Yueniang.

106
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,500
Yueniang.

107
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,150
You're awake.

108
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,850
Lie down. Don't move.

109
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,830
You haven't fully recovered yet.

110
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,330
I'm going to get you some water.

111
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,200
Xiao Yu.

112
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,580
Xiao Yu!

113
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,270
Xiao...

114
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,490
Xiao...

115
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,060
Are you okay?

116
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,390
I'm fine.

117
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,390
Are you worried about me?

118
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,730
It's good you are okay.

119
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,120
It's good you are okay.

120
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,630
Don't worry.

121
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,950
Since you rushed into the fire to save me,

122
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,050
I'll forgive you for what you did last time.

123
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,370
You should be worried about Mr. Zhou

124
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,000
if you have time.

125
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,710
Why is Mr. Zhou here?

126
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,820
He ran out of strength to put out the fire.

127
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,070
Please calm down.

128
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,810
You should get more rest.

129
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,260
Thank you.

130
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,460
It's just that I made a mistake.

131
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,640
I have to make an apology first.

132
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,240
But your health...

133
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,850
Somehow,

134
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,110
I don't feel that uncomfortable

135
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,350
after waking up.

136
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,840
Your recovery capability is amazing.

137
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,000
Sir.

138
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,140
Is Mr. Xiao really okay?

139
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,570
Among the three of you,

140
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,659
only he was sober when he came here.

141
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,280
It's good he's fine.

142
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,210
Everything is fine.

143
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,870
Right. Sir,

144
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,060
how is Mr. Zhou?

145
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,530
Miss Zhu. Don't worry.

146
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,940
Mr. Zhou

147
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,800
just inhaled some smoke, just like you.

148
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,500
He'll wake up soon.

149
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,420
Thank you. Sir.

150
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,070
Let me do it.

151
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,140
You're still weak.

152
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,830
How can you take care of others?

153
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,810
Lie down.

154
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,050
Hurry.

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,250
You

156
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,600
were too reckless.

157
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,570
Luckily, Mr. Zhou

158
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,140
saved you from the fire.

159
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,100
If anything happened to you,

160
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,570
what should your family members do?

161
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,150
Mr. Zhou saved me?

162
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,340
Yes.

163
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,940
In order to save you,

164
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,340
he inhaled smoke.

165
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,120
Young Master.

166
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,100
Young Master.

167
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,070
Young Master, I'm here.

168
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,880
I'm here, Young Master.

169
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,290
Uncle Hu.

170
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:07,920
Young Master.

171
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,260
Why are you here?

172
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,280
What if someone finds out?

173
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,510
Earlier,

174
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,480
there was heavy smoke in the academy.

175
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,530
I heard

176
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,110
you set the kitchen on fire.

177
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,030
I just

178
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,190
accidentally watered the coal.

179
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,140
It was just heavy smoke.

180
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,000
It was not that serious.

181
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,070
Then...

182
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:26,860
Right.

183
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:27,930
You came at the right time.

184
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,550
Other students in the academy

185
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,450
haven't eaten.

186
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,630
There is nowhere to cook in the academy.

187
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,620
Go get some food for them,

188
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,090
so that they won't complain.

189
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,690
It won't end well if the situation gets worse.

190
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,429
Well...

191
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,320
Do you have any other good ideas?

192
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:44,950
Young Master.

193
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,520
I really don't have money.

194
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,590
Buy it on credit.

195
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,560
I'll give you later.

196
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:50,810
And

197
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,980
Mr. Zhang's goose

198
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,830
was burnt to death by me.

199
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,030
Get him another one.

200
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,290
Goose?

201
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,100
Xiao Yu.

202
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,160
Greetings, Mr. Chen.

203
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,960
Didn't I ask you to have a good rest?

204
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,170
Why are you here?

205
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,000
I know I made a mistake.

206
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,180
I dare not delay any longer.

207
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,280
So I came to receive punishment.

208
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,880
Well.

209
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,800
I'm going to solve the problem

210
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,530
of the students' lunch.

211
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,630
Come with me.

212
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,040
Sir.

213
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,730
I've asked someone to buy food.

214
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,880
I want to make up for it.

215
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,650
I hope the academy can give me the chance.

216
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,990
That's very thoughtful of you.

217
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,510
Fine.

218
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,320
Come with me to the kitchen.

219
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,690
I have to explain to the students.

220
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,720
We'll talk about what you did face to face.

221
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,780
I'll listen to you.

222
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,890
If I don't eat you,

223
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,100
it would be a waste.

224
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,830
He is not only talented,

225
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,950
but also elegant.

226
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,030
Besides being elegant,

227
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,660
he is brave and righteous.

228
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,270
I was so lucky

229
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,380
to be saved by Mr. Zhou.

230
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,230
Sir.

231
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,760
Sir.

232
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,830
Sir.

233
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,370
Please come in. Please come in.

234
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,360
Sir,

235
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,350
please take a look.

236
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,400
Mr. Zhou is awake.

237
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,660
Please check on him.

238
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,970
Sir.

239
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,390
Lie down.

240
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,580
-Senior.
-Junior.

241
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,430
Lie down.

242
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,020
I'm fine.

243
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,640
Lie down and let him check on you first.

244
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,440
Don't move.

245
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,250
He is strong.

246
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,330
There is nothing serious now.

247
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,680
He will fully recover after resting for some days.

248
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,430
That's good.

249
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,440
-That's good.
-Thank you. Sir.

250
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,840
You two should have a good rest.

251
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,120
If you feel uncomfortable,

252
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,450
just call me.

253
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,510
Thank you. Sir.

254
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,600
-You're welcome.
-Thank you. Sir.

255
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,640
Have a good rest.

256
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,670
Right.

257
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,780
Where is Mr. Xiao?

258
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,570
Is Mr. Xiao okay?

259
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,570
He is fine.

260
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,880
He has gone back.

261
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,650
The fire was big today,

262
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,800
and Mr. Xiao is fine.

263
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,210
He was so lucky.

264
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,110
Yes.

265
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,830
I wonder how the fire started.

266
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,400
And Senior,

267
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,260
why were you in the kitchen today?

268
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,630
Sorry, Senior.

269
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,510
I shouldn't have mentioned this.

270
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,970
Senior, go back to your bed and rest.

271
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,250
Because of my sudden interest,

272
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,160
I nearly made an unforgivable mistake today.

273
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,780
Luckily, Xiao Yu is fine.

274
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,560
Otherwise...

275
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,080
Considering the current situation,

276
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,000
What do we eat today?

277
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,620
I don't think we'll have anything to eat today.

278
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,450
That's right.

279
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,150
Everyone. Calm down.

280
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,040
I have something to say.

281
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,150
All of you were busy

282
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,390
with putting out the fire in the forenoon.

283
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,120
Now, you have nothing to eat because the kitchen was burnt down.

284
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,540
You have complaints.

285
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,450
I understand.

286
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,770
Today, I'll be kind enough

287
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,680
to solve the lunch problem for you.

288
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,160
He can solve the problem?

289
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,580
Really?

290
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,350
That's good.

291
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:26,990
Really?

292
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,960
-We'll have something to eat.
-Can he really solve it?

293
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,300
As for Xiao Yu,

294
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,770
I'm willing to go to our teacher

295
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,520
and seek justice for you.

296
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,840
I wonder if you trust me.

297
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,280
What Mr. Li said is reasonable and well-founded.

298
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,560
And his father is the county magistrate of Yiyang.

299
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,890
Everyone trusts Mr. Li, right?

300
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,860
Well.

301
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,040
Mr. Li.

302
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,850
I'm delivering our gratitude to you on behalf of seniors and juniors.

303
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,540
Thank you, Mr. Li.

304
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,920
With great power

305
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,340
comes great responsibility.

306
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,120
Yiyang Restaurant delivered a lunch set

307
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,830
to each student.

308
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,760
Thank you for your hard work.

309
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,880
Please enjoy your lunch.

310
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,740
What is this?

311
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,530
We have food.

312
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,510
Really?

313
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,720
Come and take a look.

314
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,760
What is this?

315
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,840
Look at this.

316
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,090
-It smells so good.
-So many dishes.

317
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,000
Who asked you to deliver the food?

318
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,210
An old man asked us to deliver the food on behalf of Mr. Xiao.

319
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,830
He said the students had a rough forenoon.

320
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,420
He wants to treat the students to something delicious.

321
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,010
It's so delicious.

322
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,990
Who delivered this to us?

323
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,160
He is so kind.

324
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,640
Yes.

325
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,660
Why isn't Mr. Li eating?

326
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,370
Mr. Li.

327
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,920
Come and eat.

328
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,990
Come on.

329
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,550
Come on.

330
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,110
Come on. Mr. Li.

331
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,360
Just eat.

332
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,700
So Mr. Li has already prepared the food.

333
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,270
You've already started eating?

334
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,960
Mr. Chen.

335
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,880
Have you eaten?

336
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,120
Why don't you join us?

337
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,920
You guys eat.

338
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,670
Join us.

339
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:54,980
Guys,

340
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,070
it was my fault

341
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,290
that the kitchen was burnt down.

342
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,440
My apology.

343
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,150
Sir.

344
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,690
I have a question.

345
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,160
Go ahead.

346
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,080
Mr. Xiao hasn't been here for long,

347
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,550
but he caused much trouble.

348
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,730
He almost burnt the kitchen to the ground today.

349
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,470
Isn't it too unreasonable

350
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,320
to just let him apologize?

351
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,800
If the academy doesn't punish him severely,

352
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,510
how can we be convinced?

353
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:23,880
That's right.

354
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,860
If someone just makes an apology

355
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,990
after setting the academy

356
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,120
and the dorm on fire,

357
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,210
I think the academy will be suspended sooner or later.

358
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,190
The fire in the kitchen was indeed a serious matter.

359
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,620
He should be punished severely.

360
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,520
But Xiao Yu admitted his mistake in time

361
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,630
and showed a sincere attitude.

362
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,980
The academy has decided to let him

363
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,590
rebuild the kitchen

364
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,680
using his spare time

365
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,050
to give him a lesson.

366
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,350
Besides,

367
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,060
you guys helped put out the fire and save people.

368
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,170
On behalf of the academy, I'd like to show my respect to you.

369
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,230
It's our duty.

370
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,340
It's our duty. Sir.

371
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,940
I accept the punishment willingly.

372
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,140
Sorry for the trouble.

373
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm sorry again.

374
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,560
It's okay.

375
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,860
It's okay. It's all over.

376
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,560
Just rebuilding the kitchen?

377
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,930
This is too...

378
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,370
Are you teaching the academy

379
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,420
or teaching me?

380
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,260
I dare not.

381
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:33,930
Mr. Li.

382
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,210
Calm down.

383
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,480
Why did you mess with him?

384
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,440
Hurry up!

385
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,370
Move. Get out of the way!

386
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,090
Which one is mine?

387
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,160
Take this inside.

388
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,070
Okay, this is yours.

389
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,850
Take one for me.

390
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,290
This is for you. We're going in.

391
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:50,940
Okay.

392
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,790
I really want to know what's inside.

393
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,750
Open it.

394
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,200
Well...

395
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,000
Miss Song Yi.

396
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:07,810
Let me help you.

397
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,230
No need.

398
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,319
Sorry.

399
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,109
This may be a bit abrupt.

400
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,190
My name is Li... Li Wenshu.

401
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,200
I'm the son of Li Shancai, the county magistrate of Yiyang.

402
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,880
I'm also a s...

403
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,250
student of Men's Academy.

404
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,140
I'm not an outsider.

405
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,830
No need.

406
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,050
The kitchen is full of female students.

407
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,000
It's not appropriate for a man to go in.

408
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,440
You... You're right.

409
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,270
Well...

410
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,240
Madam. We have delivered all the food.

411
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,400
Okay.

412
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,850
-Go inside.
-Let's go. Okay.

413
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,050
Song...

414
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,710
Rebuild the kitchen and paint the walls.

415
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,110
Do you have any objections?

416
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,320
The academy has already

417
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,910
showed me mercy.

418
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,850
I've caused you a lot of trouble these days.

419
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,150
I should thank you.

420
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,760
Apart from taking a rest,

421
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,610
you must stay here before finishing the task.

422
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,490
I'll find time to check on you.

423
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,190
If anything goes wrong again,

424
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,130
you know the consequences.

425
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,470
Thank you. Sir.

426
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,110
I can't do this on my own.

427
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,000
Mr. Z...

428
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:38,950
Mr. Zhou?

429
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,960
Sir.

430
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,960
The man here...

431
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,340
He said

432
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,040
he wants to go back to his room to rest.

433
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,560
So I let him go back.

434
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,960
Thank you. Sir.

435
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,640
Goodbye.

436
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,010
Okay.

437
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,650
It's your day off tomorrow.

438
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,860
If there's nothing important,

439
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,630
don't go out.

440
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,080
Stay in the academy and study.

441
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,790
I have to remind you this.

442
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,940
Don't learn from Xiao Yu in Women's Academy

443
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,860
to cause trouble everywhere.

444
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,730
One more thing.

445
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,280
The dorm supervisor just took a sick leave.

446
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,320
We can't find a suitable person for the time being.

447
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,850
You've been together for a long time.

448
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,010
You should be familiar with each other.

449
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,040
So I'm asking you to recommend someone

450
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,710
to be the dorm supervisor.

451
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,230
He will be in charge of

452
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,850
the daily routine and behavior habits in the dorm.

453
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,920
Well. Who should we recommend?

454
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,000
Who is suitable?

455
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,080
No one wants to recommend someone?

456
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,880
Sir.

457
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,710
I recommend myself.

458
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,550
You are...

459
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,720
Greetings. Sir. I'm Li Wenshu.

460
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,920
Are you confident that you can handle this job?

461
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,910
My father can handle the whole county.

462
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,490
Of course I can handle the dorm.

463
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,520
Yes.

464
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,370
I think Mr. Li is the most suitable person.

465
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,520
Yes, I agree.

466
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,190
I didn't expect you to be so prestigious

467
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,230
considering you just came here not long ago.

468
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,610
I'm flattered.

469
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,850
Li Wenshu is just like his father.

470
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,230
No.

471
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,260
I can't let him succeed.

472
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,280
Mr. Zhou went to the kitchen to save people.

473
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,670
He risked his life for a just cause.

474
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,200
I recommend Mr. Zhou.

475
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,970
Who is it?

476
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,450
Zhou Ji.

477
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,700
Someone just recommended you.

478
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,780
What do you think?

479
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,260
I'm not capable enough to be entrusted with this job.

480
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,430
Many students support Mr. Li,

481
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,030
it's reasonable for him to be the dorm supervisor then.

482
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,690
I will abide by your decision.

483
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,450
In that case,

484
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,400
Li Wenshu will be the dorm supervisor.

485
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,070
-Good.
-Good.

486
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,420
Thank you. Sir.

487
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,020
Goodbye. Sir.

488
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,750
Mr. Xiao, you are...

489
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,560
You were brave enough

490
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,440
to rush into the fire today.

491
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,960
I didn't see you in the kitchen just now.

492
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,570
I guess you haven't eaten.

493
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,340
So I specially prepared some food for you.

494
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,230
You're too kind. Mr. Xiao.

495
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,940
Not at all.

496
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,540
Here.

497
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,600
Eat.

498
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,630
Thank you.

499
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,320
You're welcome.

500
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,190
Mr. Zhou.

501
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,190
Are you feeling okay now?

502
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,920
The doctor said

503
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
it's nothing serious.

504
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:01,900
That's good.

505
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,160
Mr. Zhou, eat.

506
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,640
Eat.

507
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,570
It'll get cold if you don't eat it now.

508
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,670
This tastes really good.

509
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,720
I heard that you have been punished to rebuild the kitchen.

510
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,140
Yes.

511
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,550
But the academy

512
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,150
was already merciful enough.

513
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,130
It's not easy to rebuild the kitchen.

514
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
Mr. Xiao also needs to give classes.

515
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,320
Is it difficult for you to rebuild it alone?

516
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,570
The academy just punished me to rebuild the kitchen.

517
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,780
But they didn't ask me to do it alone.

518
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,040
Here.

519
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,850
Mr. Xiao.

520
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,360
This meal is not free, right?

521
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,660
We're brothers.

522
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,610
Don't say that.

523
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,570
Even if I didn't treat you to this meal,

524
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,440
you would help me, right?

525
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,180
Put it down.

526
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,950
Throughout my life,

527
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,540
I've never apologized to anyone.

528
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,760
I didn't expect

529
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,630
I would be so humble today.

530
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,890
How should I tell him?

531
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,770
Gosh. I just can't do that.

532
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,460
Here we go.

533
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,000
Mr. Xiao.

534
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,010
This...

535
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,170
This is...

536
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,350
I saw it when I went out.

537
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,590
I think it's for you.

538
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,700
For me?

539
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,080
From whom?

540
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,570
I don't know.

541
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,150
It was already there when I went out.

542
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,760
The autumn scenery

543
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,090
is everywhere.

544
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,650
I heard that the academy asked Teaching Assistant Xiao to rebuild the kitchen.

545
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,910
I'm very worried.

546
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,120
I'm afraid that you might get too tired.

547
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,660
So I prepared a basket of fruits and vegetables for you.

548
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,660
Please accept it.

549
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,080
Mr. Zhou,

550
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,960
did you really not see who put it there?

551
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:52,960
I didn't.

552
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,160
The letter was put on the table in the doorway.

553
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,440
What's wrong?

554
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,890
Is there a problem with the letter?

555
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,560
Mr. Zhou,

556
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,080
please show me

557
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,400
where the letter was put just now.

558
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,790
Okay.

559
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,240
Here.

560
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,160
Senior Song.

561
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,970
Ju... Junior Zhou.

562
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,200
This letter is...

563
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,040
What letter?

564
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,350
Did you write this letter?

565
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,560
Nonsense.

566
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,890
How could it be me?

567
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,030
No.

568
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,550
The handwriting is neat.

569
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,680
The words are beautiful.

570
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,220
It is indeed not her style.

571
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,990
Right. Mr. Zhou,

572
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,490
why are you here?

573
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,110
It's not easy to rebuild the kitchen.

574
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,490
It's too hard for Mr. Xiao to rebuild it alone.

575
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,230
So I came to help him.

576
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,110
You are so nice.

577
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,530
I'm flattered.

578
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,400
Mr. Xiao is very nice too.

579
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,030
Him?

580
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,770
I suddenly remembered that there is still a wall that hasn't been painted.

581
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,700
You two talk.

582
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,450
I'm going in.

583
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,920
Junior Zhou. Why are you...

584
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,070
Why are you going in?

585
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,400
Who wrote this letter?

586
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,030
I'm also wondering.

587
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,880
You didn't write this letter

588
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,940
or deliver this letter?

589
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,400
Of course I didn't.

590
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,210
Even if I want to deliver a letter,

591
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,680
I'll deliver it to Junior Zhou.

592
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,250
Since you are here,

593
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,860
just think of it as a reward to you because I pity you.

594
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,790
So it's for Mr. Zhou.

595
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,930
I thank you on behalf of him.

596
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,980
Keep your voice down.

597
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,510
What do you mean?

598
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,310
I'm just surprised

599
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,760
that Miss Zhu has the ability to predict the future.

600
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,780
You didn't know Mr. Zhou is here, but you still delivered your letter here.

601
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,600
I'm impressed.

602
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,880
Don't you feel guilty?

603
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,080
Junior Zhou hasn't recovered yet.

604
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,310
But you asked him to help you.

605
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,220
You really...

606
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,390
Can you stop poking me?

607
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,410
You heard it.

608
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,240
He said it himself.

609
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,380
He came to help me because he doesn't want me to be too tired.

610
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,440
I didn't force him.

611
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,510
Then you must have poisoned him.

612
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,760
Otherwise, why would Mr. Zhou have been cheated by you

613
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,610
since he is so kind?

614
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,920
Stop poking me.

615
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,630
Let me ask you.

616
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,140
Have you shown this letter to Mr. Zhou?

617
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,210
It reads "To Teaching Assistant Xiao". Why would I show it to him?

618
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,450
Really?

619
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,910
Ask him if you don't believe me.

620
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,030
What?

621
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,680
Junior Zhou is here.

622
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,710
I want to be here too.

623
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,470
Song Zhu.

624
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,160
The repair hasn't been completed yet.

625
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,010
And the smell is strong.

626
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,600
You inhaled so much smoke not long ago.

627
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,330
It's not safe to go in.

628
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,040
Junior Zhou inhaled much smoke too.

629
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,400
Why can't I go in?

630
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:02,930
You can't.

631
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,650
Move.

632
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,170
Enough.

633
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,570
Fine.

634
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,640
Xiao Yu, let's wait and see.

635
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,320
I'll be waiting.

636
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,200
Just wait here.

637
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,790
I'll be waiting.

638
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:16,680
Just wait.

639
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,530
I'll be waiting for you.

640
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,010
Wait.

641
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,690
I'll be waiting.

642
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,570
You forgot your stuff.

643
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,790
I don't want it. It's yours.

644
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,420
It's your day off tomorrow.

645
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,520
If you're free, you should go out.

646
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,900
No need to stay in the academy.

647
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,000
There is action within knowledge,

648
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,250
and there is knowledge within action.

649
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:46,840
All right.

650
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,690
That's all for today's class.

651
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,530
Sir.

652
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:50,920
Let's go.

653
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,880
I have a question.

654
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,840
Qinruo, come with me.

655
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,520
Lady Jin, slow down.

656
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,690
Hurry up.

657
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,690
Coming.

658
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,990
I wasted my dim sum.

659
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,480
Yueniang.

660
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:08,850
Let's go.

661
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,700
Sister.

662
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,740
Go back first.

663
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,680
I'll go back later.

664
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,090
Okay.

665
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,290
Anything else?

666
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,570
No, nothing.

667
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,960
-Thank you, Mr. Chen.
-Thank you. Sir.

668
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,430
Okay.

669
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,360
Very beautiful.

670
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,850
By the way, how about having tea together tomorrow?

671
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,130
Sure.

672
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:30,940
Yueniang.

673
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,350
It's our day off tomorrow.

674
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,330
We plan to

675
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,170
have tea together in the dorm tonight.

676
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,120
Do you want to join us?

677
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,060
Yueniang.

678
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
-Join us.
-Join us.

679
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,170
That's right.

680
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:48,840
Join us.

681
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,070
If you don't come,

682
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,800
I'll get angry.

683
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:52,620
I'll be there.

684
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,500
We finally have a chance to party together.

685
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,470
Of course I'll be there.

686
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,480
I need to go home first.

687
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,020
See you tonight.

688
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,020
-Okay.
-Okay.

689
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,520
We should prepare more cakes and pastries tonight.

690
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:16,800
Mr. Zhou.

691
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,730
It's late.

692
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,200
Go back and rest early.

693
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,060
Okay.

694
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,020
Let's go, Mr. Xiao.

695
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,660
I...

696
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,070
I have something else to do.

697
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,610
It's okay. You go back first.

698
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,520
-Okay.
-I'll be right back.

699
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,190
Okay.

700
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,270
Young Master.

701
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,560
Where did you go during the daytime?

702
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,500
I couldn't find you.

703
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,620
Didn't you ask me to find a goose?

704
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,090
What I want is a white goose.

705
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,870
A big white goose.

706
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,110
It's all white.

707
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,190
Young Master.

708
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,510
You only said you want a goose.

709
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,770
You didn't say you want a white goose or a black goose.

710
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:59,660
Young Master.

711
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,400
I'll find you a white goose, okay?

712
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,730
Mr. Xiao.

713
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,350
I forgot my basin.

714
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,600
Let me get it for you.

715
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,200
Let me get it for you.

716
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:11,940
This one?

717
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:12,850
Yes.

718
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,450
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

719
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,820
Aren't you leaving?

720
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,590
It's okay.

721
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,730
I'll be right there.

722
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,650
You go first.

723
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,530
Then I'm leaving.

724
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:40,440
I heard that Song's Academy has a library.

725
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,240
I plan to go there and take a look tonight.

726
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,600
Young Master.

727
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
I've been there

728
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,890
during the daytime.

729
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,050
Many students come and go during the daytime.

730
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,010
It's not easy to do it.

731
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,300
I'll go there to gain more information tonight.

732
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,290
You're very active.

733
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,720
Is Teaching Assistant Xiao here?

734
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,720
Go hide over there.

735
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,260
You are still here.

736
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,449
Miss Zhu. Why are you here?

737
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,989
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

738
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,780
I've been thinking about it.

739
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,230
I should have talked to you nicely during the daytime.

740
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,400
I feel very guilty.

741
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:25,389
So I went home and brought you a pot of aged wine

742
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,730
to apologize to you.

743
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,800
Your behavior

744
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,520
really makes me

745
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,000
at a loss.

746
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:43,960
It's okay.

747
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,260
Take the wine back.

748
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,580
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

749
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,159
Are you afraid that I'll poison you?

750
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,440
No.

751
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,170
Why don't you go back first?

752
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,230
I don't want the wine.

753
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,350
Xiao Yu.

754
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,650
I think I was being too nice to you, right?

755
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,480
I apologized to you.

756
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,340
You didn't accept it. It's fine.

757
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,580
But you refused again and again.

758
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,320
Listen.

759
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,670
I won't give you the wine.

760
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:08,940
You...

761
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,160
What are you doing?

762
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,970
I just wanted to see

763
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,460
if you really came here to apologize sincerely.

764
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,920
It seems you came to apologize sincerely.

765
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,800
Then let go of me.

766
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,770
You should have done this earlier.

767
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,730
If you were like this earlier, I would have accepted it.

768
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,760
Why did you pretend to be a lady?

769
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,220
Say it again. Who pretended to be a lady?

770
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,320
Say it again! Say...

771
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,080
Okay.

772
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,010
You're a lady.

773
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,810
You are very beautiful

774
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,040
and gorgeous.

775
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,130
You are gentle and elegant.

776
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,490
Let's go outside.

777
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,210
Let's talk outside.

778
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,900
The kitchen is not safe.

779
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,870
Let me tell you.

780
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,250
I've given you the wine.

781
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,510
I've also apologized.

782
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,130
There is nothing to talk about between us.

783
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,390
Clean up your act.

784
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,720
Goodbye, Miss Zhu.

785
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,560
What's that sound?

786
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,490
What?

787
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,920
What sound?

788
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,490
I heard Yaya cackle.

789
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,650
I didn't hear any sound.

790
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,060
Yaya.

791
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,610
Look.

792
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,490
It's strange.

793
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,250
I did hear a goose cackle just now.

794
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,740
I told you that you heard it wrong.

795
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,650
Let's go.

796
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,130
You heard it wrong.

797
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,430
Go home and...

798
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,610
Go home and rest early.

799
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,370
Stop acting strange.

800
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,260
Alright.

801
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,490
We are even.

802
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,090
Bye.

803
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,790
Goodbye.

804
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,870
Miss Zhu

805
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,870
is too dangerous.

806
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:47,980
Young Master.

807
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,760
I think your behavior just now

808
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,500
is really scary.

809
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,320
What did you say?

810
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,480
Young Master. I said

811
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,430
I will go to the library tonight to find clues.

812
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,200
Young Master. If there's nothing else,

813
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,580
-I'll take my leave.
-Wait.

814
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,290
Did you say during the daytime,

815
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,370
many students come and go in the library?

816
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,610
It's not convenient for you to do it.

817
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,540
It will be too dangerous if you get caught.

818
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:20,840
I have an idea.

819
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,040
What's that?

820
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,940
I have my own way.

821
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,490
But

822
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,770
I need you

823
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,180
to do something for me.

824
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,670
I'm willing to do anything for you.

825
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,940
I was punished to repair the kitchen.

826
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
Before I finish repairing it,

827
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,520
my teacher won't let me leave here easily.

828
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,780
You can come and help me repair it at night.

829
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,090
There is not much work.

830
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,050
You just need to

831
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,620
paint four walls.

832
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:46,630
Everything needed is there.

833
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,300
Only...

834
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,530
Only four walls are left to be painted?

835
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,800
If you think it's not proper,

836
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,240
you can remove them

837
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,040
and paint them again.

838
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,540
And don't forget to help me find a goose.

839
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,370
But there are only four walls.

840
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,420
Mr. Xiao. Why are you looking at me like that?

841
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,200
It's creepy.

842
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,560
This...

843
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:05,770
This...

844
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,220
This...

845
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,150
How did you manage to get it into the academy?

846
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:09,990
It doesn't matter.

847
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,470
Come on. Let's have a drink.

848
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,260
Mr. Xiao.

849
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,790
Drinking wine is forbidden in the academy.

850
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,840
You are still receiving punishment.

851
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,290
If you get caught again,

852
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm afraid it won't end well.

853
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:24,720
Moreover,

854
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,040
what if

855
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,570
you are kicked out of the academy?

856
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,090
Mr. Zhou,

857
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,700
don't worry.

858
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,670
It's in the middle of the night now.

859
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,120
And it's our day off tomorrow.

860
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,620
No one will see us.

861
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,440
Besides, it's just the two of us now.

862
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,130
Neither of us will tell anyone else,

863
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,240
right?

864
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,500
Well...

865
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,480
Mr. Zhou.

866
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,130
Don't worry.

867
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,920
If anything goes wrong,

868
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,050
I will take the responsibility.

869
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,350
I won't get you implicated.

870
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,010
Mr. Zhou.

871
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,100
You worked hard in the afternoon.

872
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,330
You should drink some.

873
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,350
It's not proper.

874
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Trust me.

875
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,310
No one will come here today.
