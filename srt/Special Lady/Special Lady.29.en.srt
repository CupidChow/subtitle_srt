00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,960
[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,800
[Episode 29]

4
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,120
Let's go. Hurry up.

5
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,710
-Let's go. -Hurry up.

6
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,430
It's so vivid.

7
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,150
It will definitely be sold at a good price later.

8
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,850
Whom did you draw?

9
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,670
It looks so ugly.

10
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,030
Doesn't it look like you?

11
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,720
It does look like you.

12
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,490
Why can't I be Xiao Yu?

13
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,310
Zhou Ji.

14
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,760
Xiao, do you have something to say?

15
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,070
Why did you treat Zhu like that today?

16
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,230
What do you mean?

17
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,640
You could just bear

18
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,520
to see her suffer humiliation in front of so many people?

19
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,830
I don't think there were any problems

20
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,070
with what I did today.

21
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,800
Are you still upset

22
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,500
about the engagement?

23
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,350
Xiao, do you have anything else to say?

24
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,940
We're already trying to solve the problem of the engagement.

25
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,110
This is a letter about cancelling the engagement written by Dean Song.

26
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,329
The relationship between Xiao Yu and Song Zhu

27
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,950
will be over soon.

28
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,470
What does it have to do with me?

29
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,590
What do you mean?

30
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,710
You like Song Zhu, don't you?

31
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,310
So I have to like her forever?

32
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,590
What do you mean?

33
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,030
Senior Song took the initiative to pursue me,

34
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,720
so I was a bit interested in her.

35
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:55,060
Zhou Ji.

36
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,460
What do you mean?

37
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,550
It means literally.

38
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,280
I think I've made it clear.

39
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,209
Senior Song should know her place.

40
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,730
You're just like her.

41
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,890
Both of you are impulsive.

42
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,240
Don't be so ungrateful.

43
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,400
Xiao, what's your identity now by saying these words to me?

44
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,080
You like her,

45
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,070
so you've stood up for her?

46
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,070
What a joke.

47
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,840
You're just being sanctimonious.

48
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,790
Do you dare to say it again?

49
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,110
I used to think that

50
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,980
I shouldn't think too much about the relationship between you and her.

51
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,190
But now it seems

52
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,110
that's the truth.

53
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,070
Xiao Yu,

54
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,430
I'll tell you one last time.

55
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,470
No matter what the relationship between you and her is,

56
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,150
from now on,

57
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,070
neither of you should interfere in my life!

58
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,990
Xiao, Zhou.

59
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,190
Let's go and play with crickets.

60
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,550
They don't want to play with crickets.

61
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,230
Let’s go.

62
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,790
-Let’s go.
-No.

63
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,110
Why is there blood on Zhou's face?

64
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,170
Let's go.

65
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,550
What should she do?

66
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,909
How can Miss Zhu face other people in the future after this incident?

67
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,370
How can she get married?

68
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,500
Mr. Li, you don't have to worry about that.

69
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,070
Though no other men want her,

70
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,830
I want her.

71
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,320
He's so nice to Zhu.

72
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,960
-I'm envious. -They are such a good match.

73
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm the one who's engaged to Zhu.

74
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,430
I'm also the one who will protect her in the future.

75
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,700
Silly man.

76
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,310
Shh!

77
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,150
Xiao Yu, don't you think you're childish?

78
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,190
How do you know it's me?

79
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,909
I can feel it.

80
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,550
You can feel it?

81
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,690
Can you feel that it's me?

82
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,050
I...

83
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,640
I can feel it.

84
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,070
Well,

85
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,030
we'd better not be so childish.

86
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,780
Weren't you the one who did something so childish first?

87
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,270
Why did you leave so early today?

88
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,110
Nothing.

89
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,270
Because...

90
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,670
Because...

91
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,630
As you know, the atmosphere at school is very depressing.

92
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,730
I might as well come out for a walk.

93
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,560
Is it because of Miss Yan?

94
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,830
No.

95
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,909
I know her well

96
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,789
and understand her.

97
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,309
It's reasonable for her to be angry with me.

98
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,630
I'm fine now.

99
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,030
Don't worry about me.

100
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,710
I'm really fine.

101
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,630
Okay.

102
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,430
Let's go eat peach mustard pastries.

103
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,460
Okay!

104
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,940
Peach mustard pastries!

105
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,920
Hurry up, Short Legs.

106
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,560
Hurry up.

107
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,500
-Wait for me.
-Hurry up.

108
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,840
Junior Zhou.

109
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,490
Senior Yan.

110
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,250
Sorry to keep you waiting.

111
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,550
Is there

112
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,860
anything wrong with my dress today?

113
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,910
It's just that

114
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,510
I've never observed you so carefully before.

115
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,450
You're just like a figure in a painting,

116
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,070
and you're like an angel in the mortal world.

117
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,140
I'm flattered, Junior Zhou.

118
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,000
I merely selected this dress casually.

119
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,110
I'm sorry

120
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,390
for my imprudence.

121
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,900
Please forgive me.

122
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,560
It's all right.

123
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,990
We are friends.

124
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,460
There is no need for you to be so nervous.

125
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,750
By the way,

126
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,950
I came in a hurry previously,

127
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,320
so I lack the pigments of several colors now.

128
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,780
If you don't mind,

129
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,170
please accompany me to buy some pigments.

130
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,750
Okay. Let's go.

131
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,870
Senior Yan, please.

132
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,710
You'll treat me to the pastries?

133
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,590
I'll treat you to the pastries if I want to.

134
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,690
If I don't want to, I...

135
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,730
Senior Yan.

136
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:34,830
Let's go.

137
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,470
Now I don't want to eat them.

138
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,390
Let me send you back home.

139
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,230
Let's go.

140
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,360
Junior Zhou.

141
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,610
Can you pretend to be my boyfriend?

142
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,640
I've thought about it for a long time.

143
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,760
It's surprising that Yueniang lied to us like that.

144
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,270
I'm really angry.

145
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,800
But if we can pretend that we're dating each other,

146
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,820
I think they will be like us.

147
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,400
What do you think?

148
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,590
Okay.

149
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,600
Actually, I...

150
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,770
The pigment stall is over there.

151
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,170
Let's go over there.

152
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Watch out, Senior Yan!

153
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
Junior Zhou!

154
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,490
Junior Zhou, are you all right?

155
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,210
I'm fine.

156
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,960
But I'm worried about you.

157
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,190
Sorry for my rudeness just now.

158
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,070
Please forgive me.

159
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,050
You're already like this. Why do you still care about me?

160
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,640
I'm glad that you're fine.

161
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,990
Can anyone help us?

162
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,020
Why are you just standing there and watching us?

163
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,080
Let me help you up.

164
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,060
Why did you come here?

165
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,270
Right.

166
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,950
Why did I come here?

167
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,110
No.

168
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,470
Just now, I said that

169
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,930
I didn't want to eat the pastries.

170
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,140
So, there's nothing wrong

171
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,000
with me coming here.

172
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,350
Song Zhu.

173
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,350
Do you feel upset now?

174
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,110
Yes.

175
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,160
Yes, I do.

176
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,950
I feel upset now.

177
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,280
Xiao Yu.

178
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,270
I was the one who hurt Qinruo first.

179
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,430
So no matter what she does,

180
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,230
I should put up with it, right?

181
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,000
They have done that to you.

182
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,980
Why do you still care about them?

183
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:46,680
Can you stop

184
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,030
taking the blame for everything?

185
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,430
How can I not take the blame?

186
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,430
I...

187
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,480
I've tried my best not to take the blame.

188
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,750
I...

189
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,550
I've tried my best to stop taking the blame.

190
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,150
Don't I look like doing that?

191
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,330
I...

192
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,650
I didn't care at all just now.

193
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,940
Xiao Yu, I didn't care at all just now.

194
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,750
I didn't care at all just now.

195
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,310
You did well.

196
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,360
I'm fine now.

197
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,700
I'm really fine now.

198
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,060
Let's go eat something delicious.

199
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm hungry now.

200
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,950
So...

201
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,500
So soon?

202
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,110
I mean it.

203
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,470
You'll eat delicious food with me, won't you?

204
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,540
Let's go. I'm really fine now.

205
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,550
He didn't hurt his bones.

206
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,450
It's just a minor injury.

207
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,170
He'll get better in a few days.

208
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,400
Doctor, please prescribe the best medicine for him.

209
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,630
No matter how much it costs,

210
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,170
don't let him get any scars.

211
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,850
Don't worry.

212
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,230
I've used the best medicine for him.

213
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,150
You can come back to change the dressing in seven days.

214
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,600
Thank you, doctor.

215
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,470
Alright.

216
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,070
Senior Yan,

217
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,910
you don't have to spend so much money to treat my injury.

218
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,910
Don't say that.

219
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,240
You got hurt because you tried to save me.

220
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,190
Besides,

221
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,570
if I didn't do this,

222
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,550
I wouldn't know how to repay your kindness.

223
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,910
Speaking of which,

224
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,990
I was the one who asked you out today.

225
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,420
Because of that, this accident happened.

226
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,950
It was all my fault.

227
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,140
But it seems that

228
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,190
it's not the first time that you've saved me.

229
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,900
It's what I should do.

230
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,660
I shouldn't have said those words just now.

231
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,890
It was a bit abrupt

232
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,520
to ask you to be my boyfriend.

233
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,150
I...

234
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,070
I'm willing to be your boyfriend.

235
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,230
If I can make you

236
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,650
less worried by doing this,

237
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,610
I'm willing to do so.

238
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,830
Thank you.

239
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,310
Senior Yan.

240
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,930
Feiniang is timid.

241
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,670
If she knows that I'm injured,

242
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,110
I think she'll be worried.

243
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,490
Could you please not tell her?

244
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,550
But you...

245
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,070
I'm fine being alone.

246
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,790
Don't worry.

247
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,070
I'll come to look after you, too.

248
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,990
Don't bother, Senior Yan.

249
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,190
You got hurt because of me.

250
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,030
It's my duty to do something for you.

251
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,990
Sir, your medicine.

252
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:41,910
Thanks.

253
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,610
Thank you.

254
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,830
Thank you for your hard work today.

255
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,190
Please go back and rest early.

256
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,230
Give me the medicine.

257
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,800
Now you only have one hand that is available.

258
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,300
How can you decoct the herbs yourself?

259
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,380
Just let me do it.

260
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:11,609
Well...

261
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,760
Don't stand on ceremony.

262
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,120
I'm giving you the stuff.

263
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,670
If there's nothing else, I have to go back now.

264
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:35,960
Be careful on the way.

265
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,240
Li.

266
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,150
Catch up with him.

267
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,190
Wait for me!

268
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,680
Hurry up!

269
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,520
Wait for me!

270
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,600
You're awake.

271
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,070
Senior Yan.

272
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,810
You...

273
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,570
You started to wait here early in the morning?

274
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,750
I noticed that you hadn't woken up,

275
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,520
so I stood in front of the door for a while.

276
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,780
You didn't have to do this.

277
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,070
You could have knocked on the door to wake me up.

278
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,910
You didn't have to wait in front of the door.

279
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,470
Come in, please.

280
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,720
Senior Yan, have a seat.

281
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,550
Thank you.

282
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,350
I've brought you some breakfast.

283
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,140
Have breakfast first.

284
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,750
Then take the medicine.

285
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,390
The doctor has said that

286
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,750
you can't take this medicine on an empty stomach.

287
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,830
Senior Yan.

288
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,590
You don't have to be so nice to me.

289
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,670
I...

290
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,990
I don't know how to repay your kindness.

291
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,510
You got hurt because you tried to save me.

292
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,340
If you don't let me do something for you,

293
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,290
I'll feel even guiltier.

294
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,070
Just eat.

295
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,230
You should eat, too.

296
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,750
Look at you.

297
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,750
The corners of your mouth are full of food.

298
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,750
Xiao Yu, what are you doing?

299
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,390
Nothing.

300
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,310
I'm not doing anything.

301
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,460
Nothing. Let's go.

302
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,220
Let's go.

303
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,630
Let's go.

304
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,430
Let go of...

305
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,510
Let's go.

306
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,690
Where are we going?

307
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,550
Let's go to

308
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,550
the beverage shop.

309
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,310
Why are we going to the beverage shop so early in the morning?

310
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,560
I'm thirsty. Let's go.

311
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,270
If you have some beverages early in the morning,

312
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,070
aren't you afraid that you'll have diarrhea?

313
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,990
No, I'm not afraid of that.

314
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,130
Let's go.

315
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:10,760
Senior Yan.

316
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,670
Sorry for my rudeness just now.

317
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,120
It's all right.

318
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,350
I was the one who made this suggestion.

319
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,120
But it was hard for you.

320
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,730
You needed to pretend to be intimate with me.

321
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,280
Qinruo.

322
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,470
Well...

323
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,520
The medicine is a little cold now.

324
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,060
I'll take it to the kitchen and heat it up for you.

325
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,680
What's wrong with you?

326
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,150
You look weird today.

327
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,230
You were the one who asked me out,

328
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,220
but you look so weird now.

329
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,750
There's nothing special.

330
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,100
I didn't sleep well last night.

331
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,160
You're lying.

332
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,840
There must be something.

333
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,350
You...

334
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,030
Don't you think that Yan Qinruo

335
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,400
was too proactive towards Zhou Ji yesterday?

336
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,910
So you're thinking about that?

337
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,710
Do you still have feelings for Qinruo...

338
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:00,930
No.

339
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,550
You misunderstood it.

340
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,530
Hearing what you said, how could I not misunderstand it?

341
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,330
Is Zhou Ji the one whom you have feelings for?

342
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,110
Are you crazy?

343
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,870
Then why have you thought about this matter for such a long time?

344
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,610
Haven't you thought about it?

345
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,980
I already finished thinking about it yesterday.

346
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,570
Are you sick?

347
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,530
You are the one who is sick.

348
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,240
Let me tell you. If you're sick, you need to take medicine,

349
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,660
and you can't think too much.

350
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,840
It's true.

351
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,240
Forget it.

352
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,750
Mr. Zhou, let me help you.

353
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,440
Don't bother, Senior Yan.

354
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
I can do it myself.

355
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,750
You got hurt because of me.

356
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,270
But I didn't take good care of you.

357
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,870
It's not like that, Senior Yan.

358
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,670
Look.

359
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,570
I can bandage the wound well by myself.

360
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,870
But the more you say like that,

361
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,440
the guiltier I feel.

362
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,160
It's okay, Senior Yan.

363
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,630
It's just a minor injury.

364
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,140
I'll recover in a few days.

365
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,020
Don't worry about it.

366
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,660
By the way,

367
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,060
this. one..

368
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,540
This...

369
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,400
This is...

370
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
I've found

371
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,790
this bracelet for you.

372
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,700
Thank you.

373
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,620
Thank you.

374
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,050
I haven't drawn the picture I promised you to paint.

375
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,220
I... I'll do it now.

376
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,540
I'll do it now.

377
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,880
I'll do it now.

378
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,750
I'll do it now.

379
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,180
I’ll do it now.

380
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,340
Alright, Mr. Zhou.

381
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,540
You should take a good rest now.

382
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,100
Your Highness.

383
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,760
Your Highness.

384
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,830
Don't panic. I'm fine.

385
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,330
You may leave.

386
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,360
Don't tell anyone

387
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,500
about my coughing.

388
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,460
Yes.

389
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,780
Your Highness, take good care of yourself.

390
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,610
Let's get down to business.

391
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,490
Your Highness,

392
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,260
I've found that

393
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,890
the corruption case is related to the tax loopholes.

394
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,500
In my previous investigation, I found that

395
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,420
the donated money which the academies distributed to the students

396
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,340
returned to Li Shancai's residence again through Zhao Shoucai.

397
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,930
Therefore, I sneaked into Li Mansion at night

398
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,100
and found the account book with the records of the incomes of donated money.

399
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,090
According to the names of the merchants in the account book,

400
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,460
I found those merchants who donated the money.

401
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,780
I tracked them and found that

402
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,980
those merchants made a deal with Li Shancai.

403
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,810
They got the money they had donated

404
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,770
in a small house in the suburbs

405
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,140
so as to achieve the purpose of tax evasion.

406
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,120
I can confirm that in this case, Duke Yue took the lead

407
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,300
and Li Shancai wrapped it up.

408
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,100
There might be a bigger mastermind behind this conspiracy.

409
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,130
Many people are involved.

410
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,860
To avoid alerting the enemies,

411
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,540
I didn't enter that small house.

412
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,580
I suspect that

413
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,420
the account book about the expenditures is hidden there.

414
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,020
This account book is a handwritten copy.

415
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,300
I think Uncle Hu sent it with the letter

416
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,070
after he copied the original version.

417
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,020
With the annual 10,000 taels of gold,

418
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,860
they've evaded taxes like this.

419
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,300
The National Treasury is short of money now.

420
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,540
We also have both internal and external problems.

421
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,050
These corrupt officials

422
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,410
even colluded with merchants

423
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,370
to evade taxes.

424
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,090
A few days ago,

425
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,380
Song Yang, the new Number One Scholar,

426
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,490
put forward an idea in the imperial court.

427
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,220
It's about tax reform.

428
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,140
Wan Li was the first one who objected to it.

429
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,020
It showed his wild ambition.

430
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,660
The tax reform

431
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,820
will cut off their source of making a fortune.

432
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,980
Therefore,

433
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,890
tax reform is what we must do.

434
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,820
I've heard that most of the officials who have been promoted recently

435
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,300
used to be Song Xu's students.

436
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,140
Besides,

437
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,250
Song Xu has been in contact with Zhao Wenlang through letters recently.

438
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,730
The person who suggested tax reform

439
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,060
is the son of Song Xu,

440
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,540
but

441
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,140
it's still hard to figure out his true intention now.

442
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,420
This person seems more important now.

443
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,580
If he can participate in the reform,

444
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,220
things will be much easier.

445
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,580
Otherwise,

446
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,610
it'll be more difficult to carry out the reform.

447
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,020
Your Highness,

448
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,010
what are we going to do next?

449
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,740
We'll start with

450
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,700
one of Li Shancai's son.

451
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,660
Then we will make them lose thoroughly.

452
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,950
As for Song Xu,

453
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,550
let's see the scenery in the south by that time.

454
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,620
Mr. Zhang.

455
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,960
Can you let me copy the name list

456
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,590
and accounting records about the students of the academy

457
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,930
who received the donated money this year?

458
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,780
That's strange.

459
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,660
Why does Duke Yue want the name list

460
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,650
-and accounting records about the students who received the donated money?
-Why do you want to copy these records?

461
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,210
I want to contact the students who received the donated money,

462
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,060
and ask them to write about their feelings for the Yiyang Academy.

463
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,630
Why are you being so sneaky here?

464
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,380
Nothing.

465
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,480
I went back to the Teachers' Office and found that there was a guest inside.

466
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,820
I'll give your books to them as gifts.

467
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,710
What do you think, Mr. Zhang?

468
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,820
So it's Duke Yue.

469
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,580
Let's go.

470
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,530
What?

471
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,830
As a teaching assistant, why are you afraid of seeing him?

472
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,070
Besides, you've seen Duke Yue before, haven't you?

473
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,060
Let's go and say hello to him.

474
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,750
No need.

475
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,620
What?

476
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,710
Wait for me.

477
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,410
This is the account book about the donation records.

478
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,740
Please read it.

479
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,420
Okay.

480
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,140
There are many people recorded in this book.

481
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,290
I'm afraid it'll take some time.

482
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,780
No hurry.

483
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,500
Take your time to copy the records.

484
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,340
I'll go arrange the self-study sessions for the students first.

485
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,620
I'll come back to accompany you later.

486
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,260
Mr. Zhang, please continue with your work.

487
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,500
I'll wait for you here.

488
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,300
Okay.

489
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,020
Duke Yue, please help yourself.

490
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,500
The tea, brushes and ink are all here.

491
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,510
Please help yourself.

492
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,020
You're so kind.

493
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,710
[Account Book]

494
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,570
Why do I feel that you are weird every day?

495
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,410
What is so weird about me?

496
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,160
It's quite weird that you're avoiding Duke Yue.

497
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,390
Look.

498
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,220
Why are there two people?

499
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,730
Look.

500
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,540
Who would come to such a hidden place?

501
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,760
Don't care about that.

502
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,290
Anyway, they're definitely not female students.

503
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,020
Except me,

504
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,880
no female students would come here to play.

505
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,130
Now it's class time at the Men's Academy.

506
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,310
They must be female students.

507
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,780
I don't think they're female students.

508
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,070
I think maybe

509
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,490
Xue Hanfu and Ding Miao are catching crickets there.

510
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,580
Let's make a bet.

511
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:11,820
Okay.

512
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,700
If they're students from the Men's Academy, I'll lose.

513
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,620
I'll buy you some peach mustard pastries.

514
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,460
If they're students from the Women's Academy, you'll lose.

515
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,060
You'll have to buy me a bottle of wine.

516
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,410
Okay.

517
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,390
See you at the back mountain later.

518
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,060
Okay.

519
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,820
Now it's class time at the Men's Academy.

520
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,940
You'll definitely lose.

521
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,380
Not necessarily.

522
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,110
Don't look at it.

523
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,090
What are you doing? Let me see.

524
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,620
Don't look at it.

525
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,540
Qinruo.

526
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,820
Give me a chance

527
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,140
to let me take care of you.

528
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,270
It's just an illusion.

529
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,139
Mr. Zhou.

530
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,460
I know that

531
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,440
you were faking it just now.

532
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,060
-It was all fake.
-I wasn't faking it.

533
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,550
I've really fallen in love with you.

534
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,739
Give me a chance.

535
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,940
Do you want to cry?

536
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:45,040
Just cry. It's okay.

537
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,219
I'll let you lean on my shoulder.

538
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,380
My face feels so hot.

539
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,239
How come I feel so hot for no reason

540
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,090
after I saw a scene like that?

541
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,429
How embarrassing.

542
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,240
It's so hot.

543
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,220
You...

544
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,280
Are you sick because you're so angry?

545
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,500
This is too fast.

546
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,940
Are you okay?

547
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,810
Don't follow me.

548
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,130
I need to be alone and calm down.

549
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,970
It was all fake.

550
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,780
Besides, you know that

551
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,780
Yueniang likes you.

552
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,950
She also knows that you used to like Xiao.

553
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,520
But what about now?

554
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,860
Besides, there has been no

555
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,610
special relationship between Senior Song and I.

556
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,980
Or

557
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,030
are you actually still caring about her?

558
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,810
Mr. Zhou,

559
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,170
I have something to do. I have to go.

560
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,110
Why did we come across Zhou Ji right at that place?

561
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,210
I lost in the betting.

562
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,290
I should have beaten him up there

563
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,220
to teach him a lesson for his imprudence.

564
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,420
All of you will be able to buy the pastries.

565
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,330
Don't push or shove.

566
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,140
If I can't buy the peach mustard pastries,

567
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,910
she'll scold me again.

568
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,470
Come out.

569
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,650
Don't be childish.

570
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,420
I knew you'd be here.

571
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,060
See what I've brought you.

572
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,150
You admit defeat by doing this.

573
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,810
Don't tell anyone about it.

574
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,260
I really don't understand.

575
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,130
Actually, I don't understand, either.

576
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,060
I mean the wine.

577
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,090
I really don't understand

578
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,160
as the wine tastes so terrible,

579
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,930
why

580
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,330
there are still some people who love drinking it so much.

581
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,400
Haven't you heard of a saying?

582
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,550
It's "Getting drunk to relieve sorrows".

583
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,730
I've also heard the saying that if you get drunk to drown your sorrows, you'll feel sadder instead.

584
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,180
Today,

585
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,860
you saw that man and that woman

586
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,380
doing that thing.

587
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,920
Are you sure that you're fine?

588
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,720
Do you think what I said in the restaurant on that day were just some words said by me in a dream?

589
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,140
I saw both of them there today.

590
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,480
I was really surprised.

591
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,340
But besides that,

592
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,850
I had no other feelings.

593
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,660
If Qinruo can be happy,

594
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,730
I think I'll be glad.

595
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,860
At least, among the four of us,

596
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,420
someone didn't lose.

597
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,540
I don't understand the concepts of winning and losing in love.

598
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,210
However, as long as you feel relieved,

599
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,730
I'll be happy.

600
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,740
Talking about the knowledge of love

601
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,680
with men like you is such a difficult task.

602
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,100
I didn't understand, so I asked you.

603
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,450
About the phrase you mentioned last time,

604
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,660
it seems to be "infatuation and imagination".

605
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,640
Right. What does it mean?

606
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,250
I asked Jin Xiaoyue secretly.

607
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,880
She said that

608
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,290
when a person likes someone,

609
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,230
he'll eat what that person likes to eat.

610
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,770
Are you okay?

611
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,040
I'm fine. I choked on this pastry.

612
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,210
Go ahead. I'm fine.

613
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,540
Go ahead.

614
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,100
He will also

615
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,570
do what that person likes to do.

616
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,660
What do you like to do?

617
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,370
I like

618
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,750
Cuju and archery.

619
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,770
Anyway,

620
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,850
he'll change himself

621
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,680
for that person.

622
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,760
What have you changed?

623
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,390
I like reading now. Does it count?

624
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,060
No.

625
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,520
So, I've gradually realized that

626
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,420
my feelings for Zhou Ji cannot be considered as love.

627
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,300
Then I'm relieved.

628
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,350
I still didn't know how to tell you about it.

629
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,500
What did you want to tell me?

630
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,620
I've asked Zhou Ji.

631
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,690
He said he had never liked you.

632
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,590
Really?

633
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,150
That's great.

634
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,620
If you're fine,

635
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,340
I'm relieved.

636
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,340
As I'm thinking about it now,

637
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,090
you're quite handsome

638
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,820
when you don't talk.

639
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,290
As I'm thinking about it now,

640
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,900
it's kind of good

641
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,100
to marry you.

642
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,430
What did you say?

643
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,380
It's...

644
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,690
It's kind of good

645
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,940
to marry you.
