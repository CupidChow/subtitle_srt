[Prince Fu's Mansion]

5
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,600
What if he is determined to marry Song Zhu?

6
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,789
How dare he!

7
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,670
If he is really that disobedient,

8
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,970
I won't see him as my son anymore.

9
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,820
And I won't let him be a viscount.

10
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,250
You can have these.

11
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,660
I wanted to say goodbye to His Highness and Her Highness in person,

12
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,520
but I saw them having a discussion

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,060
so I don't want to interrupt them.

14
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,280
Guard Yu, when it's convenient for you,

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,480
please tell His Highness and Her Highness that I've left.

16
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,520
Father.

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,290
Let me help you.

18
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,440
Father.

19
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,260
Why are you being so good today?

20
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,520
Father.

21
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,810
You did a great thing for the people

22
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,640
in the court today.

23
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,890
That's why you're pleasing me here?

24
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,470
No.

25
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,930
I admire you.

26
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,520
Good.

27
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,900
Father.

28
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,040
Thank you.

29
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,420
Let me thank you on behalf of the crown prince.

30
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,590
You've fulfilled his last wish.

31
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,450
Thank you, Father.

32
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,329
Lunch is ready.

33
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,640
Let's have lunch.

34
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,480
Let me ask Yueniang to come.

35
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,190
Yan.

36
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,240
No need to do that.

37
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,380
She has left.

38
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,370
She has left?

39
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,180
When?

40
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,860
She said she would wait for me and we would pick up Mr. Song

41
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,590
and go back to Yiyang together.

42
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,140
Yan.

43
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,110
You haven't eaten yet. Where are you going?

44
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,970
I'm not eating.

45
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,990
It's no use sighing.

46
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,450
Well...

47
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,830
Don't I need to have lunch?

48
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,800
Why did she leave suddenly?

49
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,130
She said she would wait for me to come back.

50
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,390
Did my parents say anything to her?

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,839
I have no idea.

52
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,990
I only saw Miss Song Zhu

53
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,400
get out of the side hall with the farewell gifts

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,200
and go back to the room after a while.

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,420
She didn't give the gifts to His Highness and Her Highness.

56
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,820
-Get me a carriage.
-Yes.

57
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,070
Yuniang, let's hang the lanterns together.

58
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,430
Okay.

59
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,630
Rongniang, Yuniang.

60
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,720
-Mother.
-Go with me to worship our ancestors.

61
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,510
Thanks to God's blessing,

62
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,430
your father, Li, Yang, and the teachers

63
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,950
are all safe.

64
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,210
Yes.

65
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,430
It's all thanks to our Third Sister.

66
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,920
Why did Mother say it was thanks to God's blessing?

67
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,650
Just listen to her.

68
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,550
What are you two murmuring?

69
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,220
Nothing.

70
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,430
Let me tell you.

71
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,380
You should be in awe of the gods.

72
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,480
You should do...

73
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,360
Do...

74
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,610
Pilot acts.

75
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,270
Pilot acts?

76
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,560
According to what I know

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,280
about Mother's vocabulary,

78
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,570
I think she meant pious acts.

79
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,350
Darling.

80
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,920
Honey.

81
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,500
Please stride the brazier

82
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,810
to get rid of bad luck.

83
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,280
Honey.

84
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,570
Darling.

85
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,950
Just do it.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,590
Okay.

87
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,550
Here.

88
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,780
Okay.

89
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,800
Okay.

90
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,830
Yan.

91
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,540
I know you're angry with your father but you should eat.

92
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,820
Yan.

93
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,710

00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,970
You're making me blush.

00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,600
You look cute when you blush.

Are you still angry?

167
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
I'm not angry.

168
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,720
I'm not angry about what they said.

169
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,450
I just wanted to see my father as soon as possible.

170
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,370
Okay.

171
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,660
But what your parents said

172
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
still made me feel a little unhappy.

173
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,240
I'm sorry that what they said made you feel bad.

174
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,790
I felt bad.

175
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,650
But

176
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,550
I won't back down.

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,580
Besides,

178
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,950
I believe you can handle it well.

179
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,030
Look, you're here.

180
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,710
Yueniang, you may rest assured.

181
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,240
I will treat you well.

182
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,280
And your parents may also rest assured.

183
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,120
In my life,

184
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,100
I will only marry you.

185
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,570
How do you know

186
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,520
my parents will let us get married?

187
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm confident of it.

188
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,380
Dean Song has always thought highly of me.

189
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:52,990
Mother.

190
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,760
What brings you here?

191
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,190
Greetings, Your Highness.

192
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,220
I forgot to introduce her to you just now.

193
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,090
This is Lin Qing'er, daughter of the incumbent Imperial Preceptor.

194
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,090
Your father and I have decided on her as your fiancée.

195
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,540
This is unacceptable.

196
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,930
I will never marry any other woman.

197
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,610
It's not up to you.

198
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,970
Mrs. Song.

199
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,380
Can I talk to my mother alone?

200
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,530
Let's leave.

201
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,230
Princess Fu, Viscount.

202
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,460
I'll take my leave.

203
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,680
Mother.

204
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,060
Yueniang.

205
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,080
I don't want life to be hard for you in the future.

206
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,810
How about...

207
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,100
Mother.

208
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,060
This is my business.

209
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,460
Let me take care of it.

210
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,610
Okay.

211
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,610
I'll let you handle it.

212
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,500
Yueniang.

213
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,740
I support you and you can pursue your happiness.

214
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,870
But I also don't want life to be hard for you in the future.

215
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,290
I'll always support you.

216
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,890
I'm always on your side.

217
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,190
Mother, let me talk to her.

218
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,630
Your name is Lin Qing'er?

219
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,390
You are Song Zhu?

220
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,250
Yes, you can also call me Zhu.

221
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,480
Zhu?

222
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
You can also call me Qing'er.

223
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,830
Qing'er, let's go out for a walk.

224
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,570
Let's go. I'll show you around the academy.

225
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,050
Okay.

226
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,340
Don't worry, Mother.

227
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,540
Mother.

228
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,270
You know my feelings for Yueniang.

229
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,470
Don't force me to marry any other woman.

230
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,540
How about this?

231
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,540
Yan.

232
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,800
How about we both make a concession?

233
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,550
I can let you marry Song Zhu,

234
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,890
but she can only be your concubine.

235
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,420
Only a girl of noble birth like Lin Qing'er

236
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,260
can be your wife.

237
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,400
No.

238
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,550
I told you that my wife could only be Song Zhu.

239
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,750
If you force me to marry any other woman,

240
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,780
I'll marry into the Song family

241
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,800
and be a son-in-law that lives with the Song family.

242
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,760
And my name will be changed into Song Yan.

243
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,710
What?

244
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,349
You're a viscount.

245
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,450
How can you marry into her family?

246
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,050
If you do that,

247
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,820
you'll never be allowed to come back home

248
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,810
and you're not my son anymore.

249
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,170
This place is called Luwen Hall

250
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,060
where Chen Yan and I had the first battle.

251
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,490
I hated him so much at that time.

252
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,390
Take a seat.

253
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,770
This is the place

254
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,120
where Chen Yan and I

255
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,550
watched fireworks together for the first time.

256
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,240
There.

257
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,640
This is the place

258
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,300
where Chen Yan and I told each other our feelings for each other.

259
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,530
Mother.

260
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,200
You don't know what to do now?

261
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,330
Are you testing me?

262
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,610
You're silly.

263
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,270
Your acting was so good.

264
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
You're Prince Fu's son, a viscount.

265
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,450
You're so in love with that girl.

266
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,170
I have to come and see

267
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,680
how much you love each other.

268
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,900
So you'll allow me to marry her.

269
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,500
That's because she didn't back down.

270
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,650
She has won my trust.

271
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,960
She

272
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,190
is really like me when I was young.

273
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,610
I think

274
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,040
it won't be bad

275
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,040
if I let her take care of everything in the mansion.

276
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,620
She is the girl that I love.

277
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,820
Of course she's a wonderful girl.

278
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:45,730
What about

279
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,810
Lin Qing'er?

280
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,520
She didn't want to marry you in the first place.

281
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,400
Anything else?

282
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,730
Are there any more interesting stories between you and him?

283
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,600
You seem to enjoy those stories very much.

284
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,330
Because they're interesting.

285
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,480
Actually,

286
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,290
I didn't mean to make you break up.

287
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,400
I was curious.

288
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,690
Curious?

289
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,280
I was curious about the girl

290
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,210
who the viscount loves so much

291
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,540
that he would give up everything for her.

292
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,500
You're just an ordinary girl.

293
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,130
Yes.

294
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,730
I'm an ordinary girl.

295
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,470
Your Highness.

296
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,760
Qing'er, see you.

297
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,800
See you.

298
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,780
It seems you two get along well.

299
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,420
Looks like you've persuaded your mother.

300
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,880
Anyway,

301
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,280
we've finally overcome all the difficulties.

302
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,400
Not really.

303
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,540
Don't you know the family rules of the Song family?

304
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,600
What family rules?

305
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,290
Have a guess.

306
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:08,930
I don't remember your family has family rules.

307
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:09,530
Wait.

308
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,540
Don't come over.

309
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,130
How can you throw it at me?

310
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,890
How dare you!

311
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,110
Stop!

312
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,170
Don't run.

313
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,810
Catch me.

314
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,250
Catch me.

315
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,070
Uncle Dai, where is my father?

316
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Mr. Song has gone to the Dean's Room.

317
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,210
My father is not here.

318
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,370
Let's go see your mother first.

319
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,230
Mrs. Song has gone to the academy.

320
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,360
Why is my mother in the academy?

321
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,250
She said she wanted to take a walk around the Women's Academy.

322
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,290
Thank you, Uncle Dai.

323
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,840
My mother never went to the academy before.

324
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,240
It's okay. Let's split up and find them.

325
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,750
Brother, where's Mother?

326
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,690
She just left.

327
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,120
Just left?

328
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Where did he go?

329
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,470
I don't know.

330
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,000
It's strange.

331
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,440
My parents won't be away from home for long.

332
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,150
They're neither in the hall nor at the study.

333
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,490
I didn't see them in the bedroom, either.

334
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,750
Where else can they go?

335
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,870
There's one place we haven't been to.

336
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,150
Family Instructions of the Songs

337
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,930
Honey.

338
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,410
Thank you for helping me do it.

339
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,720
I know what Juntang meant to you.

340
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,640
He had no any family members.

341
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,440
You two grew up together.

342
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,500
We always saw him as a member of our family.

343
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,970
Darling, let's eat.

344
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:20,910
Okay.

345
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,450
Yueniang.

346
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,180
Father, Mother.

347
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,140
What are you doing here?

348
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,650
What? Can't we be here?

349
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,530
Why are you avoiding us?

350
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,490
We're not.

351
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,720
Your father and I are eating here

352
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,210
because it's quiet here.

353
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,410
Eating here

354
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,130
can bring us please.

355
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,610
Right, Darling?

356
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,620
It's peace. It can bring us peace.

357
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,290
The two words mean the same thing.

358
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,830
Mr. Song.

359
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,560
Mrs. Song.

360
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,680
I know

361
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,080
you are testing me.

362
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,150
Your Highness.

363
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,480
Since you know it,

364
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,200
let's be frank.

365
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,290
You are from the royal family while the Songs are ordinary people.

366
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,360
We're from different social classes.

367
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,930
Yueniang is not one of the very ladylike girls.

368
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,720
If she marries into your family,

369
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,650
I don't think it'll be good for her.

370
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,870
If in your family,

371
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,360
she is always unhappy and restricted,

372
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,380
I'd let her stay in the Song family for the rest of her life

373
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,180
rather than let her be your wife.

374
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,630
Your Highness.

375
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,200
I know you're a wonderful man.

376
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,420
But you're from the royal family so you can't do everything you want to do.

377
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,750
If I let you two get married, it may cause you two big trouble.

378
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,880
Mr. Song, Mrs. Song.

379
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,850
Listen to me.

380
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,850
I'm willing to give up my title as viscount

381
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,130
for Yueniang.

382
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,440
Really?

383
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,220
Yes.

384
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,260
I will be with Yueniang forever

385
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,980
and work as a teaching assistant in Yiyang Academy for the rest of my life.

386
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,170
Mr. Song, Mrs. Song, you may rest assured.

387
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,780
As long as you agree to marry Yueniang to me,

388
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,880
I will treat her well.

389
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,650
I'll only marry her in my life.

390
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,230
We'll be together forever

391
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,950
until death do us part.

392
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,770
Your Highness.

393
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,400
This is serious.

394
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,900
You have to honor your promise.

395
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,120
Let me vow in front of the memorial tablets of the ancestors

396
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,930
of the Song family and Mr. Chen.

397
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,800
I, Chen Yan,

398
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,730
will only marry Song Zhu in my life

399
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,540
and I won’t let her suffer any injustice.

400
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,670
I'll let her live happily.

401
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,330
If I break my promise,

402
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,300
let me be struck by lightning and die.

403
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,610
That's too much.

404
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,360
Get up.

405
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,650
Mr. Song, Mrs. Song.

406
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,970
Can you

407
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,600
trust me now?

408
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,050
Try this.

409
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,680
Is it good?

410
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:06,970
Yes.

411
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,390
This is for you.

412
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,850
You made it?

413
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,990
You know I'm not good at my embroidery.

414
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,950
I bought it.

415
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,120
Whether it's made by you or bought,

416
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,250
I'll take it and like it

417
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,380
even if it's poison.

418
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,680
Can I refuse to take it?

419
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,790
No.

420
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,200
Put it on.

421
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,200
Wait.

422
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,740
Can I refuse to put it on?

423
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,820
No. Come back.

424
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:54,650
I don't want to put it on.

425
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,260
Come back.

426
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,070
I won't put it on.

427
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,710
Yan.

428
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,640
Turn around.

429
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,660
Smile.

430
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,510
Look, how handsome you are.

431
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,510
Do you like it?

432
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,090
No?

433
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,650
You said you would take it even if it's poison.

434
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,650
You're a liar.

435
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,170
Well.

436
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,680
I...

437
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,050
I...

438
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,720
I don't like its color.

439
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,500
Yan.

440
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,140
I have something to discuss with you.

441
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,610
I'd like to

442
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,450
visit the Xiao family some day.

443
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,880
I think we need to do that.

444
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,070
Let's go tomorrow.

445
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,010
What did you eat?

446
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:58,780
Yueniang.

447
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,080
Nothing.

448
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,450
An important guest is here.

449
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,380
Father wants you to go to the study.

450
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,770
Can't you keep the guest company?

451
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,610
Why do I have to be there?

452
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,410
You'd better go to the study now.

453
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,040
Yan, go with me.

454
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,140
Let's go.

455
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:27,860
Father.

456
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,170
Let me introduce him to you.

457
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,210
This is Uncle Xiao's son,

458
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,000
Xiao Yu.

459
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,810
Mr. Xiao.

460
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,240
This is my daughter, Song Zhu.

461
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,330
Father, is he here to...

462
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,890
This is your business.

463
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,210
Take care of it yourselves.

464
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,210
Yan, it's inappropriate for you to go in.

465
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,560
Why?

466
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,430
I'm still engaged to him.

467
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,360
It is between me and Mr. Xiao.

468
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,320
It has nothing to do with you.

469
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,480
Even without you,

470
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,610
I would also break off the engagement.

471
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,750
So I want to handle it myself.

472
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:39,730
Fine.

473
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,530
I'll wait for you at the door.

474
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,800
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

475
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,890
Now I see you.

476
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,500
You don't look like the real Xiao Yu.

477
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:10,880
What?

478
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,010
Nothing.

479
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:15,890
Actually,

480
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,240
I have something to discuss with you.

481
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,120
Please go ahead.

482
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,510
Do you remember

483
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,940
our engagement made in our childhood?

484
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,360
I came today

485
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,440
to discuss with you about the marriage certificate.

486
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,720
My father and mother will come in a few days.

487
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,600
No.

488
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,810
I...

489
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,410
I didn't mean that.

490
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,260
Lady Zhu, what are you doing this for?

491
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,010
I was so lucky

492
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,930
to be born into the Song family.

493
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,330
In the Song family, we respect the elderly

494
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,170
and men and women are equal.

495
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,520
My father opened the Women's Academy

496
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,100
because

497
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,250
he believes in gender equality.

498
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,610
He has also proven

499
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,670
that men and women are truly equal.

500
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,920
Although I don't like reading the Four Books and the Five Classics,

501
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,180
I love reading romantic novels.

502
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,600
Those novels

503
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,820
are stories about freedom.

504
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,080
And the freedom to love whomever one wants to love

505
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,210
is the most important kind of freedom.

506
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,550
However, a marriage certificate

507
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,890
will make two people lose that freedom

508
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,020
and make them stuck

509
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,040
in the marriage forever.

510
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,250
When one mistake is made,

511
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,160
it will lead to another mistake.

512
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,490
Then the couple will be miserable.

513
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,170
So?

514
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,920
So I think

515
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,030
if two people have never met each other before,

516
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,830
their engagement made by others

517
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,580
should be made invalid.

518
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,240
Otherwise,

519
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,660
both of them

520
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,380
will lose their freedom

521
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,290
and their lives will be ruined.

522
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,040
So you want to break off the engagement?

523
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,520
Mr. Xiao.

524
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,190
[To Xiao Chuanzhong]

525
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,880
This is a letter my father wrote to Uncle Xiao.

526
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,810
It’s about our decision to break off the engagement.

527
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,050
My parents told me

528
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,580
you were different from other girls.

529
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,320
I didn't expect you to be so special.

530
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,620
I hope you can understand my decision.

531
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:15,949
Do you remember what it was like

532
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,880
when we met here for the first time?

533
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,400
Why are you here?

534
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,670
Why are you here?

535
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,889
At that time, I was still Xiao Yu.

536
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,810
If Xiao Yu

537
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,389
doesn't agree to break off the engagement,

538
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:36,389
what should we do?

539
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,780
We'll go see him tomorrow.

540
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,100
What if he still refuses to break off the engagement?

541
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,639
Then let's elope.

542
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,090
Elope?

543
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,650
Yes.

544
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,239
We'll tell him

545
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,489
no matter what happens,

546
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,429
we will never break up.

547
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,280
Okay.

548
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,510
Don't go back on your word.

00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,840
♫I sang in the fields and knew that the journey was long and the mountains were high♫

563
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,350
Miss Song Zhu.

564
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,810
♫I could only watch you leave and listen to the neighing of horses and roaring of tigers♫

565
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,760
I hope this letter finds you well.

566
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,130
It's an honor for me that we used to be engaged.

567
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,350
♫I've had a few happy moments with you♫

568
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,070
You brothers told me

569
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,360
♫But there were also many sad moments for parting♫

570
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,930
the stories between you and Chen Yan.

571
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,840
♫I sang in the fields and had endured many hardships♫

572
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,580
I'm so envious of you two.

573
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,670
Knowing you're in love with someone else,

574
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,510
♫I don't know when we'll meet again, and maybe we'll no longer be young by then♫

575
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,120
I'd like to quit.

576
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,400
As a bystander,

577
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,980
♫Get a pot of sweet tea to comfort my confidant in the journey♫

578
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,230
I wish you all the best.

579
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,860
♫It's just perfect♫

580
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,760
From Xiao Yu.

581
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,100
I'm finally free from that engagement.

582
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,660
I'm free!

583
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,300
♫In the ancient road♫

584
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,790
♫Parting is hidden in the fields♫

585
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,720
♫There's no green grass through this journey of 10 miles♫

586
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,440
♫The breeze♫

587
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,220
♫Is so gentle while I'm drinking wine♫

588
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,720
Close your eyes.

589
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,330
♫The setting sun♫

590
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,320
♫Seems slightly burnt while I'm thinking about the past♫

591
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,610
♫I got rid of the sorrows that had made me frown♫

592
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,330
♫Why not♫

593
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,460
♫Just ride a horse to travel around the world and laugh happily?♫

594
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,720
♫I sang in the fields and knew that the journey was long and the mountains were high♫

595
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,800
The new semester in the Yiyang Academy has started!

596
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,920
♫I could only watch you leave and listen to the neighing of horses and roaring of tigers♫

597
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,780
The new semester in the Yiyang Academy has started!

598
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,380
♫I've had a few happy moments with you♫

599
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,230
The new semester in the Yiyang Academy has started!

600
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,520
♫But there were also many sad moments for parting♫

601
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,150
♫I sang in the fields and had endured many hardships♫

602
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,710
♫I don't know when we'll meet again, and maybe we'll no longer be young by then♫

603
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,250
♫Get a pot of sweet tea to comfort my confidant in the journey♫

604
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,070
♫It's just perfect♫

605
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,140
Who is this gentleman?

606
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,720
♫I look back and my dream has come true today♫

607
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,440
I'm your Chen Yan.

608
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,700
♫It has nothing to do with the wind or the moon or anything else♫

609
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,900
I'm here to marry you.

610
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,850
♫The delightful noise♫

611
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,930
♫On the road cannot make me remember the past♫

612
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,980
What are you doing?

613
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,080
This is my wife.

614
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,130
♫Let's take a look at the banana trees in the rain♫

615
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,650
When you're in Song's Academy,

616
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,370
don't try to hit on her.

617
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,910
♫Hope we can meet again and laugh heartily♫

618
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,400
You're so annoying.

619
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,580
♫Is it good?♫

620
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,290
Great.

621
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,270
Yeah! We're married!
