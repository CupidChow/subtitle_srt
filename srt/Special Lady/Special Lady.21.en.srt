[Episode 21]

4
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,150
Mr. Xiao.

5
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,050
Zhu.

6
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,530
M-Mr. Zhou.

7
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,620
What a coincidence. Are you shopping?

8
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,890
Junior Zhou.

9
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,180
What are you doing?

10
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,440
S-Selling gourds.

11
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,580
Hello, Teaching Assistant Xiao. Hello, Miss Song.

12
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,060
I'll leave you guys to it.

13
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,160
Brother, I'll go over there.

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,700
Junior Zhou…

15
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,090
I'm leaving then.

16
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,160
Junior Zhou!

17
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,800
What are you going to do?

18
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,730
Explain!

19
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,329
Explain what?

20
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,210
The more you explain, the more they'll misunderstand us.

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,310
Then can you think of a way?

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,010
Go and explain to them!

23
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,810
Junior Zhou.

24
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:32,670
Hurry up!

25
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,930
Junior Zhou, we were not frolicking

26
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,510
as you thought we were.

27
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,260
Why would Mr. Zhou misunderstand?

28
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,250
Lady Zhu just thought too much.

29
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,650
No need to explain.

30
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,450
Junior Zhou,

31
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,510
why don't you stay and paint the gourds for us?

32
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,880
Your paintings will sell well.

33
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,160
But Mr. Zhou is shopping with Lady Zhou.

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,860
Okay.

35
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,690
Take a look.

36
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,260
-Come and have a look.
-Take your time to pick.

37
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,720
My brother painted all of these personally.

38
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,800
-It's so pretty.
-Pick whatever you want.

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,460
The painting is so good.

40
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,740
-What is this?
-This one too.

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,610
A rabbit.

42
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,010
-You're so smart.
-Mother, I want this.

43
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,920
-I'll take this one.
-There are more down there.

44
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,850
There are big ones and small ones.

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,170
Okay, I want this one.

46
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,810
Look at this. The gourd you want.

47
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,520
-Thank you.
-Mother, it's so pretty.

48
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,040
Look, isn't this pretty?

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,850
What else do you want to see?

50
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,090
I want to paint too.

51
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,079
-Your painting is so ugly.
-Okay. One by one.

52
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,520
Junior Zhou is really something.

53
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,150
The money is so much that I can't even count it.

54
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,210
My brother's painting has always been lively.

55
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,160
It's the same even if it's on the gourd.

56
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,480
There's more.

57
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,410
I want this one.

58
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,490
The small one is also fun.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,290
Junior Zhou.

60
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,360
Look at mine. Is it pretty?

61
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,000
Not as pretty as mine.

62
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,010
So beautiful.

63
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,250
Zhu

64
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,329
always praises Mr. Zhou whenever she sees him.

65
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,000
Then why did she give me the handkerchief?

66
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,520
Could it be a trap?

67
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,730
Hurry up!

68
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,950
Sorry.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,070
Did you pay?

70
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,640
-Ma'am, I want this one.
-Thank you.

71
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,290
Okay.

72
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,940
How much is it?

73
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,600
Here.

74
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,649
You're so good at arithmetic?

75
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,170
It's just that you're so lousy at it.

76
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,960
Are you two newlyweds?

77
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,100
We used to be like you.

78
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,490
We always bickered.

79
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,310
-Her?
-Him?

80
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,090
Bah!

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,240
Look.

82
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,860
Newlyweds are so nice.

83
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,850
So romantic.

84
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,720
Let's go.

85
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,820
Junior Zhou.

86
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,670
Zhu,

87
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,840
do you want the watercolor?

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,150
You are not mad at me, are you?

89
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,020
I've never been mad at you.

90
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,490
Gourds! Gourds!

91
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,560
Xiao Yu, keep your voice down.

92
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,250
Don't you want to sell gourds?

93
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,590
Gourds!

94
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,180
Of all kinds of colors.

95
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,080
Welcome, Lord Zuo.

96
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,470
Unfortunately,

97
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,130
our Dean went out for something.

98
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,530
I'm not here

99
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,440
for Mr. Song.

100
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,409
Then what brings you here today, Lord Zuo?

101
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,580
A few days ago,

102
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,280
I accidentally got Mr. Shen Kuo's

103
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,050
"Brush Talks from Dream Brook" translated and annotated by you.

104
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,820
I like it very much.

105
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,520
Very much.

106
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,720
Lord Zuo,

107
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,440
I'm overwhelmed by your appraise.

108
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,500
It's just something

109
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,670
I jabbered when I was bored.

110
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,330
Mr. Zhang, you're too modest.

111
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,850
The foresight and sagacity of the book

112
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,490
is astonishing.

113
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,430
After reading your translation,

114
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,490
I was so enlightened.

115
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,320
Then I thought that it would be a loss of the world

116
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,970
if your valuable thoughts

117
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,240
are not known by everyone.

118
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,150
Lord Zuo, I'm flattered.

119
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,200
If you don't mind, Mr. Zhang,

120
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,960
I'll reorganize your poetry anthology

121
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,640
and add a compilation of scholars from our academy.

122
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,970
to leave your thoughts to the future generations.

123
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,500
What do you think, Mr. Zhang?

124
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,340
Lord Zuo, please don't…

125
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,590
Don't joke with me.

126
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,520
I'm not joking with you.

127
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,080
I'm waiting for your approval.

128
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,920
Then I'll do it right away.

129
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,390
I agree.

130
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,650
It's my great honor.

131
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,120
That's great.

132
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,410
But I need time to sort out the information.

133
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,490
If it's convenient for you,

134
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,280
can you lend me the information

135
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,390
of all the students in your academy?

136
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,810
I'll get it now.

137
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,470
Okay.

138
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,390
Lord Zuo.

139
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,970
-This way.
-Come with me.

140
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,610
Okay.

141
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,730
Don't miss it.

142
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,470
The last few painted gourds.

143
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,630
The last few good gourds.

144
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,890
Move aside.

145
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,760
Do you all have a stall?

146
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,690
-You guys.
-Have a look. The last…

147
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,370
You all have a stall.

148
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,760
Have you paid the tax today?

149
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,070
-Did you pay the tax?
-Hello, officer.

150
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,850
Give it to me.

151
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,800
-Officer. 
-Have you paid the tax?

152
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,450
Here you are, officer.

153
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,250
Pay your tax.

154
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,100
These two are presents for you.

155
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,409
So nice. Thank you.

156
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,130
Don't make us waste our time.

157
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,440
Did you pay today's tax? Hurry up.

158
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,690
-Don't move.
-Did you pay the tax?

159
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,800
Did you pay your tax today?

160
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,380
How much is it?

161
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,110
Half of your income today.

162
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,500
They don't even know the rules.

163
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,720
I'm sure they didn't pay.

164
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,850
Come here.

165
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,610
I'd like to see how you'll move.

166
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,260
Interesting.

167
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,170
A gourd seller

168
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,210
dares to be so arrogant to us.

169
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,730
How dare you!

170
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
Officer,

171
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,200
we didn't sell gourds.

172
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,050
Those two people

173
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,650
just bought some from you.

174
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,400
If you don't believe me, you can ask them.

175
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,650
Hey, come back!

176
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,130
Officer.

177
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,400
We are not merchants.

178
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,740
We didn't set up a stall, either.

179
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,850
So we don't need

180
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,980
to pay any tax.

181
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,250
These gourds

182
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,370
were bought from a peasant woman.

183
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,970
Someone liked the gourds,

184
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,120
so we gave some to them.

185
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,770
If you like them,

186
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,210
we'll give them to you, too.

187
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,180
For you.

188
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,280
Here, officer.

189
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,930
Here you are.

190
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,690
Don't try to play tricks.

191
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,810
Did you two buy gourds here?

192
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,730
No, we didn't.

193
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,410
These were given as a present. We didn't buy it.

194
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,850
Look, officer.

195
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,840
I'm telling the truth.

196
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,120
Go.

197
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,780
Just go.

198
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,740
Can we leave, too?

199
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,980
-Let's go.
-You can't leave.

200
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,650
Whether you bought the gourds or gave them out,

201
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,320
you have to pay the tax with half of your income.

202
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,030
Okay.

203
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,810
Look, officer.

204
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,960
I gave you three gourds just now.

205
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,040
Those two took away two gourds.

206
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,710
There are five gourds in total, right?

207
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,160
Here are the tax for five gourds.

208
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,500
Can we go now?

209
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,480
Let's go.

210
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,360
Let's go.

211
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,010
Let's go.

212
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,290
Go away.

213
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,870
The tax is heavy, and the people are suffering.

214
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,810
Forget it. Don't be angry.

215
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,080
Don't be angry.

216
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,370
Just use a few copper coins to drive away the jinx.

217
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,090
Didn't you teach me

218
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,690
not to confront the tough with toughness?

219
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,590
How can you forget it when it comes to yourself?

220
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,850
Junior Zhou, I talked a lot today,

221
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,200
and I'm thirsty now.

222
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,170
Why don't we sit down and drink something?

223
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,940
We made money.

224
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,580
It's on me.

225
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,200
Do you want to go?

226
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,220
Don't be upset.

227
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,910
Drink some ice drink and cheer up.

228
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,660
Mr. Xiao, are you coming?

229
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,970
I…

230
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,710
Junior Zhou, let's go in first.

231
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,330
Let him think about it.

232
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:47,720
-Wait…
-Let's go.

233
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,050
Hurry up!

234
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,370
Let's go, brother.

235
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,080
I guess it doesn't matter if I go or not.

236
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,640
Are you coming or not?

237
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,450
Don't just stand there.

238
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,040
Coming.

239
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,800
Lady Zhou, help yourself.

240
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,960
-Junior Zhou.
-Thank you.

241
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,480
I'll do it.

242
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,090
Junior Zhou.

243
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,940
Thank you.

244
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,360
Lady Zhou.

245
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,540
Thank you, Miss Song.

246
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:20,910
Zhu,

247
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,930
thanks to your quick wit.

248
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
Otherwise,

249
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,080
I don't know how long those soldiers would badger us.

250
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,680
What quick wit?

251
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,540
I was just being unreasonable.

252
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,170
You...

253
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,950
were really brave.

254
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:41,950
Zhu.

255
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,620
Where is my money?

256
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:45,740
What money?

257
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,440
The money for selling gourd.

258
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,230
50%.

259
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,360
Didn't I give the money

260
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,100
to the soldiers?

261
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,240
Didn't you see it?

262
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,850
No.

263
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,060
What 50%?

264
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,440
Isn't it 40%?

265
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,660
Are you trying to be unreasonable?

266
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,060
Me? Unreasonable?

267
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,720
Zhu,

268
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,240
there seems to be ink on your forehead.

269
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,900
Really?

270
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,520
Let me help you.

271
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,400
Wipe it yourself.

272
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,560
Don't mind him.

273
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,450
By the way, Junior Zhou,

274
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,060
thank you for today.

275
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,270
Luckily, you helped me sell gourds.

276
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,960
That's why they sold out so fast.

277
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,250
Anyway,

278
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,650
you've made great contributions today.

279
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,600
You have to eat more.

280
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,970
And Lady Zhou, too.

281
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,680
Here, let me add some food for you.

282
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,070
You flatter me, Zhu.

283
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,320
We worked together to succeed.

284
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,450
I dare not take credit.

285
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,560
What are you looking at?

286
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,570
I'm asking you. What are you looking at?

287
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,740
Can't you see?

288
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,380
Brother.

289
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,180
It looks so beautiful outside.

290
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,550
Let's go have a look, too.

291
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,520
Let's go.

292
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,820
Slow down.

293
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,420
Let's go, too.

294
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,800
What's there to see?

295
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,720
Are you going or not?

296
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,730
If you're not, I'll go myself.

297
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,980
I'm not going.

298
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,890
I knew you wanted to go.

299
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,780
Let's go.

300
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,890
Brother, this way.

301
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,010
Feiniang, slow down.

302
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,490
What kind of music is this?

303
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,650
It's beautiful.

304
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,170
This is dance music from the Western Region.

305
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,600
How did you know?

306
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,230
I...

307
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,660
Someone in my family does business,

308
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
and they've dealt with people from the Western Region.

309
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,450
Aren't your family all officials?

310
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,130
Can't someone do business?

311
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,330
Mr. Xiao,

312
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,450
what kind of products

313
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,350
do your family buy and sell?

314
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,570
Mr. Zhou, why do you ask so suddenly?

315
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm sorry for being rude.

316
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,660
I heard that you had had touch with people from the Western Region,

317
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,930
so I got curious.

318
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,990
After all, it's not common to see an aristocratic family that trades with the businessmen from the Western Regions.

319
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,820
I'm interested in the western language,

320
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,980
but I don't know where to start.

321
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,220
My family don't understand the western language either.

322
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,130
When they come here,

323
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,060
they bring an interpreter.

324
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,040
Then...

325
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,490
It's okay. I'll go home and ask about it.

326
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,150
If you are interested,

327
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,680
I'll tell you how to learn it later.

328
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,160
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

329
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,090
The exotic dance

330
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,780
is indeed much bolder and more unstrained

331
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,990
than the elegant and reserved style of our country.

332
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,960
I think we are too pedantic.

333
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,000
Since ancient times,

334
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,810
the cultivation and breeding have made women

335
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,530
unable to do what they like,

336
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,180
to wear the clothes they like,

337
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,870
to wear the makeup they like,

338
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,280
or to dance the dances they like.

339
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,820
It actually doesn't matter what is the right thing to do.

340
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,160
You can write poems and articles as you like,

341
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,080
but if we're talking about the outfit,

342
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,840
I don't think I can accept it.

343
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,690
When everyone

344
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,370
is used to it,

345
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,740
there's nothing that you can't accept.

346
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,990
What other exotic anecdotes do you know?

347
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,650
Tell me more.

348
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,520
You want to hear it?

349
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,930
After you said it,

350
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,770
I really think it's no big deal.

351
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,850
Besides, it's really beautiful.

352
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,010
In fact, many places other than the Central Plain

353
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,840
are not as scary as described in the books.

354
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:34,920
They have

355
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,250
many features that we can appreciate.

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,730
For example?

357
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,510
For example, their attitudes towards food

358
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,440
and towards people both differ from ours.

359
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,050
There are many more.

360
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,100
-Brother.
-What else?

361
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:45,770
What are you thinking?

362
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,280
Tell me more.

363
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,880
It's okay. Let's go.

364
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,460
He is Xiao Yu?

365
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,089
Yes, he is Xiao Yu.

366
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,089
Mr. Zhang from Yiyang Academy gave me this portrait.

367
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,530
It must be Xiao Yu.

368
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,300
This Xiao Yu is not that Xiao Yu.

369
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,410
Maybe they have the same name?

370
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,210
Dare this person

371
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,079
make such a big scene in Yiyang Academy?

372
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,600
My Lord, perhaps we thought in the wrong direction.

373
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,790
It's not that this Xiao Yu was so powerful,

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,030
but that Mr. Li was too weak.

375
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,680
Something is wrong.

376
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:42,940
Keep investigating.

377
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,450
Yes, My Lord.

378
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,330
A fatty?

379
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,490
A fatty?

380
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,000
While Mr. Zhang and Lord Zuo were chatting,

381
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,610
I peeked at the information.

382
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,490
Not only your portrait shows a fatty,

383
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,170
but you also have an ordinary family.

384
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,410
Who on earth is helping me in secret?

385
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,930
We don't know whether he's a friend or foe.

386
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,690
But the fact that your identity is fake

387
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,290
has already been known by three people.

388
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,690
Young Master, we have to hurry.

389
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,170
I'm afraid things will get more complicated later.

390
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,200
I didn't expect Mr. Zhou to have such a varied style of painting.

391
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,250
Apart from ink painting,

392
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,680
he could even draw such an exquisite and cute person.

393
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,190
This...

394
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,620
This wasn't painted by Mr. Zhou?

395
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:04,860
No wonder it's so ugly.

396
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,200
Miss Fei, you're indeed Junior Zhou's sister.

397
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,540
You even look like him so much when you're studying.

398
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,720
Miss Yan,

399
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,020
it sounds like you know my brother well.

400
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,760
We studied together before.

401
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,690
Seeing you like this,

402
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,080
I'm reminded of him.

403
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,360
Miss Yan, you've studied with my brother before?

404
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,800
I've never heard my brother mention it before.

405
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,980
Did you go out alone?

406
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,970
What are you thinking?

407
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,040
Of course not.

408
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,180
By the way, Feiniang,

409
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,320
did you go downtown

410
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,880
to take a walk this weekend?

411
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,430
Yes.

412
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,220
But Yiyang is a really complicated place.

413
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,960
What happened?

414
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,800
Last night,

415
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,200
my brother, Lady Zhu,

416
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,690
Teaching Assistant Xiao, and I

417
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,130
saw a group of people dancing the Western style dance

418
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,170
near the beverage shop.

419
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,800
Yueniang and Mr. Xiao were there too?

420
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,000
We even sold gourds all afternoon.

421
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,290
Miss Song Zhu also bought us beverage.

422
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,170
It was really delicious.

423
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,500
I've never had it at home before.

424
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,870
Humph.

425
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,420
You made an appointment to have a drink, but you didn't even invite me.

426
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,160
No, we didn't make an appointment beforehand.

427
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,900
We just ran into each other.

428
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,680
They were already selling gourds when we arrived.

429
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,440
So it was like when you were shopping with Yueniang,

430
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,760
you ran into Junior Zhou and Mr. Xiao?

431
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,940
No, I went shopping with my brother.

432
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,610
You mean

433
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,240
you went shopping with Mr. Zhou,

434
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,980
and then you met Mr. Xiao and Yueniang on the way?

435
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,210
Not really.

436
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,900
We met them

437
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,180
when my brother took me to buy some cake before that.

438
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,170
But at that time they were being chased.

439
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,410
They were being chased?

440
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,280
I don't know who was chasing Miss Song Zhu.

441
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,260
Luckily, Teaching Assistant Xiao was there to protect her.

442
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,120
Did they get hurt?

443
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,560
I assume they did not.

444
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,820
When they were selling gourds,

445
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,290
I saw that they were both fine.

446
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,810
That's good.

447
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,180
I was scared.

448
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,770
Miss Yan, do you know

449
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,200
what's the relationship between Teaching Assistant Xiao and Miss Song?

450
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,640
Why do you ask?

451
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,550
Yesterday,

452
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,010
I saw them fleeing from the chase.

453
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,440
At that time,

454
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,800
I saw Teaching Assistant Xiao holding Miss Song's hand.

455
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,080
Lady Zhou, you can't make a casual comment like that.

456
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,570
You said it yourself.

457
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,760
It was an urgent situation.

458
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,480
And even if it's true,

459
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,170
there's a reason for it.

460
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,330
You can tell me this.

461
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,410
If you keep telling this to others,

462
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,090
not only will you tarnish the reputation of Yueniang and Mr. Xiao,

463
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,730
but also it's not good for you either.

464
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,160
Like this.

465
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,720
It's a trick. Look.

466
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,760
Turn like this.

467
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,970
-Got it? 
-Let me think about it.

468
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,130
What's going on?

469
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,800
What's wrong?

470
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,500
Did you quarrel with Lady Zhou?

471
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,880
Well then...

472
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,610
What's wrong? You're acting weird.

473
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,090
Yueniang.

474
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,720
I heard you were in danger yesterday.

475
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,960
You didn't even tell me.

476
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,450
You stared at me

477
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,460
just because of this?

478
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,980
Anyway, I was stalked yesterday.

479
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,790
Luckily, nothing happened.

480
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,040
I didn't want you to worry,

481
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,950
so I didn't tell you.

482
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,610
I'm glad you're fine.

483
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,770
The mere thought of it makes me scared.

484
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,240
Alright.

485
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,760
I'm blessed and protected by the gods.

486
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,560
Look, I'm fine.

487
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,730
Well,

488
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,650
did anything else happen yesterday?

489
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,770
Anything else?

490
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,730
I heard

491
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,780
you and Mr. Xiao hold hands.

492
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,430
Go back to our seats.

493
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,040
Qinruo.

494
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,840
It was urgent.

495
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,210
It was an accident.

496
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,340
Bo Ya, the guqin performer in the pre-Qin period

497
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,160
once played the guqin in the wilderness.

498
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,770
The woodcutter Zhong Ziqi

499
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,670
could comprehend that the tune of the guqin

500
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,640
was depicting something as majestic as Mount Tai

501
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,550
and as vast as Yangtze River and Yellow River.

502
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,200
Bo Ya was amazed and said,

503
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,520
"Great.

504
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,600
Our hearts strike the same chord."

505
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,370
After Zhong Ziqi died,

506
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,970
Bo Ya was so sad about losing his soulmate

507
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,860
that he smashed his guqin and cut the strings.

508
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,230
That's the story behind the Melody of High Mountains and Flowing Rivers.

509
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,440
You'll be confused if you just learn but not think.

510
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,130
You'll be tired and lost if you just think but not learn.

511
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,320
If a gentleman wants to achieve something,

512
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,490
he must first…

513
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,240
Mr. Xue. Mr. Xue.

514
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,780
judge

515
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,760
and analyze the situation.

516
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,330
He must make a through plan before taking any action.

517
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,240
Come on, let me tell you some news.

518
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,320
I promise you'll be energetic immediately.

519
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,800
What is it?

520
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,620
Mr. Xiao got a handkerchief as a gift.

521
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,440
It is quite normal

522
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,880
to get a handkerchief as a gift.

523
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,420
Who doesn't have one?

524
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,850
I don't.

525
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,360
Don't interrupt.

526
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,690
But on the handkerchief

527
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,460
was embroidered a mandarin duck.

528
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,770
It's so romantic.

529
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,160
However, Mr. Xiao said that someone was troubled.

530
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,850
He just mediated in the middle.

531
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,570
He said he would return it for his friend in a few days.

532
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,000
Luckily, I was quick-witted.

533
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,600
Actually, I knew everything.

534
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,080
I just didn't make it clear.

535
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,520
So it was from you?

536
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,320
You nerd.

537
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,640
Why would I give him a handkerchief with a mandarin duck?

538
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,480
How about I give you one with Zhong Kui, the ghostbuster on it?

539
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,850
Go on. Go on.

540
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,270
Do you know that Mr. Xiao's family don't live in Yiyang?

541
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,610
He came to Yiyang to study.

542
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,450
Besides the people in our academy,

543
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,340
he has no other relatives or friends.

544
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,380
So the handkerchief must be a token of love

545
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,050
given by someone in our academy.

546
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,370
Who could it be?

547
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,130
Let's just watch the show.

548
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,520
Ding Miao,

549
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,440
I see you're so happy

550
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,800
to learn things.

551
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,570
I want to know

552
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,220
what you think about what I just taught.

553
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,270
High mountains and flowing rivers.

554
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,550
Sit down.

555
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,590
Bo Ya and Ziqi hadn't been together for long,

556
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,090
but they became bosom friends.

557
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,450
They sincerely treated each other

558
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,960
as soulmates.

559
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,640
Bo Ya cut the strings

560
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,530
only because there was only the tune left,

561
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,040
but no one could understand it.

562
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,340
Others may think he made a fuss about nothing.

563
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,520
However, for Bo Ya,

564
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,090
losing his soulmate

565
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:17,200
doesn't only mean there was no one in this world who understood his music,

566
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,130
but also that no one understood his mind.

567
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,080
In today's lesson,

568
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,170
I hope you can learn a piece of life philosophy,

569
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,520
beside learning the tune,

570
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,560
that it's easy to get a thousand teals of gold,

571
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,670
but hard to find a bosom friend.

572
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,050
You students

573
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,170
can't even stand

574
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,960
or sit properly.

575
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,920
In every class,

576
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,200
your thoughts float away.

577
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,940
You are not interested in reading or learning,

578
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,560
but are so passionate about dirty things.

579
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,020
Indeed, each generation is getting worse.

580
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,420
Zhou Ji,

581
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,000
stand up.

582
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,930
Look at

583
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,330
what a role model is like.

584
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,960
When you looked at

585
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,370
and laughed at Ding Miao and Xue Hanfu,

586
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,090
Zhou Ji was the only one

587
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,650
who was thinking.

588
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,000
Class,

589
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,530
thinking is very important.

590
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,350
We need to reflect on ourselves all the time.

591
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,890
Qinruo.

592
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,040
Let's go.

593
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,370
Qinruo, I...

594
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,120
Go away!

595
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:11,890
Qinruo.

596
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,170
Did you have a quarrel with Lady Yan?

597
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,890
You're such a troublemaker.

598
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,010
Qin…

599
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,720
Lady Zhou, hurry up.

600
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,690
Okay.

601
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,730
Qinruo.

602
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,450
Where are you going?

603
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,210
Mind your own business. Just stop causing me trouble!

604
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,140
You caused me trouble.

605
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,900
-Let me ask you. 
-I don't understand what you're talking about.

606
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,240
Can't you see such a big pit?

607
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,590
You scared me.

608
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,520
I can't see it. I'm blind.

609
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,370
Sir, can you stop blocking my way?

610
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,050
You...

611
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,780
Do you know it's just because Qinruo got to know that yesterday you asked me out

612
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,650
and held my hand

613
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,950
that she's mad at me now?

614
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,240
But even if you talk to Lady Yan now,

615
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,140
you can't really make it clear.

616
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,340
Leave her alone to calm down.

617
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,720
Don't interfere with girls' affairs.

618
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,320
I have something to tell you.

619
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,930
Wait until this is over.

620
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,300
No, I have to say it now.

621
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,730
Go away!

622
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,320
Qinruo!

623
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,990
Song Zhu, are you even a woman?

624
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,890
This is a gift from Zhu to Mr. Xiao.

625
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,760
Mr. Zhou.

626
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,430
Mr. Xiao.

627
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,760
What are you doing?

628
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,320
I was tidying up for you.

629
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,450
No.

630
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,840
I saw this handkerchief dropped on the ground.

631
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,750
It must be something important to you,

632
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,230
so I wanted to return it to you personally.

633
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,470
But shouldn't the handkerchief be in the box?

634
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,170
Really?

635
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,350
I found it on the ground just now.

636
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,480
Maybe I forgot to put it back after taking it out.

637
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,680
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

638
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,670
You're welcome.

639
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,160
Mr. Xiao,

640
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,010
I saw the handkerchief is exquisite,

641
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,290
delicate,

642
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,440
and full of love.

643
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,080
Could it be that

644
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,430
some girl admired you secretly?

645
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,720
It's from Miss Song Zhu.

646
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,720
Mr. Zhou, what do you think?

647
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,030
What?

648
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,920
I said this handkerchief was from Miss Song Zhu.

649
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,510
Mr. Zhou, do you have anything to say?

650
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,280
It's a gift from Zhu to you.

651
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,350
I didn't scrutinize it,

652
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,139
so I can't really comment on it.

653
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,639
I have to go study,

654
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,190
so please excuse me.

655
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:31,330
How much of what you said is true

656
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,130
and how much is fake?

657
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,489
Let me see.

658
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,610
Yueniang.

659
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:52,080
The needlework

660
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,020
gets really chilling after your modification.

661
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,040
People might think

662
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,730
my sister

663
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,670
is embroidering some exotic herbs.

664
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,970
Second Sister, you don't understand.

665
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,200
I'm embroidering something magnificent and mighty.

666
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,400
Indeed I don't understand.

667
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,290
Second Sister, stop laughing at me.

668
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,130
Do you think everyone is

669
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,550
so ingenious on needlework like you?

670
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:31,850
What's wrong?

671
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,720
I'm quitting embroidering.

672
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,890
Let it grow on its own.

673
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:37,600
Yueniang,

674
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,660
the needlework is actually the same as painting.

675
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,580
Make your mind follow your heart.

676
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,420
Think about the beauty of what you painted.

677
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,090
Every stitch is like a stroke.

678
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,290
You can't be impatient.

679
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,050
Second Sister, you're right.

680
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,510
I can't be impatient.

681
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,850
Besides, this is what I wanted

682
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,080
to use to apologize.

683
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,540
I should embroider it myself.

684
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,950
Second Sister, let me do it.

685
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,000
If you put your true heart

686
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,200
in your gift,

687
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,890
the person who receives it will naturally appreciate your kindness.

688
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,170
In that case,

689
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,440
I'll be here for you.

690
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,530
When you need me,

691
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,080
I'll teach you stitch by stitch.

692
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,710
Zhen, how have you been?

693
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,520
I heard that in your Women's Academy, there is a teaching assistant

694
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,130
named Xiao Yu.

695
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,130
Seeing this name, I was wondering

696
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,590
who he was.

697
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,800
If you have time,

698
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,330
send his portrait back to me.

699
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,360
Remember, it's important.

700
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,800
That's strange.

701
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,880
This is not Teaching Assistant Xiao.

702
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,070
It's not Teaching Assistant Xiao on this portrait.

703
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,720
Xiao Yu.

704
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,430
The son of Xiao Chuanzhong.

705
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,560
Guards!

706
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:45,920
Master.

707
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,770
Send someone

708
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,220
to send this letter to Lord Zuo immediately.

709
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,030
Yes.

710
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,870
Instructor Shen.

711
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,420
You're good, Instructor Shen.

712
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,290
You walk silently and land without a trace.

713
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,130
Good eyesight.

714
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,130
Teaching Assistant Xiao, what brings you here?

715
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,320
I'm here to see the Dean,

716
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,000
but he seems to be talking to someone else.

717
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,910
So I'm waiting here.

718
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,880
No need to wait.

719
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,100
I'll take you in.

720
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,530
Dean.

721
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,590
It's okay. Just stand here for a while.

722
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,620
I... No.

723
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:45,970
Dean.

724
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,560
Why don't you get back to work?

725
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:50,890
Yes.

726
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,260
Brother, where is Teaching Assistant Xiao?

727
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,210
He must be out for business.

728
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,050
Brother.

729
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,460
I think I did something wrong.

730
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,960
What is it?

731
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,320
Miss Yan chatted with me yesterday.

732
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,010
I accidentally told her

733
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,070
that we saw Teaching Assistant Xiao and Miss Song

734
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,080
together in the street.

735
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,720
And she…

736
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,170
she seems to be mad at Miss Song Zhu.

737
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,350
Brother,

738
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,010
did I say something wrong?

739
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,480
Did you tell her

740
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,500
that Mr. Xiao and Zhu held hands?

741
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,010
Yes.

742
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,020
Then,

743
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,170
should I explain it to the two ladies?

744
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,480
Today, I read

745
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,530
a line in Volume 9

746
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,550
of "Exoteric traditions of the Han version of the Songs" by Han Ying from Han Dynasty.

747
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,890
The luke mind

748
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,570
could harm your mind and body.

749
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,320
The lust

750
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,640
will draw disasters for you.

751
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,300
What do you think of this sentence, Dean?

752
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,130
Take a look.

753
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,710
What did I paint on this paper?

754
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:54,430
If a person who has no fluke mind

755
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,860
doesn't control their desire

756
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,780
and does whatever they want,

757
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,360
they will no longer be the same old person they used to be.

758
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,260
Just like the white paper won't be white anymore with only one drop of ink on it.
