[Prince Fu's Mansion]

5
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,190
You're all at the same age.

6
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,550
Don't be so reserved.

7
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,259
You can chat casually.

8
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,130
Miss, may I know your name?

9
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,970
My surname is Lin.

10
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,960
My name is Qing'er.

11
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,430
Qing'er?

12
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,770
Good name.

13
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,220
It matches your temperament.

14
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,440
Yan.

15
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,010
It's still early.

16
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,079
Take Miss Lin for a walk.

17
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,680
May I have the honor?

18
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,240
Please.

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,130
Look.

20
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,120
What a perfect match.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,370
How old are you?

22
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,670
I just turned 16 this year.

23
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,070
I'm 18.

24
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,390
Your Highness, I heard that you used to study at Yiyang Academy.

25
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,230
I guess you must be well-educated and knowledgeable.

26
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,460
I am also interested in poetry and painting.

27
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,270
Can you please teach me when you're free?

28
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,520
You flatter me.

29
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,150
If you are willing,

30
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,790
I'm willing to do it anytime.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,720
Do you always have so many escorts

32
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,330
when you go around?

33
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,150
Did it scare you?

34
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,220
No.

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,730
I'm just not used to it.

36
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,079
Guard Yu.

37
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,960
Why are you following me all day?

38
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,560
Young Master, you're out today.

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,560
Prince Fu asked me to protect you.

40
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,640
Even if my father sent you here,

41
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,030
didn't you see

42
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,430
I was chatting with the girl?

43
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,030
Go back now.

44
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,020
But this is Prince Fu's order.

45
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,260
Are you afraid I'll run away?

46
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,870
She said she was not used to it.

47
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,610
Do you have to ruin

48
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,760
my potential marriage?

49
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,670
When His Highness and Her Highness ask about it,

50
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,190
I'll tell them you scared her away.

51
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,500
Go!

52
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,680
Yes.

53
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,920
Miss, how about it now?

54
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

55
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,360
I've always found them annoying.

56
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,790
Today, with your help,

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,830
I can finally take a breath.

58
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,089
This way, please.

59
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,420
Your Highness.

60
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,730
What is this place?

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
This is my room.

62
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,320
This...

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,350
What do you mean?

64
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,560
To be honest,

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,680
I need your help.

66
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,420
Although this may seem rude,

67
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,990
it's very important.

68
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,430
I can only ask you for help now.

69
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,530
What is it?

70
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,530
Come in.

71
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,159
Hurry.

72
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,120
What's wrong?

73
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,800
Oh no!

74
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,909
Young Master.

75
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,790
Young Master.

76
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,480
Young Master,

77
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,670
please go back with me.

78
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,850
The capital... You...

79
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:58,850
Where is he?

80
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,680
Didn't he go this way just now?

81
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,750
My Lord.

82
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,160
What should we do now?

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,410
What can we do?

84
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,240
Go to His Highness and admit our error.

85
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,540
Let's go.

86
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,200
He put us off

87
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,880
and ran away again, leaving only a letter.

88
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,910
Just let him go and have fun.

89
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,300
Didn't he promise that he won't cause any more trouble in the letter?

90
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,670
He just wants to see something new.

91
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,040
It's good for men

92
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,240
to travel around and have some adventures.

93
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,980
You!

94
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,420
A doting mother is…

95
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,190
tolerant.

96
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,840
Have some cake.

97
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,110
The cakes outside the city are very delicious.

98
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,310
-Really? 
-I'll take you there next time.

99
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,390
Zhu.

100
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,870
Qinruo.

101
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,980
I picked it especially for you.

102
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,020
Don't be mad at me anymore.

103
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,710
I don't need it.

104
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,730
Qinruo.

105
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,560
I want to tell you about the engagement.

106
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,500
Stop it.

107
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,310
I don't want to hear it.

108
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,580
From now on,

109
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,920
I'll have nothing to do with you.

110
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,150
We'll have no relations any longer.

111
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,530
Qinruo.

112
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,580
Listen to my…

113
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,750
You still don't understand?

114
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,090
Lady Zhao.

115
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
I'll go with you.

116
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,390
Feiniang?

117
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,190
When did you come back?

118
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,030
Miss Song Zhu.

119
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,120
I came back today.

120
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,520
What about Junior Zhou? Is he back?

121
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,680
Yes, he came back together with me.

122
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,390
That's good.

123
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,420
Thank you, Feiniang.

124
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,200
Have a good rest. I have to go.

125
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,820
Junior Zhou.

126
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,450
You're back.

127
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,540
I...

128
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,570
What's the matter?

129
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,080
I...

130
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,810
Just speak freely, Senior Song.

131
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,789
Junior Zhou,

132
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,950
are you still mad at me?

133
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,809
Why should I be mad at you?

134
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,680
About the engagement…

135
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,910
What does your engagement

136
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,960
have to do with me?

137
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,840
Junior Zhou,

138
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,690
I came to tell you this.

139
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,300
My father has agreed to break off the engagement for me.

140
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,190
I'll show you the letter now.

141
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,990
Wait for me.

142
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,430
Where's the letter?

143
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,440
Junior Zhou.

144
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,870
Wait for me. I'm going back to fetch the letter.

145
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,320
I must have forgotten it in a hurry.

146
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,270
-Wait for me.
-Senior.

147
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,030
I have nothing to do

148
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,940
with your personal affair with Mr. Xiao.

149
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,250
Junior Zhou,

150
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,300
do you have something on your mind?

151
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,260
If that's the case,

152
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,620
you can tell me.

153
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,430
There is indeed one thing.

154
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,340
Go ahead.

155
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,270
As long as I can help,

156
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,230
I will.

157
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,660
This is the men's dorm.

158
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,530
And you are a girl.

159
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,930
If you come in casually like this,

160
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,420
people will misunderstand.

161
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,150
Please conduct yourself with dignity.

162
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,660
Also,

163
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,550
since the Academy separates male and female students,

164
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,300
it means they don't want us to have too many interactions.

165
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,210
So, in the future,

166
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,750
Senior Song,

167
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,350
you'd better not see me again.

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,910
If there's nothing else,

169
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,870
please go back.

170
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,390
Feiniang.

171
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,620
Brother.

172
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,310
Brother.

173
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,720
I miss Mom.

174
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,360
I miss her too.

175
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,820
I'll take good care of you in her place.

176
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,950
It's all because I'm so useless.

177
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,200
I couldn't even

178
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,550
keep the only bracelet she left behind.

179
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,430
You can't even have it as a souvenir.

180
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,320
It's easy

181
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,820
to pawn something but hard to redeem it.

182
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,830
If you don't pull strings,

183
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,770
it's hard to redeem it even if you offer more money.

184
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,990
If someone takes it…

185
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm so useless.

186
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,750
Brother.

187
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,420
You just said that we need to pull strings.

188
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,510
We can go to Miss Yan.

189
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,120
She will find a way.

190
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,770
No.

191
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,020
She has helped us a lot.

192
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,190
We can't trouble her anymore.

193
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,810
Brother, don't think about it.

194
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,870
Isn't Mother's stuff more important than that?

195
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,670
Brother.

196
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,190
Leave it to me.

197
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:18,940
I'll handle it.

198
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,980
Feiniang!

199
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:52,930
Cai.

200
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,320
I‘’ve done what you asked.

201
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,650
Senior Yan.

202
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:34,910
Junior Zhou.

203
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,030
Senior Yan.

204
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,770
Why are you here?

205
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,400
I...

206
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,130
By the way,

207
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,300
I heard about your mother.

208
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,310
Feiniang told you?

209
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,330
I've promised her

210
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,750
I will help with the bracelet.

211
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,660
She went to trouble you after all.

212
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,720
Don't blame Miss Fei.

213
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,839
I think she misses your mother.

214
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,619
I should have done it.

215
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,099
It's nothing.

216
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,900
I can't repay

217
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,380
your great kindness.

218
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,630
Junior Zhou, you're welcome.

219
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,780
By the way,

220
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,260
if you're free the day after tomorrow,

221
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,980
I'd like to ask you out.

222
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,660
Let's find a place,

223
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,480
and I'll paint a portrait for you.

224
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,240
Well...

225
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,380
I don't have enough money

226
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,920
to repay you.

227
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,710
If I don't do anything,

228
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,970
I'll feel sorry.

229
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,840
All right.

230
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,470
I'm going back now, Junior Zhou.

231
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,500
Okay.

232
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,430
-See you, Senior Yan.
-See you.

233
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,140
Yueniang.

234
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,360
Why are you back so late?

235
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,990
You didn't show up at dinner.

236
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,910
Go inside.

237
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,700
The dishes are already cold. I'll reheat them for you.

238
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,410
I'm fine.

239
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,370
Mother, I'm not hungry.

240
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,940
Wait.

241
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,280
What's wrong with you?

242
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,080
Nothing.

243
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,240
What happened?

244
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,280
Where have you been?

245
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,310
Nowhere.

246
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:55,910
Mother.

247
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,020
I just scraped it when climbing the wall.

248
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,940
I'll go back to my room now.

249
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,730
Yueniang.

250
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,630
Those scoundrels

251
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,100
are so lawless.

252
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,610
They dare kidnap a student

253
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,660
from the Women's Academy in broad daylight.

254
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,680
No.

255
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,030
I can't let my parents know.

256
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,010
What's going on?

257
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,360
Let me see. What's wrong?

258
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,150
Let me see.

259
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,150
Look. No way.

260
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,840
Could it be true?

261
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,680
We go to school together.

262
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,180
Bad luck. Bah!

263
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,740
And there is even ragged cloth as evidence. What's going on?

264
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,750
Don't say that.

265
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,210
We don't know what exactly happened.

266
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,550
Yeah, how could they do that?

267
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,610
Right. How can she live in the future?

268
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
[The student from the Women's Academy, Song's Academy, brazenly committed adultery, with the ragged cloth as evidence]

269
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,550
But the fabric

270
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,840
does look similar to that of Zhu's clothes.

271
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,510
Morning.

272
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,890
Morning. Morning.

273
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,640
It can't be true, can it?

274
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,390
I don't know.

275
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,500
What are you looking at? What's there to look at?

276
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,640
It's all fake.

277
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,560
Yes, it's fake. Yes, yes.

278
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,390
Let's go to class.

279
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,870
Good it's nothing. Let's go.

280
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,830
Let's go.

281
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,070
Yueniang.

282
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,090
What...

283
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,050
What happened?

284
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,490
Second Sister, you don't trust me, either?

285
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,510
I'm worried about you.

286
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,670
It's okay. Let's go to class first.

287
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,250
In that case,

288
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,130
Miss Song Zhu won't be able to get married ever.

289
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,620
Judging from her reaction,

290
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,260
it's most likely true.

291
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,510
I think so, too.

292
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,320
Why is it so noisy before class?

293
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,760
Do you need to use your mouth to study?

294
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,190
Or do you want to be punished by the teacher?

295
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,110
Sit down.

296
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,230
Is it true?

297
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,670
I think it's fake.

298
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,430
Zhu.

299
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,400
Zhu.

300
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,070
Zhu.

301
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,900
Zhu.

302
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,790
Junior Ding, come here.

303
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,610
Come here.

304
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,660
Senior Song, you want to see me?

305
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,460
Let me ask you.

306
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,540
Did something happen in the Academy?

307
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,810
Well...

308
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,330
Something related to me?

309
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,560
Yueniang.

310
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,980
Slow down.

311
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,770
Why

312
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,520
is she always in a flurry recently?

313
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,440
If you want to see it,

314
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,340
I'll show you.

315
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,310
It's just like what's written on the paper.

316
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,320
The ragged cloth is indeed mine.

317
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,400
That means it's true.

318
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,030
However...

319
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,260
Get me a glass of water.

320
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,750
How can you be sure

321
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,630
that I slept with someone only judging by a piece of ragged cloth?

322
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,240
What the poster said

323
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,920
was a distorted fact.

324
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,900
I came to the Academy yesterday afternoon

325
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,590
to deal with something personal.

326
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,830
Then I was kidnapped by some rascal.

327
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,040
The cloth was torn?

328
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,110
There was a rascal?

329
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,660
She was kidnapped?

330
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,940
Can anyone break in?

331
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:45,740
After a while,

332
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,690
I was brought to a house by that rascal.

333
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,800
He

334
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,700
tore my clothes and let me go.

335
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,140
He tore her clothes!

336
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,880
I didn't know what was going on,

337
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,090
but now I do.

338
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,350
That pervert just wants to spread rumors

339
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,620
to frame me and ruin my reputation.

340
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,260
So,

341
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,290
please stop making trouble

342
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,760
and spreading rumors anymore.

343
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,670
That's just your side of words.

344
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,610
Why should we believe you?

345
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,520
That's right.

346
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,890
That's right.

347
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,090
Right?

348
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,850
I...

349
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,340
We are all students of Yiyang Academy.

350
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,910
Why don't you trust me

351
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,900
but would rather trust an outsider's words?

352
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,430
Your clothes are torn like that.

353
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,200
No matter how you explain it, it's useless.

354
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,280
That's too much.

355
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,020
She's only a girl.

356
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,980
But then again,

357
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,440
why didn't those rascals

358
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,810
pick on other students but only you?

359
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,270
You are right.

360
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,780
Flies don't sting seamless eggs.

361
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,990
I'm a fly.

362
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,390
I don't sting seamless eggs.

363
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,010
You...

364
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,840
I'm telling the truth,

365
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,150
believe it or not.

366
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,050
She's angry.

367
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,000
Besides,

368
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,290
no matter if it's me

369
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,610
or someone else,

370
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,360
whether it's a woman or a man being framed,

371
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,350
no one should criticize the victim.

372
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,560
Because the victim

373
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,070
shouldn't be blamed

374
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,660
with any reason by anyone.

375
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,740
The offender is always the one who should be blamed.

376
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,080
You don't investigate

377
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,600
who trespassed the Academy;

378
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,270
instead, you are gathered here to criticize the victim.

379
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,960
Is this the attitude

380
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,640
one with morality should have?

381
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,510
By the way,

382
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,820
it suddenly occurred to me

383
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,630
that you are engaged.

384
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,530
-Who is it?
-She's engaged?

385
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,020
Who?

386
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,510
Who is it?

387
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,140
It's...

388
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,050
Now I remember.

389
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,260
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

390
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,680
Where's he?

391
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,980
Where?

392
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,030
He resigned!

393
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,150
Well...

394
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,740
I'm not trying to stir up trouble.

395
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,600
I just feel a little bit of pity for you.

396
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
You've got into trouble again and again.

397
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,820
I'm afraid

398
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,380
no man will dare to accept you anymore.

399
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,350
Speaking of which...

400
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:20,840
Shut…

401
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,100
You don't have to worry about that, Mr. Li.

402
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,000
Even if other men don't want her,

403
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:32,950
I do.

404
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,190
Teaching Assistant Xiao does live up to his reputation.

405
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,750
What are they…

406
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,110
I'm the one who's engaged to Zhu.

407
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,160
I'm also the one who will protect her in the future.

408
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,160
You don't believe her?

409
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,000
I do.

410
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,110
He's hugging her.

411
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,050
Besides,

412
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,720
what happened today is not good for Zhu's reputation.

413
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,550
I hope you won't mention it again.

414
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,110
If I ever hear about this from anyone,

415
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,000
don't blame me for not considering our relationship as old classmates.

416
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,280
All right.

417
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,270
Everyone, just go back.

418
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,300
Let's go.

419
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,750
Let me send you home.

420
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,050
Look.

421
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,280
Feiniang, go back first.

422
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,720
I'll go back then?

423
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,680
Qinruo, let's go.

424
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:50,880
Let's go!

425
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,490
Senior Yan.

426
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,250
Everyone has left.

427
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,090
Let's go back, too.

428
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:03,840
Let's go.

429
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,780
Senior Yan, do you feel bitter inside?

430
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,610
Not really.

431
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,480
I just think I was so stupid.

432
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,770
What about you?

433
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,990
I wish Mr. Xiao and Senior Song all the best.

434
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,160
If you're still unhappy,

435
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,410
I have a good place to go.

436
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,690
Waiter.

437
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,720
Another portion of Honey Ribs

438
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,520
and wine.

439
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,720
No more wine.

440
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,120
Just something to eat.

441
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,550
That's all.

442
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,650
Okay, sir.

443
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,890
You don't even want a piece?

444
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,550
I'm not hungry. You eat.

445
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,750
Order more if it's not enough.

446
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,490
Are you not eating because you don't have enough money?

447
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,320
I didn't bring any money.

448
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,390
Don't worry.

449
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,950
I won't leave you here as a pledge.

450
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,940
Don't worry. Eat on.

451
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:45,850
Here.

452
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,600
Come on, take a bite.

453
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,310
Don't you like it?

454
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,160
Actually,

455
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,790
you are a good girl.

456
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,640
Zhou Ji mistreated you.

457
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,910
He's not the right person for you.

458
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,030
Maybe this could be a blessing for you.

459
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,710
I mean

460
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,270
you don't have to

461
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,040
be so low-spirited and gluttonous

462
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,370
just because of this.

463
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,130
I'm not eating anymore.

464
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,080
Why not?

465
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,030
There are still so many dishes.

466
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,930
You said I'm gluttonous.

467
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,650
That's not what I meant.

468
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,190
Just kidding.

469
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,740
You still have the mood to joke?

470
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,510
Give me one of those.

471
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:12,920
This?

472
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,320
If I say I'm fine,

473
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,580
it must be a lie.

474
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,940
Actually, everything between Zhou Ji and I,

475
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,350
from the day we met

476
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,500
until today,

477
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,710
seems different from what I imagined.

478
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,220
I thought I would lose my appetite for days

479
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,140
and then couldn't sleep for days.

480
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,350
But after I cried

481
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,260
and ate some food,

482
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,140
I don't think it's a big deal.

483
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,430
Maybe

484
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,910
I was obsessed with my own fantasy.

485
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,260
Maybe after today,

486
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,340
I'll be the same old Song Zhu again.

487
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,090
Okay.

488
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,250
I hope...

489
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,150
I wish

490
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
to see

491
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,740
the original Song Zhu sooner.

492
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,650
Here come the Honey Ribs.

493
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,230
Please enjoy.

494
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,520
According to the book,

495
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,170
eating sweets can make you happy.

496
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,230
In the entire Yiyang,

497
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,990
this dessert is the sweetest.

498
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,260
Senior Yan,

499
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,200
have some more.

500
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,350
You'll feel better after eating this.

501
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,940
Thank you.

502
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,190
Senior Yan.

503
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,520
Is the drink not sweet enough?

504
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,030
No.

505
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,570
It's sweet.

506
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,280
Junior Zhou,

507
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,780
don't worry.

508
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,290
I'm fine now.

509
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,230
You, too. Have some.

510
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:10,650
Okay.

511
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,500
Look at the homemade fans.

512
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,200
By the way,

513
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,390
thank you for what happened in the Academy today.

514
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,470
Also,

515
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,000
what happened yesterday...

516
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,220
Did you get hurt yesterday?

517
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:34,870
No.

518
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,320
That's good.

519
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,110
It is not like you.

520
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,660
You didn't even ask what happened.

521
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:44,960
As you said,

522
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,180
those who should be criticized are the ones who hurt people

523
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,170
instead of the victims.

524
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,270
If you are fine,

525
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,490
everything else doesn't matter anymore.

526
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,520
All right.

527
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,830
Don't worry.

528
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,470
I'm a man who will live up to his word.

529
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,550
I will not only trust you,

530
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,810
but also protect you.

531
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,750
After all, I'm engaged to you.

532
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,600
You made such a scene in the county government

533
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,750
and made things worse.

534
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,620
If I hadn't come back,

535
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,850
how would you end it?

536
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,530
How did you know I went to the county government?

537
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,150
Though I was not in Yiyang,

538
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,500
I did know some things.

539
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,470
If I'm not mistaken,

540
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,380
the person who did it was related to the county government. Right?

541
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,850
It must be Zhao Shoucai's man.

542
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,430
Zhao Shoucai.

543
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,560
Fine, I'll help you with this.

544
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,160
No, you can't be stupid.

545
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,420
Those people are rascals.

546
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,220
I know what to do.

547
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,700
You're home.

548
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,580
I won't send you in.

549
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,650
Okay.

550
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,690
By the way,

551
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,620
wait for me. I'll go get something.

552
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:24,550
[Song Mansion]

553
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:33,770
What?

554
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,550
My father's letter.

555
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,480
[To Xiao Chuanzhong]

556
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,850
I finally got it!

557
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
It's a letter to break off the engagement.

558
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,440
Your father agreed to break off the engagement?

559
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,570
Zhu,

560
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,650
there are still rumors about you.

561
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,150
If you break off the engagement now,

562
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,520
the rumors will get worse, won't they?

563
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,350
Besides,

564
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,280
someone will definitely doubt your reason to break off the engagement.

565
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,690
As a righteous woman,

566
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,810
I'm not afraid of rumors.

567
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,040
I'm very grateful for what you did

568
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,680
in the Academy today.

569
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,440
But forget about those words

570
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,740
that you have to be accountable for me.

571
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,800
I don't need anyone to be accountable for me.

572
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,160
I can be accoutable for myself.

573
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,140
Zhu,

574
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,870
I know you hate me.

575
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,750
-But I just…
-I don't hate you.

576
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,240
I...

577
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,210
I said those things that day just because I was angry.

578
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,460
Then why did you insist on breaking off the engagement?

579
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,840
Once the engagement is broken off,

580
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,800
we don't have to

581
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,080
bear moral pressure anymore.

582
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,150
Our marriages won't have anything to do with each other.

583
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,440
You don't still want to marry Zhou Ji, do you?

584
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,970
Have you forgotten

585
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,730
what I said in the restaurant?

586
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,080
I'm not in a hurry to get married.

587
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
I just feel

588
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,590
I'm free now.

589
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,450
That's good.

590
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,700
That's good.

591
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,120
Yeah.

592
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,130
It's good to be free.

593
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,480
All right, stop your silly laugh.

594
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,220
Go back to the dorm.

595
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,690
I'm leaving.

596
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,620
Zhu,

597
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,180
are we still friends?

598
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,490
Of course.

599
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,590
Take me whenever you need me.

600
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,840
For example, beating the drum.

601
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:47,920
I'll accompany you to beat the drum in the future.

602
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,710
Huh.

603
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,880
Sometimes,

604
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,290
he's pretty cute.
