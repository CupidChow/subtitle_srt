00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,620
What are you doing?

5
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,789
I just want to know

6
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,670
when it started.

7
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,000
Why are you shy?

8
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,840
It's...

9
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,550
What are you doing?

10
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,970
Aren't you also shy?

11
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,870
Annoying.

12
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,790
Have a seat.

13
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,730
You haven't told me

14
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,020
when it started.

15
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,550
Since a long time ago.

16
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,970
Since a long time ago?

17
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,760
How good am I?

18
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,550
Very good.

19
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,579
Xiao Yu.

20
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,900
You're actually very good, too.

21
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,930
I've learned a truth recently.

22
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,450
What is it?

23
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,540
If you don't want regrets,

24
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,910
you should learn to cherish the present.

25
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,200
It's a little profound.

26
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,280
Have you ever experienced the taste of losing?

27
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,920
What do you want to say?

28
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,470
I want to say

29
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,140
you should learn

30
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,150
to cherish the people around you.

31
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,660
So you just want to ask me

32
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,510
to cherish you.

33
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,779
Why did you say it out loud?

34
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,519
Annoying.

35
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,600
I figured it out

36
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,550
and told you, but that's not right, is it?

37
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,910
So embarrassing.

38
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,830
Why did you run away?

39
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,520
Why did you run away again?

40
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,670
It's not dark yet.

41
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,880

45
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,550
You come here very often.

46
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,350
We're acquaintances.

47
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,590
No need to be polite.

49
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,270
Thank you, Prince Fu.

What brings you here

in the middle of the night?

52
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,390
Your Highness is busy.

53
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,910
I won't beat around the bush.

54
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,790
Have you heard

55
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,920
what Song Xu's second son Song Yang

56
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,510
mentioned in the court today?

57
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,110
I rarely interfere with the affairs of the court.

58
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,600
What do you want to say?

59
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,550
Song Yang

60
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,350
not only advised the emperor

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,910
on tax reform

62
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,430
but also collected public opinion from the people.

The people are all on his side.

64
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,040
It has aroused public discussion.

65
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,070
What does it have to do with me?

66
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,790
Your Highness is wise.

67
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,110
You're not involved in politics.

68
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,130
But the viscount...

69
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,150

[The Purple Aura Comes from the East]

in front of His Majesty.

73
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,440
The public has been talking about it.

However,

76
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,390
have you ever worried?

77
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,830
Although Song Yang wins the people's support,

78
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,000
he has offended the officials.

79
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,390
What do you think about

80
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,150
the tax reform?

81
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,430
Is my opinion important?

82
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,830
I have always respected

ask them why they haven't replied

Tell them I want to invite them to meet me in Yiyang.

If anything happens,

106

Go.

110
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,830
So you already knew.

111
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,690
You intercepted my letter.

112
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,600
Can't you let me check the reason?

113
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,920
I apologize to you.

114
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,910
I was wrong

115
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,430
to impersonate others before.

116
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,590
It's okay.

117
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,860
Mr. Song.

118
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,910
Since you've already determined that I'm working for the Crown Prince,

119
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,610
why didn't you expose me?

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,549
Why should I?

121
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,309
Aren't you afraid?

122
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,830
What's there to be afraid of?

123
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,830
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Song.

and say goodbye to you.

128
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,900
Say goodbye?

Are you going home?

Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

131

You don't want me to leave?

132
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,630
I do. I really do.

133
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,030
I'm just going out of town for some business.

134
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,160
I'll be back soon.

135
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,130
Did something happen?

136
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,180
No.

Don't worry.

144
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,610
Wait for me.

145
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,700
Aren't you only going out of town for a few days?

146
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
It's not like you're not coming back.

147
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,510
Don't pretend to be so sophisticated.

148
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,230
Go.

149
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,470
Hurry up.

150
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,910
I'm leaving.

151
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,750
Go.

152
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,560
Don't move this box.

153
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,510
I'll take it with me.

154
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:47,950
Okay.

155
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,750
Don't.

156
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,590
This...

157
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,240
You can't put these together.

158
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,640
You can't move them together.

159
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,390
Okay.

160
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,420
I'm so mad.

161
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,790
My Lady.

162
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,900
Lady Yan.

163
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,700
Why are you so angry?

164
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,540
Sorry for making you laugh.

165
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,750
Originally, I asked the mansion to send a boat here

166
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,600
to take away the stuff of mine,

167
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,110
Zhou Ji, and Feiniang together.

168
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,510
I didn’t expect

169
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,470
they would rent such a small boat.

170
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,670
It's that tiny.

171
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,260
It's not enough to even carry my own things.

172
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:27,780
Yuanzhen.

173
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,130
Have you done

174
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,070
what I asked you to do?

175
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,150
Soon.

176
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,700
She'll be back in a few days.

177
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,950
Okay.

178
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,440
I'll wait for your good news in the inn.

179
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,470
Lady Yan.

180
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,390
Don't be angry.

181
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,610
Just hire another boat.

182
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,750
Carry this one with care.

183
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,600
But Yiyang is not a business place.

184
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,660
There aren't many boats.

185
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,400
Plus, this place suddenly closed down.

186
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,750
Doesn't every family need to hire boats?

187
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,470
They said

188
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,670
they could only make one more round trip,

189
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,700
and this time they would take back most of my luggage first.

190
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,080
But they asked me to stay here

191
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,960
for five or six days

192
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,340
and wait for them to come back.

193
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,330
Well,

194
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,430
everyone is gone.

195
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,760
How can I stay?

196
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,070
-Ridiculous.
-Lady Yan.

197
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,040
Don't the Song family have boats?

198
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,080
Why don't you borrow one from Lady Zhu?

199
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,910
The Song family?

200
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,580
No. Forget it.

201
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,310
Lady Yan.

202
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,510
Are you really going to

203
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,990
stop contacting Miss Zhu forever?

204
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,710
I can see that

205
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,030
she cares about you.

206
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,310
Forget it.

207
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,430
I'll figure it out myself.

208
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,950
Lady Zhao?

209
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,310
Why are you here?

210
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,660
Come, have a seat.

211
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,470
What's wrong?

212
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,390
Did something happen?

213
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,190
Lady Zhu.

214
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,330
I'm not here for myself.

215
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,350
Then for whom?

216
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,270
Did something happen to Qinruo?

217
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,830
Don't be nervous.

218
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,850
It's not a big deal.

219
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,360
It's that Qinruo couldn't hire a boat to move her luggage

220
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,550
and wanted to borrow one from you.

221
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,030
But she didn't want to lose face.

222
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,860
So she asked me to say this.

223
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,110
So this is the reason.

224
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,270
Okay, leave it to me.

225
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:39,970
Don't worry.

226
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,390
It's a mess.

227
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,780
Let me make it clear.

228
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,990
If you can't

229
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,990
sort out these things today,

230
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,070
I won't go back.

231
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,750
My Lady. Don't be angry.

232
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,100
The boat has been settled.

233
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,440
Have you borrowed one?

234
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,860
Lady Zhu lent us one.

235
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,310
The butler of the Song family

236
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,630
has already come and arranged everything for us.

237
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,270
Yueniang.

238
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,150
-My Lady.
-Thank you.

239
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,870
Did you pack up?

240
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,050
How did you know I wanted to borrow a boat?

241
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,560
Miss Yan is going back,

242
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,950
but there's no boat.

243
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,700
Everyone in your mansion has been spreading the news.

244
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,630
Everyone in Yiyang knows about it.

245
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,810
How can I not know?

246
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,260
Yueniang, I...

247
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,310
Alright.

248
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,790
There are so many things to move.

249
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,070
Let me help you.

250
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,510
Look at you.

251
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,350
I told you to buy less.

252
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,350
You bought so many things.

253
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,110
Do you regret it now?

254
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,110
Don't I have your boat now?

255
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,530
Let me do it.

256
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,830
How can Miss Yan's hands get dirty?

257
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,250
Let me do it.

258
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,900
You must be tired these days.

259
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,530
You usually buy so many things.

260
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,400
It's hard to pack them up.

261
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,420
Why do you say the same thing as Yueniang?

262
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,180
Did I buy a lot?

263
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,910
No.

264
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm worried that you'll be tired.

265
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,560
And I can't help you in your dorm.

266
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,430
Don't worry. It's all packed.

267
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,750
But when I think about leaving the academy,

268
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,440
I feel reluctant.

269
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,750
Miss Song Zhu must be the one you miss the most.

270
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,020
Alright.

271
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,390
Don't think too much.

272
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,010
Besides, you'll meet again.

273
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,790
After your imperial examination,

274
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,630
let's come back to Yiyang to have a look.

275
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:19,770
Chuxing.

276
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,430
Why do I feel the atmosphere today is weird?

277
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,319
Everyone in the palace seems down.

278
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,690
His Highness is resting.

279
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,850
The servants don't dare to make noise.

280
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,280
Your Highness hasn't come for days.

281
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,700
I'm afraid you forgot.

282
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,310
The Eastern Palace is always like this.

283
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,470
By the way,

284
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,610
how is Fifth Brother lately?

285
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,310
I think he recovered well last time.

286
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,070
I shall leave now.

287
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,180
Your Highness.

288
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,390
Please.

289
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,230
Okay.

290
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,330
Young Master.

291
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,590
Don't go in.

292
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,430
Let me give Fifth Brother a surprise.

293
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,430
Young...

294
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,620
Greetings, Your...

295
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,590
Fifth Brother.

296
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,840
How did this happen?

297
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,970
Aren't you much better now?

298
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,590
Seventh Brother.

299
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,590
You broke your promise.

300
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,200
You promised to bring Miss Song Zhu here.

301
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,680
Do you want to see her?

302
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,160
I...

303
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,870
Don't.

304
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,460
Don't scare her.

305
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,320
How's your card game practice?

306
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,620
I'm really a master now.

307
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,260
Fifth Brother.

308
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,810
Get up. Let's play together.

309
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,730
Wait for me.

310
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:57,990
I'll wait for you.

311
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:00,650
Fifth Brother.

312
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,640
This is your secret letter.

313
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,820
I did what you asked me to do.

314
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,240
Thank you

315
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,630
for these days.

316
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,990
Seventh Brother.

317
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,060
Thank you.

318
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,550
Fifth Brother.

319
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,990
You...

320
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,210
I have many interesting things to tell you.

321
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,650
Don't you like it?

322
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,320
Do you want to listen?

323
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,910
Let me tell you.

324
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,870
Okay.

325
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,190
Stop talking.

326
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,470
I'll go first.

327
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,500
Okay.

328
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,030
You

329
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,100
must keep the letter well.

330
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,750
If the reform fails,

331
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,680
get out the letter.

332
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,990
Tell them I forced Mr. Song to support me.

333
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,120
Understand?

334
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,350
Also,

335
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,520
the corruption...

336
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,830
And those corrupt officials...

337
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,590
I'm counting on you.

338
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,190
You must support His Majesty

339
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,360
to eliminate corrupt officials

340
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,910
for the people...

341
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,470
Fifth Brother.

342
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,950
Guards!

343
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,150
Help!

344
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,020
Guards!

345
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,520
Guards!

346
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,440
Fifth Brother.

347
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,230
Guards!

348
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,130
Help!

349
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:56,870
Fifth Brother.

350
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,330
Hurry.

351
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,120
Come on.

352
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,470
Your Highness.

353
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,670
Your Highness.

354
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,310
Here.

355
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,190
Fifth Brother.

356
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,980
Stop talking. Get some rest.

357
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,520
No.

358
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,990
Many officials support the reform.

359
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,470
They are all Song Xu's students.

360
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,390
Wan Li is going to kill Mr. Song.

361
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,270
You must save him.

362
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,190
Do you remember?

363
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,470
Seventh Brother.

364
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,480
Do you recall when we were young

365
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,350
and His Majesty often said we were like the same?

366
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,340
But I think

367
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,750
we are the same.

368
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,660
You were my eyes

369
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,320
and saw the mountains and rivers for me.

370
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,070
I told His Majesty

371
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,700
you don't have to come

372
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,190
to my funeral.

373
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,310
You'll be forgiven.

374
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,780
After I leave,

375
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,190
you need to do your job.

376
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,510
Fifth Brother, don't talk nonsense.

377
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,870
You'll get better.

378
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,770
I know my health.

379
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,560
Finish this path for me.

380
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,640
Protect the people you want to protect.

381
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:10,980
Alright.

382
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,750
I'm done talking.

383
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,750
Tell me about your interesting stories.

384
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,470
Tell me.

385
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,420
I'm listening.

386
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,470
Ever since you left,

387
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,890
every time that kid saw me on the street,

388
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,270
he would take away all the cards.

389
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,130
It's all my fault.

390
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,490
Look how badly I scared him.

391
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,960
Once,

392
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,910
Uncle Hu and I passed by

393
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,780
and gave him a string of candied haws.

394
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,040
We reconciled after that.

395
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,990
I also told him

396
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,560
that the bad guy would bring him a lot of delicious food.

397
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,630
Later, every time he saw me,

398
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,410
he would ask me

399
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,530
when the bad guy would come.

400
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,070
One day,

401
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,550
the kid came with his father.

402
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,010
He pointed at me and said I was a good guy.

403
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,610
I thought his father came to get even with me.

404
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,830
I didn't expect his father to buy me a drink.

405
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,050
Uncle Hu was also drunk that day.

406
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,500
That kid asked me,

407
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,050
"You and that bad guy who likes food..."

408
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,200
The bad guy...

409
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,810
Fifth Brother.

410
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,000
Young Master.

411
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,000
Take care.

412
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,980
Uncle Hu.

413
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,230
You don't have to accompany me.

414
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,930
Go back.

415
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,070
But...

416
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,500
I haven't completed the mission

417
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,210
the Crown Prince appointed to me.

418
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,150
You've done a good job.

419
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,040
The Crown Prince asked you to protect me, right?

420
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,580
Look.

421
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,490
I'm fine.

422
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,200
I...

423
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,680
Uncle Hu.

424
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,290
You belong to the martial world.

425
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,710
The martial world is the most comfortable place for you.

426
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,110
Things in the palace are not for you.

427
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,610
From now on,

428
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,550
I will walk my own way.

429
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,340
Young Master.

430
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,560
Wherever you are, it's the martial world.

431
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,370
If you need anything,

432
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,280
I'll be there.

433
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,490
Young Master.

434
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,050
Uncle Hu.

435
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,180
Get up.

436
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,180
Take care.

437
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,510
I'll take my leave.

438
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,300
Be careful.

439
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,380
Carry these things on the boat.

440
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:21,850
Yes.

441
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,710
You lost again.

442
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:47,990
Well.

443
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,710
I didn't lose.

444
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,720
Why are you always cheating?

445
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,150
I...

446
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,910
I... Well.

447
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,240
Why don't you play seriously?

448
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,110
You cheated.

449
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,070
You insisted that I was cheating.

450
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,790
I was not.

451
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,310
I...

452
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,710
Stop cheating.

453
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,840
I'll run with you carrying the robe.

454
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,870
Don't catch me.

455
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,590
I...

456
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,620
You stay in the palace every day.

457
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,370
Aren't you bored?

458
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,710
No.

459
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,070
I think it's good.

460
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,900
This is my life.

461
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,300
Unlike you.

462
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,550
I...

463
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:29,990
Again?

464
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,870
You can't drink it when you're coughing.

465
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,920
I heard from Diao that

466
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,230
you still won't take the medicine, right?

467
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,750
You said you would bring it for me.

468
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,630
You promised me to take the medicine.

469
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:17,660
Well...

470
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,610
I was wrong.

471
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,220
What did you do wrong?

472
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,780
Everything.

473
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,480
Alright?

474
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,070
Take the medicine.

475
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,540
Wan Li is going to kill Mr. Song.

476
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,390
You have to finish the path I haven't finished.

477
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,430
Protect the people you want to protect.

478
00:30:59,390 --> 00:30:59,880
Be careful.

479
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,100
Be careful.

480
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,910
Be careful.

481
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,000
The things inside...

482
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,830
If they're broken,

483
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,070
you won't be able to pay for any one of them.

484
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,740
Yueniang.

485
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,830
I'm here to see you off.

487
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,020
I really don't want to leave you.

488
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,550
Silly.

489
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,590
If you miss me,

490
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,750
write to me.

491
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,200
Or I can visit you in Luoyang.

492
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,750
It's a deal.

493
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,160
You must come on my next birthday.

494

Even if anyone else doesn't go, I will.

495

How did you know...

497
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,000
Have you checked everything?

498
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,550
What are you doing?

499
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,470
They are watching. Let go.

Go back.

572
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:08,820
Stop here.

573
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,970
♫After letting go of worries, the world seems wider♫

574
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,280
I'll miss you.

575
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,280
Me too.

576
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,760
♫I care about you until the end of the world♫

577
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,080
♫I miss you only♫

578
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,510
It's cold. Remember to put on more clothes.

579
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,340
♫Hoping for a return, but no one answers♫

580
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,230
Mr. Zhou.

581
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,130
♫Ah, tired birds behind fences, enduring winter and summer♫

582
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,410
Take good care of Qinruo.

583
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,180
Otherwise, I won't go easy on you.

584
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,400
♫Radiant youth♫

585
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,300
Okay.

586
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,900
♫The wind and sand that cannot be held♫

587
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,050
♫Close at hand, yet far away♫

588
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,510
There are many people at the dock.

589
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,630
Don't cry in public.

590
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,680
It's embarrassing.

591
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,580
Just go.

592
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,340
Yueniang.

593
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,880
Take care.

594
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,110
Got it.

595
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,050
The boat's draft position is abnormal.

596
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,150
What are you looking at?

597
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,700
Nothing.

598
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,630
I'm hungry.

599
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,170
Treat me to Lyu Fu Shop.

600
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:34,710
Let's go.

601
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,380
Go that way.

602
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,030
Why are you looking at me?

603
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,760
Why do you always go to the Lyu Fu Shop?

604
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,310
Just treat me.

605
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:47,910
Let's go now.

606
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:53,790
My Lord.

607
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,310
The stuff is loaded.

608
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,990
Okay, let's go.

609
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,480
Yes.

610
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,040
Father.

611
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,990
What's on the boat?

612
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:03,690
Nothing.

613
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,760
It's not your classmate's boat.

614
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,600
We were talking about business.

615
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,230
Really?

616
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,320
Yes.

617
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,280
Get in.

618
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,670
Is that an official ship?

619
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:46,990
Get over there.

620
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,710
What are you doing?

621
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,750
Stop right now.

622
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,800
My luggage.

623
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,130
Give it to me.

624
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:32,500
[Duke Yue's Mansion]

625
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,590
That's mine.

626
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,600
I want it.

627
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,670
Dongmei.

628
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,730
Why are you holding a vase?

629
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,360
How dare you!

630
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,670
Put them down!

631
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,000
Put them down!

632
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:58,920
My Lady.

633
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,420
My Lady.

634
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,990
Miss Yan.

635
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,950
Do you still think you're a noble lady?

636
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,000
Your father and brother

637
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,670
were arrested by the people of the Supreme Court.

638
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,280
What did you say?

639
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,990
What did you say?

640
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:08,780
Make it clear.

641
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,010
Isn't it clear enough?

642
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,550
This place will be closed soon.

643
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,230
Let go!

644
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,350
Let go!

645
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,010
Let's go.

646
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,670
Miss Yan.

647
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,870
What happened?

648
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,930
How?

649
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,370
What happened?

650
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:39,890
What should I do?

651
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,630
My father.

652
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,350
My brother.

653
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,120
I don't know where they are.

654
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,810
I have nothing now.

655
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,750
What should I do?

656
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,420
You still have me.

657
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,310
Brother.

658
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,510
Someone is here.

659
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,770
Lady Yan, I'm late.

660
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,710
Who are you?

661
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,490
My name is Wan Li.

662
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,390
An officer of the Bureau of Military Affairs.

663
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,730
Duke Yue asked me to take care of you.

664
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,620
Come with me now.

665
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:53,850
Greetings, Lord Wan.

666
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,810
How are my father and brother now?

667
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,190
Just call me Uncle Wan.

668
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,880
Your father and brother are not doing well.

669
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,990
They were arrested by the Supreme Court.

670
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,870
I can't ask about it.

671
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,430
But I will figure out a way

672
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,760
to let you meet them.

673
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:14,960
Don't worry.

674
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,200
Thank you, Uncle Wan.

675
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:23,250
Is this Zhou Ji, Mr. Zhou?

676
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,230
Greetings, Lord Wan.

677
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,420
I'm Zhou Ji. Nice to meet you.

678
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,390
You are indeed a talent.

679
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,430
Duke Yue has good taste.

680
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,330
Mr. Zhou.

681
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,330
Duke Yue has been asking me to help you with a job.

682
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,750
I happen to be short of men.

683
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,640
I plan to let you take over the position of Direct Scholar.

684
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,840
Get familiar with the process these days.

685
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,950
After the document is issued,

686
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,210
you can take office.

687
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,870
Thank you, Lord Wan.

688
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,380
I'll do my best.

689
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,710
I won't let you and Duke Yue down.

690
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,730
Then come back to my mansion and settle down.

691
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,370
Thank you, Lord Wan.
