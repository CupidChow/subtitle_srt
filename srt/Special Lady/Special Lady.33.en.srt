Come in.

8
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,090
Mr. Song, I'm back.

9
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,990
I heard about the crown prince.

10
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,510
I'm sorry for your loss.

11
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,480
Mr. Song,

12
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,310
what are you burning?

13
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,829
Yang has been arrested.

14
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,829
I think they'll be here soon.

15
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,220
Song Yang has been...

16
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,190
Yang sent a letter from the prison,

17
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,620
saying that Duke Yue was also arrested.

18
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,680
On the night he was arrested,

19
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,320
my boat was intercepted on the river.

20
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,160
They found a large amount of official silver on it.

21
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,360
I was set up.

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,680
They wanted to drag me into it, too.

23
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,000
No wonder. I thought the draft was not right at that time.

24
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,890
Mr. Song,

25
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,070
this doesn't necessarily have anything to do with Duke Yue.

26
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,400
When I saw Yan Qinruo at the time,

27
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,910
she didn't know about anything.

28
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,530
Besides,

29
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,470
I don't think she has the guts to do such a thing.

30
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,480
There must be someone else behind this.

31
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,140
The crown prince said they would come.

32
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,870
I didn't expect it to be so soon.

33
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,100
I'm still late.

34
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,390
Yan Qinruo is unsophisticated.

35
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,090
It's unlikely that she was involved.

36
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,070
Maybe, as you said,

37
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,990
even Duke Yue is a scapegoat.

38
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,880
Yu, can you promise me one thing?

39
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,470
Whatever you need me to do, Dean Song,

40
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,870
I'll do my best.

41
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,210
If something happens to the Song family,

42
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,630
please take care of Yueniang and the others for me.

44
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,590
Can you promise me?

45
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,830
I promise!

46
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,690
Mr. Song,

47
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,990
but you...

48
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,040
A clean hand wants no washing.

49
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,670

50
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,220
No,

Did someone die again?

Keep up.

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,120

Who told you to come?

66
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,180
How could you arrest people at will?

67
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,840
Do you have an arrest warrant?

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,050
Surely there's an arrest warrant.

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,770
Or should I say,

135
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,480
the one who will marry you can't be me.

136
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,970
So you've been lying to me all this time.

00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,650
By the way,

378
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,710
when Mr. Chen asked me to leave that day,

379
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,150
I remembered someone was burning paper money at the side.

380
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,370
Burning paper money?

381
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:07,700
Yes.

382
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,030
Lord Cao,

383
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,720
can't you really make an exception?

384
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,910
To be honest,

385
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,710
it's not that I don't want to help you.

386
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,780
It's just that this has tremendous implications in the capital.

387
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,430
I have a whole family

388
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,190
who rely on me.

389
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,480
I have to be responsible for my family.

390
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,080
It's really...

391
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,670
I see.

392
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,200
Sorry to bother you.

393
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,030
Miss Zhu.

394
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,520
Lord Cao, do you have any other way?

395
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,670
Miss Song Zhu.

396
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,150
Greetings, Lord Wan.

397
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,570
Have a seat.

398
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,710
Thank you, Lord Wan.

399
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,010
Miss Song Zhu, did you come to the capital

400
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,790
for the case of Dean Song?

401
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,670
Yes.

402
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,150
Did Dean Song ask you to come to me?

403
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,310
I came to the capital myself.

404
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,310
Actually,

405
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,340
I've visited several disciples of my father.

406
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,030
But they all said

407
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,480
you were the only one who could help me.

408
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,510
My father has been arrested.

409
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,990
And my two older brothers are also imprisoned one after another.

410
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,590
There are only my mother, my two sisters,

411
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,720
and me in our family.

412
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,990
The Academy has closed down,

413
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,720
and the students were dismissed.

414
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,110
I...

415
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,870
I can only come here to beg you.

416
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,720
If I can't save my father this time,

417
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,030
our Song family…

418
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,580
our Song family will be doomed.

419
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,480
Lord Wan, please offer us

420
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,360
a helping hand.

421
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,280
Please don't do this.

422
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,630
Get up, please.

423
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,710
Come on.

424
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,460
Sit down.

425
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,190
Don't worry.

426
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,850
I'm Dean's disciple.

427
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,430
I felt duty-bound to help.

428
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,390
Tell me.

429
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,910
What do you want me to do?

430
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,710
I heard that my father was imprisoned by the Supreme Court.

431
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,070
If possible,

432
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,610
I'd like you to take me to see my father

433
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,960
and my two brothers.

434
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,590
I want to see if they are doing well.

435
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,660
It's not difficult.

436
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,790
However, the Bureau of Military Affairs

437
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,790
is supposed to assist and supervise the case-solving.

438
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,950
I need some time

439
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,600
to manage the relationships.

440
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,590
If you don't mind,

441
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,160
you can stay here.

442
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,590
Rest assured.

443
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,520
In a few days,

444
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,960
I'll take you to meet your father and brothers.

445
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,990
Thank you, Lord Wan.

446
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,140
It's nothing.

447
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,820
Dean Song treated me well back then.

448
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,330
This is the least I could do for him.

449
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,900
Then I'll

450
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,630
ask them to clean up the Eastern Courtyard now.

451
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,930
You've just had a long journey.

452
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,190
You can take a rest now.

453
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,970
Thank you.

454
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,230
If you need anything,

455
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,590
just come to me.

456
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:17,960
Okay.

457
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,410
Mrs. Song.

458
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,520
Big Senior.

459
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,570
Second Senior.

460
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,790
Xiao...

461
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,630
Your Highness.

462
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,920
What are you doing here?

463
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,190
I just want to check on you.

464
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,410
There have been many misfortunes in your family recently.

465
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,070
I'm worried that you might...

466
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,880
Here are some gifts.

467
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,370
Please accept them.

468
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,560
Thank you for being so kind.

469
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,710
It's just that the Song family is not related to Your Highness,

470
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,180
so we won't bother you.

471
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,990
Rongniang, don't be rude.

472
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,520
Xiao…

473
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,040
You can just call me Chen Yan.

474
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,260
Your Highness.

475
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,100
Please take a seat.

476
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,480
Mrs. Song, you don't have to be so polite.

477
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,820
Yuniang, bring some tea for His Highness.

478
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,290
No need, Mrs. Song.

479
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,740
Please have a seat, too, Seniors.

480
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,510
Your Highness,

481
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,910
If you don't mind,

482
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,230
these snacks...

483
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,000
Mrs. Song,

484
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,720
you don't have to treat me as a guest.

485
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,250
It's not my first time here.

486
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,270
Yeah.

487
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,070
Your Highness,

488
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,780
can I say something?

489
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,230
Go ahead.

490
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,350
My husband,

491
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,790
my eldest son, and Yang

492
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,360
are all imprisoned in the Supreme Court now.

493
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,350
I'm worried every day.

494
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,910
I'm always worried

495
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,670
that now they left,

496
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,310
they can never come back.

497
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,470
Your Highness,

498
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,630
we have no connections in the imperial court.

499
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,140
If you can spare us,

500
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,190
I'll do anything for you

501
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,790
and be always grateful to you.

502
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,040
Mother.

503
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:06,870
Mrs. Song.

504
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,510
Mother.

505
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,370
Please get up.

506
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,110
What are you doing?

507
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,320
Please sit down.

508
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,160
-Your Highness.
-Mother.

509
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,000
There's nothing I can do.

510
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,410
Mother.

511
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,500
Mrs. Song,

512
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,180
don't worry.

513
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,800
I came to Yiyang

514
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,350
to investigate this.

515
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,310
If I can find any clues,

516
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,550
I'll risk my life

517
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,770
to protect Dean Song.

518
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,630
Do you also believe that my husband was wronged?

519
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,470
I do.

520
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,750
Good.

521
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,110
That's great. I'm glad to hear that.

522
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,580
With your words,

523
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,350
I'm relieved.

524
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,660
Mrs. Song, you must take care of yourself.

525
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,670
I believe Dean Song

526
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,980
wouldn't want to see you like this.

527
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,030
This is just a little money from me.

528
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,030
Please accept it.

529
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,510
No, Your Highness.

530
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,990
I really can't take it.

531
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,380
Do accept it, Mrs. Song.

532
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,150
Now that the Song family is in trouble

533
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,550
and there are no men here,

534
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,190
you'll inevitably need money to take care of everything.

535
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,250
Keep it now,

536
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,730
in case you need it someday.

537
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,380
By the way,

538
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,450
why isn't Miss Song Zhu here?

539
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,960
Yueniang went to the capital a few days ago.

540
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,950
Why did she go there?

541
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,600
To look for her father.

542
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,350
There are some of my husband's disciples in the capital.

543
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,870
She will try her luck with them one by one.

544
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,850
By the way,

545
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,330
she's been away for a few days.

546
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,850
It's time to send us a message.

547
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,470
Yueniang didn't have an accident, did she?

548
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,060
No.

549
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,000
I shouldn't have let her go alone.

550
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,750
Mrs. Song, don't worry.

551
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,690
Do you have

552
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,270
a list of the names of the disciples?

553
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,400
Can I have a look?

554
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,510
Yes.

555
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,870
Yuniang, go get it.

556
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,650
Yes.

557
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,030
Is there anything wrong?

558
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,710
No.

559
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,530
How about this?

560
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,280
I'll go back to the capital first.

561
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,290
If there is any news,

562
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,710
I'll let you know immediately.

563
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,480
Okay.

564
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,230
Please take care of Yueniang.

565
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,320
Mother.

566
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,790
Yueniang told me

567
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,030
the viscount had deceived her.

568
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,670
Besides, he may be involved in my father's imprisonment.

569
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,730
How dare you entrust Yueniang to him?

570
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,790
In my opinion,

571
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,630
he's genuinely in love with Yueniang.

572
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,810
Besides, Yueniang is alone outside.

573
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,200
She needs someone to look out for her.

574
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,830
Let's just take it one step at a time.

575
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,050
Miss Song Zhu did come to me a while ago,

576
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,830
but she didn't stay long.

577
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,980
Sorry.

578
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,050
[Cao Mansion]

579
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,370
Your Highness,

580
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,270
you'd better go somewhere else to look for her.

581
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,150
Wait.

582
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,900
Do you know where she went?

583
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,950
Did she go to Wan Li's residence?

584
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,510
Thank you.

585
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:15,660
[Wan Mansion]

586
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,320
Feiniang, I can do it myself.

587
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,960
Feiniang, be careful.

588
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,390
Miss Yan, you've never done any rough work.

589
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,940
Don't hurt your hand.

590
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,880
Let me do it.

591
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,180
My Lord.

592
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,660
At this point,

593
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,810
why did you invite the children of these two families

594
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,730
to our mansion?

595
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,430
Think about it.

596
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,500
If their fathers refuse to plead guilty,

597
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,290
I'll tell them the good news.

598
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,590
What will they decide?

599
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,080
Thank you for your teaching.

600
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,550
-Yueniang. -Hush.

601
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,400
Hush.

602
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:10,900
Yueniang.

603
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,389
Why are you here?

604
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,610
Qinruo.

605
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:16,110
I heard about

606
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,100
what had happened to your family.

607
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:21,850
Yueniang.

608
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,810
Are you okay?

609
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,530
No.

610
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,679
I'm not okay.

611
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,630
It's all right.

612
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,300
It will be fine.

613
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,960
Yueniang, what happened to you?

614
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:54,929
Come, sit down.

615
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,510
Why aren't you in Yiyang?

616
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,420
What are you doing in the capital?

617
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,510
I'm here to look for my father.

618
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,970
What happened to the Dean?

619
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,170
He was arrested.

620
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
For having embezzled a lot of money.

621
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,700
The same charge as your father.

622
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,700
Dean.

623
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,810
Why is he also...

624
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,690
Do you know something?

625
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,070
No.

626
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,880
Yueniang.

627
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,700
Did you come to the capital alone?

628
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,660
I met Xiao Yu.

629
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,590
In fact, he came to Yiyang

630
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,370
with his own agenda from the very beginning.

631
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,360
His name is not even Xiao Yu.

632
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,470
Actually...

633
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,560
Forget it. Enough talk about him.

634
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,980
I'm here to clear my father's name.

635
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,160
I believe he is innocent.

636
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,360
I believe your father is innocent, too.

637
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,730
Yueniang,

638
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,830
you should go back.

639
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,090
Why do you say that, too?

640
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,020
There are many people in the capital.

641
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,150
And it's very messy.

642
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,710
It's not safe for you

643
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,010
to stay here alone.

644
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,020
Do you know anything?

645
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,420
Yueniang.

646
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,470
My father is Duke Yue.

647
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,080
No matter what,

648
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,690
we have relations with the Imperial Family.

649
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,270
Yet our house was still searched, and our property confiscated.

650
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,230
So,

651
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,390
my father must have committed something,

652
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,080
and it was verified.

653
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,560
Tell me.

654
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,450
Did Wan Li tell you something?

655
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,880
Uncle Wan said...

656
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,080
What about Uncle Wan?

657
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,640
When I went back home,

658
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,670
our house had already been emptied.

659
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,680
Besides,

660
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,720
I've also met my father.

661
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,530
I don't believe it.

662
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,550
There must be some misunderstanding in it.

663
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,150
Trust me.

664
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,760
There must be some misunderstanding.

665
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,920
That's why I'm here to find out the truth.

666
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,390
Yueniang, don't think too much.

667
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,430
And you know what?

668
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,520
I heard that

669
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,600
the silver allegedly embezzled by your father and mine

670
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,730
was on the boat you borrowed from me.

671
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,420
How is that possible?

672
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,590
No way.

673
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,350
I've never transported those.

674
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,380
I believe it was not you.

675
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,120
Of course I know it was not you.

676
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,760
But you need to think it over calmly.

677
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,350
When you borrowed the boat from me,

678
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,070
did anyone know about it?

679
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,130
Or did anyone from your family know about it?

680
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,830
Borrowing the boat?

681
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,890
Didn't you ask Uncle Dai to come and offer help?

682
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,800
Didn't you ask Zhao Yuanzhen to borrow it from me?

683
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,800
She said you were too embarrassed to ask, so I...

684
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:05,770
Lady Zhao.

685
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:06,910
I...

686
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,580
No.

687
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,590
We need to find Zhao Yuanzhen now

688
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,910
and ask her what she knows.

689
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,270
Okay.

690
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:14,890
Qinruo.

691
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,860
Qinruo.

692
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,070
You're still up so late.

693
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,600
I'm here to tell you

694
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,790
I'm going home tomorrow.

695
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,540
Going home?

696
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,570
Don't worry. I've told Lord Wan.

697
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,130
I'm going home tomorrow.

698
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,130
I'll be back soon.

699
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,290
Let's talk in your room.

700
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,210
Okay.

701
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,720
Lady Zhao,

702
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,760
if you know the truth,

703
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,240
do tell me, please.

704
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,770
Because it concerns whether my father can be released.

705
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,190
You borrowed the boat from my family.

706
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,360
Lady Zhao, I beg you.

707
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,190
If you know anything,

708
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,820
please tell me.

709
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,930
Zhu, I really don't know what you're talking about.

710
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,830
Lady Zhao,

711
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,180
why do I feel that you've become like a stranger

712
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,930
after you left the Academy?

713
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,190
I haven't.

714
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,350
I have never changed.

715
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,140
No, you were very considerate

716
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,320
in our memories.

717
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,690
You've never been so cold like you are now.

718
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,350
And do you forget

719
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,690
that you're our role model

720
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,130
among us?

721
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,390
Miss Zhu.

722
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,880
When we were in the Academy, we were all students.

723
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,430
Of course we should treat each other politely.

724
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,760
But this is the capital.

725
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,920
I need to act like a noble lady.

726
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,290
Miss Zhu, is there anything else?

727
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:55,680
I...

728
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,260
If there's nothing else,

729
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,220
please leave.

730
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,350
You broke into my house at night.

731
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,830
It's not good

732
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,360
if someone sees you.

733
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,150
Okay.

734
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,840
Sorry to have bothered you.

735
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,620
Lady Zhao,

736
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,960
if you remember anything,

737
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,130
please tell me.

738
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,040
Are you okay?
