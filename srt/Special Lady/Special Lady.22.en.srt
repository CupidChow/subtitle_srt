[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,729
[Episode 22]

4
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,710
Yu, just see

5
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,229
what is drawn on this paper.

6
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,930
It tells us not to hope for a fluke.

7
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,430
If we don't control our desires and we act absurdly, hoping for a fluke,

8
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,960
after this paper is stained by a drop of ink,

9
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,700
it's no longer white anymore.

10
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,630
You have to read a book many times

11
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,940
so that you can understand its true meaning.

12
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,479
It takes more time

13
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,350
to figure out the personality of a person

14
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,480
and learn about his mind.

15
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,570
Thank you for your guidance.

16
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,470
Wait.

17
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,180
Actually,

18
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,840
I have something on my mind, too.

19
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,100
What is it?

20
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,870
Forget it.

21
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,310
I shouldn't tell you about it.

22
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,350
Just go back.

23
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,980
Brother.

24
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,000
Just tell me.

25
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,570
Don't treat me like a child.

26
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,480
Maybe I can help you think of an idea.

27
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,940
Feiniang, in your opinion,

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,470
if a woman has given

29
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,520
a handkerchief with the patterns of mandarin ducks to someone else,

30
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,870
does it mean that

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,850
this woman loves that person very much?

32
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,300
Who is it, Brother?

33
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,520
Did she give it to you?

34
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,190
No.

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,840
You know these two people, too.

36
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,530
They are Xiao and Zhu.

37
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,630
They...

38
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,829
Teaching Assistant Xiao and Miss Song Zhu?

39
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,670
Forget it.

40
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,860
Just pretend that you didn't hear it.

41
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,320
Why are you here?

42
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,280
Are you still angry?

43
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,430
My dear Qinruo.

44
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,010
I'm here to apologize to you.

45
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,480
Come on. Have a seat.

46
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,240
Sit down.

47
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,610
Look what I've brought you.

48
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,990
I'm not angry.

49
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,870
I don't care.

50
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,210
I embroidered it for a very long time.

51
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,159
You have to accept the gift.

52
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,360
My hand still hurts after I embroidered it.

53
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,790
My hand hurts.

54
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,790
It hurts so much.

55
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,100
Look at this wound.

56
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,120
I didn't ask you to embroider it.

57
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,060
You deserve it as you embroidered the handkerchief yourself.

58
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,450
Yes.

59
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,640
I deserve it as I embroidered the handkerchief myself.

60
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,030
You are my best friend.

61
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,630
If you're angry,

62
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,710
I have to pacify you, don't I?

63
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,790
It won't hurt anymore after I blew on it.

64
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,710
Actually, Yueniang,

65
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,690
I'm not angry with you.

66
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,980
I'm angry with myself.

67
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,670
I knew that

68
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,880
it was a critical moment,

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,830
but I just minded the fact that Mr. Xiao held your hand.

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,120
Actually, yesterday,

71
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,790
I wanted to make it clear to you.

72
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,610
But I saw Mr. Xiao holding your hand again.

73
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,840
I got

74
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,250
very angry at once.

75
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,250
But I was afraid that I would vent my anger on you,

76
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,030
so I walked away first.

77
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,150
In that case,

78
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,490
I took the blame for Mr. Xiao's mistake.

79
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,270
Since you have given it to me,

80
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,360
it's mine.

81
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,070
You can't take it away.

82
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,680
Ask your Mr. Xiao for it.

83
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,030
Don't be so petty-minded.

84
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,550
Your Mr. Xiao is the most important person.

85
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,630
I'm not important at all. Don't take it.

86
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,270
Who said that?

87
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,990
Yueniang is the most important person.

88
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,090
Really?

89
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,440
Alright.

90
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,070
Since you are so sincere

91
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,340
and like it so much,

92
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,280
I'll forgive you reluctantly

93
00:05:59,310 --> 00:05:59,830
and give it to you.

94
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,310
But this is the most precious thing in the world.

95
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,870
You have to cherish it and keep it well.

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,370
Of course.

97
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,710
You're not angry?

98
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,910
I'm not angry.

99
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,110
I have to go.

100
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,790
Don't be angry.

101
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,550
I'm not angry.

102
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,830
I'm not angry.

103
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,790
Yueniang.

104
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,510
What did you forget to take again?

105
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,550
Miss Yan.

106
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,960
Do you have any clothes which you need to wash?

107
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,190
Let me help you wash them together with these clothes.

108
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,980
Feiniang.

109
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,070
No need.

110
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,100
Don't bother.

111
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,310
It's okay.

112
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,510
I usually help my brother wash his clothes.

113
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,790
It's really not necessary.

114
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,670
Thank you.

115
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,680
Alright.

116
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,760
Feiniang.

117
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,909
Look at this.

118
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,070
Yueniang gave this gift to me just now.

119
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,710
Is it beautiful?

120
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,670
Why did Miss Song Zhu always give people a handkerchief?

121
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,660
What are you talking about?

122
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,910
This is her first time embroidering a handkerchief.

123
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,350
It's true.

124
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,630
Then tell me

125
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,790
who else she gave it to.

126
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,200
Song Zhu!

127
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,070
Qinruo.

128
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,670
Did you give Mr. Xiao a handkerchief with patterns of mandarin ducks?

129
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,950
What?

130
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,030
Stop playing dumb.

131
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,080
Whenever there was something between you and Mr. Xiao,

132
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,250
I always told myself,

133
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,200
"Yueniang is your best friend."

134
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,590
"She won't lie to you."

135
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,440
I...

136
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,830
But I actually found out that

137
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,080
you secretly gave Mr. Xiao

138
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,950
a handkerchief with patterns of mandarin ducks.

139
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,650
How...

140
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,200
How could it be possible?

141
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,580
I...

142
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,190
When did I give him a handkerchief with patterns of mandarin ducks?

143
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,500
You still don't admit it?

144
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,830
Feiniang, just say it.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,790
Well...

146
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,950
I'm not clear about this incident, either.

147
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,560
Alright.

148
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,510
I'll figure out

149
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,430
the specific details of this incident.

150
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,830
But it's true that I've never given a handkerchief to him.

151
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,240
The only handkerchief I've ever given to someone

152
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,550
is the one in your hand.

153
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,470
Who would like it?

154
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,920
Yan Qinruo, stop!

155
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,600
There should be a limit for you to make a big fuss.

156
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,400
You only listened to what others said and questioned me.

157
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,380
Do you know that

158
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,720
I feel very wronged because of

159
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,350
your sudden and unjust accusation?

160
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,720
She feels wronged?

161
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,470
She even yelled at me.

162
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,790
Miss Yan.

163
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,790
Miss Yan!

164
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,060
Miss Yan!

165
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,390
Miss Yan, slow down.

166
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,440
The mountain road is rough.

167
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,510
Don't sprain your ankles.

168
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,670
Miss Yan.

169
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,990
Why are you still following me?

170
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,570
I'm here to apologize to you.

171
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,670
Apologize?

172
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,900
Why are you apologizing to me?

173
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,720
Miss Yan,

174
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,350
stop being angry with me, okay?

175
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,810
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,950
Stop following me.

177
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,870
Miss Yan.

178
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,000
But I didn't bully you.

179
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,390
Why are you crying?

180
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,150
Miss Yan,

181
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,020
stop being angry with me, okay?

182
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,870
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,370
I won't do it again.

184
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,020
Alright.

185
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,030
Stop crying.

186
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,250
I didn't yell at you on purpose.

187
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,700
Stop crying.

188
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,930
Since I arrived in Yiyang,

189
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
besides my brother,

190
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,350
I think that you've been the one who treats me the best.

191
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,790
Now,

192
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,190
I've made you, the person who treats me the best,

193
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,330
feel bad.

194
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,050
Alright.

195
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,690
Coincidentally, I also want to go out for a walk.

196
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,850
Come with me.

197
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,150
Then you should smile now.

198
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,670
You look so sad.

199
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,610
Aren't you happy to have some soft drinks?

200
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,190
Let's go.

201
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,510
Zhu.

202
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,510
Junior Zhou.

203
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,910
Where is Xiao Yu?

204
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,550
Aren't you the one who knows

205
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,180
where Xiao has gone the best?

206
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,440
You were with Xiao during class,

207
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,870
and you were with Xiao after class.

208
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,400
Anyway,

209
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,670
just go find him yourself.

210
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,920
How come all of them are so weird?

211
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,940
Junior Zhou,

212
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,020
have you also heard about

213
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,390
the handkerchief with patterns of mandarin ducks?

214
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,280
I've never given a handkerchief with patterns of mandarin ducks to anybody.

215
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,660
I saw the gift you gave to Xiao.

216
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,750
I gave him a gift in order to apologize to him.

217
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,310
Besides, I gave him a wolf-hair brush.

218
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,840
But that handkerchief is right inside this dorm.

219
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,120
It's inside this dorm?

220
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,940
How about this, Yueniang?

221
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,380
You can give that to him,

222
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,090
and I'll give this to him.

223
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,180
Then let's give our gifts to him together.

224
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,800
Okay.

225
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,000
You misunderstood it.

226
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,430
Just see what you've done.

227
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,670
Xiao Yu,

228
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,470
answer my questions carefully.

229
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,910
Just answer the questions carefully.

230
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,390
What gift did you get from me?

231
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,590
And what gift did you get from Qinruo?

232
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,050
Say it.

233
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,600
What gifts did I receive?

234
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:15,670
I...

235
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,910
Well, I mean...

236
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,120
I misunderstood you,

237
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,150
so I gave you a gift in order to apologize to you.

238
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,590
What gift did you get from me?

239
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,950
Don't you know

240
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,390
what gift you gave me?

241
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,670
You gave me a handkerchief with patterns of mandarin ducks.

242
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,290
Miss Yan gave me a wolf-hair brush.

243
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,320
What?

244
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:37,830
No!

245
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,120
You misunderstood it.

246
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,480
I gave you a wolf-hair brush.

247
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,850
What Qinruo gave you is the handkerchief with patterns of mandarin ducks.

248
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,330
Look.

249
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,030
Now you're clear about the misunderstandings, huh?

250
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,140
How could you misunderstand me?

251
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,880
I apologize to you.

252
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,270
Zhou.

253
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,340
I think I've lagged behind in my studies in the past several days.

254
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,660
Can you give me some guidance?

255
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:21,410
Sure.

256
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,120
No.

257
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,840
Don't say yes to him.

258
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,600
Go away.

259
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,480
Junior Zhou,

260
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,480
though I've made it clear to you,

261
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,010
Qinruo still has a misunderstanding on me.

262
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,790
Come with me.

263
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,480
Take the handkerchief and go with me

264
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,460
to explain it clearly to Qinruo.

265
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,170
You have to clear up this misunderstanding for me.

266
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,020
Stop.

267
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,400
Let's go.

268
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,180
Stop.

269
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,290
Do you know where Miss Yan is now?

270
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,060
So,

271
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,470
you should go home now.

272
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,670
She will definitely go back to the dorm tonight.

273
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,950
After she goes back to the dorm,

274
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,470
you can explain it to her clearly and it'll be fine, right?

275
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:00,870
Alright.

276
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,710
Junior Zhou.

277
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,310
Wait! Stop!

278
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,630
Zhu.

279
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,540
This is the boys' dorm, isn't it?

280
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,150
It's inappropriate for you to stay here, right?

281
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,110
I just want to stay here.

282
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,460
I can take this chance to ask Junior Zhou for some advice.

283
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,440
What advice do you want to ask him for?

284
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,810
Zhou promised to give me some advice first.

285
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,620
Go away.

286
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,590
Junior Zhou promised me first.

287
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,550
He promised me first.

288
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,310
Didn't you hear it clearly?

289
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:35,630
I said it first.

290
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,790
What are you talking about?

291
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,400
Junior Zhou has promised me.

292
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:38,830
Junior Zhou.

293
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,070
Are you clear about what kind of person she is now?

294
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,590
Junior Zhou.

295
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,750
He provoked me first.

296
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,110
Did you saw that?

297
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,830
I have a question.

298
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,310
My studies are the most important.

299
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,230
Go away.

300
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,300
Miss Yan, you're here again.

301
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,960
Ma'am.

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,080
I want to order the food I used to order.

303
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,750
Okay.

304
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,640
Miss Yan,

305
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,580
you've bought too many gifts.

306
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:55,970
It's okay.

307
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,440
It was my fault after all.

308
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,540
I shouldn't have vented my anger on you.

309
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,750
Sometimes,

310
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,650
I feel troubled because of

311
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,510
my bad temper.

312
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,510
Alright.

313
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,440
Let's sit down and talk.

314
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,540
When I was a kid,

315
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,840
I was the youngest child in my family.

316
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,790
So,

317
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,470
both my father and brother doted on me.

318
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,240
It was even more difficult

319
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,200
to change my bad temper.

320
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,990
Both your father and bother dote on you.

321
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,690
That's great.

322
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,580
Mr. Zhou dotes on you, too.

323
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,610
He has been running around a lot

324
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,040
for your admission to the school.

325
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,550
I know that my brother loves me.

326
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,580
Feiniang,

327
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,070
actually, we know some of the situations

328
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,690
about you and Mr. Zhou

329
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,260
as well as your family.

330
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,840
But I don't think it's a big deal.

331
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,600
You don't mind that?

332
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,140
Why should I mind it?

333
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,990
Mr. Zhou helped me and saved me.

334
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,280
I treat him as a friend.

335
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,700
From now on,

336
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,100
you are my sister.

337
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,630
If you have something on your mind,

338
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,620
you can tell me about it.

339
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,700
Mis Yan,

340
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,930
you're so nice.

341
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,350
Don't cry.

342
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,560
This...

343
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,900
It means...

344
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,390
What about this?

345
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
And this one.

346
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,470
So it's...

347
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,670
Zhu.

348
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,490
Are you alright?

349
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,090
Zhou.

350
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,430
I still don’t understand this part.

351
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,780
Can you explain it to me again?

352
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,310
This article tells us that...

353
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,550
Zhou.

354
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,820
You explained it so well.

355
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,500
This article tells us that...

356
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,550
I see.

357
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,340
Zhu.

358
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,950
Even if you stared at this for a year, it would be useless.

359
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,390
The word "virtuous"

360
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:10,010
has nothing to do with you.

361
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,540
You know it but you don't do it,

362
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,240
and it's called dishonesty.

363
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,000
You do it but you fail,

364
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,569
and it's called incapability.

365
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,280
Therefore...

366
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,420
Move your hands away.

367
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,270
Zhu, why don't you take a rest?

368
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,730
Did you hear that?

369
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,120
He asked you to take a rest.

370
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,750
No, you...

371
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,420
I'll take your advice.

372
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,960
Junior Zhou,

373
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,920
I'll go wash your clothes.

374
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,860
-I'll wash the clothes for you. -Those clothes...

375
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,120
Those clothes have just been washed.

376
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,680
Look.

377
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,580
Look at Zhu.

378
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,800
She is so reckless.

379
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,900
I don't know what trouble she might cause.

380
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,460
I’d better go check it out.

381
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,370
Zhou.

382
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,680
For all the questions I asked just now, please leave written comments about them.

383
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,420
I'll go out and take a look.

384
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,630
Leave the written comments for me.

385
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,250
Be good, Feiniang.

386
00:17:59,340 --> 00:17:59,870
Don't cry.

387
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,160
Miss Yan.

388
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:02,940
Taste it.

389
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,040
Thank you, Miss Yan.

390
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,200
It's very delicious.

391
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,040
I told you so.

392
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,950
The drinks here are delicious.

393
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,140
Miss Yan.

394
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,390
When we were shopping just now,

395
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,690
I noticed that you were away alone for a while.

396
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,300
You bought

397
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,250
that little box for Miss Song Zhu, right?

398
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,300
This is the first time Yueniang has yelled at me.

399
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,410
I think I've wronged her again.

400
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,110
But I've already said those words to her.

401
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,170
Besides, for the handkerchief

402
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
which Yueniang had embroidered for me personally,

403
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,130
I even threw it on the ground.

404
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,110
Miss Yan.

405
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,440
Don't worry.

406
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,860
Although Yueniang yelled at me in the end,

407
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,480
I could feel that

408
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,400
she was also very sad.

409
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,200
I think Miss Song must be the same as you.

410
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,370
She must have said something harsh out of anger.

411
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,260
If you give her the gift you bought,

412
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,230
she will definitely make up with you.

413
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,430
Really?

414
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,030
I hope so.

415
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,230
Actually, Feiniang,

416
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,480
all these friends around me

417
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,610
have been on good terms with me

418
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,040
because of my family background.

419
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,040
But only Yueniang is different from them.

420
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,230
Since the first time I met her,

421
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,310
she treated me differently from others.

422
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,850
Do you think mine looks good?

423
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,670
It looks so nice.

424
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,150
Who is that?

425
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,230
Let's go and take a look.

426
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,790
This lady looks so gorgeous.

427
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,270
Yes.

428
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,590
Who is this lady?

429
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,660
Ladies,

430
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,910
my name is Yan Qinruo.

431
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,670
It's my first day at school.

432
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,840
So,

433
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,670
I've brought you some cosmetics.

434
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,530
Please take care of me in the future.

435
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,860
-Really? -Cosmetics?

436
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,840
Let's go and have a look.

437
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,950
Let's go at once to take a look.

438
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,060
Great!

439
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,030
Thank you.

440
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,750
Pick whatever you like.

441
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,510
This one.

442
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,550
I like this one.

443
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,930
All the cosmetics used by Miss Yan are high-quality goods.

444
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,860
They must be expensive.

445
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,830
They are not expensive.

446
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,130
If you like them,

447
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:21,880
take whatever you want.

448
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,270
Thank you, Miss Yan.

449
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:23,620
Here you are.

450
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,750
Miss Yan, you're so nice.

451
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,620
It smells so good.

452
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,490
Look at mine. It smells so good.

453
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,550
Miss Yan is so generous.

454
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,510
-Put it on. -Try it on.

455
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,220
Let me wipe it for you.

456
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,760
Okay.

457
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,190
Do I look good?

458
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,790
Yes.

459
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,550
Let me take a look.

460
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,590
Does it match my clothes?

461
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,830
Miss, this rouge is for you.

462
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,500
No need.

463
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,220
I don't like these things.

464
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,080
I like this.

465
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,800
What is this?

466
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,730
Are you curious?

467
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,750
A wreath?

468
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,640
Yueniang, you know how to make this?

469
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,800
From now on, if you need anything at the academy,

470
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,270
you can come to me.

471
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,280
I'll take care of you.

472
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,420
Are we friends now?

473
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,040
From now on, Song Zhu and Yan Qinruo

474
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,760
are best friends.

475
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,500
I'm so happy.

476
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,770
Me, too.

477
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,400
Alright.

478
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,470
It's getting late.

479
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,510
Let's go back.

480
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,310
Okay.

481
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,770
I want to send the pastries to my brother first.

482
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,190
Okay.

483
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,200
I'll go with you.

484
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,540
Thank you, Miss Yan.

485
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,870
Ma'am,

486
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,170
pack these things up for me.

487
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,120
Okay.

488
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,800
Coming.

489
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:57,890
Come here.

490
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,830
Look.

491
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,760
Why is Senior Song washing clothes in the men's dorm?

492
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,650
Right.

493
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,560
Maybe there's no place for her to wash the clothes at the women's dorm.

494
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,420
Let's go.

495
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,510
-Xiao. -Xiao.

496
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,500
Li.

497
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,380
Are you going to wash your clothes?

498
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,360
Do you know how to wash clothes?

499
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,060
Of course.

500
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,070
I know how to wash clothes.

501
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,080
See?

502
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,310
You're so skillful. I can tell that you don't know how to wash clothes.

503
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,690
A person who seldom does housework

504
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,120
and doesn't know the differences between the five grains

505
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,510
dares to judge me?

506
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,440
Who seldom does housework and doesn't know the differences between the five grains?

507
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,750
I'm good at doing all kinds of housework.

508
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,670
Can you do that?

509
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,510
Do it.

510
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,600
Do it.

511
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,430
I'll do it. I'll do it. I can do it.

512
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,430
I acutally can do it.

513
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,090
However,

514
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,280
I didn't ask to do this work.

515
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,230
Figure out a way yourself.

516
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,310
Xiao Yu, are you trying to cause trouble to me?

517
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,060
Let me tell you.

518
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,520
-I've hated you for a long time.
-You broke it by throwing it.

519
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,390
You broke Zhou's clothes.

520
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,860
Don't stay here if you're free.

521
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,990
Just go away.

522
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,640
I really have something to do.

523
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,070
I came here to laugh at you, didn't I?

524
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,300
Xiao Yu, do you want to die?

525
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,330
Brother.

526
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,470
Your clothes are broken just like that.

527
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,960
It's okay.

528
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,260
It's just a piece of clothes.

529
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,370
Don't worry about it.

530
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,510
I'm sorry, Junior Zhou.

531
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,970
I’ll buy you a new one later.

532
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,680
No need.

533
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,020
You were kind enough to wash my clothes.

534
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,480
There are too many people here.

535
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,390
Let's go back first.

536
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,840
Okay. Let me help you.

537
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,680
Junior Zhou.

538
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,230
Yueniang.

539
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,500
Qinruo, you came just in time.

540
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,030
Otherwise, when you return to the dorm tonight,

541
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,300
I'll still need to go to see you.

542
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,950
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

543
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,600
Explain the misunderstanding to Qinruo clearly.

544
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,010
I...

545
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,460
What should I explain?

546
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,530
You...

547
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,320
How can you be so useless at the critical moment?

548
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,070
Give me the handkerchief.

549
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,120
Do you remember that day when we went to select some gifts?

550
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,660
You would give him a handkerchief with patterns of mandarin ducks.

551
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,830
I would give him a wolf-hair brush.

552
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,240
The shopkeeper packed these two gifts wrongly.

553
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,470
How could such a mistake happen?

554
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,520
Alright.

555
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,910
Now the misunderstanding has been cleared up.

556
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,910
The injustice for me

557
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,510
has been cleared up, too.

558
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,530
Yueniang.

559
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,430
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

560
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,350
Come and take a look at once.

561
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,740
Come and take a look at this chess game.

562
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,330
Come and take a look.

563
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,310
Your favourite slingshot.

564
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,110
And your little Qinruo whom you like more.

565
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,750
Stop being angry.

566
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,050
So you think that you can pacify me with this slingshot?

567
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,520
The workmanship is not very good.

568
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,670
Right.

569
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,990
How can this workmanship be compared with Yueniang's?

570
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,710
How about this?

571
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,310
After you improve it,

572
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,460
let's still use it to get some fruits.

573
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,690
Let's talk about it when there are fruits.

574
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,150
Look at you.

575
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,050
Do you know how bad

576
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,680
your temper was when you blamed me?

577
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,670
If you dare to do this again,

578
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,270
I'll shoot you with this slingshot so that you can calm down.

579
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,800
I'm sorry.

580
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:14,910
Just punish me as you like.

581
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,350
That's more like it.

582
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,670
So you're not angry now?

583
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,110
I'll forgive you this time.

584
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,240
Stop.

585
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,950
Anyway,

586
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,510
you're one of the people who

587
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,820
caused this trouble.

588
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,370
Don't you have anything

589
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,800
to say to Qinruo?

590
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,130
I caused the trouble?

591
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,470
I have something to do.

592
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,340
I'll go inside first.

593
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,320
You two talk.

594
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,500
It's up to you now.

595
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,030
Yueniang.

596
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,630
Wait. Make it clear.

597
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,800
Mr. Xiao.

598
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,540
Brother.

599
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,030
I've washed

600
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,160
these clothes for you previously, haven't I?

601
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,770
They've got dirty again after I've worn them these two days.

602
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,030
Feiniang.

603
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,220
Miss Song Zhu.

604
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,370
Miss Song Zhu.

605
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,530
I talked nonsense previously,

606
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,310
which made you and Miss Yan fall out with each other.

607
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,670
I know I was wrong.

608
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,470
I'm sorry, Miss Song Zhu.

609
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,120
It’s okay.

610
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,680
I've explained it to Qinruo clearly.

611
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,150
Don't worry about it.

612
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,600
Really?

613
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,790
Great.

614
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,430
Miss Song Zhu, have a seat.

615
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,900
Miss Yan bought some pastries.

616
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
Sit down and let's eat together.

617
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,240
Okay.

618
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,520
Brother, stop working.

619
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,810
-Come and have some pastries.
-Okay.

620
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,650
I'm sorry, Mr. Xiao.

621
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,470
I misunderstood Yueniang

622
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,380
and caused you a lot of trouble.

623
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,820
Mr. Xiao.

624
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,700
I'm fine.

625
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,750
It doesn't matter.

626
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,910
It's all right as long as you've explained it to Zhu clearly.

627
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,510
Here you are, Miss Song Zhu.

628
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:22,910
Thank you.

629
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,940
Junior Zhou, eat it first.

630
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,470
Feiniang, eat it first.

631
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,920
Okay.

632
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,890
It suddenly occurred to me that

633
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,800
I had something to do.

634
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,630
I have to go back first.

635
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,530
Enjoy the food.

636
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,220
Feiniang, be careful on your way back.

637
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,800
Miss Fei.

638
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,060
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

639
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,840
Miss Yan.

640
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,410
Why did you come out alone?

641
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:03,960
Where are they?

642
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,250
Miss Song and my brother are eating pastries inside.

643
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,220
If there's nothing else,

644
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,390
I'll go back first.

645
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,350
I haven't finished washing my brother's clothes.

646
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,750
Just go.

647
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,710
Bye, Miss Yan.

648
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,820
Bye, Teaching Assistant Xiao.

649
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,570
Mr. Xiao.

650
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,060
What are you looking at?

651
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,040
Nothing.

652
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,550
Are you worried about Yueniang?

653
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,630
Yes.

654
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,530
Yes.

655
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,040
Zhu.

656
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,040
Junior Zhou, eat it first.

657
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,880
By the way, Junior Zhou,

658
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,390
for what happened today...

659
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,360
Don't worry about

660
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,440
what happened today.

661
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,690
We've figured out

662
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,080
the truth, haven't we?

663
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,020
Mr. Xiao,

664
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,950
do you have a crush on Yueniang?

665
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,480
What do you mean?

666
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,040
It's the literal meaning.

667
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,990
You don't talk, and it means that you have a crush on her.

668
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,420
I don't have a crush on her.

669
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,190
That's good.

670
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,140
However, isn't it good that Yueniang and Mr. Zhou

671
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,860
are inside the room?

672
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,990
Zhu is alone with Zhou

673
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,690
in the dorm.

674
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,190
I'm afraid if others see them,

675
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,470
it'll be bad for her reputation.

676
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,480
Don't worry, Mr. Xiao.

677
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,270
I believe that Junior Zhou

678
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,040
will handle such things well.

679
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,670
He won't let others gossip about Yueniang arbitrarily.

680
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,070
If there's nothing else,

681
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,310
I'll go back first.

682
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,500
Then I won't disturb you any longer.

683
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,150
By the way, Zhu...

684
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,500
After school tomorrow,

685
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,830
shall we go to the Wenjing Hall together?

686
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,280
The Wenjing Hall?

687
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,190
Yes, let's go together.

688
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,790
It suddenly occurred to me that

689
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,240
I still had some homework to do.

690
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,020
See you tomorrow.

691
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:51,860
See you tomorrow.

692
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,560
I'm leaving.

693
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,650
Song...

694
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,070
Zhou.

695
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,380
Is there a happy event?

696
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,100
You keep smiling.

697
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,590
Nothing.

698
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,020
But the pastries I ate just now were too sweet.

699
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,230
Too sweet.

700
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,610
Really?

701
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,170
Let me taste it, too.

702
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:13,760
Eat more.

703
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,790
Miss Yan bought them.

704
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,949
Young Master.

705
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,909
During the daytime, I carefully investigated

706
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,699
the leader of the local ruffians who caused trouble to the villagers,

707
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,470
and found out that he's the brother of Li Shancai's wife.

708
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,750
His name is Zhao Shoucai.

709
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,830
They colluded with each other.

710
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,590
Li Shancai oppressed the street vendors through him.

711
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,610
In that case,

712
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,960
though they paid the protection fees to the local ruffians,

713
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,570
actually, the money was given to the people of the local government.

714
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,720
The phenomenon of the government secretly instigating the local ruffians has become a serious problem.

715
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,590
I think the source of the problem

716
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,750
is the loopholes in taxes.

717
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,820
Currently, it seems

718
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,030
to be the case.

719
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,390
After all, the key is the source of the problem.

720
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,630
People in the world are divided into five ranks.

721
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,160
People of the top three ranks are exempt from taxes.

722
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,640
People of the lower two ranks are evaluated according to the contributions of their ancestors.

723
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,390
With more contributions, they can pay less taxes. With no contributions, they have to pay more taxes.

724
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,720
Those people without contributions are mostly commoners,

725
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,460
pedlars, menial servants, landlords and tenant farmers.

726
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,200
Li Shancai made this scheme.

727
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,900
He must have considered that those people without contributions

728
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:45,810
have no privileged backgrounds or backers.

729
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,680
That's why he used the local ruffians' power more unscrupulously,

730
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,550
and charged Safety Money on the basis of taxes.

731
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,940
Such protection fees are neither legal nor illegal,

732
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,640
and are collected with neither a legitimate nor a clear reason.

733
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,170
It's surprising that Li Shancai

734
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,910
dares to use the loopholes in taxes to make profits.

735
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,870
He's so bold.

736
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,160
Report this case to the Crown Prince as soon as possible.

737
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,230
Yes.

738
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,830
Young Master.

739
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,760
Li Shancai is just a magistrate of Yiyang.

740
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,100
How dare he be so unscrupulous?

741
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,890
Does he have a bigger backer behind him?

742
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,620
The corruption case involves many people.

743
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,280
Is it possible that

744
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,360
the Yiyang Acadmey has something to do with Li Shancai?

745
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,550
There's no time to lose.

746
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,280
Let's go to the Li Mansion tonight

747
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,770
to see if we can find some clues.

748
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,140
It turns out to be you, little thing.

749
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,590
It's late at night. Don't run around.

750
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,800
Okay.

751
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,390
Okay.

752
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,430
Okay.

753
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,280
Okay.

754
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,360
Uncle Hu.

755
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:36,700
This one.

756
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:39,770
It's hollow.

757
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,000
I think it's a secret compartment.

758
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,700
There must be a mechanism.

759
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,490
Young Master.

760
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,650
It's indeed a secret compartment.

761
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,270
An account book?

762
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,830
[Duke Yue's Fund Raising Account Book]

763
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,070
What does this mean?

764
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,530
This should be the donation money Duke Yue has acquired

765
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,960
from these fifty people.

766
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,150
1,000 taels a month.

767
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,410
It's the donation money given to the Four Academies.

768
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,270
Why is this account book in Li Shancai's house?

769
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,930
Besides, they hid it so carefully.

770
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,150
There's something even weirder.

771
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:44,480
Look.

772
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,560
950 taels.

773
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,660
Young Master.

774
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,800
If all the donation money

775
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,720
was given to Li Shancai in the end,

776
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,220
what does that mean?

777
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,190
It means that Li Shancai has even embezzled the donation money.

778
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,030
This is the donation money raised by Duke Yue.

779
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,040
He even dared to embezzle it?

780
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,270
Was he really that bold?

781
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,260
So, maybe Duke Yue

782
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,440
colluded with Li Shancai.

783
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,920
We need to investigate this case carefully.

784
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,350
Yes.

785
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,330
We have to investigate not only Li Shancai

786
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,540
but also Duke Yue.

787
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,390
By the way,

788
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,540
we also need to investigate Song's Academy

789
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,930
and the other three academies.

790
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:33,360
Why are all of them written in this account book?

791
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,070
Without these several academies being the covers,

792
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,230
this money wouldn't have flowed back to Li Shancai.

793
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,220
There's one more thing that's very weird.

794
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,020
Didn't these donors

795
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:45,950
learn about

796
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,680
where the money they had donated would be taken to?

797
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,130
If the money they had donated was not used for charity,

798
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,380
would they not notice it

799
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,910
and would they keep donating money?

800
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,000
Unless...

801
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,880
Those donors were also the beneficiaries.

802
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,830
The donors were the beneficiaries?

803
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,270
What benefits could they get?

804
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,100
They could avoid taxes.

805
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,890
Have you forgotten the case

806
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,090
where Zhao Shoucai used the loopholes in the city gate taxes to accumulate wealth?

807
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,410
Their ideas are the same, though the methods are different.

808
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,030
You mean that

809
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,470
they used the donation as a cover

810
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,710
to avoid taxes?

811
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,770
Then these academies have become institutions for

812
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,190
money laundering and tax evasion, right?

813
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,920
Just now, I read the account book and noticed that

814
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,460
all the people behind Duke Yue were merchants.

815
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
There were no officials.

816
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,080
This is a loophole in taxes.

817
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,640
Officials don't need to pay taxes.

818
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,550
People don't need to pay taxes for donations.

819
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,430
But merchants need to pay taxes.

820
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,000
Duke Yue and Wan Li are good friends,

821
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,510
and Lord Zuo is Wan Li's trusted aide.

822
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,460
Both of them are related to Li Shancai.

823
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,400
Did Wan Li also get involved in this case?

824
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,070
Or,

825
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,380
was he the mastermind?

826
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,110
But now,

827
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,080
we still need to figure out the truth about the account book

828
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,130
and solve the corruption case as soon as possible.

829
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:12,910
Uncle Hu.

830
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,300
Let's split up to take action.

831
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,570
You should go outside and investigate the case.

832
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,750
Start from Li Shancai to find out about the details.

833
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,000
I remember that Xue Hanfu in the academy

834
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,360
seems to come from a merchant's family, too.

835
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,230
I'll go sound him out

836
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,990
to see if there are any valuable clues.

837
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,220
Yes.

838
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,550
Uncle Hu.

839
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,690
Do you think that

840
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,070
something is missing in the account book?

841
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,700
What is it?

842
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,110
How come there are only incomes and no expenditures?
