Hurry up!

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,190
Be careful.

7
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,470
Ding Miao.

8
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,350
This way. This way.

9
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,440
Why are you hiding?

10
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,670
The ball. The ball.

11
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,039
Ding Miao, catch up now.

12
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,390
It's okay, Mr. Ding.

13
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,350
Let's get the ball back.

14
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,720
Team Blue committed a foul.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,280
Team Red is given a penalty kick.

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,580
Yueniang, come on.

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,190
-Come on.
-Come on.

18
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,790
Come on.

Bravo!

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,280
Nice shot!

21
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,590
Nice shot!

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,810
Yiyang Academy scored one point.

23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,310
Good job.

24
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,550
I could do it too.

25
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,750
I taught them.

26
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,550
I taught them.

27
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,910
They are my students.

28
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,020
Team Blue has requested to replace team members.

29
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:09,420
-Team Blue, come on.
-Team Blue, come on.

30
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,120
Pass the ball!

31
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,120
Pass the ball, Song Zhu!

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,310
Someone broke the rules and kicked me.

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,600
That's right.

34
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,380
-Pass it to me!
-Hurry up! Go!

35
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,680
Li Wenshu, are you crazy?

36
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,460
It's my show time.

00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,520
-Bravo!
-Nice shot!

38
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,570
Yueniang.

39
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,880
Go! Go!

40
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,760
Are you okay?

41
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,100
How could you do this?

42
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,110
-Pass the ball!
-Come on!

43
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,090
Come on, Zhu.

44
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,620
I'm fine.

45
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,860
Go on.

46
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,870
Attack!

47
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,720
Defend!

48
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,900
Li Wenshu, catch the ball.

49
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,829
-Nice shot!
-Nice shot!

50
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,900
Amazing!

51
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,390
It was within my expectation.

52
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,300
Son,

53
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,270
don't cause trouble for your father.

54
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,690
I wonder how the competition is going inside.

55
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,950
The Literature and Martial Arts Tournament is being held inside. Irrelevant people are not allowed to enter.

56
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,750
I'm a student of the academy.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,080
Where is your certificate?

58
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,180
Show us.

59
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,340
I can't enter without a certificate?

60
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,750
This is the rule set during the competition.

61
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,920
Sorry.

62
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,350
What are you doing?

63
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,960
What are you doing?

64
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,670
Come here.

65
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,530
Come here.

66
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,590
Again?

67
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,020
Brat.

68
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,180
You're not here to play.

69
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,110
Where is the ball?

70
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,010
Pass the ball. Hurry up.

71
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,870
Xue Hanfu.

72
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,310
Hurry!

73
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:31,950
This way.

74
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,150
Catch it.

75
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,950
Junior Xue.

76
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,820
Xue Hanfu.

77
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,590
Are you okay?

78
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,240
Xue Hanfu, are you okay?

79
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,790
The ball.

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,520
Give me the ball.

81
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,260
Hurry up!

82
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,870
-Go!
-Go!

83
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,150
Bravo!

84
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,790
Nice shot!

85
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,750
They've gone too far.

86
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,030
Come on!

87
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,750
-Come on!
-Come on!

88
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,140
Defend!

89
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Defend!

90
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,720
You...

91
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,860
Lord Li, calm down.

92
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,160
This is the arena.

93
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,050
This way. Hold on.

94
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,700
Ding Miao.

95
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,670
Move.

96
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,070
Are you okay?

97
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,310
Why is he wearing a mask?

98
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,390
Who is this?

99
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,810
That's right. I have never seen him before.

100
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,230
I have never seen him before.

101
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,830
No.

102
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,470
We still have time to score.

103
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Leave those two to me.

104
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,680
You focus on taking the ball and scoring.

105
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,040
Are you okay?

106
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,820
I'm... I'm fine.

107
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,240
Go get some rest first.

108
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,770
Okay, come on.

109
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,900
-Mr. Xiao.
-Xiao Yu.

110
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,710
Mr. Xiao.

111
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,720
As long as Yueniang is fine.

112
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,860
As long as Yueniang is fine.

113
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,680
Tu Ding, go to his right.

114
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,110
Okay.

115
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,430
Ding Miao, go to his left.

116
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,220
Pay attention to the direction of the ball and the goal.

117
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,659
Ding Miao.

118
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,720
Go.

119
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,490
Senior, catch the ball.

120
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,930
We won!

121
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,190
We won!

122
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,350
We won!

123
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,150
Yueniang, you're the best!

124
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,470
We won.

125
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,820
Yiyang Academy won the Literature and Martial Arts Tournament.

126
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,920
We won.

127
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,650
-Yueniang.
-Yueniang.

128
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,310
Yueniang.

129
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,260
We won.

130
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,220
It hurts. It hurts.

131
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,020
What's wrong?

132
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,390
You're badly injured.

133
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,430
Does it hurt?

134
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,180
I'll get you the best medicine.

135
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,050
It's okay. It's just a minor injury.

136
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,840
It doesn't hurt.

137
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,480
Why were you so careless?

138
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,310
What do you think?

139
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,830
Am I good?

140
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,270
You are great.

141
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,040
Awesome.

142
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,580
Let's see who dares to look down on female students again.

143
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,150
That's right.

144
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,280
-That's right.
-That's right.

145
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,190
Yiyang Academy is the best.

146
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,830
I didn't expect the final score

147
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,670
to be taken by Song Zhu.

148
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,420
If it were me,

149
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,280
I could score too.

150
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,850
You played very well.

151
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,600
-Of course.
-That would be a foul then.

152
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,050
Xiao Yu has been expelled from the academy.

153
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,310
You cheated.

154
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,540
That's right. You cheated.

155
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,710
-What happened, Dean Song?
-Yes, that's right.

156
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,260
That's right. You cheated.

157
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,950
That's right.

158
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,550
You cheated.

159
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,500
Yiyang Academy can't afford to lose. Is that so?

160
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,290
You cheated!

161
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,040
You are despicable.

162
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,790
Who said we cheated?

163
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,950
Don't talk nonsense behind our backs.

164
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,100
It's really despicable to gossip behind our backs.

165
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,420
Who is this nasty girl?

166
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,630
How did Yiyang Academy educate women?

167
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,510
You cheated.

168
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:28,990
You cheated.

169
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,510
You cheated.

170
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,350
What are you talking about?

171
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:30,910
You cheated!

172
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,910
What nonsense are you talking about?

173
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,710
-Young Master.
-Uncle Hu.

174
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,850
Cut the crap.

175
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,140
How is the investigation going?

176
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,330
Young Master, why did you...

177
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,170
-You cheated.
-Can you be reasonable?

178
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,150
You cheated.

179
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,580
What makes you say we cheated?

180
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,830
You are despicable!

181
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,450
That guy, are you trying to escape?

182
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,480
Uncle Hu.

183
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,720
Come back and explain the cheating.

184
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,110
Come back and explain it.

185
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,750
Stop arguing.

186
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,110
Stop arguing.

187
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,350
There is something I don't understand.

188
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,920
You cheated.

189
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,630
What do you want to understand?

190
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,810
I picked these things accidentally.

191
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,790
I didn't expect them to be the tokens of the Imperial College.

192
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,840
In the Literature and Martial Arts Tournament,

193
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,970
there shouldn't have been students from the Imperial College, right?

194
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,360
Where are you going in such a hurry?

195
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,990
Dean is still here.

196
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:07,910
Let's go.

197
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,310
[Bureau of Military Affairs]

198
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,010
The Bureau of Military Affairs?

199
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,250
Without the tokens of the Imperial College,

200
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,350
they can't enter the academy, right?

201
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,010
What are you talking about?

202
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,550
Give us the tokens.

203
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,230
-Give us the tokens.
-Give them to us.

204
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,150
Give them to us.

205
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,890
You shameless thief, how dare you steal?

206
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,530
Give them to us.

207
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,150
Hurry up.

208
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,040
Hand them over.

209
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,590
Don't do anything stupid.

210
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,670
Why are you so anxious?

211
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,710
Are you a student of the Imperial College?

212
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,710
How dare you!

213
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,610
In broad daylight,

214
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,910
you're talking nonsense.

215
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,310
There are no students from the Imperial College here.

216
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,260
Then let's take a look.

217
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,300
You look quite alike.

218
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,090
It's him.

219
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,920
It's him.

220
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,550
You're alike.

221
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,380
Quite alike.

222
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,200
Right?

223
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,070
-Look.
-They look exactly the same.

224
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,830
Yesterday,

225
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,470
I heard the academies in Yiyang would hold a tournament,

226
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,070
so I came to watch.

227
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,420
I didn't expect to find these three tokens on the arena.

228
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,610
I wanted to return them to its owners,

229
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,500
but I didn't expect Song's Academy to be insulted.

230
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,950
I was just saying, but I accidentally revealed the fact

231
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,350
that the Imperial College helped someone cheat.

232
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,440
Tell me.

233
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,960
What a coincidence, right?

234
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,590
You shameless people!

235
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,830
-Leave.
-Just leave.

236
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,270
Get lost!

237
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,270
You are the shameless people who can't afford to lose.

238
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,540
Who are you cursing?

239
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,750
Stop!

240
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,690
What did you say?

241
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,280
Say it again!

242
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,430
Stop! Come back!

243
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,240
-Where are you going?
-Come back!

244
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,110
Don't go if you're capable.

245
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,300
I'm talking about you. Stop right there.

246
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,030
You said it, right?

247
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,630
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

248
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,390
You helped us solve the problem this time.

249
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,490
Indeed, it was thanks to Mr. Xiao.

250
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,040
Mr. Chen,

251
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,210
our academy has a rule that major contributors

252
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,520
can have their merits and demerits offset each other, right?

253
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,550
Xiao Yu exposed the fact that the Imperial College

254
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,170
helped the other three academies cheat.

255
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,510
He's a major contributor, right?

256
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,310
Of course.

257
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,780
Mr. Chen,

258
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,020
why don't you let Mr. Xiao

259
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,800
come back to be a teaching assistant again?

260
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,950
Indeed, Xiao Yu has made a great contribution.

261
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,670
Please think about it, Dean.

262
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,240
Songzhi,

263
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,360
what do you think?

264
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,700
Dean,

265
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,950
I think

266
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,190
since there are rules,

267
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,500
we should follow the rules.

268
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,200
Uncle Hu.

269
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,350
The tournament lasted for a day.

270
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,710
Everyone must be tired.

271
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,870
There's no rush.

272
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,230
Get some rest.

273
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,320
Mr. Han,

274
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,160
please.

275
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:39,950
Please.

276
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,210
Please.

277
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,070
Go now.

278
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,150
Uncle Hu.

279
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,050
Everyone is waiting for you.

280
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,650
Let's go.

281
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,370
Yueniang,

282
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,560
do you think Mr. Xiao

283
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,520
can come back or not?

284
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,200
I don't know.

285
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,890
You...

286
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,410
You.

287
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,170
You.

288
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,290
You.

289
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,410
All of you!

290
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,850
The three academies in Luoyang joined hands.

291
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,210
But you still lost to a mixed-gender team of Song's Academy.

292
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,970
Are you all losers?

293
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,560
I tried so hard

294
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,920
to ask for help from the Imperial College.

295
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:52,480
You...

296
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,690
Lord... Lord Li,

297
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,850
we didn't expect this to happen either.

298
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,730
Who would have known Xiao Yu

299
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,610
would come out of nowhere?

300
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,360
The whole plan was ruined by him.

301
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,890
And your son also stood out

302
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,400
in this competition.

303
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,200
So it was... an awkward matter to us.

304
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,849
He's just a teaching assistant.

305
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,599
Is he that capable?

306
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,839
You...

307
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,599
You have never reflected on yourselves.

308
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,569
You must have been careless.

309
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,200
That's why Xiao Yu took the chance.

310
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,119
Now this is great.

311
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,890
The three academies made fools of themselves by cheating

312
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,450
and lost the competition.

313
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,370
But this has helped Song's Academy

314
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,120
become more famous.

315
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,760
You are really...

316
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,970
Song's Academy.

317
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,120
Xiao Yu.

318
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,510
You acted rashly, Young Master.

319
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,570
You acted rashly.

320
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,890
Didn't I repeatedly tell you

321
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,280
to wait for me at the inn?

322
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,320
Look at what you did.

323
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,290
You went to watch the tournament

324
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,490
and even joined them.

325
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,850
What should we do

326
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,290
if someone recognized you?

327
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,730
They didn't recognize me, right?

328
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,920
I left the arena safely, right?

329
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,370
Young Master, better safe than sorry.

330
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,850
Don't worry, Uncle Hu.

331
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,570
It's no big deal this time.

332
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,890
If they really recognize me, they would have recognized me in the arena.

333
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,000
Since I have left there,

334
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,610
it means everything is fine, right?

335
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,110
But...

336
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,720
What happened?

337
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,730
I took a ball for Miss Song Zhu.

338
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:19,920
Young Master,

339
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,680
you've really given your heart to the academy.

340
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,250
You even saved a girl.

341
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,760
Was it because she's Miss Song Zhu?

342
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,280
Because she's a woman.

343
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,130
What does that mean?

344
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,610
You should've been there.

345
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,930
You should've done it.

346
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,570
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it.

347
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,440
Young Master, I was looking for you everywhere.

348
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,410
You didn't find me

349
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,640
and you didn't save her.

350
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,680
Uncle Hu, you are really capable.

351
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,400
Young Master,

352
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,720
if it were really as urgent as you said,

353
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,060
you should have refused and said you won't go back to the academy.

354
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,120
If I hadn't dragged you...

355
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,250
Everyone was looking at me

356
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,690
with gratefulness.

357
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,970
How could I let them lose face?

358
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,490
How could you make me let them lose face?

359
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:07,730
Alright.

360
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,080
Let's get down to business.

361
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,810
Did you catch up with those two men today?

362
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,130
No.

363
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,850
What a pity.

364
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,330
I don't think they are simple.

365
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,090
You're right.

366
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,890
Why are they not simple? Tell me.

367
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,680
Those two are from the Bureau of Military Affairs.

368
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,290
I knew it.

369
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,770
If that is the case,

370
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,330
Song Xu has something to do with them.

371
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,250
Both the students of the Imperial College

372
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,570
and the masters of the Bureau of Military Affairs came to Yiyang.

373
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,490
Seemingly, their purpose is to destroy Song's Academy.

374
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,570
Why?

375
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,720
I don't know if Song Xu is one of them.

376
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,530
But Li Shancai

377
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,880
must have something to do with them.

378
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,130
Young Master,

379
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,920
when I was looking for you,

380
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,280
I saw Zhou Ji and Zhou Ting

381
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,610
meet each other secretly.

382
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,560
They are brothers. It doesn't mean anything.

383
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,170
But Zhou Ji lost the competition.

384
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,090
He lost to his big brother Zhou Ting,

385
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,120
who's been admitted to the Imperial College because he gave up the place.

386
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,520
Uncle Hu, go back to the inn first.

387
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,760
I'm going back to the academy.

388
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,250
Young Master, we just finished our task.

389
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,930
The tournament just ended.

390
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,710
The crown prince is waiting for us to go back.

391
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,530
We should set off early.

392
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,280
Are you the young master or am I the young master?

393
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,560
Mr. Xiao?

394
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,490
Mr. Zhou.

395
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,720
My bed...

396
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,200
is still available, right?

397
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,650
Of course.

398
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,960
Mr. Zhou, aren't you gonna invite me in to have a seat?

399
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,720
What... What are you talking about?

400
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:19,520
Please come in.

401
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,450
Mr. Xiao, are you coming back to the academy?

402
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,290
Mr. Zhou,

403
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,600
you don't welcome me?

404
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,200
Of course I welcome you.

405
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,890
Mr. Xiao helped the academy turn the tables.

406
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,890
Everyone is grateful to you.

407
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,870
It's just that... you don't look like

408
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,930
you are ready to come back.

409
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,790
I'm not coming back now.

410
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,360
Then Mr. Xiao is here to...

411
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,870
I remember I left something here.

412
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,880
I'm gonna look for it. It's okay.

413
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,250
You... You can just do your things.

414
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,050
Mr. Xiao,

415
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,770
if it weren't for you today,

416
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,610
Miss Zhu would have been hurt.

417
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,400
It was... just a coincidence.

418
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,680
Right, Mr. Zhou,

419
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,890
it should be the meal time now.

420
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,170
Why didn't you go?

421
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,450
I have no appetite.

422
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:46,810
Mr. Zhou,

423
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,010
are you still upset about the competition?

424
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,960
Mr. Xiao knows about it too?

425
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,400
As a student, I lost the competition.

426
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,490
It's because I haven't studied hard enough

427
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,810
and I'm not as capable as him.

428
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,310
I must spend more time studying harder.

429
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,240
Mr. Zhou.

430
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,560
Mr. Zhou has a wide reputation

431
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,230
for being talented.

432
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,640
From what I know about Mr. Zhou,

433
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,120
you are good at drawing.

434
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,290
And you are better at playing chess.

435
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,760
The life and death problems in a chess game

436
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,450
are difficult for beginners.

437
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,130
But for Mr. Zhou,

438
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,520
I think they can be solved easily.

439
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:33,890
Mr. Zhou,

440
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,730
did the student of the Imperial College

441
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,450
play a trick?

442
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,440
Mr. Xiao, what makes you say so?

443
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,560
You saw it this morning.

444
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,930
The students of the Imperial College

445
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,480
were up to no good.

446
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,890
In the third round,

447
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,570
they committed a foul

448
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,050
to score.

449
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,000
In that case,

450
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,960
it's normal for them to do dirty things.

451
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,450
Mr. Zhou,

452
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,200
did he?

453
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,090
No.

454
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,740
Maybe I thought too much.

455
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,890
I won't talk about this again.

456
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,490
I found it.

457
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:24,970
Mr. Zhou,

458
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,400
I'm leaving.

459
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,990
Okay.

460
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,000
Goodbye, Mr. Xiao.

461
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,360
Come on.

462
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,850
Come on.

463
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,890
Come here, everyone.

464
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,560
I'm so happy today.

465
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,930
Thanks to Mr. Xiao

466
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,450
and Miss Song Zhu.

467
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,560
In terms of the last shot,

468
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,780
Miss Zhu did great today.

469
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,410
Right?

470
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,720
Yes.

471
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,740
Come on, let's make a toast to Zhu with tea.

472
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,990
Because I am the best female student

473
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,720
in Yiyang Academy.

474
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:06,810
Drink it.

475
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,170
Come on.

476
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,120
Come on. Drink.

477
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,930
Come on.

478
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,130
Drink it.

479
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:12,960
Here.

480
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,960
Speaking of Mr. Xiao,

481
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,810
if he hadn't shown up at the critical moment

482
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,610
to take the ball for Miss Zhu,

483
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,840
Miss Zhu would have been hurt

484
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,320
just like Junior Xue.

485
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
That's right.

486
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,490
Speaking of this,

487
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,970
I really should thank him.

488
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,200
Everyone in Men's Academy said

489
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,530
the key to this time's success

490
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,900
is Mr. Xiao's hug for Yueniang.

491
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,070
And there is more.

492
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,810
They also said

493
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,410
they are a perfect...

494
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,760
a perfect match.

495
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,770
Who said that?

496
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,250
A perfect match.

497
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,040
I...

498
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,850
I heard them say that

499
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,560
when I was passing by.

500
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,260
So I was just saying.

501
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,690
I didn't say it.

502
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,600
Stop talking.

503
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,040
Let's eat.

504
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,430
They were just talking nonsense.

505
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,880
Don't take it to heart.

506
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,170
I won't take it to heart.

507
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,280
But will Mr. Zhou think too much?

508
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,270
That's right.

509
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,850
How could I forget that?

510
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,400
And he lost the competition today.

511
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,370
I think he must be more upset.

512
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,510
I only focused on watching the competition.

513
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,070
I...

514
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,680
I neglected this.

515
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,090
Junior Zhou,

516
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,080
I have something to tell you. Meet me at the back of the mountain.

517
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,370
Xiao Yu saved Miss Song Zhu today.

518
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,320
Women's Academy is also talking about this.

519
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,050
That's right.

520
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,370
That was a great kick.

521
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,170
That's right.

522
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,810
I don't even know how she scored.

523
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,650
Yes, it was really amazing.

524
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,370
That's right.

525
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,120
Miss Zhu.

526
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:17,960
Junior Zhou.

527
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,170
After today's competition was over,

528
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,210
I didn't have time to ask you.

529
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,670
Are you okay?

530
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,770
Thank you for your care.

531
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,120
I'm fine.

532
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,480
Really?

533
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,290
That's good.

534
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,810
Miss Zhu, why did you ask me here?

535
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,650
Actually, it's nothing important.

536
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,280
I'm glad you're fine.

537
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,980
Then I don't need to think of so many words

538
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,590
to comfort you.

539
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:02,920
Well...

540
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,240
Anyway,

541
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,610
you'll always be the most talented man in my heart.

542
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:22,810
Thank you, Miss Zhu.

543
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,130
You're so thoughtful.

544
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,490
Do you... have something else to say?

545
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,700
Why are you walking around with a male student at this hour

546
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,370
instead of going back to the dorm?

547
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,410
Miss Zhu,

548
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,800
you are getting more and more audacious.

549
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,930
Well, Miss Zhu,

550
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,880
I should leave.

551
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,240
But...

552
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,240
But there is something I haven't told you yet.

553
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,010
Let's go back.

554
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,210
Instructor Shen

555
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,290
really showed up at the wrong time.

556
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,140
He showed up just when I mustered up my courage.

557
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
But

558
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,360
we didn't really win today's competition.

559
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,210
But in my heart,

560
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,930
they've already won.

561
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,790
As the saying goes, a drop of water cannot make an ocean,

562
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,960
and a single tree can't make a forest.

563
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,290
When the students stood up

564
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,450
and united as one,

565
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,170
the thriving morale

566
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,460
reminded me of myself when I was young.

567
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,010
When you were young,

568
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,490
you were as reckless as them.

569
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,240
People can never return to their truth.

570
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,600
I didn't expect my father to be enthusiastic.

571
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:03,690
Right,

572
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,440
Darling,

573
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,840
I heard that Xiao Yu's returning to the academy hasn't been decided yet.

574
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,520
Let him handle it himself.

575
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,210
But...

576
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,730
Yu is more independent-minded than we think.

577
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,690
You've never been on that swing.

578
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,920
You can't feel the...

579
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,290
the tension or thrill

580
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,080
immersively.

581
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,250
Back then, it was like there was a kind of...

582
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,730
a kind of invisible power.

583
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,580
It... It...

584
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,090
It was like I was possessed by my ancestors.

585
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,730
And they made me score

586
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,130
and win the crucial round.

587
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,880
Mr. Ding, you're amazing.

588
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,240
Amazing.

589
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,890
Awesome.

590
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,650
But

591
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,680
compared to Mr. Xiao, it's not worth mentioning.

592
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,600
When Mr. Xiao ran towards Miss Song Zhu

593
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,810
and stood in front of her,

594
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,690
guess what?

595
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,620
He was like an immortal

596
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,560
and held her in his arms.

597
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,670
Impressive.

598
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,170
Mr. Li

599
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,770
should have stood out in the competition.

600
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,600
But Xiao Yu took the glory for no reason.

601
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,990
Mr. Li was looking at the big picture.

602
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,550
Otherwise, he wouldn't have stood out.

603
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,340
I don't care about petty gains.

604
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,610
As the saying goes, when a man retires from his responsibilities,

605
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,760
fame and fortune become irrelevant.

606
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,520
A bunch of vulgar people.

607
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,840
Mr. Xiao was against two men alone.

608
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,690
He protected Miss Song Zhu and helped her win the crucial round.

609
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,520
That was how we exposed the plot of humiliating us

610
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,040
of the three academies in Luoyang.

611
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,120
But Mr. Xiao still hasn't said

612
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,000
if he will come back to the academy.

613
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,520
This morning, I went to clean the room for our teacher.

614
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,040
Mr. Chen said Mr. Xiao went to him yesterday

615
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,810
and told him he wanted to come back to be the teaching assistant.

616
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,440
Really?

617
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,530
He'll come back to the dorm today.

618
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,210
Then we should welcome him properly.

619
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:48,620
That's right.

620
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,300
According to The Book of Lord Shang, the Strategy of War,

621
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,440
the army of a real king

622
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,650
does not boast a victory

623
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,070
or harbor rancour for a defeat.

624
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:06,170
Besides, the result hasn't come out yet.

625
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,090
And you are so noisy.

626
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,690
How inappropriate!

627
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,970
The exam is in a few days.

628
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
You should review your lessons.

629
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,370
If anyone fails the exam,

630
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,010
I will

631
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,050
punish him.

632
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,170
Yes, Sir.

633
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:35,970
Okay.

634
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,840
That's all for today's class.

635
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,810
I'm going to announce something.

636
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,240
From tomorrow on,

637
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,330
Teaching Assistant Xiao will come back.

638
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,350
I don't need to feel guilty anymore.

639
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,740
But I should pay him back as soon as possible.

640
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,220
I need to find out if Mr. Zhou has misunderstood us

641
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,030
before Xiao Yu comes back.

642
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,710
Class dismissed.

643
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,940
Mr. Zhou...

644
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,890
Mr. Zhou...

645
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,040
Mr. Zhou.

646
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,710
Miss Song Zhu.

647
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,560
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

648
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,530
Go back to Women's Academy.

649
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,400
If I see you

650
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,260
make trouble in Men's Academy again,

651
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,490
I'll punish you severely.

652
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,230
I'll also report it to Dean.

653
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,500
I won't do this again.

654
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,320
I won't.

655
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,280
I'm leaving.

656
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,120
Master.

657
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:14,730
Come in.

658
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,889
Master, someone wants to see you.

659
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,170
Who is it?

660
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,650
He's not wearing fancy clothes.

661
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,530
He said his surname is Zuo.

662
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,480
Lord Zuo, please.

663
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,530
Here.

664
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,060
-Close the door.
-Okay.

665
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,570
Greetings, Lord Zuo.

666
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,340
Save it.

667
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:46,960
Someone has reported what happened in Yiyang

668
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,850
to Officer Wan.

669
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,639
How should you be punished?

670
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,920
I failed to fulfill my duties.

671
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,440
Lord Zuo, please put in a good word for me in front of Officer Zuo

672
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,200
and give me a chance to make up for my mistake.

673
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,480
What mistake?

674
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,160
Li Shancai,

675
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,160
let me ask you.

676
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,240
What was wrong with you?

677
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,170
I...

678
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,410
You didn't do a good job.

679
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,730
And it has boosted Song Xu's reputation.

680
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:13,850
Let me ask you.

681
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,570
How did they find out about the students of the Imperial College?

682
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:18,920
Well...

683
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,290
Well...

684
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,410
It was all because of a man named Xiao Yu.

685
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,210
Xiao Yu?

686
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,070
Who is he?

687
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,610
He...

688
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,600
He...

689
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,640
Why does his name sound the same as the name of the young master of the Xiao family?

690
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,720
Go now.

691
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,080
Investigate this person in secret.

692
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,600
Okay.

693
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:34,970
I will find out the truth.

694
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,830
Go now.

695
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,950
Okay.

696
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,540
Mr. Xiao, congratulations on your return to the academy.

697
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,650
Let's go.

698
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,080
Nice catch.

699
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:56,650
You are really...

700
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,270
Mr. Xiao,

701
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,810
I'm so happy that you're back.

702
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,790
I've done the fortunetelling.

703
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,760
There's water in your destiny.

704
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,360
It signifies prosperity for me.

705
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,820
With your help,

706
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,320
I will definitely be invincible

707
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,400
and move forward steadily.

708
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,130
Alright.

709
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,660
We are brothers.

710
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,740
Don't stand on ceremony.

711
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,330
Mr. Xiao,

712
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,050
you are really capable.

713
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,560
You caught the water basin perfectly.

714
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,330
That's right.

715
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,650
What are you talking about?

716
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,850
Mr. Xiao has shown what he's capable of

717
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,170
in the arena, right?

718
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,650
If he hadn't found out other academies cheated

719
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,930
and helped us win the competition,

720
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,810
our academy's reputation would have been ruined.

721
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,530
This time, instead of losing its reputation,

722
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,330
our academy is world-famous.

723
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:28,790
That's right.

724
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,200
Alright.

725
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,170
Have you seen Mr. Zhou?

726
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,530
He went to Wenjing Hall.

727
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,840
Although he didn't come to celebrate with us,

728
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,650
I believe

729
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,450
his heart

730
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,840
is with us in the dorm.

731
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:40,970
Yes.

732
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:45,480
Well...

733
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,120
Well...

734
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,110
What happened?

735
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,550
I knew it.

736
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,660
We've gone too far

737
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,650
considering the way of celebrating.

738
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,040
It's within my expectation.

739
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,490
It's within my expectation.

740
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,090
The divination today

741
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,090
must be ominous.

742
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,050
Mr. Xiao must have encountered some difficulties.

743
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:01,330
Then...

744
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,160
Then let's help him.

745
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:03,960
We can't.

746
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,770
It's about love.

747
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,890
Love?

748
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,070
How should I get close to him?

749
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,130
Right, Mr. Xiao?

750
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,360
Yes.

751
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:16,890
Yes.

752
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,170
Mr. Xiao, what's wrong?

753
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,000
Nothing.

754
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,530
Nothing.

755
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,930
It's very likely

756
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,520
he's lovesick.

757
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,330
Lovesick?

758
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:34,770
Mr. Xiao,

759
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,320
As the old saying goes,

760
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,000
I advise you not to cherish cloth of gold,

761
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,410
but to honor the days of youth.

762
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,040
Pick the flowers while they are blooming.

763
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,850
Wait not to grasp in vain at empty twigs.

764
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:44,610
If you

765
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,170
really like Miss Song Zhu,

766
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,590
just confess your love to her.

767
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,200
What did you say?

768
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,210
Everyone knows

769
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,550
you saved her.

770
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,970
Don't hide it anymore.

771
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,890
Everyone is saying you and Miss Song Zhu are together.

772
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,090
What do you mean?

773
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,410
What nonsense are you talking about?

774
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:01,610
Leave.

775
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,530
Tell us.

776
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Mr. Zhou, you're back.

777
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,970
Mr. Zhou.

778
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,570
He looked like nothing happened when he saw you back.

779
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,720
What's wrong with Mr. Zhou?

780
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,560
Nothing. Nothing.

781
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,090
Leave.

782
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,010
We'll talk about it later.

783
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,750
Go back to your dorm.

784
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,470
What happened?

785
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,290
I don't know.

786
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,780
Do you think Mr. Zhou is angry?

787
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,400
Keep your voice down.

788
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,800
I advise you not to cherish cloth of gold,

789
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:48,890
but to honor the days of youth.

790
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,590
Pick the flowers while they are blooming.

791
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,960
Wait not to grasp in vain at empty twigs.

792
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,690
Empty twigs.

793
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,080
Let's go. Just go.

794
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,330
Let's go. Let's go back.

795
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,000
On the day of the tournament,

796
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,180
I saw Mr. Xiao use your body to take the ball for Miss Zhu

797
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,280
and hug her.

798
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,040
Yes.

799
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,460
I did hug her

800
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:26,530
and save her.

801
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,120
But don't worry, Mr. Zhou.

802
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,760
Mr. Zhou, let me tell you.

803
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,490
After I took the ball for her,

804
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,460
I still feel sore all over my body.

805
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,510
They say you and Miss Zhu

806
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,720
are a perfect match

807
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,200
and a heaven-made couple.

808
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:51,430
I guess you care a lot about Miss Zhu too.

809
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,170
No, no.

810
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,370
Don't worry.

811
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,440
I don't like her.

812
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:15,960
No.

813
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,160
That fool will make it worse.

814
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,620
No.

815
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,690
I have to explain this

816
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,370
to Mr. Zhou tomorrow.

817
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,130
Either nothing will happen,

818
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,150
or something serious will happen.

819
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,690
No.

820
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,840
I can't wait till tomorrow.

821
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:10,680
Who is it?

822
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,120
Mr. Xiao,

823
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,920
there are only the two of us in this room.

824
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,650
Are you okay?

825
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,640
Maybe I had a nightmare.

826
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,390
I'm fine.

827
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,030
Who is it?

828
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,910
Could it be Uncle Hu?

829
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,070
Are you alright, Mr. Xiao?

830
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,330
I'm fine.

831
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,780
I can't sleep. I'm going out for a walk.

832
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,160
Junior Zhou,

833
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,960
actually, Xiao Yu and I are not...

834
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,680
Why are you here?

835
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,530
Aren't you here for me?
