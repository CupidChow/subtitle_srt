[Special Lady]

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,850
[Episode 19]

4
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,520
As for the poem I told you last time...

5
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,910
I wanted to say...

6
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,180
I want...

7
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,490
Senior,

8
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,270
let's review first.

9
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,990
It's getting late.

10
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,250
I...

11
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,230
The exam is in a few days.

12
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,170
I still have a lot of books to read.

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,530
Excuse me.

14
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,960
Junior Zhou.

15
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,860
Is there any misunderstanding?

16
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,430
I never misunderstand anything.

17
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,400
I just...

18
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,660
I just want to study hard.

19
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,310
I don't want to be disturbed by other things.

20
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,730
Please understand.

21
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,310
Can't believe I see ghosts

22
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,230
before midnight.

23
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,750
I didn't expect you to come to Wenjing Hall to study.

24
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,470
You're here to study,

25
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,630
but can you read?

26
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,829
What are you doing here?

27
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,850
What do you mean?

28
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,829
What kind of attitude is that?

29
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,240
Is this how you treat

30
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,550
the person who has saved your life?

31
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,470
You promised not to threaten me with this.

32
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:34,900
I...

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,990
Did I promise you?

34
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,240
I forgot.

35
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,579
I just came to the Wenjing Hall on a whim.

36
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,920
How can you read?

37
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,050
Let me see.

38
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,490
Stop it.

39
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
Like I said, you...

40
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,200
Go away!

41
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:49,829
Stay away from me.

42
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,610
Were you going to cry?

43
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,600
Are you crazy?

44
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,650
Are you talking about yourself?

45
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
That's good.

46
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,900
I'm relieved.

47
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,910
Why?

48
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,390
Because it would be too ugly.

49
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,780
You're ugly!

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,470
People surnamed Xiao are all ugly.

51
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,190
People surnamed Xiao are the ugliest.

52
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,260
The ugliest.

53
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,190
Everyone surnamed Xiao is ugly.

54
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,149
People surnamed Xiao are the ugliest.

55
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,340
You...

56
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,190
You...

57
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:26,630
You...

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,880
Did you quarrel with Mr. Zhou?

59
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,150
I...

60
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,950
Let me help you.

61
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,070
Did you quarrel with Mr. Zhou?

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,440
I won't give it to you.

63
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,880
Here you are.

64
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Don't give it to her.

65
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,990
Don't give it to her.

66
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,400
Give it to me.

67
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,920
Let me see.

68
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,510
Open it.

69
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,610
What's written on it?

70
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,550
Miss.

71
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,130
If you keep sighing,

72
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,990
the flowers on the tree will be sighed off by you.

73
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,790
Yueniang.

74
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,560
What happened?

75
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,730
Why don't you even tell me?

76
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,430
I met Mr. Zhou at Wenjing Hall today.

77
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,060
Wasn't that a good thing?

78
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,150
But he was very cold to me.

79
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,370
"I never misunderstand anything.

80
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,350
I just want to study hard.

81
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,710
I don't want to be disturbed by other things.

82
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,030
Senior. Please understand."

83
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,220
That's what he said.

84
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,580
That's what he told me.

85
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,800
I still don't understand why.

86
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,910
He should have told me earlier.

87
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,200
It's not because of the scandal.

88
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,390
Then why?

89
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,310
Yes.

90
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,550
Then why?

91
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,910
Miss.

92
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,470
Don't you remember?

93
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,270
The exam is coming.

94
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,270
Since the exam is coming,

95
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,590
Mr. Zhou would focus

96
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,390
on his study.

97
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,510
Therefore, he was cold to you.

98
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,190
Yes.

99
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,750
You have a point.

100
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,350
But Yueniang,

101
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,200
the top deserves the top.

102
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,830
Your level of knowledge is about the same as mine.

103
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,830
Don’t lose face

104
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,550
in front of Junior Zhou in this exam.

105
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,390
Big Brother won't leak the questions and help me with the review.

106
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,150
This exam...

107
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,870
Come on, let me teach you.

108
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,110
Stop sighing.

109
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,430
Get ready for the exam.

110
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,470
The teacher is here.

111
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,590
The teacher is here.

112
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,550
Sit down.

113
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,470
Excuse me.

114
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,750
Let me help you.

115
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,470
What are you doing?

116
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,000
Didn't you ignore me just now?

117
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,050
Handsome Mr. Xiao,

118
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,230
are you going to hold a grudge against a girl?

119
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,520
The exam is coming.

120
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,050
The exam is coming.

121
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,460
And then?

122
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,670
It's too difficult.

123
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,550
I usually stay in the Teachers' office.

124
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,070
I know some of their thoughts.

125
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,750
That's what I mean.

126
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,840
So can you help me with the review?

127
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,950
To help you with the review?

128
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,430
Why should I help you?

129
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,230
Aren't we good friends?

130
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,950
Isn't it normal to help your friend with the review?

131
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,720
But it’s abnormal that you want to study.

132
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,590
It’s for Zhou Ji again, right?

133
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,789
Please help me.

134
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,510
Okay.

135
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,370
I'll help you.

136
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:35,799
No problem.

137
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,150
But

138
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,659
you have to pay some price.

139
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,750
Pay some price?

140
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,640
What do you mean?

141
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,570
Follow me.

142
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,650
Between Bohai and Mount Tai lies Qingzhou.

143
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,620
After the governance of Yiyi improved,

144
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,470
both the Weishui...

145
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,520
Both the Weishui and Zishui rivers have been dredged.

146
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,100
The soil...

147
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,080
The soil...

148
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,630
I remember! I remember!

149
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,700
The soil...

150
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,310
The soil there is fertile and white,

151
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,070
with extensive saline-alkali land by the seaside.

152
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,590
The land there is of the third grade,

153
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,230
with taxes at the fourth grade.

154
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,710
Offerings...

155
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,140
Offerings...

156
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,860
I remember again.

157
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,970
Offerings include salt and fine woven cloth.

158
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,210
Offerings...

159
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,550
With a variety of sea products.

160
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,350
Additionally, there are silk,

161
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,520
hemp, tin, pine, and peculiar stones from the valleys of Mount Tai.

162
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,710
The Caiyi region is suitable for pasturing.

163
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,480
You've memorized it quite well.

164
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,100
It's so hard.

165
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,870
Making a mistake costs money, so of course, I've memorized it well.

166
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,310
The essay section holds more weight in terms of points.

167
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,970
You need to focus on it.

168
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,640
Writing essays is my weakness.

169
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,430
Weakness?

170
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,510
Then I'll...

171
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,630
I'm good at it.

172
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,110
I'm good at it.

173
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,540
I'm good at it.

174
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,330
♫In the ancient road♫

175
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,610
♫Parting is hidden in the fields♫

176
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,890
♫There's no green grass through this journey of 10 miles♫

177
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,400
♫The breeze♫

178
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,200
♫Is so gentle while I'm drinking wine♫

179
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,420
♫The setting sun♫

180
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,370
♫Seems slightly burnt while I'm thinking about the past♫

181
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,670
♫I got rid of the sorrows that had made me frown♫

182
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,360
♫Why not♫

183
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,680
♫Just ride a horse to travel around the world and laugh happily?♫

184
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,150
♫I sang in the fields and knew that the journey was long and the mountains were high♫

185
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,020
♫I could only watch you leave and listen to the neighing of horses and roaring of tigers♫

186
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,230
♫I've had a few happy moments with you♫

187
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,620
♫But there were also many sad moments for parting♫

188
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,090
♫I sang in the fields and had endured many hardships♫

189
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,810
♫I don't know when we'll meet again, and maybe we'll no longer be young by then♫

190
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,970
♫Get a pot of sweet tea to comfort my confidant in the journey♫

191
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,280
♫It's just perfect♫

192
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,440
Zhu.

193
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,550
How did your essay go?

194
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,030
Not bad.

195
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,540
You're really something.

196
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,320
You really guessed the topic accurately.

197
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,750
However,

198
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,380
thanks also to my intelligence.

199
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,300
I answered without a single mistake.

200
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,750
Why didn't you say that

201
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,850
when I took your money?

202
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,770
That was just a small amount of money.

203
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,450
Just a small amount of money.

204
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,320
Yueniang!

205
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,720
What are you doing?

206
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,360
Nothing.

207
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,210
I won't bother you if there's nothing else.

208
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,150
Leave. Goodbye.

209
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,750
Goodbye.

210
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,030
Mr. Ding, do you believe

211
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,640
Mr. Zhou will be the first place again in this exam?

212
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,200
Of course.

213
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,220
My bro

214
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,130
is knowledgeable.

215
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,420
He's just a little less skilled than me

216
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,460
in fortune-telling and divination.

217
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:50,890
Mr. Zhou.

218
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,690
Zhou...

219
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,360
Can't you see?

220
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,310
Mr. Zhou is sleeping.

221
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,190
Lower your voice.

222
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,630
Listen.

223
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,630
Last night, Mr. Zhou stayed up all night

224
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,910
at Wenjing Hall.

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,040
The first place

226
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,720
won't be easy to get.

227
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,100
There's no such thing as a free lunch in this world.

228
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,340
Of course.

229
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,550
We should also study hard

230
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,740
and learn from Mr. Zhou.

231
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,680
My father said

232
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,380
all he wishes is that I finish my studies safely.

233
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,270
My mother also said

234
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,550
she would buy an official position for me.

235
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,830
What a loser.

236
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,350
Zhou...

237
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,990
Mr. Zhou.

238
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:21,980
Mr. Zhou.

239
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,820
Did we disturb you just now?

240
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,670
Mr. Zhou, Zhou...

241
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,790
Look at you.

242
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,510
It's you who wants to buy an official position,

243
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,530
not Mr. Zhou.

244
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,550
Why were you talking so loudly?

245
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,350
You were disturbing his sleep.

246
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,030
What does it have to do with me?

247
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,910
Let's go back.

248
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,780
Idiot.

249
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,180
Let's go back.

250
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,930
Good.

251
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,070
How is it?

252
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,190
How did the students do in this exam?

253
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,190
Is there anyone outstanding?

254
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,860
Zhou Ji deserves his fame.

255
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,910
He wrote fluently,

256
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,270
cited extensively, and did it all in one go.

257
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,680
But why did his handwriting

258
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,590
suddenly become exquisite?

259
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,310
Let me see.

260
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,110
Why is this handwriting so familiar?

261
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,990
Would it be a test paper from a female student?

262
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,270
How can a female student generate

263
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,110
such a broad view?

264
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,040
Why does it look so...

265
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,400
[Candidate Song Zhu A]

266
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,520
Good article.

267
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,530
Did Yueniang write this?

268
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,280
Dean, you think...

269
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,670
The skill level of Yueniang

270
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,570
and the author of this essay...

271
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,620
Are worlds apart.

272
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,790
Juntang.

273
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,790
Who do you think

274
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,430
composed this article?

275
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,150
In the entire academy, only one person is on good terms with Miss Zhu

276
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,280
and willing to make an exception

277
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,470
to help her.

278
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,750
Three places higher than last time.

279
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,790
Your name is over there.

280
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,510
See?

281
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,840
-Over there.
-Look.

282
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,270
Yes.

283
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,070
You've improved.

284
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,030
Come on.

285
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,610
Look.

286
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,350
It's a little better than last time.

287
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,820
Miss Jin.

288
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,270
Second Sister.

289
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,790
After school,

290
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,110
take your test paper back.

291
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,920
Check the mistakes.

292
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,270
During afternoon self-study,

293
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,960
copy the entire article in which you made mistakes during the exam 20 times

294
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,330
and submit it tomorrow.

295
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:56,670
Second Sister.

296
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,670
Second...

297
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,100
Second Sister.

298
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,310
20 times?

299
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,120
Got it, Second Sister.

300
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,240
Lady Zhao.

301
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,790
Take a look for me.

302
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,270
What's my ranking this time?

303
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,390
I dare not watch it myself.

304
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,830
I didn't do well in the exam, either.

305
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,450
Second.

306
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,920
Second?

307
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,310
Am I that good?

308
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,230
I didn't even review.

309
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,880
You are second to last.

310
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,020
It doesn't matter.

311
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,210
It's good to be second to last.

312
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,640
As long as I'm not the last.

313
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,460
You are just lucky.

314
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,160
Luckily your father didn't check your studies.

315
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,780
You only got the fifth place this time.

316
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,960
How come you started to show off?

317
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,450
It's just the fifth place.

318
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,670
You really piss me off.

319
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,310
I'm not cut out for studying.

320
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,270
I don't recite.

321
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,590
The person who recites every day appears dull.

322
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,670
I won't want to be a Number One Scholar, either.

323
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,380
It's enough that I can read.

324
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,430
"It's enough that I can read."

325
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,630
Am I right, Lady Zhao?

326
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,670
You're right.

327
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,980
Women don't study for fame.

328
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,109
We don't need to fight for fame for our families with knowledge.

329
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,710
Ranking is not important.

330
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,910
It's important to learn and use it.

331
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,790
Look how insightful Lady Zhao is.

332
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,109
Lady Zhao.

333
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,869
Your words

334
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,710
sound as melodious as the nightingales in the courtyard.

335
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,380
Lady Zhao talks nicely.

336
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,030
Why do you compare her with a bird?

337
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,510
Yueniang.

338
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,470
You got the fifth place and you started to show off.

339
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,990
I am...

340
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,260
I'm the fifth.

341
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,670
How dare you show off?

342
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,230
I'm the best fifth.

343
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,790
Why don't you be as outstanding as me?

344
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,830
The teacher is here.

345
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,800
Sir.

346
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,230
Sir, we’re going to class.

347
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,390
Song Zhu.

348
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,950
Let’s go.

349
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,510
Let's go.

350
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,520
Sir.

351
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,710
Go to the Dean's Room.

352
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,730
The Dean's Room?

353
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,700
Father.

354
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,510
Come in.

355
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,630
Father.

356
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,110
Are you compiling books again?

357
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,390
After reading a strategic essay,

358
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,550
I got some inspiration.

359
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,390
Whose essay is so remarkable

360
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,720
that it inspired you?

361
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,790
Make a guess.

362
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,110
I...

363
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,880
How can I guess?

364
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,860
I've never approved a test paper.

365
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,230
You should be familiar with this essay.

366
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,550
Father.

367
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,750
I...

368
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,410
Dean.

369
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,210
I, Xiao Yu, want to see you.

370
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,350
Come in.

371
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,840
Did Father find out anything?

372
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,530
Mr. Chen said you wanted to see me.

373
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,760
Have a seat.

374
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,430
After you return to the academy,

375
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,550
you've assisted Mr. Chen in formulating essay topics for the female students.

376
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,150
Have you seen these test questions?

377
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,950
I saw them while helping Mr. Chen

378
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,910
distribute the papers.

379
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,310
The question was "Because he doesn't contend,

380
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,590
no one in the world can contend with him."

381
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,910
How do you interpret this sentence?

382
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,110
Dean.

383
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,910
Forgive my frankness.

384
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,830
I disagree.

385
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,150
Father must suspect Xiao Yu and me of cheating.

386
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,550
Feel free to speak.

387
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,070
The sage Laozi advocated the highest virtue is like water,

388
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,950
benefitting all without contention,

389
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,990
dwelling in places people disdain,

390
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,710
hence closer to the Tao.

391
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,550
This phrase applies to all things in the world.

392
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,990
It's the truth.

393
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,670
But this sentence ignored the most important part.

394
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,310
Human hearts.

395
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,710
The saying goes that human hearts are unfathomable.

396
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,430
That's the truth it speaks.

397
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,710
If everyone

398
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,070
doesn't contend,

399
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,450
then how can the family be sustained?

400
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,030
How can the country be governed?

401
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,380
If everyone idles around,

402
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,430
in the end,

403
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,520
the outcome will surely be an empty treasury.

404
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,400
How come what you're saying

405
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,670
is so similar to what I said?

406
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,470
Can't you at least offer a different perspective?

407
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,350
That's just my humble opinion.

408
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,790
Forgive me if it seems presumptuous.

409
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,910
Dean. I wonder, do you think it's better for the world to strive for universal harmony

410
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,040
or to classify people into different categories?

411
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,200
Yesterday, I entered the city to sell silk,

412
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,910
tears filled my heart on the journey back.

413
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,010
The people adorned in luxurious silk attire

414
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,160
are not silk farmers.

415
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,720
The bricklayers excavated the soil in front of the gate to make bricks...

416
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,980
Why is it weird?

417
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,120
But their own house had not a single tile...

418
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,510
They're saying weird things.

419
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,670
Those wealthy families, without dirtying a finger,

420
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,870
dwell in high-rise buildings covered in tiles.

421
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,750
Dean. You mean...

422
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,150
I just remembered this poem

423
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,950
after hearing your words.

424
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,590
I didn't mean anything else.

425
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,870
All right, come in.

426
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,910
I called her here

427
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,910
to let her hear

428
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,550
what the essay she wrote

429
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,270
means.

430
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,640
Father.

431
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,390
I...

432
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,040
I won't do it again.

433
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,150
You two helped each other.

434
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,270
It seems that you two are very close.

435
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,150
I've written a letter to your father.

436
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,790
The matter of your marriage can be put on the agenda now.

437
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,950
Yu.

438
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,270
You can come over for dinner.

439
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,670
Let's discuss it again.

440
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,900
I'll follow your arrangement.

441
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,550
Okay, you may leave.

442
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,350
Let me ask you.

443
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,150
Why didn't you refuse?

444
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,030
Why should I?

445
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,030
Do you know

446
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,070
what it means when my dad invites you over?

447
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,400
As your future husband,

448
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,980
it's normal to visit your family.

449
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,140
What future husband?

450
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,080
I don't want to marry you.

451
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,190
You don't want to marry me.

452
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,030
In that case,

453
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,910
why do we need to go to such lengths?

454
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,900
Who says I don't want to marry you?

455
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,720
You're so smart,

456
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,840
beautiful, virtuous,

457
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,020
and suitable to be a wife.

458
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,750
If I can have you as my wife,

459
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,950
what else do I want?

460
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:04,830
You...

461
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,760
You're the most shameless person I've ever met.

462
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:15,910
Look.

463
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,430
We have

464
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,150
reached an agreement to break off the engagement.

465
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,520
You didn't succeed in helping me.

466
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,710
I understand.

467
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,440
You helped me write a family letter,

468
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,790
but it's as if you didn't write anything.

469
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,270
I forgive you too.

470
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,990
But now you're saying this to me.

471
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,310
I think you think I've been too nice to you lately.

472
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,950
Zhu.

473
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,360
I advise you to be kind.

474
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,990
Don't always scold me.

475
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,790
It won't do you any good.

476
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,830
I should advise you to be kind.

477
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,040
You're bullying me because the engagement hasn't been broken off.

478
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,160
Are you done scolding me?

479
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,960
If you're done.

480
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,030
I'm leaving.

481
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,430
Mr. Xiao.

482
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,720
I was wrong.

483
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,900
I beg you.

484
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,190
Can you break off the engagement with me?

485
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,020
Are you begging me?

486
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,550
I am begging you.

487
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,750
Please help me.

488
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,230
Help me ruin the engagement.

489
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,750
Okay?

490
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,680
Okay.

491
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,870
This time,

492
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,620
you owe me.

493
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,150
What do you mean?

494
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,830
Newly made clothes.

495
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,030
Come and take a look.

496
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,710
Young Master. Miss.

497
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,830
Take a look.

498
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:46,960
This one and that one.

499
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,910
Wrap them up for me.

500
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,750
Okay.

501
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,070
Well...

502
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,110
How much?

503
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,110
20 copper cash.

504
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:54,950
Okay.

505
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,510
Thank you.

506
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,560
Wait for me.

507
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,840
It's okay. I can do it myself.

508
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:01,800
Thank you.

509
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,480
Sir.

510
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,630
Excuse me.

511
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,240
All kinds of ready-to-wear.

512
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,870
This one.

513
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,300
And this one.

514
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,270
And this one.

515
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,110
Wrap them up for me.

516
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,750
Okay.

517
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,790
You...

518
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:17,790
Take them.

519
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,590
Thank you.

520
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,070
-Sir, look at this painting.
-I...

521
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,590
Pack all these up for me.

522
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,180
You...

523
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,030
Forget it.

524
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,630
Wait.

525
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,300
My mother happens to want a painting.

526
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,380
Give me a painting.

527
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,430
-Thank you, Boss.
-Okay.

528
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,270
How much is this?

529
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,030
Two taels.

530
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,030
Two taels.

531
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,510
Here. Thank you.

532
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,160
Okay.

533
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,100
Wait for me.

534
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,790
If you mess up

535
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,590
tonight,

536
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,350
listen,

537
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,470
I... I...

538
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,190
Don't worry.

539
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,450
Isn't it just to make your family hate me?

540
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,270
Is it that hard?

541
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,470
Well.

542
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,430
Make them think

543
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,260
you're showing your true colors.

544
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,880
They had a good impression of you.

545
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,110
You have to make them think

546
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,650
you've been trying to cover up.

547
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,520
Do you understand?

548
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,350
But I'm afraid

549
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,870
if my true colors are revealed,

550
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,510
the dean will force you to marry me.

551
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,790
Please make them feel

552
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,830
as embarrassed as possible.

553
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,920
Anyway, don't let them like you.

554
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,990
-Miss Song Zhu.
-Otherwise...

555
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,030
Aren't you tired of

556
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,050
nagging everyday?

557
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,640
Let me ask you.

558
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,390
Doesn't your family find you annoying?

559
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,470
I'm just afraid you'll mess it up.

560
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,110
It's hard to make people like you.

561
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,790
It's easy to be hated.

562
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,410
You know what? The way you are now

563
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,800
is quite easy for people to dislike.

564
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,830
Say it again.

565
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,910
Alright, let me help you.

566
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,750
I can do it. Give it to me.

567
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,550
-I can do it.
-You can do it.

568
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,710
I know you can.

569
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,110
The whole street sees that you can do it.

570
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,080
Give it to me.

571
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:24,950
Young Master.

572
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,150
What are these?

573
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,910
They are for the Song family.

574
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:31,610
For the Song family?

575
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,270
I promised Miss Song Zhu

576
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,750
to go to the Song family and make them dislike me

577
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,630
so that she can break off the engagement.

578
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,310
Break off the engagement?

579
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,400
With these...

580
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,960
Can you break off the engagement with these?

581
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,590
Miss Song Zhu

582
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,740
underestimated the friendship between the two families.

583
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,620
Even if the engagement is cancelled,

584
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,190
it will be sorry for...

585
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,280
You really underestimated

586
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,580
the relationship between the Song family and the Xiao family.

587
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,310
It's just that Miss Song Zhu is so stubborn.

588
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,950
If I don't agree,

589
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,850
she will think I like her.

590
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,660
Moreover, my frequent visits to the Song's Academy

591
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,990
and interactions with Song Xu

592
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,800
are advantageous to me.

593
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,390
But Young Master,

594
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,730
do you have feelings for Miss Song Zhu?

595
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,470
No.

596
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,620
Why do you keep talking about this?

597
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,860
I've been walking all day and I'm quite tired.

598
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,550
I need to go to sleep.

599
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,480
Wake me up at 3 p.m.

600
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,470
Even if it's meant to provoke,

601
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,870
these things seem too fake, don't they?

602
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,510
These are all the top qualities among fakes.

603
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,280
Top qualities.

604
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,390
Feinaing.

605
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,410
Have you packed everything for school?

606
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:56,840
Yes.

607
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,990
Is there anything else you need in the dorm?

608
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,710
Yiyang Academy attaches the most importance to rules.

609
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,990
It's not like home.

610
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,670
You must be polite when you get along with others.

611
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,310
They are all older than you.

612
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,470
Greet them when you meet them, okay?

613
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,910
Take these cakes back

614
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,820
for everyone later.

615
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,350
Brother,

616
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,710
I find you are more nagging than mother.

617
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,220
You won't nag me every day, will you?

618
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,910
That depends on your performance.

619
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,280
Brother.

620
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,540
[Song Mansion]

621
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,620
Is that Dean Song's house?

622
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,150
Yes.

623
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,310
That's Dean Song and Song Zhu's house.

624
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,950
Mr. Xiao, please.

625
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,080
Mr. Xiao, come with me.

626
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:58,990
Brother.

627
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,630
What are you looking at?

628
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,260
Nothing. Let's go.

629
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,470
From the moment you enter,

630
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,420
you have to be careful.

631
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,300
Uncle Dai who will escort you in is Mother's confidant.

632
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,590
He hates arrogant and domineering men.

633
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,190
Mr. Xiao, watch your steps.

634
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,400
It's so dark here. How can I walk?

635
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,250
I'll get two more lanterns.

636
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,510
How can two lanterns be enough?

637
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,550
I want ten.

638
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,980
Mr. Xiao has night blindness?

639
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,650
Poor Yueniang.

640
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,950
Mother.

641
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,860
Xiao Yu is splendid on the outside but tattered within.

642
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,240
You have no idea how arrogant

643
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,630
he is in the academy.

644
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,380
He's notorious.

645
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,870
He didn't look like that before.

646
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,270
And he helped the academy in the tournament.

647
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,310
It's true.

648
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,410
You can observe him later.

649
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,910
Besides,

650
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,390
a playboy

651
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,010
can also help the academy, right?

652
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,510
Greetings, Auntie.

653
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,100
He has night blindness.

654
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,710
Get more lanterns.

655
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,540
Go.

656
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,830
Yu. Please sit down.

657
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,070
Mother.

658
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,700
Why are there so many lanterns?

659
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,860
Mind your own business.

660
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,840
Do you know why?

661
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,500
How would I know?

662
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,300
Is it your family's way of treating a guest?

663
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,420
Whatever.

664
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,960
Let yourself go and behave wildly.

665
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,260
What is this?

666
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,590
Why does it taste so bad?

667
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,000
Can't you even taste how good this tea is?

668
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,830
I can't tell what's good about it.

669
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:40,660
Well...

670
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,210
Yu.

671
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,260
This tea is your father's favorite.

672
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,300
He mentioned in the letter that this tea is commonly stocked in your household.

673
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,260
Can't you tell?

674
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,870
No wonder

675
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,870
it tastes familiar.

676
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,870
Auntie. Please excuse me.

677
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,780
I don't like to drink tea at home.

678
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,750
It's okay.

679
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,030
Dai.

680
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,080
Make him another pot.

681
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,699
Yes.

682
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,980
You can't even recognize that this is the tea you have at home.

683
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,300
Do you have no sense of taste?

684
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,730
How would I know?

685
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,920
Is it also your family's way of treating a guest?

686
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,580
I was in a mess just now.

687
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,510
That was improper.

688
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,300
I haven't presented the gifts yet.

689
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,350
Auntie. I heard that you've always liked paintings.

690
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,790
So I found

691
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,720
this painting by Mr. Yan Liben.

692
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,520
Please accept it.

693
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,670
Yu. You're so polite.

694
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,470
You saved Yueniang last time.

695
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,090
I haven't thanked you yet.

696
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,470
How can I accept your gift?

697
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,270
It's just a small gift.

698
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,230
It's my duty.

699
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,340
Nothing will go wrong with this painting, right?

700
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,060
We bought it together.

701
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:39,980
Don't worry.

702
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,150
Ridiculous!

703
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,470
That's right.

704
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,030
Ridiculous!

705
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,030
Yu.

706
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,010
Where did you obtain

707
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,600
this authentic painting by Yan Liben?

708
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,230
Well...

709
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,660
A few days ago,

710
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,290
I went to the art shop to find this painting.

711
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,580
The owner told me

712
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,670
the painting was burned.

713
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,940
I really believed it.

714
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,690
I thought

715
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,180
I might never have the chance to see this painting.

716
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,000
So I stopped thinking about it.

717
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,390
I didn't expect that after they couldn't find this painting,

718
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,830
they actually lied to me.

719
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,510
Mother.

720
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,860
Why don't you take a closer look?

721
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,510
Are you sure it's an authentic painting?

722
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,310
Shut up.

723
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,590
Can't I tell if it's authentic or not?

724
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,780
Yu.

725
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,890
You know me well.

726
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,550
I don't know how to thank you.

727
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,070
Auntie. You're welcome.

728
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,900
As long as you like it.

729
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,350
Yueniang.

730
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,170
If you are as considerate as Mr. Xiao,

731
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,230
I'll be relieved.

732
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,580
Good.

733
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,320
Good.

734
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,990
Did you do it on purpose?

735
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,830
How is that possible?

736
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,490
I went to buy the painting with you.

737
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,590
You picked it yourself.

738
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:28,870
Well.

739
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,630
How can you not know

740
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,290
what your mother likes and dislikes?

741
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,880
I...

742
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:35,210
I...

743
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,990
I was also surprised.

744
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,430
What should we do now?

745
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,980
Let me think.

746
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,590
The point is you can't make any more mistakes.

747
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,790
Your mother made the mistake herself.

748
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,270
As long as you don't escape,

749
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,630
as long as you firmly...

750
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,170
Firmly refuse to marry me...

751
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,600
Zhu, how many times have you uttered these unrealistic words?

752
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,510
I don't know how many times I've rejected you.

753
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,120
Who would want to marry his brother?

754
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:13,750
I...

755
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,300
Who is your brother?

756
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,390
We can't be sisters.

757
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,510
Why don't you tell me

758
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,720
what we should do next?

759
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,170
Your parents are waiting for us to eat.

760
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,500
Zhu.

761
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,630
Come in and eat.

762
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,670
Coming.

763
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,260
Hurry up.

764
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,870
Let's go.

765
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,680
Let's cange the plan.

766
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,970
Now, your target is my father.

767
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,660
How should I do?

768
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,620
Fight with me.

769
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,410
Okay.

770
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,390
Let's go.

771
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,020
Let's eat.

772
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,510
Come, sit down.

773
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,990
Sit down, Yu.

774
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,200
Yu.

775
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,930
Do you remember you liked this dish the most

776
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,590
when you were in our mansion and young?

777
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,310
Here.

778
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,350
I made it for you today.

779
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,030
Here.

780
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,230
After a long time,

781
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,310
I can't even remember the taste.

782
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,550
How is it?

783
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,830
Delicious.

784
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,590
Then eat more.

785
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,630
Make yourself at home.

786
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,760
Okay.

787
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,030
Why are you so rude?

788
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,990
My parents haven't eaten yet.

789
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,630
Uncle Song told me to make myself at home.

790
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,430
Didn't you hear that?

791
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,470
Father, look at him.

792
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,170
He has no manners at all.

793
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,470
Yueniang.

794
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,550
You finally have something you don't like.

795
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:46,820
I...

796
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,510
We are family.

797
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,310
It doesn't matter.

798
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,560
Let's eat.

799
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:52,950
Let's eat.

800
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,690
Let's eat.

801
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,980
I heard that

802
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,640
Mr. Xiao helped Yuenaing

803
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,430
with the review for this exam.

804
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,390
Really?

805
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,610
Before, Yueniang came to me for review before every exam.

806
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,870
Why did you ask Mr. Xiao for help this time?

807
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,770
-That’s because I happened...
-Yueniang has always been lazy.

808
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,340
Previously, you showed no patience with some of the difficult

809
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,950
and obscure articles.

810
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,140
It's like I wanted to kill you

811
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,560
when I asked you to recite.

812
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,910
But I didn't expect

813
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,320
that this time you could perfectly transcribe the obscure "Shang Shu - Tribute of Yu"

814
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,670
without missing a single detail.

815
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,230
That's because...

816
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,030
Yueniang.

817
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,320
You finally met someone who can control you.

818
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,000
Mr. Xiao.

819
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,590
After Yueniang have you,

820
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,840
she doesn't even need me anymore.

821
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,360
Let's eat.

822
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,040
Let's eat.

823
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,510
Yueniang has been impolite just now.

824
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,160
I'm sorry.

825
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,600
Dean, you're being too serious.

826
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,250
I know her personality.

827
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,230
Now that the marriage between you and Yueniang is on the agenda,

828
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,080
it seems like...

829
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,800
-It’s time to meet your parents.
-No.

830
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,470
I think

831
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,310
we should put the marriage aside for now.

832
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,280
What do you mean?

833
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,470
Could it be that you and Yueniang...

834
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,350
No.

835
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,230
But I haven't finished my studies.

836
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,390
If I haven't cultivated myself,

837
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,790
how can I think about establishing a family?

838
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,470
Well...

839
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,470
Uncle,

840
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,430
we haven't had a good discussion about the essay topic last time.

841
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,290
May I continue seeking guidance from you today?

842
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,250
[Song Mansion]

843
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,350
Xiao Yu, stop!

844
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,120
What did my parents tell you?

845
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,550
Of course it's about our marriage.

846
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,920
What did you say?

847
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,110
Of course, I agreed.

848
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,350
What?

849
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,230
You...

850
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,060
How can you change so easily?

851
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,210
Why didn't you refuse?

852
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,640
It's not that serious.

853
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,830
Anyway, you don't need to worry about it.

854
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,220
What do you mean?

855
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:14,830
Did you ask me?

856
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:15,880
Why did you agree?

857
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,480
You are a stumbling block in my life.

858
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,750
I'm so annoyed.

859
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,150
Are you that reluctant to marry me?

860
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,400
You sound like you’re willing to marry me.

861
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,930
Is Zhou Ji that good?
