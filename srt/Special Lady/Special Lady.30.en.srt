[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,720
[Episode 30]

4
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,790
You...

5
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,270
What?

6
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,520
My arm is numb.

7
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,710
Look.

8
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,350
You drooled on my shoulder.

9
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,550
Who did you say drooled?

10
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,840
Xiao Yu, who did you say drooled?

11
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,829
My bad. My bad.

12
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,420
Say it again.

13
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,230
My arm is numb.

14
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,829
Who did you say drooled?

15
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,670
Xiao Yu!

16
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,280
Stop it.

17
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,070
Who did you say drooled?

18
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,520
Who did you say drooled?

19
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,490
My arm is numb.

20
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,350
Stop it.

21
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,520
-It hurts.
-Xiao Yu!

22
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,230
You still won't stop.

23
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,790
Stop it!

24
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,540
Why...

25
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,050
Why are you blushing?

26
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,460
Where are you going?

27
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,590
It's getting dark. I'm going home.

28
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,430
It's...

29
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,240
getting dark?

30
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,780
Yueniang.

31
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,390
Yueniang.

32
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,040
-You came back at this hour.
-Uncle Dai.

33
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,010
You drank wine, right?

34
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,760
No.

35
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,630
No?

36
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,600
The smell is strong. You can't smell it?

37
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,470
Uncle Dai, you drank wine, right?

38
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,310
You...

39
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,490
I ate some wine-brewed rice balls.

40
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,620
I'm sleepy. I'm going back to sleep.

41
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,090
You look quite handsome...

42
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,200
when you don't talk.

43
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,550
Now I think...

44
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,430
it's a good thing

45
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,690
to marry you.

46
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,110
Why did I say that?

47
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,500
Luckily, he didn't hear it.

48
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,280
The weather in the capital is nice.

49
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,310
The citizens and neighbors are as good as those in Yiyang.

50
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,190
There are also many people in the imperial court who are Dad's apprentices.

51
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,710
So they are kind to me.

52
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,050
I wrote you this letter

53
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,550
to let you know I'm fine in the capital.

54
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,160
Mom and Dad, please don't worry about me.

55
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,180
Father,

56
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,370
when I was a student, I wondered why you are willing to stay in Yiyang

57
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,010
since you are quite knowledgeable.

58
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,690
I've been an official in the capital for a long time.

59
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,040
Now I understand you.

60
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,060
There are selfish officials in the imperial court.

61
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,590
They disregard the people's livelihood for their own benefits.

62
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,140
I've studied with you since I was young.

63
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,550
I dare not speculate your intention.

64
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,150
But I know you established Women's Academy

65
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,590
because you uphold equality.

66
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,159
I'm in the capital now.

67
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,610
And I think the tax rules are not fair.

68
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,380
So I discussed it with your apprentices.

69
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,360
I listened to their opinions

70
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,670
and submitted a memorial about it to His Majesty.

71
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,690
His Majesty promoted some of your apprentices,

72
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,790
but he never mentioned the tax thing.

73
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,790
I don't understand why.

74
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,140
So I wrote this letter to tell you.

75
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,070
Please enlighten me.

76
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,710
Recently, Song Xu

77
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,840
sent a letter to Zhao Wenlang through the post.

78
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,750
I didn't want to alert him,

79
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,010
so I didn't check the content of the letter.

80
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,550
But after Zhao Wenlang received the letter,

81
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,160
he immediately went to Lord Zuo.

82
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
They hurried to Wan Mansion at that night.

83
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,400
I'm sure they were discussing something urgent with Wan Li.

84
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,530
Besides, after they left Wan Mansion,

85
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,390
they immediately went to Duke Yue's Mansion.

86
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,110
What was so urgent

87
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,470
that they needed to inform each other in such a hurry?

88
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,400
Could it be that Song Xu found out that Chen Yan is investigating the corruption case?

89
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,840
My Lord,

90
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,140
I've delivered the letter Song Xu wrote to Zhao Wenlang

91
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,700
to Duke Yue.

92
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,550
If Duke Yue knows

93
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,590
Li Shancai is in trouble,

94
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,200
he'll definitely get rid of this problem.

95
00:06:59,230 --> 00:06:59,800
That's right.

96
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,110
Meanwhile,

97
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,970
if he knows it is because of Song Xu,

98
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,980
he'll take care of him too.

99
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,710
It's called killing two birds with one stone.

100
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,630
We are the wolf.

101
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,550
You mean

102
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,650
the wolf has a winning game

103
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,470
when the shepherds quarrel, right?

104
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,840
Bad news, Master!

105
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,150
Hurry!

106
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,980
Bad news!

107
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,830
Hurry!

108
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,550
Why are there so many soldiers?

109
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,690
What happened?

110
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,510
Tu Ding.

111
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,720
Tu Ding.

112
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,240
Hurry. Come here.

113
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,120
Have you found Mr. Li?

114
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,910
No.

115
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,350
Maybe he went somewhere to drink.

116
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,880
I wonder what happened to his family

117
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,550
so that they want to find him immediately.

118
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:08,950
Fine.

119
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:09,910
Let's keep looking.

120
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,160
Hurry. Let's go.

121
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,390
Why is Li Shancai

122
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,750
in a hurry to find Li Wenshu?

123
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,850
Could it be that what Uncle Hu did is working?

124
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,520
Your Highness, the crown prince wants to see you.

125
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,120
Alright. Stop crying.

126
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,620
Stop crying.

127
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,720
Mother.

128
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,140
You...

129
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,120
Why are you crying?

130
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,770
What's wrong, Dad?

131
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,390
Son,

132
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,900
go to your uncle's house with your mother and stay there for a few days.

133
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,480
After I resign,

134
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,830
I'll go to you.

135
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,070
What happened?

136
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,090
Don't ask.

137
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,170
Well, you...

138
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,640
I won't leave if you don't tell me.

139
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,360
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

140
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,270
Brother,

141
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,040
you do a raid every time.

142
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,160
Do you have a secret that you don't want me to know?

143
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,500
Why are you here?

144
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,200
The corruption case is related to tax rules' loopholes.

145
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,580
They are suspected of tax evasion.

146
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,030
I am

147
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,870
responsible for the case myself.

148
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,860
Where is Uncle Hu?

149
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,080
Why didn't he come with you?

150
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,250
Uncle Hu?

151
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,490
I asked him to find clues

152
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,590
and evidence

153
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,040
and then give them to Mr. Ming.

154
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,830
Mr. Ming will investigate this case.

155
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,230
That's good. We can get rid of Zhao Shoucai and the others.

156
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,710
Song Xu wrote a letter to Zhao Wenlang a few days ago.

157
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,980
It revealed the relationships among Zhao Wenlang, Lord Zuo, Wan Li,

158
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,560
and Duke Yue.

159
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,990
I think Song Xu knows you're investigating him.

160
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,860
So he informed them.

161
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,720
Impossible.

162
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,850
Why?

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,680
The donation has something to do with Yiyang Academy.

164
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,440
But he has nothing to do with the corruption case?

165
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,010
I investigated Yiyang Academy.

166
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,670
It's innocent.

167
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,850
This is not enough.

168
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,750
Maybe this is for confusing us.

169
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,720
I tested Song Xu.

170
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,750
Song Xu is upright.

171
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,790
How did you test him?

172
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,550
In the way of consulting.

173
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,110
Today, I read a sentence in the Volume 9 of the Exoteric traditions of the Han version of the Songs

174
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,530
written by Han Ying in the Han Dynasty.

175
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,150
Those who depend on luck are like an axe that breaks down people's mind and body.

176
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,010
Those who indulge in desire are like a horse that pursues calamities.

177
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,240
Dean, what do you think of this sentence?

178
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,920
Yu,

179
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,310
look at what's on the paper.

180
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,050
It means

181
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,110
if those who are not lucky

182
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,330
don't control their desire

183
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,630
and do bad things,

184
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,890
even if they make a tiny mistake,

185
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,150
they will no longer be innocent.

186
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,500
Did Song Xu say it himself?

187
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,350
That's my understanding.

188
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,250
Maybe... he meant

189
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,780
defects cannot belittle virtues.

190
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,580
Even if he does something wrong,

191
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,950
it's nothing compared to his great achievements.

192
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,670
Since I'm here,

193
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,110
I will investigate things

194
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,760
personally.

195
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,490
At this hour,

196
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,770
I think Uncle Hu has submitted the evidence about Li Shancai

197
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,420
to Mr. Ming.

198
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,240
Mr. Ming has asked men

199
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,310
to arrest Li Shancai, Zhao Shoucai, and the others.

200
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,190
Mr. Ming, thank you for traveling overnight.

201
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,380
You're welcome, Uncle Hu.

202
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,650
After I enter the city tomorrow,

203
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,810
Uncle Hu can retreat.

204
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,280
I will find out the truth.

205
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,820
This is what the crown prince wants.

206
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,650
Okay.

207
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,430
Please.

208
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,090
Please.

209
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,110
You take this.

210
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,850
Father, this...

211
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,230
Father, I...

212
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,970
This can save our family.

213
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,750
Keep it safe.

214
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,260
I...

215
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,150
Take it.

216
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,690
Mother.

217
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,750
Go now.

218
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,290
Someone. Get the carriage ready.

219
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,920
Don't.

220
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,790
Father, Mother,

221
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,390
I... I should...

222
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,240
-Go now.
-Go now.

223
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:44,790
Just go.

224
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,870
-Go.
-We should stay together.

225
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,270
Go.

226
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,270
-Mother.
-Go now.

227
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,450
-Go now.
-Father! Mother!

228
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,250
Father!

229
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,670
I didn't expect myself

230
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,360
to go to my uncle's place

231
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,710
alone.

232
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,160
As a filial son, I shouldn't

233
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,940
leave my parents home to solve problems.

234
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,540
I should share weal and woe with my parents.

235
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,840
Go back.

236
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,780
You didn't find the other half of the ledger?

237
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,640
No.

238
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,360
Keep looking for it.

239
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,220
Keep looking for it.

240
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,920
Find every part of the ledger no matter what it takes.

241
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,470
Okay.

242
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,990
Look. What happened?

243
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,820
What happened?

244
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,230
I heard Master Li and Mrs. Li are both dead.

245
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,310
What happened?

246
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,820
I heard someone in Li Mansion died.

247
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,840
Really?

248
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,260
What are you looking at?

249
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,240
Lord Li and his wife hung themselves.

250
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

251
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,280
That's not nonsense.

252
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,190
They really died.

253
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,860
Look. They are carrying them out.

254
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,320
Move.

255
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,250
Get lost.

256
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,650
I really didn't expect this.

257
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,970
Get out of the way.

258
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,990
Why did you take so much?

259
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,140
-It's not much.
-Just eat.

260
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,100
Let me give you a piece of meat.

261
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,460
Eat more.

262
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:33,910
Thank you.

263
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,770
I'm not fat. You eat this.

264
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,900
Don't be so picky.

265
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,700
I didn't say you're fat.

266
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,680
I'm not fat.

267
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,550
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,430
Sorry.

269
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,230
Let me clean it for you.

270
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,220
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,020
It's okay.

272
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,810
You are still using it?

273
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,310
Although it's ugly,

274
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,640
it's easy-to-use.

275
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,960
Go back to your room and get changed.

276
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,670
I'll wash it for you.

277
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,490
No need.

278
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,270
Thank you.

279
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,620
When did we... become so distant?

280
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,870
Actually, yesterday, I...

281
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,640
You like him, right?

282
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,510
Qinruo,

283
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,580
actually, it doesn't matter who you are with.

284
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,820
Because in my heart,

285
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,460
you are the most important.

286
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,210
Li Wenshu's parents

287
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,270
hung themselves last night.

288
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,230
What?

289
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,840
I heard it from Madam Sun

290
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,240
when I was having breakfast this morning.

291
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,750
She went to buy vegetables this morning

292
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,890
and saw it when she went past Li Mansion.

293
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,920
Where is Li Wenshu?

294
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:12,830
I don't know.

295
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,150
His father asked someone to tell him to go home last night.

296
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,920
He never came back after that.

297
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,270
What's wrong?

298
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,750
After the rumor thing in the academy,

299
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,440
my father wrote a letter of accusation

300
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,010
to Lord Zhao Wenlang

301
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,230
to tell him every bad thing

302
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,490
that Li Shancai and Zhao Shoucai did.

303
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,140
So I'm thinking

304
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,630
if Li Shancai's death is related to the letter.

305
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,740
It was a letter of accusation that Dean Song wrote to Zhao Wenlang?

306
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,020
Yes.

307
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,110
Although Li Shancai was a bad person,

308
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,400
he didn't deserve to die.

309
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,330
Li Wenshu's parents hung themselves.

310
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,860
He is an orphan now.

311
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,859
I... I

312
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,700
really feel sorry.

313
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,829
Xiao Yu,

314
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,069
do you think I shouldn't have been nosy?

315
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,849
Miss Zhu,

316
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,530
you have a strong sense of justice.

317
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,790
Li Shancai deserved it.

318
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,410
Dean Song did it for the people.

319
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,470
You don't have to feel burdened.

320
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,040
Right.

321
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,430
I'm going to meet a friend.

322
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,390
You go home first.

323
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,280
Don't go out before I come back.

324
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,810
I'm worried

325
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,550
Li Shancai's accomplices

326
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,310
will take the chance to take revenge.

327
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,430
I'm not afraid.

328
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,800
Besides, I have nothing to do in the academy.

329
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,670
Don't worry.

330
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,520
You were in danger in the academy last time.

331
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,910
But I can't just stay at home.

332
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,460
Then come with me.

333
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,600
I'm worried about you.

334
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,880
Where... am I going?

335
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,090
You are going wherever I go.

336
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,790
Hurry up.

337
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,170
Where are we going?

338
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,680
Song Zhu,

339
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,690
my parents died because of the Song family.

340
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,840
I want you to pay with your life.

341
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,520
Don't worry. She's good.

342
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,960
Xiao Yu,

343
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,630
what kind of person is your friend?

344
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,230
An ordinary person.

345
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,090
Let's go.

346
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,890
This is an ordinary person?

347
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,510
This is an ordinary person?

348
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,380
A rich ordinary person.

349
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,870
This is Song Zhu, the youngest daughter of the Song family.

350
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,330
This is my best friend.

351
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,380
His name is...

352
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,190
Xiaowu.

353
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,210
Xiao...

354
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,290
There is actually someone having a name like this?

355
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,110
Yes.

356
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,020
I wonder if the person who gave me this name

357
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,210
is stupid.

358
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,200
What's your family name?

359
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,550
She's asking your family name.

360
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,870
My family name is...

361
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,340
Tai.

362
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,140
Does this family name exist?

363
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,390
S-Sit. Sit.

364
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,320
Let's eat together.

365
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,330
Come on.

366
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,350
Sit here.

367
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,550
Make yourself at home. Eat whatever you want.

368
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,730
Here.

369
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,670
Tai Xiaowu.

370
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,500
Eat.

371
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,410
Eat.

372
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,320
Xiao Yu.

373
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,560
You are coughing again?

374
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,700
No.

375
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,260
I choked on the food.

376
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,200
I have fully recovered long ago.

377
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,950
That's good.

378
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,450
Eat.

379
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,920
Mr. Tai ordered so many dishes.

380
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,270
Isn't it a waste if we can't finish them?

381
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,480
I came to Yiyang not long ago.

382
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,670
So I want to taste

383
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,700
the specialties here.

384
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,820
So I ordered a lot.

385
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,760
I see.

386
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,910
Eat.

387
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,070
Mr. Tai,

388
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,300
have you ever tasted the peach mustard pastry from Lyu Fu Shop?

389
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,410
No.

390
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,320
Is it good?

391
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,440
Yes.

392
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,660
It's the most delicious pastry I've ever tasted.

393
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,630
Really?

394
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,380
Right. Lyu Fu Shop is nearby.

395
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,360
I'll go buy some peach mustard pastries for you

396
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,190
as a gift. What do you think?

397
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,550
Don't stand on ceremony, Miss Song.

398
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,580
Miss Zhu, don't stand on ceremony.

399
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,080
I'm not standing on ceremony.

400
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,320
I really want to buy some.

401
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,700
I also want to eat some.

402
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,210
I'm going.

403
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,670
I'll go.

404
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:15,970
It's not far anyway.

405
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,940
I'll be right back.

406
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,590
Sit.

407
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,330
Okay.

408
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,610
Xiao Yu has changed a lot

409
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,320
since he came to Yiyang Academy.

410
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,810
He does have changed a lot.

411
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:40,870
You have no idea

412
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,740
how annoying he was when he first came.

413
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,620
Of course I know.

414
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,130
We grew up together.

415
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,310
I didn't know you two are so close.

416
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,770
He...

417
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,180
is the person

418
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
I trust the most.

419
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,790
He is also the person I can entrust my life to.

420
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,370
Mr. Tai.

421
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,810
It's an old disease.

422
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,080
Can you keep it a secret for me?

423
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,680
You don't want Xiao Yu to know?

424
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,100
If he knows,

425
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,390
I'm afraid it will put him in an awkward situation.

426
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,680
Mr. Tai, are you alright?

427
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,030
Mr. Tai.

428
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,590
There is nothing he can do.

429
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,920
Telling him will only make him worried.

430
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,270
So promise me

431
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,750
that you'll keep it a secret.

432
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,990
Okay.

433
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,660
Why are you standing there?

434
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,950
You're back so soon.

435
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,940
It's not far.

436
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,140
Eat it after finishing the meal.

437
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,410
Eat. I put it in your bowl long ago.

438
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,430
-I don't have the heart to eat it.
-Take a bite.

439
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,960
Do I have to take a bite?

440
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,730
Don't make me embarrassed.

441
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:23,780
Here.

442
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,810
I'm here to tell you

443
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,770
Song Xu wrote the letter to Zhao Wenlang

444
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,670
to report Li Shancai's wrongdoings.

445
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,990
Song Xu has nothing to do with those people.

446
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,090
I've asked Mr. Ming

447
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,790
to investigate the case.

448
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,790
He has searched Li Mansion this morning.

449
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,310
The evidence is being sorted out.

450
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,420
I hope... there will be news soon.

451
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,350
You like her?

452
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,150
Who likes her?

453
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,650
Then why did you bring her here?

454
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,210
I just don't want her to get hurt.

455
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,910
You like her.

456
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,390
Stop talking nonsense, okay?

457
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,790
We are from two different worlds.

458
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,510
It's impossible for us to be together.

459
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,940
I'm glad you are aware of that.

460
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,120
Don't forget

461
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,560
you're not Xiao Yu,

462
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,320
just like I'm not Tai Xiaowu.

463
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,080
Lady Yan,

464
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,960
you usually are lively.

465
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,740
Why have you looked upset lately?

466
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,840
I'm not upset.

467
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,400
Lady Yan.

468
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,140
Mr. Zhou asked me to give this to you.

469
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,720
Thank you.

470
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,730
Lady Jin.

471
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,170
What did he write?

472
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,390
Nothing.

473
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,130
Lady Jin,

474
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,190
come with me to get some water.

475
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Take this.

476
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,180
Come with me.

477
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,450
-Let's go. You have much strength.
-Okay. Let's go.

478
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,210
You ruined my plan.

479
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,170
Between 7:00 and 9:00 tonight,

480
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,050
meet me beside the stream in the back mountain of the academy.

481
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,850
I won't leave without seeing you.

482
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,900
I didn't expect you and Mr. Tai to be so close.

483
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,130
Of course.

484
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,520
We grew up together.

485
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,230
He is the person...

486
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,040
I trust the most.

487
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,630
He is also the person I can entrust my life to.

488
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,470
You two said the same words.

489
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,230
I'm just worried about his coughing.

490
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,140
He has had this disease since childhood.

491
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,510
He coughs when the weather turns cold every year.

492
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,390
Didn't he say he has recovered?

493
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,160
I'm worried that he is just acting strong.

494
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,280
Didn't you see he coughed again just now?

495
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,430
But I'm not a good doctor.

496
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,380
There is nothing I can do.

497
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,800
When my eldest sister got married, I was very young.

498
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,950
I only remember she always cried in those days before her wedding.

499
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,650
Although I couldn't change her fate of marrying off,

500
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,320
I thought

501
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,660
I should at least give her

502
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,840
a handkerchief I embroidered myself.

503
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,750
So whenever she is sad

504
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,350
and uses this handkerchief,

505
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,210
she would think of her family members

506
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,810
who love her and always support her.

507
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,510
And she would think of a younger sister who loves her and always supports her.

508
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,030
And maybe...

509
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,110
she wouldn't be that sad.

510
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,710
But unfortunately,

511
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,000
I didn't give her the handkerchief.

512
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,740
Because my embroidery skills are too bad.

513
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,440
However,

514
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,750
in my opinion,

515
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,320
it doesn't matter what we can do for the people we care about.

516
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,420
Indeed, there are many things we can't change.

517
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,760
But

518
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,000
it's enough as long as we can do everything we want to do

519
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,470
and have no regrets.

520
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,800
Why do I feel you are a little different?

521
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,080
Don't... Don't look at me like this.

522
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,870
I... I mean

523
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,750
although you're not a doctor

524
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,870
and you can't change it,

525
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,030
you can find other ways

526
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,280
to show your care about Mr. Tai.

527
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,230
For example...

528
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,400
There is a kind of tea in your tea garden

529
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,160
that can relieve coughing, right?

530
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,680
We can go pick some for your friend.

531
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,180
Now?

532
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,330
Let's go before the sun goes down.

533
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,200
Let's go.

534
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,730
Let's go.

535
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,130
I can't be merciful.

536
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,450
She is my classmate.

537
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,330
But she is also the one who caused the death of my parents.

538
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,990
I should kill her

539
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,390
to avenge my parents.

540
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,330
Song Zhu, I'm going to kill you!

541
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,750
Lean on it.

542
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,220
Lean on it.

543
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,040
Xiao... Xiao Yu.

544
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,690
Don't make me worried, Xiao Yu.

545
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,400
Xiao Yu.

546
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,420
Xiao Yu, don't die.

547
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,560
Don't make me worried.

548
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,580
Xiao Yu.

549
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,230
Xiao Yu.

550
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,980
Open your eyes.

551
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,560
Can you hear me?

552
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,000
You can't die.

553
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,380
I don't hate you. I don't hate you.

554
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,960
I like you.

555
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,000
Can you hear me?

556
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,450
Xiao Yu.

557
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,090
I'm used to being with you.

558
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,520
You can't die.

559
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,710
Open your eyes.

560
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,180
Xiao Yu.

561
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,210
Xiao Yu, you can't...

562
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,160
You can't die. You can't die.

563
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,990
Xiao Yu.

564
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,320
Xiao Yu.

565
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,520
Xiao Yu, how are you feeling?

566
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,760
Does it hurt a lot?

567
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,190
I want to hear you say something.

568
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,260
Say something.

569
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,280
My head hurts.

570
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,650
Your head hurts? Let me see

571
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,640
if your head is injured.

572
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,620
Let me see.

573
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,590
It's not injured.

574
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,090
Because you were shaking me.

575
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,310
I'm sorry. Sorry.

576
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,310
What should we do now?

577
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,880
I'll help you up. Let's go back.

578
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,030
No. No.

579
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,130
We should find a place to rest.

580
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,220
-Okay.
-It's going to rain.

581
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,490
Come on.

582
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,100
Come on.

583
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,060
Be careful.

584
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,850
Be careful.

585
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,410
Be careful.

586
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,520
I'm sorry.

587
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,370
I still let the flowers get wet.

588
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,280
Why didn't you take shelter?

589
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,320
I was worried that you couldn't find me.

590
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,550
Qinruo,

591
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,700
let me protect you.

592
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,020
Okay?

593
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,440
Although I don't have money,

594
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,090
power,

595
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,920
or a powerful family background,

596
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,730
I have my life.

597
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,870
I am the one

598
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,750
who can protect you with my life.

599
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,090
You're so silly.

600
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:09,730
Right.

601
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,260
This is for you.

602
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,810
What are you doing?

603
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,070
I need to deal with the wound immediately.

604
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,870
Otherwise, I will bleed to death.

605
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,990
Let me help you.

606
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,880
Pull... Pull the sleeve.

607
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,190
Slowly. Slowly.

608
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,350
Why is there so much blood?

609
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,520
Deal with the wound first.

610
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,050
Come on.

611
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,140
Hang in there.

612
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:34,930
Lie down.

613
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,290
Lie down.

614
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,760
Does... Does it hurt a lot?

615
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,690
Why are you smiling?

616
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,710
It's just that I've never seen you like this.

617
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,270
Xiao Yu.

618
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,900
Thank you for saving me.

619
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,140
Song Zhu,

620
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,400
thank you for binding up the wound.

621
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,340
Stop it.

622
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,570
Xiao Yu,

623
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,970
can I ask you a question?

624
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,790
Why did you protect me like that

625
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,320
when we fell down from the hill?

626
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,750
Do you know you could die

627
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,140
by falling down from the hill with me?

628
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,160
I didn't know why.

629
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,950
But now I know.

630
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,040
Why?

631
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,140
Can I ask you a question?

632
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:03,970
Is what you said true

633
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,530
after we fell down from the hill?

634
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,460
What did I say?

635
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,320
You said we should have no regrets.

636
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,310
If I really died back then,

637
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,950
would you feel regretful?

638
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,430
You said you like me. Is it true?

639
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,000
You're taking advantage of me.

640
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,440
I am taking advantage of you.

641
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,950
I only take advantage of you.

642
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,280
Xiao Yu, you know what?

643
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,190
When you appeared,

644
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,350
I always thought

645
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,620
you were a fatal accident.

646
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,150
Now

647
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,390
I've found that you are indeed a fatal accident.

648
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,950
But you are also a beautiful accident.

649
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
Don't forget

650
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,590
you're not Xiao Yu,

651
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,430
just like I'm not Tai Xiaowu.

652
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,250
Don't take it off.

653
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:16,900
Do you want to freeze to death?

654
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,320
Your clothes are already damaged.

655
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,370
I'm fine.

656
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,190
No. Don't act tough.

657
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,820
I won't have the strength to carry you if you die.

658
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,960
Let's hold each other to keep warm.

659
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,950
No.

660
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,670
We're not doing anything.

661
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,010
When it gets colder later,

662
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,240
we'll both freeze to death.

663
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:49,700
No.

664
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,270
Come on.

665
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,320
Hurry. Let's lean on each other.

666
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,180
Closer.
