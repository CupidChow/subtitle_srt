4
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,320
Left push.

5
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,840
Right push.

6
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,870
Why didn't it work?

7
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,640
It worked.

8
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,260
It worked.

9
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,870
It... It worked.

10
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,900
-It worked.
-It worked.

11
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,750
-It worked.
-Come on.

12
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,710
I'm gonna do it again.

13
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,470
Strike while the iron is hot.

14
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,070
Come on.

15
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,380
Hold it properly. Let me take a look.

16
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,110
I know. I know.

17
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,200
I know.

18
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,910
Instructor Shen.

19
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,310
Left push.

20
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,300
I heard from my seniors and juniors today...

21
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,190
well...

22
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:44,290
many squires donated money to Yiyang Academy.

23
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,950
They even set up a charity organization for this.

24
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,829
I heard the purpose of the money of this charity organization

25
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,740
is

26
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,710
to help those students from poor families.

27
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,030
Right?

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,470
Why...

29
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,510
Instructor Shen.

30
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,030
Yes.

31
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,960
When Yan Qinruo was admitted to Women's Academy,

32
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,040
her father, Duke Yue,

33
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,950
donated a large sum of money.

34
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,960
At that time,

35
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,550
we were building the dorms.

36
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,310
Stay away from me.

37
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,510
I thought building dorms

38
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,670
was a good thing.

39
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,000
But Dean

40
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,200
advocates frugality.

41
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,390
He refused to accept the donation.

42
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,630
It was deadlocked.

43
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,990
So Duke Yue

44
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,910
used the money to set up a charity organization.

45
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,670
Move aside. Move aside.

46
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,390
Hold it straight.

47
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,450
The charity organization...

48
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,030
would allocate money to students from poor families.

49
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,710
It's also a way to cultivate some talents for the country.

50
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,510
That's right.

51
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,630
The move...

52
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,190
You need to lift it up.

53
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,680
Well, what happened after that?

54
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,230
What happened?

55
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,590
I-Inhale.

56
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,640
After that,

57
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,780
more and more people donated money to the charity organization.

58
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,720
The charity organization

59
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,920
asked the four academies to allocate the money.

60
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,990
It's not proper for Yiyang Academy to stay out of it, right?

61
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,220
So Dean

62
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,830
asked me to find some students from poor families to give them money.

63
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,560
This angle...

64
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,560
Higher.

65
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,630
Okay.

66
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,710
That's right.

67
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,590
Okay.

68
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:11,790
Then...

69
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,830
Then who is in charge of this charity organization?

70
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,470
Duke Yue.

71
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,040
He would donate money every month.

72
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,269
And the amount is the largest.

73
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,470
I think it's the most reasonable that he's in charge.

74
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,190
What about Yiyang Academy?

75
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,730
Who is responsible for this in Yiyang Academy?

76
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,590
Mr. Zhang.

77
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,470
He is responsible for checking the ledger.

78
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,490
I am responsible

79
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,390
for checking the donation list,

80
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,550
finding the students, and giving them money.

81
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,810
Then... are you... are you responsible for giving money to all of the students?

82
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm only responsible for the students in our academy.

83
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,540
Others are responsible for the students in other academies.

84
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,670
My energy has been leaked again.

85
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,070
Well, there are so many things to do in Yiyang Academy.

86
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,270
Instructor Shen, can you handle all of them?

87
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,350
I can make more contributions by doing those things.

88
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,070
It's just a donation list.

89
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,350
What's so complicated about it?

90
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,580
It's just a piece of paper, right?

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,920
I just need to go to the teachers' office to take a look.

92
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,880
Something is not right.

93
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,400
Why did you ask so many questions today?

94
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,050
Donating money is a good thing.

95
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,350
I just have nothing to do.

96
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,610
So I want to know the great achievements of Yiyang Academy.

97
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,910
Instructor Shen,

98
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,320
can you take me with you

99
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,190
to handle the donation thing next time?

100
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,070
If I take you with me,

101
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,320
what can you do?

102
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,390
I want to do good deeds.

103
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,100
I want to do good deeds just like you.

104
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,860
Fine, I'll think about it.

105
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,780
Why do I vaguely remember

106
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,990
this martial arts book can't be given to other people?

107
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,560
Stop!

108
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,280
I said I'll think about it.

109
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,150
Did I say I won't take you with me?

110
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,600
It's a good thing that young people do good deeds, right?

111
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,670
So I'll take you with me, okay?

112
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,430
Then it's a deal.

113
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,950
This martial arts book is a bit interesting.

114
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,590
It really can't be given to other people?

115
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,570
Of course it can't.

116
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,990
Can I see him in person?

117
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,660
Young Master, I really can't do this.

118
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,390
You can do this.

119
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,640
Young Master, don't make it difficult for me.

120
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,990
You can do this. You can do this as long as I say you can.

121
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,690
You can do this.

122
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,840
Instructor Shen.

123
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,750
Here. Let me introduce.

124
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,420
This is the master who gave me the martial arts book.

125
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,780
His name is...

126
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,380
His name is...

127
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,470
People in this world are like duckweed.

128
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,300
We are just dust in the universe.

129
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,590
Our names are unimportant.

130
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,070
You can call me anything.

131
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,870
No.

132
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,470
Master, I must know your name.

133
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,310
Then you...

134
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,350
Then you can call me Little King Kong.

135
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,950
Little King Song?

136
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,350
Little King Kong, not King Song.

137
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,830
Master, your name is indeed amazing.

138
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,510
I heard you really admire my martial arts book.

139
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,750
I like it very much.

140
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,910
I've been studying all kinds of martial arts books since childhood.

141
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,380
You can say I'm obsessed with martial arts.

142
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,950
Master Little King Kong, Not King Song, if you don't mind,

143
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,950
we can have a further discussion.

144
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,520
Further...

145
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,170
Further...

146
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,900
Further...

147
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,480
Looks like Instructor Shen is a master too.

148
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,500
Of course.

149
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,310
Instructor Shen is the top martial artist of Yiyang Academy.

150
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,070
In that case,

151
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,159
let's begin.

152
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,880
Impressive.

153
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,950
Master Little King Kong, Not King Song,

154
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,230
this way, please.

155
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,350
Don't...

156
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,420
Take your time. I'm going back to the dorm first.

157
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,659
Instructor Shen,

158
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,840
be careful with your swords.

159
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,590
Mr. Wang, I'm going back to the dorm first.

160
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,310
Okay.

161
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,070
I'll go to your place later.

162
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,720
Okay.

163
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,940
No.

164
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,330
I think I have forgotten something.

165
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,770
I need to go back to Wenjing Hall again.

166
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,870
Why didn't you take the front door?

167
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,560
Why are you here?

168
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,770
I want to ask you the same question.

169
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,190
Why are you here furtively?

170
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,720
I'm the teaching assistant.

171
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,170
Why would I enter the teachers' office furtively?

172
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,070
It's just that

173
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,790
I forgot to put back the documents

174
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,810
Mr. Chen gave me.

175
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,310
Mr. Chen and the others weren't here.

176
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,510
So I went in through the window because it was convenient.

177
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,450
Wait. Wait.

178
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,930
You didn't even go to class.

179
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,660
Mr. Chen asked me to sort out the documents.

180
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,680
I was sorting out the documents.

181
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,270
What's wrong?

182
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,260
Why are you looking at me like this?

183
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,790
It's like you are looking at a thief.

184
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,390
Let me ask you.

185
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,030
In the teachers' office, there are only papers and books.

186
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,310
If I'm a thief,

187
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,560
is there any gold or silver inside

188
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,350
that I can steal?

189
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,070
That makes sense.

190
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,710
Let's talk about you.

191
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,030
What are you doing here?

192
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,110
I'm here for you.

193
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:39,980
Tell me.

194
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,760
Why did you tell Qinruo that you don't like her?

195
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,030
Why shouldn't I tell her?

196
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,560
Then why did you tell me you like her?

197
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,040
Why did you tell her I like her?

198
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,450
Because you told me that.

199
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,110
I told you not to tell her.

200
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,790
So it's my fault?

201
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,350
No one is to blame.

202
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,560
Just blame me.

203
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,820
Well, why did you do this to her?

204
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,000
Since it's a misunderstanding, it's better to clarify it early.

205
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,470
I...

206
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,710
You are really...

207
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,420
I was wrong about you.

208
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,740
You said it like you were right about me.

209
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,630
What do you mean?

210
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,390
Come back. I haven't finished cursing you.

211
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,940
This is the list of and information on the poverty students accepting the donation

212
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,870
that I copied from the academy.

213
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,460
Keep it.

214
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,510
The money has almost been given out.

215
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,710
I think there are many suspicious people among them.

216
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,680
I'd better go to Luoyang tomorrow.

217
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,510
Uncle Hu, be careful.

218
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,230
I will visit the students accepting the donation

219
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,120
with Instructor Shen tomorrow.

220
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,150
Let's meet later.

221
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,390
Mr. Wu, wait for me.

222
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,070
Hurry up.

223
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,830
It's good that you came

224
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,890
to do good deeds voluntarily.

225
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,900
But you should work harder and do something concrete more frequently.

226
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,750
In that way, you'll be worthy of being a member of Yiyang Academy.

227
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,910
It's... It's so heavy.

228
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,620
Is it heavy?

229
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,520
It's not that much.

230
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,080
I delivered it on my own back then.

231
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,810
You need to exercise more.

232
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,850
Yes, you're right.

233
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,910
Let's go.

234
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,950
Thank you.

235
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,210
Yiyang Academy is my great benefactor.

236
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,510
Come on.

237
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,630
Get up.

238
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,070
Under a man's knees lies gold.

239
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,910
Sir, there are things you don't know.

240
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,830
Our family has a kid to raise and elders to support.

241
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,260
My father died of an illness a year ago.

242
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,510
We didn't even have money to eat.

243
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,910
If it weren't for the money,

244
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,030
I'm afraid I couldn't have been able to keep studying.

245
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,950
It's been so hard for you.

246
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,190
Here, take the money.

247
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,160
Study hard.

248
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,830
Serve the country in the future.

249
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,910
Thank you.

250
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,830
Put away the money.

251
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,310
We're going to visit the next student.

252
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,620
Let me walk you out.

253
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,430
Okay.

254
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,750
Please.

255
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,670
Thank you.

256
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,040
Miss, look at my cloth.

257
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,110
All of them are top-quality.

258
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,310
There are all kinds of colors.

259
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,380
-Let me take a look.
-Help yourself.

260
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,430
Does this one come in other colors?

261
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,010
Finally, it's done.

262
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,500
How much did we give out in total?

263
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,780
100 taels in total.

264
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,550
Good.

265
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,610
Instructor Shen.

266
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,310
Has the academy ever revisited the students

267
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,790
accepting the donation?

268
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,880
The academy doesn't have enough manpower.

269
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,430
Duke Yue will ask someone to revisit them.

270
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,290
We just need to give out the money.

271
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,190
Aren't you worried something might go wrong in the process?

272
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,840
You're judging a gentleman's intentions with the mindset of a villain.

273
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,830
Duke Yue donated the most money.

274
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,130
Don't you believe him?

275
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,380
Focus on something important.

276
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,790
Let's go.

277
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,350
Let's go back.

278
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,040
Not bad.

279
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,390
Put it away.

280
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,460
Okay.

281
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,640
Put it away.

282
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,720
Come on. This way.

283
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,000
This way, please.

284
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,910
Okay.

285
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,090
Cai, this way, please.

286
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,540
This way.

287
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,910
Cai, be careful.

288
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,810
Stop.

289
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,590
Who are you?

290
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,190
Stop him!

291
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:41,690
Go!

292
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,770
Don't come over.

293
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,750
I'm warning you.

294
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,110
I have someone powerful behind me.

295
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,370
You should think twice before touching me.

296
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,630
Young Master,

297
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,349
look.

298
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,349
Uncle Hu,

299
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,470
you came back to Yiyang in a hurry.

300
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,000
Why did you bring so much money?

301
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,110
I took it.

302
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,970
Where can you take so much money?

303
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,770
After Li Yi, the dean of Wenshang Academy,

304
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,590
gave out the money,

305
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,800
I followed him all the way.

306
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,350
I found that the students accepting the money

307
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,820
returned the money to Zhao Shoucai.

308
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,510
I revisited them one by one according to the list you gave me

309
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,470
and found a batch of students vanished.

310
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,590
I think... they are not students at all.

311
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,750
Thank you, Uncle Hu.

312
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,750
No big deal.

313
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,390
According to my investigation,

314
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,830
there is something wrong with most of the students in these three academies.

315
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:04,990
This time,

316
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,260
I took the money from Zhao Shoucai.

317
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,230
If someone is anxious and worried about the money,

318
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,710
he must have something to do with this.

319
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,270
It was Zhao Shoucai again who accepted the money.

320
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,880
And he specially

321
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,110
went from Yiyang to Luoyang to do this.

322
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,830
Li Shancai also cares about this matter very much.

323
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,590
He must be involved too.

324
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,070
Looks like these three academies are just transfer stations.

325
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,080
There might be more people involved behind them.

326
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,750
Anyway, the money has been taken by us.

327
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,830
Let's see who will take the bait.

328
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,820
You even failed to do such a trivial thing.

329
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,430
You are so useless.

330
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,950
Did you see who he is?

331
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,670
Well...

332
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,560
That man was wearing a mask.

333
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,070
I... didn't see him clearly.

334
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,120
Loser!

335
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,590
Darling.

336
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,660
Darling, what...

337
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,720
what are you doing?

338
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,670
You don't know if he is from Luoyang...

339
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,860
or went there from Yiyang either.

340
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,850
Darling.

341
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,040
Do you know how big trouble he caused?

342
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,800
Beating him won't help. The money is still gone, right?

343
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,270
Even if you beat my brother to death,

344
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,670
we still can't get the money back, right?

345
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,880
I don't want to see him.

346
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,310
Ask him to get lost.

347
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,350
Get lost!

348
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,030
Do you know if they find out about this,

349
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,710
we'll all be doomed?

350
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,990
Darling,

351
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,350
don't be angry.

352
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,630
It's not that serious.

353
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,770
You are short-sighted.

354
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,960
Darling, calm down.

355
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,430
Calm down.

356
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,870
Looks like I need to think of a way out.

357
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,990
A way out?

358
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,350
Darling,

359
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,870
I heard

360
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,320
Song Zhu, the youngest daughter of Song Xu,

361
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,350
recently was rewarded by the empress dowager.

362
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,770
The Song family is very famous now.

363
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,230
If we can build a relationship with the Song family,

364
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,910
the Song family can protect us, right?

365
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,560
How?

366
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,390
Song Yi has already rejected our marriage proposal.

367
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,550
Considering our current situation,

368
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,040
we can only make another bet.

369
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,590
If we succeed,

370
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,990
we'll have nothing to worry about, right?

371
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,230
Let me think about it.

372
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,610
Miss,

373
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,590
take this umbrella.

374
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,470
Or you might get wet

375
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,440
and catch a cold.

376
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,590
I didn't expect

377
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,820
Mr. Zhou to draw our meeting under the umbrella.

378
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,110
I don't know when I can get the painting.

379
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,910
But...

380
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,330
I think this umbrella... can be considered a token of love.

381
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,080
It's written like this in novels anyway.

382
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,380
Miss, be careful.

383
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,390
My umbrella!

384
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,270
This stupid Xiao Yu

385
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,270
is a jinx to me.

386
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,940
All of us

387
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,240
will reach our hands into this wooden box.

388
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,960
As long as the missing bracelet is found,

389
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,300
no one will be punished.

390
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,520
Catch it.

391
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,440
Be careful.

392
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,790
Be careful.

393
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,030
Father!

394
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,330
Father!

395
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,320
Father!

396
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,590
What's wrong?

397
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,380
Why do you suddenly want

398
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
to propose marriage to Song Yi for me?

399
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,080
I'm doing this for you.

400
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,910
Well, Father.

401
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,990
You know Song Yi...

402
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,960
I'm going back.

403
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,110
You...

404
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,830
Well, you...

405
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,190
You are cowardly. Who do you take after?

406
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,990
Stop talking about me.

407
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,010
Just tell me if we can succeed today.

408
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,640
We've been here many times, but we have never succeeded.

409
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,150
I'm worried we might be kicked out today.

410
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,550
We won't.

411
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,310
I'm the county magistrate.

412
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,660
Song Xu needs to show me some respect, right?

413
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,340
And what kind of person is Song Xu?

414
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,150
He would never do such a thing.

415
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,110
Don't worry.

416
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,640
I will successfully propose marriage to Song Yi for you today.

417
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,800
Okay?

418
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,470
You are right.

419
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,030
I am the most promising young master

420
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,470
in Yiyang County.

421
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,130
I really don't know

422
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,290
who else can be worthy of Song Yi.

423
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,990
Besides, my love for her is so sincere.

424
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,910
That's right.

425
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:17,800
Let's go.

426
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,510
This is my son.

427
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,180
Be careful.

428
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,330
Be careful.

429
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,740
Ling's marriage was bestowed by His Majesty.

430
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,800
Song Zhu has been engaged since she was little.

431
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,390
As for Yuniang's marriage,

432
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,060
Mr. Song and I don't think

433
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,570
we should interfere too much.

434
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,190
We want her to decide her future husband on her own.

435
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,190
So Lord Li,

436
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,250
I have to let you down again.

437
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,230
Song Zhu is engaged?

438
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,540
To whom?

439
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,030
I've never heard of it.

440
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,800
Xiao Yu, the son of Xiao Chuanzhong from the capital.

441
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,350
You mean Teaching Assistant Xiao?

442
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,790
Mr. Wu, what are you doing?

443
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,550
It's done?

444
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,560
Morning, Mr. Xiao.

445
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,630
Morning.

446
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,190
Since you came back from Luoyang,

447
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,440
the frequency of your return to the dorm has decreased.

448
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,710
Otherwise,

449
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,720
we could have seen each other earlier.

450
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,560
Mr. Zhou, did you...

451
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,790
miss me?

452
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,200
I...

453
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,090
I was just kidding.

454
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,870
Recently, I have been busy with some personal matters.

455
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,880
Mr. Xiao, if you are free,

456
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,040
can you chat with me?

457
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
Is this...

458
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,150
wine?

459
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,550
You usually don't drink, right?

460
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,000
People change.

461
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,470
Right?

462
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,440
That makes sense.

463
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,780
But it's not proper to drink in broad daylight.

464
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,580
It's hot here.

465
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,470
Mr. Zhou,

466
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,120
let's chat outside.

467
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,160
Mr. Xiao,

468
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,390
you're the first person I knew

469
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,350
when I just arrived in Yiyang.

470
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,580
Yes.

471
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,470
In that case,

472
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,840
I think you are also the first person I knew here.

473
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,080
Later, we came to Yiyang Academy.

474
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,210
And you and I are in the same dorm.

475
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,040
I'm very happy.

476
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,240
You've helped me a lot these days.

477
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,930
I'm very grateful to you.

478
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,620
After all, many things happened because of me.

479
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,310
I should take responsibility for them.

480
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:14,950
We...

481
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,070
are brothers, right?

482
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,950
Since I was little,

483
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,280
I've never opened my heart to anyone,

484
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,390
except my sister and mother.

485
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,150
How should I put it?

486
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,710
Maybe...

487
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,750
I've been used to being given a cold shoulder.

488
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,650
In Yiyang Academy,

489
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,230
I can have a chat

490
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,700
with you.

491
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,390
I'm quite satisfied.

492
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,430
So at least,

493
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:58,820
we are friends.

494
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,750
Yes.

495
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,910
Then...

496
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,910
I knew Miss Song Zhu.

497
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,420
The Song family's good reputation spreads far and wide.

498
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,670
A number of men want to marry

499
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,550
a daughter of the Song family.

500
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,030
I haven't made any achievement.

501
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,340
I shouldn't have thought too much.

502
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,210
But...

503
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,670
Mr. Xiao,

504
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,520
you should know Miss Song Zhu has feelings for me.

505
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,020
I know.

506
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,310
Then what do you think of her?

507
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,620
She is a good girl.

508
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,550
That's all?

509
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,400
She deserves a good husband.

510
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,120
I like Zhu too.

511
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,780
I know that too.

512
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,640
Since you know it...

513
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,790
But that person can't be you.

514
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,830
Why not?

515
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,430
Zhu has a straightforward and bold personality.

516
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,260
Maybe she will suffer some losses someday.

517
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,640
I can protect her.

518
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,550
You can't.

519
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,110
What if I can?

520
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,240
Alright.

521
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,680
Don't just sit here.

522
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,700
Let's go.

523
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,350
What you want to do is your choice.

524
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,780
It's none of my business.

525
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,390
And I have no right to interfere.

526
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,560
Yueniang.

527
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,130
Don't go back later.

528
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,110
Go to the dorm and chat with me, okay?

529
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,820
I don't plan to go back.

530
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,230
I want to see Mr. Zhou.

531
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,650
Why do you want to see him?

532
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,860
Since we left Yiyang last time,

533
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,790
I've felt he has a lot on his mind.

534
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,350
I planned

535
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,120
to ask him if he needs any help

536
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,790
after I finish the things in the academy.

537
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,130
But there were so many things.

538
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,440
So I haven't had a chance to ask him yet.

539
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,670
It's okay.

540
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,030
If he needs help,

541
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,310
I can go with you.

542
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,460
Yueniang.

543
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,720
Do you think I should stop thinking about Xiao Yu?

544
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,820
You liked him,

545
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,790
and you've invested your time and feelings.

546
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,160
It's normal that you still think about him.

547
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,520
But...

548
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,790
I know you're comforting me.

549
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,470
You said he doesn't deserve me.

550
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,320
But I always think

551
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,340
if I'm really that good,

552
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,230
why doesn't he like me?

553
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,130
Maybe... you used the wrong way?

554
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,050
Or maybe... he was in a bad mood that day.

555
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,310
But I think

556
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,660
every cloud has a silver lining.

557
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,290
Maybe he will pursue you in a few days.

558
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,270
How is that possible?

559
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,880
He hasn't come to the academy for a few days.

560
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,510
He must be avoiding me.

561
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,640
Don't think like that.

562
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,130
Maybe he really is busy.

563
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,970
I think we may see him later.

564
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,870
How is that possible?

565
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,990
Everything is possible.

566
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,820
Speak of the devil.

567
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,610
Qinruo.

568
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,600
Junior Zhou.

569
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,219
Zhu, Senior Yan.

570
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,090
Are you... going back to the dorm?

571
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,370
Yes. Are you going back to the dorm too?

572
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:23,790
Let's go together.

573
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,989
Okay.

574
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,510
I happen to have something to tell you.

575
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,340
Me too.

576
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,620
Last time in Duke Yue's Mansion,

577
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,190
you helped Feiniang.

578
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,489
I haven't had a chance to thank you.

579
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,400
I don't know... if it's too late to thank you now.

580
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,030
Let's go.

581
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,429
It's okay.

582
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,480
It's okay.

583
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,830
Seize this chance to make it clear.

584
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,150
It's okay.

585
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,040
A bad penny always turns up.

586
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,430
I think the four of you are bad pennies.

587
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,550
What do you mean?

588
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,830
Don't try to drive a wedge among us.

589
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,150
Lady Yan

590
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,700
is Miss Song Zhu's best friend.

591
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,030
You don't hide anything from each other.

592
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,230
Zhou Ji

593
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,550
is the top student in the academy.

594
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,850
He knows everything.

595
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,710
He's very close to Xiao Yu.

596
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,270
What exactly are you trying to say?

597
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,260
You're anxious.

598
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,620
Do you two know that your close friends

599
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,440
are hiding something from you?

600
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,680
You don't know?

601
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,620
I'm a know-all

602
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,700
in Yiyang.

603
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:23,990
You don't know?

604
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,510
You don't know?

605
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,310
Song Zhu has been engaged

606
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,090
to Xiao Yu, the son of Xiao Chuanzhong, long ago.

607
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,730
Are you

608
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,360
surprised?

609
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,390
This...

610
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,190
Liar.

611
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,630
Liar.

612
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,500
Yueniang,

613
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,870
is what he said... true?

614
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,270
Yueniang.

615
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,800
Is what he said... true?

616
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,950
I...

617
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,590
Say something.

618
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,750
Is what he said true?

619
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,390
I...

620
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,070
I...

621
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,600
Say something.

622
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,270
Song Zhu.

623
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,330
Song Zhu, you are a liar!

624
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,290
Liar!

625
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,270
Qinruo.

626
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,440
I...

627
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,730
I...

628
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:55,550
I...

629
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,520
I'll explain to you later.

630
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:40,930
So...

631
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,700
this is why

632
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,980
that person can't be me.
