I just don't hope that

She misses you in your distant hometown when you're in the capital.

When you think about being responsible for others,

73

00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,100
Your Highness, please.

191
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,510
Prince Fu's son wants to see you.

192
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,250
Come on. Bring it in.

193
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,770
You may leave.

194
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,410
Yes.

195
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,290
Your Highness.

196
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,540
Mr. Song.

197
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,250
Please sit down.

198
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,020
Sit down.

199
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,790
Mr. Song, you've been in prison for several days,

200
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,250
and you've suffered a lot.

201
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,670
I've been inquiring about your case.

202
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,430
I will do my best to help you.

203
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,390
Thank you, Your Highness.

204
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,620
But I do need your help

205
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,700
for something.

206
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,540
Please say it.

207
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,570
If I can do it,

208
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,730
I will do my best.

209
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,880
Please say it.

210
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860
Yueniang is in Wan Li's mansion now.

211
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,050
I'm worried that...

212
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,910
It's all right.

213
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,910
I've brought her back to Prince Fu's Mansion.

214
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,670
Don't worry.

215
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,070
That's good.

216
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,640
Thank you.

217
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,350
Mr. Song,

218
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,130
I promised you before.

219
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,550
How is Yueniang?

220
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,300
She's fine.

221
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,110
Okay.

222
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,910
Mr. Song.

223
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,360
About that matter,

224
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,650
it has been widely spread in the capital.

225
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,270
The ministers in the imperial court are also taking a wait-and-see attitude.

226
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,070
I guess

227
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,560
the arrow is already on the string.

228
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,450
I'm just worried about Yueniang.

229
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,730
I don't want her to get involved too much.

230
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,580
I understand.

231
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,240
Your wife,

232
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,210
your eldest daughter, and your second eldest daughter

233
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,340
are all fine at home.

234
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

235
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,550
Mr. Song,

236
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,440
actually, I have a question

237
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,250
which I've kept thinking about.

238
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,190
I wonder since when

239
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,650
you've suspected that I'm not Xiao Yu.

240
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,910
Do you remember

241
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,790
Uncle Wang, whom I once mentioned to you?

242
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,880
You started to suspect it such a long time ago?

243
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,590
Mother.

244
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,270
We're back.

245
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,340
I finally brought you back

246
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,890
in an aboveboard way from the front gate of the Zhou Family.

247
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,020
I was wondering who broke the rules

248
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,010
and dared to intrude into the ancestral hall of the Zhou Family without permission.

249
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,780
[Zhou Shenyuan's Wife, Ms. Li]

250
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,250
Zhou Ting.

251
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,750
Things are different now.

252
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,869
I'm no longer

253
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,089
that illegitimate child whom you can bully arbitrarily.

254
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,569
Zhou Ji!

255
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:23,869
Mother.

256
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,280
Mother.

257
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,910
Zhou Ji.

258
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,390
I'm the legitimate wife of your father in this family.

259
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,510
It's fine if you don't call me mother.

260
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,030
How dare you set a memorial tablet here

261
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,140
with the title of Wife for your mother who is a concubine?

262
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,340
Do you want her to be unable to rest in peace after she died?

263
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,530
I don't think

264
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,790
you know this yet.

265
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,570
The entire Zhou Family

266
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,950
is about to have a different master.

267
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,760
Mother, he...

268
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,240
Let him speak.

269
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,820
Not only do I want my mother to enter the ancestral hall,

270
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,070
but I'll also kick both of you out of Luoyang.

271
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,780
Guards!

272
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,180
Kick them out!

273
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,770
How arrogant!

274
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,230
I wonder why my good brother

275
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,390
was so bold

276
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,930
and said such outrageous words

277
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,080
to me, who is your elder brother.

278
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,900
I think he's crazy.

279
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:33,880
Son,

280
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,080
today is a good day for you to take office.

281
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,200
Don't waste your time because of him.

282
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,820
What are you waiting for?

283
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,450
Didn't you hear what I said?

284
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,450
What can I do for you, My Lord?

285
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,830
Help me throw him to the street

286
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,670
that is in front of the gate of the Zhou Family.

287
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,270
Catch him!

288
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,480
Go.

289
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,760
Go.

290
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,030
Ting, look at him.

291
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,480
What a loser!

292
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,200
I'm the incoming Direct Scholar of the Bureau of Military Affairs.

293
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,400
What do you want to do?

294
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,320
Do you know that

295
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,110
I'll take up the post of Direct Scholar in the Bureau of Military Affairs today?

296
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,010
That's impossible.

297
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,930
That's impossible.

298
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,740
Lord Wan promised to give this post to me.

299
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,270
He promised to give it to me.

300
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,170
Do you have the official document?

301
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,880
Do you have it?

302
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,780
Thanks, buddies.

303
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,040
Take good care of my brother.

304
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,440
Here you are.

305
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,830
Take it and have a drink.

306
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,240
Okay.

307
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,560
He even wants to be an official?

308
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,790
A lowly person like him even wants to be a high-status man.

309
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,320
-How pitiful. -What a pitiful guy.

310
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,950
Alright.

311
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,670
Sit down.

312
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,450
If you're not used to them serving you,

313
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,340
I'll serve you.

314
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,400
Be careful. It's hot.

315
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,560
I went to see your father.

316
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,970
He wants you to return to Yiyang.

317
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,260
But I know that you won't leave.

318
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,930
Just do what you want to do.

319
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,840
I will help you.

320
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,820
We'll take action at nine tonight.

321
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,190
Alright. Don't drink too much wine.

322
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,010
Brother.

323
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,790
Brother, stop drinking.

324
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,020
-Brother, give it to me.
-Don't stop me.

325
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,040
Feiniang, are you okay?

326
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,980
-Feiniang.
-I'm fine.

327
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,520
Zhou Ji, what are you doing?

328
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,190
Zhou Ji.

329
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,640
Brother.

330
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,300
Yes.

331
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,680
I'm just an illegitimate son.

332
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,430
Alright.

333
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,800
Don't be like this. Okay?

334
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,720
Don't stop me.

335
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,800
No! No, no, no.

336
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,760
No, no, no.

337
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,500
Lord Wan,

338
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,850
you are right.

339
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,480
You're very discerning.

340
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,410
You've made me realize

341
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,430
what kind of person I am.

342
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,490
Alright.

343
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,070
Alright, Zhou Ji. Alright.

344
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,310
Don't... Don't be like this, Zhou Ji.

345
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,750
Brother.

346
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,790
I'd like to drink a toast to you.

347
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,550
Brother.

348
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,060
-Stop drinking. -Brother, stop drinking.

349
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,280
Stop drinking.

350
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,280
Stop drinking.

351
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,350
Go away!

352
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,750
Feiniang.

353
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,110
-Don't be like this.
-Brother, stop drinking.

354
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,880
Stop drinking, Brother.

355
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,440
Yueniang.

356
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,470
Miss Song Zhu.

357
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,890
Miss Song Zhu, please help my brother.

358
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,580
Since he came back from home,

359
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,030
he has been like this.

360
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,990
Please persuade my brother.

361
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,880
There's no time to talk about these things.

362
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,340
Let's go at once. Hurry up.

363
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,150
Qinruo, let's go.

364
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,730
Senior Song, Xiao.

365
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,500
Brother.

366
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:20,690
Brother.

367
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,150
We're here to save you.

368
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,290
It's not safe to be in the Wan Mansion.

369
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,600
You have to leave here with us at once.

370
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,660
Where are we going?

371
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,860
Wan Li actually wants to confine you in his house with the excuse of looking after you.

372
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,070
I'll explain it to you in detail later.

373
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,000
Take Zhou Ji to leave with us first.

374
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,070
No.

375
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,550
If I go with you,

376
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,800
you will be implicated.

377
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,660
Why are you still talking about implicating us now?

378
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,150
My real identity is Prince Fu's son.

379
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,220
My name is Chen Yan.

380
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,740
Don't worry. You won't implicate me.

381
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,840
Let's go at once.

382
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,880
Let's go. Hurry up.

383
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,590
Okay.

384
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,670
Hurry up.

385
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,310
Coming.

386
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,950
Let's leave here together.

387
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,570
-Brother, let's leave here together. -Let's go.

388
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,250
Hurry up!

389
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,070
Brother.

390
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,280
Leave me alone!

391
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,760
Let me die here!

392
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,090
If you don't go, I won't go, either.

393
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,170
Yan Qinruo.

394
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,960
You go first.

395
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,320
I'll help Zhou Ji up.

396
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,370
What are you doing?

397
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:08,880
Brother.

398
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,620
Let's go. Stand up.

399
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,730
Go. Let's go.

400
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,520
Hurry up.

401
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,350
On what ground can you interfere in my business?

402
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,460
Do you think I want to care about you while you're being like this?

403
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:14,920
It's none of your business.

404
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,520
Qinruo!

405
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,790
Don't drag me!

406
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,540
Let's go.

407
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,180
Let's go. Go.

408
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,600
Hurry up.

409
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,960
Your Highness.

410
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,270
My Lord, why didn't you stop them?

411
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,780
The viscount must have been well-prepared if he dared to

412
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,050
take some martial artists to intrude into my mansion at night.

413
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,500
Why should I spoil his mood?

414
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,230
The Supreme Court's case

415
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,750
will be handled tomorrow, right?

416
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,430
Yes.

417
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,680
[Huichun Garden]

418
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,550
Let me out!

419
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,040
Hurry up!

420
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,870
On what ground can you lock me up here?

421
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,150
In that case,

422
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,600
the post offered by Wan Li

423
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,880
was actually given to Zhou Ting in the end.

424
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,610
Zhou Ji didn’t know about that.

425
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,930
He was like this when he came back.

426
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,770
I should have noticed it.

427
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,180
I believed Wan Li too easily.

428
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,710
Qinruo.

429
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,390
It has already happened.

430
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,850
Don't blame yourself.

431
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,940
If you don't let me out,

432
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,920
I'll destroy this place.

433
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,120
Will it be okay if my brother is locked up like this?

434
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,750
With his current state like that,

435
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,950
it is not up to him whether it's okay or not.

436
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,600
You don't want anything wrong to happen to him, do you?

437
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,710
This is my house.

438
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,500
As long as you stay here,

439
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,830
you won't be in danger.

440
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,630
Stay here during these days first.

441
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,310
If you need anything,

442
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,480
just tell me.

443
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:43,980
Right.

444
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,530
Song Zhu,

445
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,670
let's go.

446
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,770
I want to spend more time with Qinruo.

447
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,370
Let me out!

448
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,910
Go back with me first.

449
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,460
You two should go back now.

450
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,220
You've been rushing around all day.

451
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,750
Have a good rest for a while.

452
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,970
I have Feiniang to accompany me.

453
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,450
Okay.

454
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,750
I'll come to see you early in the morning tomorrow.

455
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,820
Your Highness.

456
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,790
I want to... I want to buy something.

457
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,060
Go ahead.

458
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,210
Tomorrow will be the 35th day after my mother's death.

459
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,680
I want to burn some joss paper for my mother.

460
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,050
Okay.

461
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,530
Come with me.

462
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,240
Let me ask you.

463
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,080
Are there any other students in our academy whose families suffered misfortunes?

464
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,290
I don't think so.

465
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,470
What's wrong?

466
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,630
When the teacher asked me to leave that day,

467
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,790
I remember that someone was burning joss paper beside us.

468
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,870
What do you mean?

469
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,620
The person who burned joss paper

470
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,910
probably knows where the account book is.

471
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,110
If I'm not wrong,

472
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:19,980
that day

473
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,210
was the 21st day after the death of Zhou's mother.

474
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,740
Calm down first.

475
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,120
Now there are two people who know about this thing.

476
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,720
They're Zhou Fei and Zhou Ji.

477
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,960
If she wasn't that person...

478
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,750
I'll ask Zhou Ji myself.

479
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,020
I want to ask him myself.

480
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,150
You have to send Yan Qinruo away with an excuse.

481
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:40,920
Why?

482
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,000
From what I know about Zhou Ji,

483
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,320
he won't tell the truth in front of Yan Qinruo.

484
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,180
He won't even tell the truth in front of you, either.

485
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,280
Trust me.

486
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,700
Feiniang, let me ask you.

487
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,370
Where were you when Li Wenshu rang the bell?

488
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,620
She was with me at that time.

489
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,910
What's wrong?

490
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,930
If you don't let me out now,

491
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,390
I'll die inside.

492
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,730
It looks like we need to talk to him.

493
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,180
Don't worry.

494
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,330
I'll go.

495
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,920
Qinruo! Qinruo!

496
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,380
Sit down.

497
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,110
We have to trust him.

498
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,120
You want to make a scene?

499
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,120
Fine.

500
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,050
I'll do it with you.

501
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,900
If you want to have a drink,

502
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,690
it's okay, too.

503
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,440
I'll have a drink with you.

504
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,320
Come on.

505
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,560
I didn't expect that

506
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,970
we would meet again with this kind of relationship.

507
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,640
Viscount.

508
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,590
It's surprising that you are Prince Fu's son.

509
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,790
I also didn't expect that you would be like this.

510
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,720
I would be like this?

511
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,350
Your Highness.

512
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,770
You have a high status.

513
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,640
Many things

514
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,530
are surely not important to you.

515
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,060
But you don't have to ruin yourself like that.

516
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,110
If you do this,

517
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,880
how will your sister and Miss Yan feel about it?

518
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,700
Don't be such a hypocrite.

519
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,980
I don't need your sympathy, either.

520
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,190
You know what?

521
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,920
We've never

522
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,210
been from the same world all the time.

523
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,550
But at least, we were friends before.

524
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:58,960
Friends?

525
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,030
Not really.

526
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,490
I'm not good enough to be your friend.

527
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,380
Since we're not friends,

528
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,750
I'll cut to the chase.

529
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,890
Please go ahead, Your Highness.

530
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,810
Did you see the account book

531
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,520
on the day when Mr. Chen died?

532
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,130
You've beaten around the bush for a long time.

533
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,070
Your purpose is to interrogate me?

534
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,370
Answer my question.

535
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,260
No.

536
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,180
So many things have happened recently.

537
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,980
Though I can't believe it,

538
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,540
I also know that

539
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,300
my father won't be released from prison.

540
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:49,810
Qinruo.

541
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,720
Don't be discouraged now.

542
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,030
There's always some hope for everything.

543
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,610
Right?

544
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,730
But it's different for my family.

545
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,400
Moreover, I never thought that

546
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,560
after I had implicated you again and again,

547
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,510
you would still rish your life to save me.

548
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,310
Qinruo.

549
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,420
There's no need to say these things between us.

550
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,460
Besides, I went to see Zhao Yuanzhen.

551
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,460
I always feel that

552
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,480
someone has obviously set me up.

553
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,290
But Zhou Ji...

554
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,390
I don’t know what to do, either.

555
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,070
You've already got into trouble.

556
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,140
Every correct step you take is helpful for saving yourself.

557
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,140
You don't have to talk about these principles with me.

558
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,710
Speaking of principles,

559
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,250
I know more than you.

560
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,670
Did you get the account book?

561
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,320
I said no, and I told the truth.

562
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,910
Even if you don't want to save yourself,

563
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,810
you should think about others.

564
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,790
Look at me now.

565
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,300
Do I have to lie to you?

566
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,090
Just think about what's the right thing to do.

567
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,389
You are from a noble family,

568
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,420
while I'm just a commoner.

569
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,150
Just pretend that

570
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,050
I've never existed.

571
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,070
Let's go.

572
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,420
I have to go.

573
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,290
Just go.

574
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,790
He said no.

575
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,870
It's fine.

576
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,910
Let's think of another way.

577
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:27,950
Let's go.

578
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,610
Mother.

579
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,780
Yan, come inside the room with me.

580
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,460
Yan.

581
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,410
Your father heard that

582
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,470
people of the Bureau of Military Affairs

583
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,080
were worried that Song Xu's case would have a big influence,

584
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,480
so they advanced the time of beheading him.

585
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,020
Don't interfere in this matter anymore.

586
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,530
When will they behead him?

587
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,380
Tomorrow.

588
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,270
No!

589
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,870
No! Wait!

590
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,170
No!

591
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:50,860
Zhou Ji!

592
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,420
Zhou Ji, open the door!

593
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,340
Who is it?

594
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,110
Open the door. I'm Song Zhu.

595
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:56,950
What's the matter?

596
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,630
Yueniang.

597
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,320
Do you know where the account book is?

598
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,460
If you know where it is,

599
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,450
please give it to me.

600
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,180
I beg you.

601
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Yueniang, what's wrong?

602
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,060
I don't have it.

603
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,940
Just go away.

604
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,740
Zhou Ji, I beg you!

605
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,390
Open the door!

606
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,360
I just want the account book!

607
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,270
Zhou Ji, open the door!

608
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,620
Yueniang, what happened?

609
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,300
-I beg you!
-Calm down.

610
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,830
Zhou Ji, what's going on with the account book mentioned by Yueniang?

611
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,130
There's no account book.

612
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,030
I don't have the account book.

613
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,350
I beg you, Zhou Ji!

614
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,180
I've said that I don't have it.

615
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,630
-Open the door first. What’s going on? -Zhou Ji!

616
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,390
I don't have it!

617
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,230
I beg you!

618
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,760
-I've said that I don't have it. -Yueniang.

619
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,720
Yueniang, calm down first.

620
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,330
I beg you.

621
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,120
Yueniang, be careful.

622
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,580
-Please open the door! -Stand up.

623
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,270
-Zhou Ji, open the door!
-I've said that I don't have it.

624
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,630
I really don't have it.

625
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,640
Zhou Ji, open the door!

626
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,830
Zhou Ji.

627
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,200
-I beg you. -Yueniang.

628
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,060
Yueniang.

629
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,310
Let's go back.

630
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,220
Yueniang.

631
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:52,820
Zhou Ji.

632
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,770
Zhou Ji, open the door.

633
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,220
Zhou Ji!

634
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,560
I've said that I don't have the account book.
