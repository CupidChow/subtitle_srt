[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,680
[Episode 24]

4
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,630
Look.

5
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,720
It's so impressive.

6
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,470
Let's go and have a look.

7
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,080
You're right.

8
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,390
Lady Yan's family is so rich. It's so impressive.

9
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,789
Yes.

10
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,030
Look.

11
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,920
No wonder Lady Yan

12
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,440
is always well-dressed.

13
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,440
Yes.

14
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,130
She is Duke Yue's daughter.

15
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,590
Look. It's so impressive.

16
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,270
Yes.

17
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,440
Look.

18
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,190
Qinruo, Qinruo.

19
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,180
Yueniang.

20
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,190
Mr. Zhou.

21
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,320
Wait.

22
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,370
Yueniang.

23
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,040
Your outfit...

24
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,030
What's wrong?

25
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,110
My mother prepared it for me.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Isn't it pretty?

27
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,520
It's pretty.

28
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,790
But it's too plain.

29
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,360
It's not like your usual outfit.

30
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,790
By the way, Yueniang.

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,350
Why hasn't Mr. Xiao come?

32
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,820
He is always late.

33
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,140
Yueniang, get in the carriage.

34
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:42,730
Okay.

35
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,200
It's so strange.

36
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,190
How can you say I'm always late?

37
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,480
Who is this gentleman?

38
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,070
I am...

39
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,620
What are you doing?

40
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,320
How can you be so rude?

41
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,530
Come here.

42
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,390
My Lady.

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,800
Go and invite Mr. Xiao to take my carriage.

44
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
-Okay.
-Go. Go.

45
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,970
I look more mature and reliable with the beard.

46
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,400
After all, I'm a teaching assistant.

47
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,320
You're just pretending to be mature.

48
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,510
How can you say that?

49
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,610
Your beard is false.

50
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,829
Sir.

51
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,360
My lady invited you to take her carriage.

52
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,260
This is your chance.

53
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,170
What chance?

54
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,260
It's not appropriate.

55
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,670
Tell her

56
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,160
I'll take the carriage behind hers.

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,950
Okay.

58
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,950
Why didn't you agree to take her carriage?

59
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,750
-Go.
-Stop.

60
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,070
You're talking nonsense.

61
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,150
I have to invite him myself.

62
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,350
I shouldn't stay with her all the time.

63
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,190
What are you talking about? Go.

64
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,410
Mr. Xiao.

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,900
You look

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,560
really special today.

67
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,990
Look, there are many servants.

68
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,980
Look.

69
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,630
Brother.

70
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,149
They're all from the Yan family. It's so impressive.

71
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,149
Lady Yan.

72
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,810
Everyone is here.

73
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,839
It would be improper if we take the same carriage.

74
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,950
It's because

75
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,610
we're both single.

76
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,910
That's not a big deal.

77
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,320
I'll give them money and ask them not to talk about us.

78
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,340
We should follow the social etiquette.

79
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,960
You are the host and I am a guest.

80
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,760
Our identities are different.

81
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,030
You're a student and I'm the teaching assistant.

82
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,740
We're also good friends.

83
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,520
It's your birthday today.

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,870
We are honored to have been invited.

85
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,490
That's Teaching Assistant Xiao.

86
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,320
How about...

87
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,130
Lady Yan.

88
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,110
Lady Yan.

89
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,970
Please get in your carriage.

90
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,890
Don't keep everyone waiting for too long.

91
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,870
Fine.

92
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,159
Yueniang,

93
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,870
how about we take the same carriage?

94
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,500
Oh, okay.

95
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,880
I'll be in the carriage alone.

96
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,710
I'll be in the carriage alone.

97
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,550
Junior Zhou.

98
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,510
Senior Song.

99
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,430
Are you taking this carriage?

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,990
Mr. Xiao.

101
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,730
Can we take the same carriage?

102
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,010
Sure.

103
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,330
Lady Zhu, Lady Zhu.

104
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,990
Everyone is here.

105
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,120
If you and Mr. Zhou take the same carriage,

106
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,620
others will gossip about you.

107
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,630
You're both single. You'd better not take the same carriage.

108
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,120
I don't care what others

109
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,110
say about me.

110
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,440
Let’s go, Mr. Zhou.

111
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:47,870
Well…

112
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,350
Mr. Xiao.

113
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,350
You should follow the social etiquette.

114
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,230
You are a girl and he is a boy.

115
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,630
Your identities are different.

116
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,770
You're his senior and he's your junior.

117
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,710
And Lady Zhu and I are close friends.

118
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,520
Very close.

119
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,360
So she and I should take the same carriage.

120
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,310
Let's go, let's go.

121
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,080
Brother, I'll take another carriage.

122
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,510
Okay.

123
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,020
Can I take Miss Yan's carriage?

124
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,310
That'll be improper.

125
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,420
Fine.

126
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,890
Miss Fei.

127
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,900
How about you take our carriage?

128
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,800
Okay.

129
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,430
Okay.

130
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,340
Go.

131
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,640
Let's go.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,590
Go away.

133
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:22,990
I...

134
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,670
Get off!

135
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,200
No.

136
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,790
-You get off!
-I...

137
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,710
-Get off. 
-I'll sit here.

138
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,470
Get off!

139
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,640
You get off!

140
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,310
No. No.

141
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:28,870
I won't get off.

142
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,030
Mr. Zhou and I should take the carriage.

143
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,350
-Stop.
-Get off!

144
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,200
Get off, get off!

145
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,690
You...

146
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,870
Teaching Assistant Xiao has got sore eyes.

147
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:09,820
Zhou...

148
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,740
Zhou...

149
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,870
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

150
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,710
How about we switch seats?

151
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,390
No.

152
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,560
I'm tired.

153
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,270
I need to take a nap.

154
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,350
Wake me up when we arrive in Luoyang.

155
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,350
I also feel a little tired all of a sudden.

156
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,890
Teaching Assistant Xiao, see you in Luoyang.

157
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,220
Junior Zhou, see you in Luoyang.

158
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,120
This is the first time that my sister

159
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,030
has invited her classmates to come.

160
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,539
You must serve them well.

161
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,400
Remember?

162
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,990
Yes, Young Master.

163
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,640
Junior Zhou, have we arrived?

164
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,350
Yes.

165
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,140
We're at the gate of Duke Yue's Mansion.

166
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,020
Let's get off now.

167
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,300
I cannot feel my legs.

168
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,170
Okay.

169
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,870
You're so clumsy.

170
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,840
You're so mean.

171
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,900
Senior, please.

172
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,750
Brother.

173
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,460
Sister.

174
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,580
Are you feeling tired?

175
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,590
I'm fine.

176
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,210
You shouldn't be waiting for me here.

177
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,180
It's so improper.

178
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,410
In our family,

179
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,900
everything that is good for you is proper.

180
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,910
Father always spoils you.

181
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:40,850
Everyone,

182
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,420
this is my brother, Yan Anbang.

183
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,200
They are

184
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,240
my friends in the academy.

185
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,470
I'll introduce each of them

186
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,110
to you and our father later.

187
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,420
Okay.

188
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,510
Where is Father?

189
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,260
He's waiting for you in the main hall.

190
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,570
Hi, Qinruo's classmates.

191
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,690
Please come in.

192
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,260
Let's go inside.

193
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,730
Let's go in.

194
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,210
Yueniang.

195
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:09,910
Please.

196
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,250
We'll see my father soon.

197
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,560
I'm finally home.

198
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,650
Brother, this place is so beautiful.

199
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,150
Mr. Xiao.

200
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,000
Follow me.

201
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,820
I'll introduce you to my father later.

202
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,480
I will work hard

203
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,460
so that you'll have a comfortable life in the future.

204
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,910
This way.

205
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:31,970
Father.

206
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,330
The guests have come.

207
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,410
Father.

208
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,990
Qinruo.

209
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,420
My dear daughter, I'm so glad you're back.

210
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,950
I missed you so much.

211
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,060
I knew you would miss me.

212
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,110
Are they your classmates?

213
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,830
Good.

214
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,750
There're so many talents in Song's Academy.

215
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,440
Your classmates

216
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,980
will have a promising future.

217
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,060
Father.

218
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,410
I want to introduce an excellent man to you.

219
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,650
Okay.

220
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,850
Who?

221
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,360
My dear daughter.

222
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,290
Who is this gentleman?

223
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,170
-I’m Zhou Ji.
-What are they doing?

224
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,100
Greetings, Duke Yue.

225
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,850
Zhou Ji.

226
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,630
You're Zhou Ji, the most talented man

227
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,230
in Luoyang.

228
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,630
Nice to meet you.

229
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,550
I'm flattered.

230
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,230
Mr. Zhou, you're famous.

231
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,520
I once saw your portrait.

232
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,390
My sister told me

233
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,270
you were studying in Song's Academy.

234
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,460
Good to see you today.

235
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,880
You're really talented and handsome.

236
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,240
Father.

237
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,150
Mr. Zhou is exceptionally good at drawing.

238
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,430
Well...

239
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,550
His works

240
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,390
He must have misunderstood.

241
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,630
are liked by ladies.

242
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,590
By the way,

243
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,100
Zhou Ting at the Imperial College is his elder brother.

244
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,390
So you're Zhou Ting's younger brother.

245
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,010
Good.

246
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,100
Father.

247
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,370
Actually, I'd like to

248
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,520
introduce another person to you.

249
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,040
Yes.

250
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,010
Who?

251
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,950
Yueniang.

252
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,590
Where is Mr. Xiao?

253
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,940
Father, he's not here.

254
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,240
I'll find him and bring him here.

255
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,710
Qinruo.

256
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,360
Come here.

257
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,590
Today is the monthly Donation Day.

258
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,680
I have some charity work to do.

259
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,630
Your birthday party

260
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,120
is going to start in a few minutes.

261
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,940
You and your classmates have some fun here.

262
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,230
You can introduce

263
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,280
your classmates to me

264
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,200
at your birthday party.

265
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,900
Father.

266
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,300
Don't be late for my birthday party.

267
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,410
I won't.

268
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,310
It's my dear daughter's birthday party.

269
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,210
I can't be late.

270
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,470
Okay, you have fun here.

271
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,600
Where is Xiao Yu?

272
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,800
Make yourselves at home.

273
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,090
Where is he?

274
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,000
Xiao Yu's so annoying.

275
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,150
Please give this to Duke Yue.

276
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,230
Okay, thank you.

277
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,500
Come on, carry these in.

278
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,460
Okay.

279
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,730
Hello.

280
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,100
Okay, thank you.

281
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,620
Okay.

282
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,680
Hurry up. Don't just stand there.

283
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,760
Carry these in.

284
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,910
Okay.

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,510
Okay.

286
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,280
Please accept them. Thank you.

287
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,190
Okay.

288
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,230
Thank you.

289
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,220
The sun is so bright.

290
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,850
It's too hot over there.

291
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,880
Let's go there and have look.

292
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,420
Let's go.

293
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,570
What's wrong? You look unhappy.

294
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,280
Brother.

295
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,870
I feel so bad.

296
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,860
Why?

297
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,470
Miss Yan told us not to give her any gifts.

298
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,810
I thought no one would give her gifts.

299
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,190
To my surprise,

300
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,680
everyone else has prepared gifts for her.

301
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,320
Miss Yan is so nice to us.

302
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,830
But I didn't

303
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,430
bring a gift for her birthday.

304
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,740
You know she's from a noble family.

305
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,310
We don't have

306
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,810
any valuable things to give her.

307
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,610
Brother.

308
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,940
How about you draw a portrait of Miss Yan and give it to her?

309
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,940
You have a good time. I'll have fun with them.

310
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,760
Go.

311
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,660
Lady Zhao.

312
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,960
You've been looking there for a long time.

313
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,670
What's there to see?

314
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,900
Where is Mr. Xiao? What's he doing?

315
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,360
What are you looking at?

316
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,070
Nothing.

317
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,240
It's strange.

318
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,580
Why does every path look the same?

319
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,860
This place looks familiar.

320
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,000
It should be this way.

321
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,920
Who are you?

322
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,270
I'm...

323
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,150
I'm the teaching assistant from Song's Academy.

324
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,500
You're Mr. Teaching Assistant.

325
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,620
The party is about to begin.

326
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,690
Come with me.

327
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,490
No need.

328
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,630
What's wrong?

329
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,350
I've got a stomachache.

330
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,600
Where is the restroom?

331
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,880
That way.

332
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,530
Thank you.

333
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,080
Mr. Teaching Assistant.

334
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,900
You look familiar.

335
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,590
We...

336
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,530
We must have met in the main hall just now.

337
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,750
Really?

338
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,230
Yes.

339
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:31,820
Master.

340
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,350
Let's go.

341
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,850
Mr. Teaching Assistant.

342
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,680
I have something important to do.

343
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,580
Sorry that I can't keep you company.

344
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,210
-I’m sorry.
-It’s okay.

345
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,530
Just do what you have to do.

346
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,530
Okay, let's go.

347
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,020
Where should I go?

348
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,550
This way.

349
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,450
[Duke Yue's Mansion]

350
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,970
Skip the formalities.

351
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,930
Thank you, Your Grace.

352
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,110
Your Grace, please.

353
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,370
I realized that flowers should be in full bloom now.

354
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,860
I missed those flowers so I came.

355
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,360
You may rest assured.

356
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,340
Those flowers are beautiful and in full bloom.

357
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,990
If you want to see them,

358
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,610
I can send them to you.

359
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,660
You don't have to come in person.

360
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,910
I'm old now. I need to take a walk more often.

361
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,400
I also want to take a trip in Luoyang.

362
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,650
Please follow me to the team room and have some tea first.

363
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,190
Let's take a break

364
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
and then go see the flowers.

365
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,500
I took the carriage to come here.

366
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,950
I'm tired of sitting.

367
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
I just want to take a walk.

368
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,240
Let's go to the garden now.

369
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,660
Okay.

370
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,609
Make some arrangements.

371
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,589
Let Anbang go with you.

372
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,290
Okay.

373
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,910
Go get ready.

374
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,210
Qinruo.

375
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,280
I have nothing valuable for you.

376
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,420
So I made a traditional knot for you.

377
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,180
You'll like its design.

378
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,210
Hope you'll like my gift.

379
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,370
Where did you learn to do it?

380
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,830
My second sister told me how to make it.

381
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,760
I gave a sachet to you before.

382
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,700
So I thought

383
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,060
it would be not special

384
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,280
if I gave you a piece of embroidery this time.

385
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,350
So I asked my second sister to teach me how to make it.

386
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,510
But I wasn't very good at it.

387
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,430
I hope you'll like it.

388
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,340
I remember you don't like doing these little things.

389
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,590
So,

390
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,800
now you know how much I love you.

391
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,160
It's a little ugly.

392
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,140
But it's a token of our friendship.

393
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,000
I like it. I'll wear it.

394
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,080
Let me wear it now.

395
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,650
Okay.

396
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,970
Let me help you.

397
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,720
Zhu.

398
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,350
Lady Zhao.

399
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,560
Why are you here?

400
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,250
Where are they?

401
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,280
My Lady.

402
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,400
Prime Minister Wang's dearest granddaughter has come to your birthday party.

403
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,830
I'll welcome her in person later.

404
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,320
Okay.

405
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,850
Yueniang.

406
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,000
The birthday party is going to begin.

407
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,640
Can you and Lady Zhao

408
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,380
find Mr. Xiao for me, okay?

409
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,670
Okay, you can go now.

410
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,430
Don't worry.

411
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,270
Bye.

412
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,400
Lady Zhao.

413
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,730
Let's find Teaching Assistant Xiao

414
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,890
for Qinruo.

415
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,580
Okay.

416
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,410
Zhu.

417
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,600
Didn't your family prepare a good piece of jewelry for you?

418
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,130
My father is frugal.

419
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,330
And I think my outfit is good enough.

420
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,550
Lady Zhao.

421
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,740
Do you also think my outfit is too plain?

422
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,210
Zhu.

423
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,200
Take this.

424
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,650
With this piece of jewelry,

425
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,090
your outfit won't be too plain.

426
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,480
You look much better now.

427
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,850
Thank you, Lady Zhao.

428
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,440
Let's go then.

429
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,090
The east garden has been in rain and wind for three days.

430
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,690
The peach blossoms and plums are scattered and swept away.

431
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,930
Only camellias have survived.

432
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,160
In the green bushes hide some new red flowers.

433
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,690
When the flowers were planted at my place,

434
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,730
they were withered.

435
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,970
I didn't expect

436
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,090
they could be in full bloom here.

437
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,290
Duke Yue, thank you for taking good care of them.

438
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,690
These flowers can bloom

439
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,370
because you brought them good luck.

440
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,570
Your Grace, help yourself.

441
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,690
I just wanted to visit the garden.

442
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:36,930
To my surprise,

443
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,640
these camellias are so beautiful.

444
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,210
I should also thank you

445
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,650
for your sweet words.

446
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,520
I'm old.

447
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,370
The sticky dumplings are too sticky for me.

448
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,970
Miss Fei.

449
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,320
Don't walk so fast. Wait for me.

450
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,930
Watch the steps.

451
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,280
There're more of them over there.

452
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,570
Hurry up.

453
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,200
Hurry.

454
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,410
Let's go.

455
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,090
Duke Yue, I remember you only have one daughter

456
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,400
who is the apple of your eye.

457
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,680
Why are there two girls?

458
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,850
It's my daughter's birthday today.

459
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,570
We're having a birthday party in the mansion.

460
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,050
So there're many of her classmates.

461
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,040
Sorry that they have disturbed you.

462
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,240
I'll ask them to have fun somewhere else.

463
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,560
No need.

464
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,320
I like lively places.

465
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,810
Their liveliness

466
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,240
makes me happy.

467
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,440
I came uninvited.

468
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,720
Make yourselves comfortable.

469
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,720
Skip the formalities.

470
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,100
Yes.

471
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,410
I came in a hurry.

472
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,930
I didn't prepare a gift.

473
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,640
Let me give

474
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,250
my purple jade sandalwood bracelet that I'm wearing

475
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,640
to Qinruo as a gift.

476
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,210
Thank you, Your Grace.

477
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,880
Where is my bracelet?

478
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,090
I was wearing it when I came.

479
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,610
Why is it missing now?

480
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,010
Get up.

481
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,410
It's just a bracelet.

482
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,200
Maybe I left it in the garden

483
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,810
when we were seeing the flowers.

484
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,730
Guard Yu.

485
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,120
Go look for it.

486
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,800
Yes.

487
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,930
Get up.

488
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,680
Let's go.

489
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,610
Yes.

490
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,170
This is really an eye-opening experience.

491
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,730
I've never seen so many flowers.

492
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,290
I don't even know the names of many flowers here.

493
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,810
Miss Fei.

494
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,200
You've never seen so many flowers either, right?

495
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,360
Hey.

496
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,650
You've never seen so many flowers either, right?

497
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,330
No.

498
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,450
I didn't have the chance to go to a garden like this.

499
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,770
You're right.

500
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,310
Duke Yue's Mansion

501
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,240
is like a museum.

502
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,610
There are so many treasures.

503
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,010
Miss Fei, come and take a look.

504
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,600
This flower is so beautiful.

505
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,240
Let's go back.

506
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,970
The party is going to start.

507
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,240
Don't make them wait too long.

508
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,370
Where could he go?

509
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,650
Xiao Yu, Xiao Yu.

510
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,000
Where have you been?

511
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,920
I went to the restroom.

512
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,650
And I got lost.

513
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,800
This way.

514
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,120
Hurry up. The birthday party is going to start.

515
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,920
You'll be late if you don't hurry.

516
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,570
You go first. I'll be right there.

517
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,810
Where are you going?

518
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,650
I need to use the restroom.

519
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,000
I'll go with you.

520
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,930
It's not proper for you to do it.

521
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,480
I can go on my own.

522
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,560
It's not proper for you to be late.

523
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,290
Let's go. Hurry.

524
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:57,880
Wait.

525
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,920
-I... 
-Let's go.

526
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,170
Listen to me. You go first.

527
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,050
Why do we have to go together? I need to use the restroom.

528
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,450
-After the meal...
-I need to use the restroom.

529
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,010
You can use the restroom after the meal.

530
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,520
Junior Zhou is waiting.

531
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,330
Hurry up.

532
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,130
Are you going to Qinruo's birthday party or not?

533
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,280
I need to use the restroom.

534
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,090
You can go after the meal.

535
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,160
Your Grace.

536
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,410
We've searched every place you've been to.

537
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,480
We didn't find the bracelet.

538
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,320
I'm guilty.

539
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,170
Please punish me severely.

540
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,650
You did nothing wrong.

541
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,970
Get up.

542
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,810
Thank you.

543
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:39,640
Guards!

544
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,560
Call everyone here.

545
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,210
We must find the bracelet.

546
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,840
Forget it.

547
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,920
It's just a bracelet.

548
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,490
Huanxi.

549
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,770
I have a luminous pearl, which is a piece of tribute.

550
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,690
After we go back, ask someone to bring it here and give it to Qinruo.

551
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,400
Yes.

552
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,890
Maybe that bracelet is not meant to be with Qinruo.

553
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,130
I'd better not give it to her.

554
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,450
Thank you for your gift.

555
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,570
But we

556
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,600
must find the bracelet.

557
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,450
That bracelet has been with you for many years.

558
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,640
It's a shame for me

559
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,480
that it got missing in my mansion.

560
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,800
If others know about this,

561
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,570
I will be embarrassed

562
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,200
in front of my colleagues.

563
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,290
Guard Yu,

564
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,610
please investigate this case thoroughly

565
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,050
and find the bracelet.

566
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,690
Fine, do it.

567
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,170
Yes.

568
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,010
Mr. Zhou,

569
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,040
I really think

570
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,610
your understanding of poetry and drawings

571
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,690
is much deeper

572
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,040
than other peers I know.

573
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,850
We don't have much time this time.

574
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,450
When you are free in the future,

575
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,930
come here often.

576
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,810
Let's have a good chat.

577
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,360
I’m flattered.

578
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,720
The works of calligraphy and drawings you collected

579
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,890
are very unique.

580
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,450
My comments

581
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,130
on your collections

582
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,410
are not very thought-provoking.

583
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,370
I'd like to ask you a question.

584
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,530
Mr. Zhou, you're old enough to get married.

585
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,410
Have your parents decided on your fiancée?

586
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,010
I'm devoted to my study.

587
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,530
I've never thought about being in a relationship.

588
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,890
I really want to make friends with you, Mr. Zhou.

589
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,250
Let me give this drawing to you.

590
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:24,920
Here you are.

591
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:25,890
I can't take it.

592
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,440
Take it if you like it.

593
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,880
This gift is too expensive.

594
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,050
I can't take it.

595
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,680
Mr. Zhou, you are wrong.

596
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,530
A good drawing should be given to someone who appreciates it.

597
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,610
You deserve this drawing.

598
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,320
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

599
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,690
You're welcome.

600
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,930
Your brother, Zhou Ting, and I are classmates at the Imperial College.

601
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,040
I've asked my father

602
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,720
to make him the Head Secretary.

603
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,280
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

604
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,130
Young Master.

605
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,690
The birthday party is going to begin.

606
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,170
Lady asked you to come to the party.

607
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,400
Mr. Zhou, the birthday party is about to begin.

608
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,770
Let’s go.

609
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,010
Okay.

610
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,080
Take this drawing.

611
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:13,770
Okay.

612
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,490
Thank you.

613
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,800
Miss Fei, let's sit there.

614
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,290
What were you doing?

615
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,810
No matter how important it is, it can't be more important than my birthday party.

616
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,080
You broke your promise.

617
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,530
It smells familiar.

618
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,890
It's the smell

619
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,050
of the purple jade sandalwood bracelet that Grandmother always wears.

620
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,730
How about we start to eat now?

621
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,150
Everyone, please be seated.

622
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,640
Okay.

623
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,160
Let's go. Okay. Let's go.

624
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,280
Everyone,

625
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,370
it's my sister's birthday today.

626
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,730
Thank you for coming to Duke Yue's Mansion and being our guests.

627
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,970
We'll do our best as hosts.

628
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,120
I hope

629
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,770
your friendship with my sister will be deeper and deeper.

630
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,890
Let me propose a toast to all of you.

631
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,650
I hope

632
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,690
you'll like our wine and food.

633
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,170
If there is any other dish you want to eat,

634
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,610
I'll ask the cooks to make it for you.

635
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,560
Okay.

636
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,680
Thank you.

637
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,530
It is Lady Yan's birthday today.

638
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,560
Let's drink happily.

639
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,680
Lady Yan, let me propose a toast to you and wish you happiness every day.

640
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,480
Thank you.

641
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,250
Mr. Zhou.

642
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,770
Mr. Yan.

643
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,170
Let me introduce him to you.

644
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,120
This is

645
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,970
Zhou Ji, Mr. Zhou.

646
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,890
He is a special friend of my sister's.

647
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,650
He is the top student of Yiyang Academy this year.

648
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:54,960
And he is good at calligraphy and drawing.

649
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,850
He is called the most talented man in Luoyang.

650
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,570
I’m flattered.

651
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,930
Mr. Zhou, I’m very happy

652
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,250
that my sister brought you here today.

653
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,000
My sister is spoiled.

654
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,130
Mr. Zhou, please take good care of her in the academy.

655
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,970
He asked Senior Zhou to take care of Lady Yan.

656
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,160
Hush.

657
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,810
It's my pleasure.

658
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,680
Mr. Yan, you can rest assured.

659
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,600
In the future,

660
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,440
if Lady Yan needs my help in the Yiyang Academy,

661
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,600
I will do my best to help her.

662
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,440
That's wonderful.

663
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,000
I'll let you take care of my only sister.

664
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,760
Please take good care of her

665
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,400
and make her happy.

666
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,240
Brother.

667
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,680
What are you talking about?

668
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,130
Okay.

669
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,010
-I'll stop. 
-What's going on?

670
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,770
I’ll stop.

671
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:49,970
Mr. Zhou.

672
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,450
Would you like to propose a toast to my sister?

673
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,330
Sure.

674
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,150
Mr. Zhou.

675
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,420
The winter and its harshness will leave soon.

676
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,740
Let's drink to the coming of the warmth of the spring.

677
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,040
Lady Yan, I wish you

678
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,450
a happy and carefree life.

679
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,570
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

680
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,460
No wonder he's called the most talented man in Luoyang.

681
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,690
I think

682
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,500
he was just being polite.

683
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,090
Mr. Xiao.

684
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,760
Why don't you propose a toast?

685
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,080
To you, Lady Yan.

686
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,130
Don't just drink.

687
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,410
Try the dishes.

688
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,600
Help yourselves.

689
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,200
Well...

690
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,450
Qinruo.

691
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,180
We would like to propose a toast to you, too.

692
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:05,980
Come on.

693
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,080
Mr. Wang, let me propose a toast to you.

694
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,720
Let me propose a toast to you.

695
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:09,930
Here.

696
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,290
Let's eat.

697
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,170
We would like to propose a toast to you.

698
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,590
Lady Yan, here.

699
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:20,890
Are you okay?

700
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,380
Why are you acting weird today?

701
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,170
Here, Lady Yan.

702
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,650
Usually, you have good manners when you're eating.

703
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:30,920
Thank you.

704
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,800
Why are you eating so fast this time?

705
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,770
Pay more attention to your Junior Zhou.

706
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,730
That's none of your business.

707
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,940
The cakes in Duke Yue's Mansion are so good.

708
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,890
So good?

709
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,890
You know too little about cakes.

710
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,560
I'll let you try some really good cakes if I have the chance

711
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,600
so you'll know what really good cakes are like.

712
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,690
How good can your cakes be?

713
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,910
My cakes must be better than these.

714
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,730
You're bragging.

715
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,190
You're bragging.

716
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,660
You're shallow.

717
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:58,800
Don't move.

718
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,740
They're officers.

719
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,680
What happened?

720
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,720
What happened?

721
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,780
What are you doing?

722
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,110
Officers, what's wrong?

723
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,760
Mr. Yan, Lady Yan.

724
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,910
Everyone.

725
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,000
Someone lost something in the mansion.

726
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:17,980
So...

727
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,530
I'm sorry.

728
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,420
Everyone, please go to the garden.

729
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:24,900
Please.

730
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:25,860
Don't be afraid.

731
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,500
Who lost something?

732
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,850
It looks so serious.

733
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,000
Yeah.

734
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,710
Maybe some lady lost a piece of jewelry.

735
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,440
Even so, the officers shouldn't make us stand here.

736
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,210
That's right.

737
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,160
There are so many officers.

738
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,920
They won't let us go or let others in.

739
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,520
Right.

740
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,720
There must be something wrong.

741
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,790
The person who lost something

742
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,230
must be someone very important.

743
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,650
Hush.

744
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,200
Be quiet.

745
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,970
You know this is serious.

746
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,850
Be careful with your words.

747
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,190
Otherwise, you'll get into trouble, you know?

748
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,460
You're a coward.

749
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,250
Please line up.

750
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:16,530
I'll question you one by one.

751
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,800
We didn't do anything.

752
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,250
Why are you treating us like suspects?

753
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,690
-Right.
-Excuse me, Guard Yu.

754
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,000
What is missing and who lost it?

755
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,850
Why are you making such a scene?

756
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,590
It's Her Grace's purple jade sandalwood bracelet.

757
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,239
Purple jade sandalwood bracelet?

758
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,659
That bracelet has been with Her Grace for many years.

759
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,960
If we find the thief today,

760
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,300
he or she will be severely punished.

761
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,550
But if we can't,

762
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,489
none of you can leave.

763
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,889
Zhou Fei has that bracelet.

764
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,320
What are you talking about?

765
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,449
I'm serious.

766
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,890
The bracelet must be with Zhou Fei.

767
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,050
Over there. Go over there.

768
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,120
But I think she didn't steal it.

769
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,200
I guess she picked it up by accident.

770
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,200
Brother.

771
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,970
Go tell Guard Yu

772
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:03,680
I have that bracelet.

773
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,720
that Zhou Fei found it by accident.

774
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,250
What?

775
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,600
And beg for his forgiveness.

776
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,100
Otherwise, things will get out of hand.

777
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,800
Nonsense.

778
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,570
Why would Zhou Fei pick up that bracelet?

779
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,520
Look.

780
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,730
I found it in the garden.

781
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,400
It looked exquisite and valuable.

782
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,360
I wanted to sell it so we would have money to get Mother treated.

783
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,970
What should I do?

784
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,950
You were so silly.

785
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,010
Give me the bracelet.

786
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,310
Be good. Give it to me.

787
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,190
Hurry.

788
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,130
Line up.

789
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,330
I'll search all of you.

790
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:35,950
You

791
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,010
are the first.

792
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,400
In Duke Yue's Mansion,

793
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,370
I've never seen a guest as poor as you.

794
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,860
Did you sneak in here?

795
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,730
Why are you so rude?

796
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,030
Officer.

797
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,400
I told you to stay out of it!

798
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:52,990
What?

799
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,610
That's Junior Zhou. Shouldn't I defend him?

800
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,400
They'll search you.

801
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,280
Fine. But he shouldn't have said those words.

802
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,130
Mind your language.

803
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,790
Okay.

804
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,960
Sir,

805
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,570
if you are really innocent,

806
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,440
please cooperate with us

807
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,540
and let the officer search you.

808
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:13,610
Brother.

809
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,960
If you want to search him, search all of us right now.

810
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,810
Yes, search all of us.

811
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,110
You can't just search him.

812
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:22,730
Officer.

813
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,080
I'm Song Zhu.

814
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,560
I've got an idea.

815
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,620
You can find the bracelet

816
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,640
without searching us.

817
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,460
You're brave.

818
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,480
But

819
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,140
what should we do

820
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,280
if you can't find the bracelet?

821
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,560
Officer, listen to me.

822
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:50,980
Most of the guests today

823
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,020
are from noble families.

824
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,570
Are you sure

825
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,270
you can find the bracelet by searching us?

826
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,220
Officer.

827
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,290
You can't be sure

828
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,270
that you can find the bracelet by searching us, right?

829
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,850
In that case,

830
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,570
how will you comfort

831
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,480
those ladies and gentlemen

832
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,150
who are to be searched for no reason?

833
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,940
Who do you think the thief is?

834
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:19,890
I don't know.

835
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,160
Tell me.

836
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,570
What idea have you got?

837
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,210
Officer, please ask someone to get a wooden box here.

838
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,080
Go.

839
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,130
Wooden box? Why does she need it?

840
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:37,410
Brother.

841
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,140
It's okay.

842
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,490
Wooden box?

843
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,810
Why does she need it?

844
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,360
What is she going to do with it?

845
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,440
I don't know.

846
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,040
Next,

847
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,970
everyone,

848
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,170
please reach into this wooden box.

849
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,600
After all of us have done it,

850
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,120
as long as the missing bracelet is in the box,

851
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,810
we won't punish anyone.

852
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,750
Is that okay, officer?

853
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,320
Sister, that's a good idea.

854
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,960
Yueniang is trying to help us.

855
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,740
I'll go first.

856
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,170
Can it be found this way?

857
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,600
I don't think so.

858
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,010
It's really strange.

859
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,090
Here it is.

860
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,530
It has been found!

861
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,370
That's the bracelet.

862
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,880
Yes.

863
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,140
Wait.

864
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,290
This means

865
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,880
one of you must have had this bracelet with you.

866
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,860
Officer.

867
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,960
Didn't you promise me

868
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,880
that you wouldn't get anyone punished if the bracelet could be found.

869
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,450
Do you want to break your promise?

870
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,900
Fine.

871
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,280
The case

872
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,730
has been solved.

873
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,070
But I have to warn the person who stole the bracelet.

874
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,240
I hope you've learnt your lesson.

875
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:05,880
You can leave now.

876
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,160
Thank you, officer.

877
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,740
Her Grace said

878
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,750
if the bracelet had been found, please report it to her.

879
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,460
Her Grace?

880
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,690
The Empress Dowager is here.

881
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,260
Miss Song Zhu,

882
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,090
come with me.

883
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,160
Please wait a moment.

884
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,550
Come on.

885
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,540
Go with me.

886
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,800
It was your idea.

887
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,430
Hurry up.

888
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,250
Just you. You don't have to take me.

889
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:35,880
I'm not going.

890
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,850
Let me finish.

891
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:37,770
Well.

892
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:38,840
Don't mention my name

893
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,210
when you are there.

894
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,130
You coward.

895
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,210
I'm a coward.

896
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,190
I'm a coward.

897
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:43,920
It's because

898
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,760
when I see Her Grace, I get very nervous.

899
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,770
Sorry, sorry.

900
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,510
Look at you.

901
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,000
It has been found.

902
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,000
Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's go.

903
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,000
Please.
