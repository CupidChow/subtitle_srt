00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,470
Junior Zhou,

5
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,509
actually, Xiao Yu and I are not...

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,390
How come it's you?

7
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,910
Aren't you here for me?

8
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,390
You can say that I'm here for you.

9
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,050
What do you mean?

10
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,230
I want to say

11
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,060
thank you.

12
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,910
Thanks.

13
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,690
What?

14
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,350
I didn't hear you clearly.

15
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,750
I said...

16
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,840
thank you.

17
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,550
Thank you.

18
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,630
I didn't expect that you would be so shy sometimes.

19
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,010
Good.

20
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,880
You've learned to say something nice.

21
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,079
I...

22
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,220
I'm always clear about what to love or hate.

23
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,550
Don't underestimate me.

24
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,430
After all, you helped me

25
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,030
and the academy.

26
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,190
I...

27
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,030
should thank you.

28
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,390
You protected me from the ball.

29
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,580
Are you okay now?

30
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,950
I think he threw that ball with so much strength.

31
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,930
Zhu.

32
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,380
I think you underestimated me by saying that.

33
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,390
Could that small ball hurt me?

34
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,840
Really?

35
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,670
It hurts.

36
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,850
Just compensate me for the medical fees.

37
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,710
Okay.

38
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,150
I'm glad that you're fine.

39
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,950
Don't worry.

40
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,550
I won't threaten you with this accident.

41
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,110
Go.

42
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,829
Ask Junior Zhou out for me.

43
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,350
Hurry up.

44
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,590
I knew that you came here not in order to thank me.

45
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,460
So you came because of him?

46
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,510
Don't leave.

47
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,670
Go ask him out for me.

48
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,300
Let's talk about it tomorrow. I'm sleepy.

49
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,829
Xiao Yu.

50
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,310
Do you know that people of the academy

51
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,410
are spreading a very ridiculous rumor about us?

52
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,630
I know.

53
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,910
For example, as you're hugging me like this now,

54
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,790
if someone sees us,

55
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,840
the rumor will become more ridiculous.

56
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,180
If he really misunderstands you because there are many rumors,

57
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,490
do you think you can explain it to him clearly?

58
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,360
Song Zhu.

59
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,750
Do you think you know him well?

60
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,720
Of course I know him well.

61
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,170
I bought his paintings

62
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,240
and read his poems.

63
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,420
Besides, both of us are students of the academy now.

64
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,260
Have you forgotten this?

65
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,150
We had soft drinks and had a lake tour together.

66
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,750
How can I not know him well?

67
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,360
I wonder whether you know what kind of person he is.

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,930
What do you mean?

69
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,460
It's the same as the meaning just now.

70
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,870
As you said,

71
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,080
it's just the facade.

72
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,350
Have you ever probed into his inner thoughts?

73
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,760
Do you know his background?

74
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,460
Do you know where he has lived

75
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,110
and whom he has been in contact with?

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,490
Do you know

77
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,340
why he came to the Yiyang Academy?

78
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,030
I...

79
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,770
You don't know all these things.

80
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,270
You talked as if you knew him well.

81
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,880
I don't know him well, either.

82
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,870
That's not right.

83
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
You live in the same dorm with Junior Zhou.

84
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,110
You are the closest to him.

85
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,470
You should know him better.

86
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,950
That's just what you think.

87
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,680
If one day,

88
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,430
you find that he is hiding something from you,

89
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,310
what will you do?

90
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,450
He's hiding something from me?

91
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,710
Xiao Yu.

92
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:48,830
Do you dare to say that

93
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,040
you don't have any small secrets?

94
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,070
Look.

95
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,270
You have some small secrets, too.

96
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,630
So,

97
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,990
don't worry about others.

98
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,430
Mind your own business.

99
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,560
It's okay that you won't ask Junior Zhou out for me.

100
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,350
No problem.

101
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,950
I'll figure out a way myself.

102
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,030
I won't keep talking to you about this.

103
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,300
You will never know my secrets.

During holidays,

107

you usually sleep till late in the morning.

Why are you up so early today?

109
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,390
I have something to do today.

can you do me a favor?

Didn't our mother make you a new dress?

120

Just let me wear it first.

121
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,150
If you don't tell me about it,

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,470

I often go to her home for tutoring, don't I?

She thinks that my clothes are shabby,

126
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,070
so I want to dress up nicely

and impress her.

128
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,380
Shabby?

129
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,670
Qinruo said something like that?

130
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,790
Our Song Family always attaches little importance to clothing.

Junior Zhou,

140
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,190
have you heard any gossip recently?

141
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,270
The exam is coming.

142
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,080
I have no time to care about other things.

143
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,570
That's good.

Yes...

146

Senior Song, if there's nothing else,

147
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,510
I need to go review the lessons.

148

If you have the time to think about this,

149
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,880
you should study more instead.

For the question I asked you last time,

152
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,470
I haven’t finished hearing your explanations.

153
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,870
A few days ago, I was reading

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,190
Qu Yuan's Nine Songs—Madam Xiang,

155
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,590
and I was still touched by the following lines.

156
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,030
I'm looking around while stepping on the waterweeds.

157
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,950
I'll have a date with a beautiful girl tonight.

158
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,500
Why did the birds gather on the waterweeds?

159
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,130
Why is the fishing net hung on the tree?

160
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,970
The angelica is green by the Yuan River and the Orchids are beautiful by the Li River.

How do you explain these four words?

168
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,150

I asked many people all the way here before I found you.

00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,240
Go back to the dorm with me to take a rest first.

192
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,620
Senior Song.

193
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,630
I need to take care of my sister first.

194
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,910
Bye.

195
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,060
Okay.

196
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,270
I won't disturb you any longer for now.

197
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,630
Bye.

198
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,950
Bye.

199
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,360
Brother.

200
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,310
Did that lady want to talk with you about something?

201
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,590
Nothing.

202
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,610
Let's go back first.

203
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,240
Father, I want this one.

204
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,630
Take this little cow.

205
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,590
Actually, I want that one.

206
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,040
-I want that one.
-Take this one first.

207
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,630
Come and look at this one.

208
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,600
I just want this one.

209
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,790
Father.

210
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,030
Mr. Xiao comes here regularly

211
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,270
to buy some pigments for Mr. Chen.

212
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,010
Will he not come today?

213
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,150
Sir, take care.

214
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,270
See you next time.

215
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,030
When did he go inside?

216
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,710
Mr. Xiao.

217
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,040
What a coincidence.

218
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,440
I'm sorry. All the pigments spilled on the ground.

219
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,630
It's all right.

220
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,400
Are you okay?

221
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,430
I'm fine.

222
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,830
Mr. Xiao,

223
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,690
you were so agile.

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,520
Miss Yan, when you walk on the road,

225
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,550
you should be careful about your surroundings.

226
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,490
Thank you for saving me just now.

227
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,320
You're welcome.

228
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,240
I'm sorry for my rudeness just now.

229
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,390
Please don't mind it, Miss Yan.

230
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,390
I understand.

231
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,110
But Mr. Xiao,

232
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,390
your pigments all spilled on the ground.

233
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,900
How about I buy another box for you?

234
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,500
No need.

235
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,820
I'm going to deliver the pigments to Mr. Chen first.

236
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,630
He needs them urgently.

237
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,230
Sorry.

238
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,230
Mr. Xiao.

239
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,470
Mr. Xiao!

240
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,040
Mr. Xiao, I'm going back to the academy, too.

241
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,710
He left so soon.

242
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,390
That was close.

243
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,620
Young Master.

244
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,280
That was close indeed.

245
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,710
Uncle Hu, did you want to scare me to death?

246
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,570
You appeared so suddenly just like a ghost.

247
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,310
How do you know I'm here?

248
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,870
Even Duke Yue's daughter knows that you are here.

249
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,870
Of course I know you're here, don't I?

250
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,560
Have you found a way to approach Song Xu?

251
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:17,930
Not yet.

252
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,310
But the exam is coming.

253
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,890
I can still go on figuring out a way.

254
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,470
Young Master, you're very busy today.

255
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,590
Do you know that Miss Yan waited for you

256
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,950
for a long time across the street?

257
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,650
After you showed up,

258
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,000
she did everything on purpose.

259
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,430
Uncle Hu.

260
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,940
Can you be serious?

261
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,420
Young master, deal with the serious matters at once.

262
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,480
Got it.

263
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,790
Bye.

264
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,560
Uncle Hu.

265
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,190
I have something important to do now.

266
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:50,890
Well...

267
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,140
As long as it's not about money, everything else is fine.

268
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,190
Hurry up.

269
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,000
Miss Yan.

270
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,800
Miss...

271
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,680
Uncle Hu!

272
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,030
Why did you come here

273
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,610
from home this time?

274
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,560
Our mother had an attack of tuberculosis again.

275
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,190
This time, she almost...

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,280
She almost died.

277
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,910
What?

278
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,320
How could this happen?

279
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,870
Well...

280
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,020
How is she now?

281
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,260
She has made it through.

282
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,070
However,

283
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,910
if we have no money to buy medicine in the future,

284
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,550
what should we do?

285
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,640
Why do you think that we'll have no money to buy medicine?

286
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,780
Didn't I send all the money I had earned by selling

287
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,030
my paintings back to our home?

288
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,590
Money?

289
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,290
I didn't receive any money.

290
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,590
The First Madam must have taken it away secretly.

291
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,300
How despicable.

292
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:54,990
Brother.

293
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,390
When our mother got sick this time,

294
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,830
I went to the Main House to ask for medicine.

295
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,910
But they gave me a few feet of white ribbons.

296
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,270
They even cursed our mother.

297
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,110
Considering that they usually treated us badly,

298
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,150
why did you go there to be insulted by them?

299
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,430
I couldn't accept it.

300
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,680
We're also descendants of the Zhou Family.

301
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,230
Just because we are children of a concubine,

302
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,260
we deserve to be bullied by the First Madam and the others?

303
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,940
If it weren't for the First Madam's scheme,

304
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,570
which made your admission qualification for the Imperial College

305
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,270
given to her won son,

306
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,150
you wouldn't have come all the way

307
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,770
to the Yiyang Academy, would you?

308
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,360
It's all in the past.

309
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,960
Don't mention it again.

310
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,720
Okay.

311
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,630
But since our home is in such a situation now,

312
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,130
why did you come out?

313
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,870
I came here because...

314
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,870
our mother heard that there was a women's school at Yiyang Academy.

315
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,710
She wanted me to ask you

316
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,020
whether I could also study with you here.

317
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,550
After you came out,

318
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,110
who would take care of our mother?

319
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,770
I said the same thing.

320
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,670
But our mother said that

321
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,130
she thought she was getting better recently.

322
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,910
Though I stayed with her every day,

323
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,340
I couldn't help her much.

324
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,750
I might as well do something useful.

325
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,440
She said she didn't want to ruin my future.

326
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,190
Our mother...

327
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,230
was really thoughtful.

328
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,550
Although you don't need to take an exam to apply for the Women's Academy,

329
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,150
it's not that easy to get admitted to this school.

330
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,510
As far as I know,

331
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,110
you'll not only need a recommendation letter from an aristocrat in the city,

332
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,130
but also

333
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,080
need a lot of money.

334
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,830
Brother,

335
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,950
now do you think I should go home or...

336
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,030
Calm down first.

337
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,270
You've just arrived in Yiyang.

338
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:08,000
In these several days, I'll find an inn for you first so that you can live there.

339
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,589
I'll figure out a way

340
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,790
for your admission to this school.

341
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,660
Since our mother wants you to study at school,

342
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,910
I won't let you go back like this.

343
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,990
Look at you.

344
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,940
Your face is dirty.

345
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,410
I'll take you to wash your face later.

346
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,050
Have some snacks first.

347
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,630
It's delicious, Brother.

348
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,630
Feiniang.

349
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,650
You've suffered a lot these days.

350
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,020
I'm so useless as your elder brother.

351
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,390
I failed to give you and mother a rich life.

352
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,390
Brother, don't say that.

353
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,140
The First Madam and the others should be blamed. It has nothing to do with you.

354
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,560
When you become the Number One Scholar in the future,

355
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,990
you can feel proud of it in front of the First Madam and her people.

356
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,790
Okay.

357
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,480
Brother,

358
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,190
I think all the members of the Yiyang Academy are nice.

359
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,730
I didn't know the way just now.

360
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,510
I asked the young men and the young ladies all the way here

361
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,470
before I found you.

362
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,190
Since all the people here are so nice,

363
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,770
I think they also treat you very well, right?

364
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,540
It turns out that the talented scholar Zhou...

365
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,250
Give the letter back to me.

366
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,040
is an illegitimate son.

367
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,270
They all treat me very well.

368
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,320
Don't worry.

369
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,470
That's good.

370
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,230
Our mother is always worried about you.

371
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,850
She has talked to me about it several times.

372
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,760
She always feels that you only told her the good news without telling her the bad news.

373
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,950
I saw it with my own eyes today.

374
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,960
I'll go back and tell our mother that

375
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,230
all the people here are very nice,

376
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,690
and my brother lives a better life here than at home.

377
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,710
Then I can make our mother stop worrying.

378
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,350
Okay.

379
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,400
Yueniang, you're back.

380
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,470
Our mother told me to ask you to have lunch.

381
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,860
Sister,

382
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,230
I went to Qinruo’s home to review lessons today.

383
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,210
I'm a bit tired.

384
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,870
I want to take a good rest.

385
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,550
I'll have lunch later.

386
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,110
There won't be lunch for you later.

387
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,800
Don't say that I didn't inform you.

388
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,840
Got it, Sister.

389
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,760
Song Zhu, you are so useless.

390
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,940
What you wanted to say was so important, but you only said half of it.

391
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,070
I wonder...

392
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,830
But Mr. Zhou is so smart.

393
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,250
He must know what I wanted to say.

394
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,740
I wonder what he thinks about it.

395
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,590
I should stop thinking about it.

396
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,130
My head hurts.

397
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,350
Greetings, my dear teachers.

398
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,560
What's the matter?

399
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,450
Sir.

400
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,950
I...

401
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,870
Sir.

402
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,270
My younger sister came all the way here today.

403
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,570
She wants to study at school.

404
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,060
I...

405
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,870
I sincerely hope that you can let her stay here

406
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,870
and be an associate student in the Women's Academy.

407
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,100
Your younger sister?

408
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,510
Does she have a recommendation letter?

409
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,450
No.

410
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,240
Mr. Chen.

411
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,710
Isn't it easy to get a recommendation letter?

412
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,850
Just ask him to find a classmate to write this letter.

413
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,280
It's not difficult to get a recommendation letter,

414
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,550
but the tuition fees at the Women's Academy are quite high.

415
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,950
Zhou Ji.

416
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,500
Has your family prepared for it?

417
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,420
Well...

418
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,260
I...

419
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm trying to find a way to solve this problem.

420
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,910
I wonder whether you can let her stay in the dorm of the Women's Academy first?

421
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,030
I'll raise money for her tuition fees as soon as possible.

422
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,540
I'll also ask someone to write the recommendation letter as soon as possible.

423
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,430
The academy has always attached much importance to the rules.

424
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,450
If I let your sister enter the academy in advance today,

425
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,590
and if in the future, someone criticizes us

426
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,440
for being unjust and unfair and breaking the rules,

427
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,860
What should we do then?

428
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,510
Mr. Zhang.

429
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,880
His sister came all the way here to find him.

430
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,780
It's inconvenient for her to be alone.

431
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,700
I don't think we should be so rigid.

432
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,390
Every family has its own problems.

433
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,910
But if we break the rules this time,

434
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,230
and if in the future, everyone can come and tell us about their sufferings,

435
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,440
how can we maintain the academy's rules?

436
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,550
That makes sense.

437
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,790
I'll stop talking.

438
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,710
Is the academy still short of a person who does chores?

439
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,390
My sister used to do such chores as

440
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,020
cooking and cleaning at home.

441
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,150
You can ask her to do some chores first.

442
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,950
Doing chores is not a long-term solution.

443
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,390
For both you and her,

444
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,690
this is not a good thing.

445
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,030
If you really care about your sister,

446
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,910
just find a way to let her get admitted to the school.

447
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,740
I understand.

448
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,290
They think it's unfair and unjust

449
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,900
and breaking the rules to let Feiniang get admitted to the school.

450
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,470
But if Feiniang were not an illegitimate daughter,

451
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,840
and I had power and influence,

452
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,340
I'm afraid the teachers wouldn't have...

453
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,510
such attitudes.

454
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,670
What fairness and justice?

455
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,110
It's just an excuse to despise those lowly people.

456
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:09,700
Zhou.

457
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,950
Xiao.

458
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,350
Why are you back so early today?

459
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,870
You didn't go to the Wenjing Hall?

460
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,040
No, I didn't.

461
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,710
Xiao.

462
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,930
Can you do me a favor?

463
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,670
What is it?

464
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,350
Just tell me.

465
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,920
My younger sister came to see me today.

466
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,710
She said that our mother wanted her to study at the Women's Academy.

467
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,190
That's a good thing.

468
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,150
In this way, you can see your sister every day.

469
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,790
As you know, in order to get admitted to the Women's Academy,

470
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,270
it's necessary to have a recommendation letter.

471
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,150
So I wonder whether you can

472
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,190
ask your father

473
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,050
to write a recommendation letter to our dean.

474
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,000
Well...

475
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,110
If it's not convenient for you, I'll think of another way.

476
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,360
It's not like that.

477
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,210
Zhou.

478
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,270
The problem is that my father

479
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,710
is away from home now.

480
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,080
I may not know when I can

481
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,070
get in touch with him.

482
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,100
So...

483
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:44,900
I understand.

484
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,640
How about I ask Ding Miao and the others for you?

485
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,110
Don't bother.

486
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,770
I’ll find another way.

487
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,800
Zhou, apart from the recommendation letter,

488
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,750
I can help you with anything else.

489
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,900
You must tell me if you have any difficulties.

490
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,840
Let's solve the problems together.

491
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,120
Okay.

492
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,870
Xiaoyue.

493
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,670
Is what you've just said true?

494
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,430
Mr. Zhou's paintings are being sold at the market again?

495
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,320
I've seen his paintings and signatures before.

496
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,600
How could I be wrong?

497
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,780
Besides, you didn't see

498
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,930
how pathetic he looked.

499
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,280
No one bought his paintings.

500
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,950
What a poor guy.

501
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,190
What are you talking about, ladies?

502
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,110
The atmosphere is so lively.

503
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,790
It's a secret.

504
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,070
We won't tell you.

505
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,110
We won't tell him.

506
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,950
Teaching Assistant Xiao,

507
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,790
I have some questions for you.

508
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,500
Come on. Let's go on talking about it.

509
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,560
Let me tell you.

510
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,070
Hurry up.

511
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,030
Zhu.

512
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,070
Teaching Assistant Xiao,

513
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,930
I want to ask why Mr. Zhou suddenly sold his paintings.

514
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,550
Did something wrong happen?

515
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,910
Selling paintings?

516
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,560
I don't know about this thing.

517
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,510
But his younger sister came to the academy to see him yesterday.

518
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,270
She said she wanted to study at the Women's Academy.

519
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,190
He told me about this last night.

520
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,520
He wanted my father

521
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,840
to write a recommendation letter for his sister.

522
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,260
Did you agree?

523
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,020
No.

524
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,430
Why didn't you agree?

525
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,000
I can't find my father.

526
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,580
I'm not able to help him.

527
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,350
Yueniang, what's the matter?

528
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,870
Mr. Zhou's younger sister wants to get admitted to the Women's Academy.

529
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,560
He wanted him to ask his father to write a recommendation letter.

530
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,710
But he refused to write it.

531
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,390
He's very unkind.

532
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,440
It's not that I don't want to help him.

533
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,790
But I can't find my father.

534
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,570
You just don't want to help him.

535
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,120
So this is the reason why

536
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,870
Mr. Zhou's sister came to see him?

537
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,020
I happened to see his sister that day.

538
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:44,710
His sister

539
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,390
looked pretty and cute.

540
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,080
Her name is Zhou Fei.

541
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,390
Unfortunately, my father is the dean. He can't recommend her internally.

542
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,540
Otherwise, I'll go ask my father for help.

543
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,950
Don't worry, Mr. Xiao.

544
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,240
I'll ask my father to write a recommendation letter.

545
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,740
By that time, just go back and tell Mr. Zhou

546
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,960
not to worry about it.

547
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,140
Miss Yan is such a generous woman.

548
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,070
It's just a piece of cake.

549
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,950
If I can help you and Mr. Zhou,

550
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,070
I'll feel very happy, too.

551
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,910
But why did Mr. Zhou still need to sell his paintings?

552
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,090
Did he do that because of the tuition fees?

553
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,830
Alright, Yueniang.

554
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,830
It's not a big deal.

555
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,400
Leave it to me.

556
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,270
Mr. Chen is here.

557
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,230
Let's go back to our seats.

558
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,150
Hurry up.

559
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,830
Everyone, you've seen your grades.

560
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,750
In the first part of the Book of Songs,

561
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,750
this poem is about two ospreys chirping towards each other at the same time,

562
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,030
as well as depending on and loving each other.

563
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,430
It evokes the idea of a lady accompanying a gentleman.

564
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,080
In the following chapters,

565
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,310
the act of picking Nymphoides Peltatum

566
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,430
evokes the idea about the protagonist's love and pursuit for a woman.

567
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,910
So, people usually think that

568
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,280
this is a poem about men and women...

569
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,600
Miss,

570
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,940
are you looking for someone?

571
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,390
Xiaofang, do you know her?

572
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,190
No, I don't know her.

573
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,840
Have you seen her before.

574
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,230
No, I haven't.

575
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,230
I don't know her.

576
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,990
Who is this?

577
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,910
I've never seen her before.

578
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,150
Why did she leave?

579
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,090
She left?

580
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,360
That girl who stood there just now is Junior Zhou's sister, isn't she?

581
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,400
This is not okay.

582
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,070
She's just a little girl.

583
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,110
Just do her a favor.

584
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,650
What kind of favor is that?

585
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,760
This favor is to break the rules.

586
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,750
Sister,

587
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,160
I can't help you with this.

588
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,570
Brother.

589
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,990
Although this girl named Zhou Fei

590
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,390
is Mr. Zhou’s sister,

591
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,440
I have to remind you that

592
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,710
it's okay to be naughty and play with each other at ordinary times,

593
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,030
but the Song Family values rules the most.

594
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,550
Our father will never

595
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,510
make an exception in this matter.

596
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,940
Brother.

597
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,240
Brother.

598
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,360
The exam is coming.

599
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,030
Go back to review the lessons.

600
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,630
Brother, if you don't agree,

601
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,900
I won't go.

602
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,710
If you talk about this again,

603
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,670
I'll report it to our father.

604
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,670
I'm leaving.

605
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,940
I hope that Mr. Zhou can find another way.

606
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,350
Though I want to help him, I'm able to do so.

607
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,070
What?

608
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,550
You went to the Women's Academy?

609
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,470
The teacher almost caught me on the spot.

610
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,390
Why did you come to the academy for no reason?

611
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,940
Didn't I ask you to take a good rest in the inn?

612
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,080
I...

613
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,690
I was bored and wanted to take a look at the academy.

614
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,670
However, Brother,

615
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,030
the Women's Academy is really good.

616
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,920
The books there are so interesting.

617
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,600
If I can sit

618
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,910
in such a spacious and bright classroom and study there,

619
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,750
how good it'll be.

620
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,910
I'm useless as your brother.

621
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,800
Brother.

622
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,350
Don't say that.

623
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:48,790
I...

624
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,950
Actually, the Women's Academy is not that good.

625
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,950
I went there merely on the spur of the moment.

626
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,030
Feiniang.

627
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,590
Wait for some more days.

628
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,040
When my paintings are sold,

629
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,350
I'll make sure that you can study at the Women's Academy.

630
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,910
Really, Brother?

631
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,010
Have I ever lied to you?

632
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:13,450
[Wenjing Hall]

633
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,510
I'm not quite familiar with this verse.

634
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,110
Just go ask the teacher later.

635
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,630
Zhou.

636
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,590
Xiao.

637
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,230
Xiao,

638
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,100
why did you have the mood to come to the Wenjing Hall today?

639
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,910
It was just an sudden impusle.

640
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,190
I’m going to draw.

641
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,630
Zhou,

642
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,310
I forgot to tell you this.

643
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,980
Miss Yan has asked me to tell you that

644
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,630
she's willing to help your sister get admitted to the Women's Academy.

645
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,460
Really?

646
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,430
Look. Isn’t that Mr. Zhou?

647
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,590
Why did he come to the girls' dorm so late?

648
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:09,940
Right.

649
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,720
Stop looking. Let's go.

650
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,270
Look at him.

651
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,280
Senior Yan.

652
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,590
Junior Zhou.

653
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,240
Feiniang.

654
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,710
Come here.

655
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,310
This is Senior Yan.

656
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:27,990
Bow to her.

657
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,370
Hello, Miss Yan.

658
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,830
This must be Junior Zhou's sister.

659
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,040
Senior Yan,

660
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,560
I specially came here to thank you today.

661
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,430
Thank you for helping my sister.

662
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,240
Feiniang, thank Miss Yan.

663
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,990
Thank you, Miss Yan.

664
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,950
You're welcome.

665
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,920
It's nothing. No need to thank me.

666
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,150
You want to help us and you're so generous.

667
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,070
I don't know how to repay your kindness.

668
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,890
Junior Zhou, you don't have to do this.

669
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,790
By the way,

670
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,750
don't worry about

671
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,830
the tuition fees, either. Just leave it to me.

672
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,540
Well...

673
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,600
How can I ask you to help with the school fees?

674
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,150
Well...

675
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,720
What's wrong with that? It's not a big deal.

676
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,540
No.

677
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,320
No, Senior Yan.

678
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,510
It is embarrassing for me to accept your money.

679
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,270
How about this?

680
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,150
I'll return the tuition fees to you by installments on a monthly basis.

681
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,000
No. Don't return the money to me.

682
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,550
I'm not the one who will give you the money.

683
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,550
It's my father who will give you the money.

684
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,790
Why will you give it to me?

685
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,320
Besides, Junior Zhou,

686
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,710
no need to treat me as an outsider like this.

687
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,429
Since we are classmates,

688
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,110
we should help each other.

689
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,190
I'll owe you a favor first.

690
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,710
In the future,

691
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,790
if you need my help,

692
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:41,780
you must tell me.

693
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,440
How about...

694
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,949
If you think that

695
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,350
you owe me a favor,

696
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,750
why don't you agree to fulfill a small request for me?

697
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,949
Senior Yan, please say it.

698
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,710
Can you draw a portrait for me?

699
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,040
Of course.

700
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,080
When do you have time?

701
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,440
No hurry.

702
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,600
I think Feining has just entered our school.

703
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,070
You and she must be busy with many things.

704
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,720
How about

705
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,830
we wait till you're free?

706
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,600
Okay.

707
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,190
You can ask me to do it anytime.

708
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,090
By that time, we can also ask Yueniang to do it with us.

709
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,730
And Mr. Xiao, too.

710
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,120
We can go to the suburbs together and find a beautiful view.

711
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,140
I'll listen to you for all the arrangements.

712
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,070
Okay.

713
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,600
I have to go.

714
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,310
Feiniang.

715
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,120
Say goodbye to Senior Yan.

716
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,390
Goodbye, Miss Yan.

717
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,000
If you need anything at the Women's Academy,

718
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,050
just come to me directly.

719
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,670
I'm leaving.

720
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,550
I can finally see Mr. Xiao.

721
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,640
I'm so smart.

722
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,070
Brother.

723
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,180
When you become the Number One Scholar in the future,

724
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,740
don't forget Miss Yan.

725
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,550
Of course.

726
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,020
Let's go.

727
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,720
Senior.

728
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,580
What

729
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,390
is the matter?

730
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,950
You don't have to be so polite, Mr. Zhou.

731
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,300
My name is Jin Xiaoyue.

732
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,630
You can call me Miss Jin.

733
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,470
I don't think it's appropriate.

734
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,470
It's okay.

735
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,910
They all call me that.

736
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,830
This must be Mr. Zhou's sister,

737
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,790
Miss Fei.

738
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,790
Feiniang.

739
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,890
Greet Senior Jin.

740
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,720
Hello, Miss Jin.

741
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,150
Good girl.

742
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,870
Don't be afraid.

743
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,880
Mr. Zhou.

744
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,550
I've heard that Miss Fei is going to enter our academy, right?

745
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,490
My dorm is still empty.

746
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,830
Why don't you ask her to move in tomorrow?

747
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,710
Miss Jin, here's the thing.

748
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,960
Only until today

749
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,990
did I know that Feiniang could enter our academy.

750
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,080
We came in a hurry.

751
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,310
Just wait till we go back and pack up the things.

752
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,790
That's okay.

753
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,960
Senior Jin, we have to go.

754
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,670
Take care, Mr. Zhou.

755
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,920
Miss Fei!

756
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,080
Remember to come to me.

757
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,160
Brother.

758
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,140
I'm a little scared of that young lady.

759
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,480
Senior Jin is willing to help us,

760
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,700
and she's doing this for our own good.

761
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,230
Feiniang.

762
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,120
You should be kind to others after you enter our academy this time.

763
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,740
Understand?

764
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,750
Don't worry, Brother.

765
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,790
I will do it well.

766
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,630
You're a good girl, Feiniang.

767
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:36,710
Let's go.

768
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,010
Zhang.

769
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,840
Wang.

770
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,950
Zhang.

771
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,110
Zhang.

772
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:46,860
Okay.

773
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,480
Zhang.

774
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,520
Where is Mr. Zhou?

775
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,970
I thought he would come to review the lessons.

776
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,360
Qingzhou...

777
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,160
Qing...

778
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,120
Qingzhou...

779
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,650
Junior Zhou!

780
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,230
Are you okay?

781
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,550
I'm fine.

782
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,790
What a coincidence.

783
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,250
Are you here to review the lessons as well?

784
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,360
Well...

785
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,660
Well...

786
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,880
For the poem I read last time...

787
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,270
Actually, I want to say that...

788
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,550
I want to say that...
