00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,960
[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,670
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:39,990
Harder.

5
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,229
Harder.

6
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,630
He's here.

7
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,729
Get ready.

8
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,890
Help!

9
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,160
Help!

10
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,280
Please don't let him recognize me.

11
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,430
It's okay.

12
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,199
-Come down.
-Hush.

13
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:09,960
Be quiet.

14
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
Mr. Xiao?

15
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,170
Shh.

16
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,329
Senior...

17
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,840
Senior Song?

18
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,230
I should be blamed for not observing the celestial phenomena.

19
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,350
I was wrong about the climatic, geographical,

20
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,140
and human conditions.

21
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,800
Let me ask you.

22
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,660
Do you really want to help me?

23
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,230
If you dare to play tricks with me,

24
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,940
I will...

25
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,820
I really want to help you.

26
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,140
I was just careless.

27
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,460
Actually,

28
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,270
you can get along with Xiao Yu in the future.

29
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,190
Maybe

30
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,640
he's not that annoying.

31
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,480
Xiao Yu.

32
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,550
Did I hear it wrong because I'm drunk

33
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,100
or were you talking nonsense because you are drunk?

34
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,130
No.

35
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,240
I just think

36
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,700
it may be too early

37
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,060
to talk about the engagement now.

38
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,310
I'll make it clear to you today.

39
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,790
I don't care who is engaged to me.

40
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,230
Whether it's Xiao Yu

41
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,350
or Li Yu,

42
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,310
even...

43
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,060
even if it's Zhou Ji,

44
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,400
I must cancel the engagement.

45
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,840
Being a daughter of the Song family

46
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,960
has made me suffocated.

47
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,500
I...

48
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,450
Why must a daughter of the Song family

49
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,290
be knowledgeable?

50
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,580
I just don't like studying.

51
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,770
So what?

52
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,860
But

53
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,970
I don't have a choice.

54
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,440
I can't change who I am.

55
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,909
But marriage can be changed.

56
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,010
Like I said,

57
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,050
I don't want an arranged life.

58
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,170
I want a free life.

59
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,520
Okay.

60
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:15,980
I promise you.

61
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,270
But

62
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,700
I've never seen a woman like you

63
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,100
who can't do anything.

64
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,920
Where should I start?

65
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:30,950
I...

66
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,440
Not really.

67
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,040
I'm not as useless as you said.

68
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,970
I...

69
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,940
There are things I can do.

70
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,960
What can you do?

71
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,850
I...

72
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,120
I can do horseback archery.

73
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,610
Horseback archery?

74
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,409
It's not bad

75
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,520
to be unique.

76
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,120
I'll help you sincerely this time.

77
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,210
If it still won't work,

78
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,870
I'm afraid you should follow the arrangement.

79
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,110
I can do horseback archery.

80
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,740
So beautiful.

81
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,490
The next class is Instructor Shen's archery class.

82
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:22,800
I heard

83
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,630
you seldom had archery classes before.

84
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,220
I think you should develop comprehensively.

85
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,340
So

86
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,990
why don't you go to the shooting range now?

87
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,310
I like archery.

88
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,150
I like archery.

89
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,550
I...

90
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,710
Are we really going?

91
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,870
Can we not go?

92
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,110
That's right.

93
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,130
Men learn the Six Arts.

94
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,380
Women should learn the same.

95
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,940
Women are weak.

96
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,390
How can we go to the archery class?

97
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,240
I don't want to leave any scar on my beautiful face,

98
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,159
not even a scratch.

99
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,390
Don't worry, ladies.

100
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,590
I will protect you in class.

101
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,870
Since Mr. Xiao said so,

102
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,030
I'm willing to try.

103
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,540
I'll give a string bag

104
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,160
to each of the ladies going to the archery class today.

105
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,310
Really?

106
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,430
Yes.

107
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,390
This is unexpected.

108
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,190
Is everyone here today?

109
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,520
Go ahead.

110
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,590
Instructor Shen.

111
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,110
I had more classes than them.

112
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,710
I can help you teach them.

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,590
Okay.

114
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,190
I don't expect too much

115
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,800
from you.

116
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,770
Draw the bow and release the arrow.

117
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,380
As long as you can hit the target,

118
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,320
I'll let you pass.

119
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:47,960
Understand?

120
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,590
The bowstring is too tight.

121
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,710
We can't pull it back.

122
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,310
That's right.

123
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,030
We can't pull it back.

124
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,130
It can be adjusted if you can't pull it back.

125
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,180
I

126
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,159
am going to try it for you.

127
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,920
-Come on.
-Come on.

128
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,010
You can have a try too.

129
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,230
Let me adjust the bowstring for you.

130
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,810
Why did you step on me?

131
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,520
Mr. Zhou is watching.

132
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,460
Why did you come to help?

133
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,020
Just let me show off.

134
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,940
Thank you, Teaching Assistant Xiao.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,860
I know how to draw the bow.

136
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,840
Give me the bow.

137
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,350
You're great, Miss Zhu.

138
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,790
Senior Xiaoyue, do you know how to draw the bow?

139
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,450
Louder. Hurry.

140
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,550
You're amazing. Miss Zhu.

141
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,200
Mr. Xiao.

142
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,620
I don't know how to draw the bow.

143
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,830
Here's your chance. Go.

144
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,430
Come on.

145
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,560
Hold the bow with your left hand.

146
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,440
The right hand.

147
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,690
Show your thumb.

148
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,409
Put the arrow on the thumb.

149
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,010
Yes.

150
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:39,620
Come on.

151
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,000
-Hold the bow with your left hand.
-Hold it...

152
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,700
Three, two, one.

153
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,510
Release.

154
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,720
You hit the target?

155
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,510
You hit the target!

156
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:47,890
Mr. Xiao...

157
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,680
Mr. Xiao, you hit the target.

158
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,940
Yueniang.

159
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,240
I finally hit the target.

160
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,190
Well...

161
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,980
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,270
I'll hit the target for you.

163
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,510
You're right.

164
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,420
Mr. Zhou really likes unique girls.

165
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,810
Then we...

166
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,860
Why don't we take the opportunity

167
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,950
to help me leave a deeper impression on him?

168
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,950
How?

169
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,890
Everyone. Everyone.

170
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,580
I heard that Mr. Xiao is good at horseback archery.

171
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,140
Why don't we have a competition?

172
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,280
Since you're in such a good mood,

173
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,380
I accept your challenge.

174
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,100
You two shoot arrows towards the center from opposite sides of the shooting range.

175
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,360
Each of you will have five arrows.

176
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,270
Regarding the target in the middle,

177
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,260
let's see who is faster.

178
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,930
Ride your horse to the middle. Whoever hits the target can score a point.

179
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,670
Mr. Xiao.

180
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,800
The target number will be counted by Zhou Ji.

181
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,970
The one who hits more targets will be the winner.

182
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,630
See?

183
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,150
Mr. Zhou is paying all his attention to you.

184
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,390
Do your best.

185
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,590
Be careful not to embarrass yourself.

186
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,180
It's just a competition.

187
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,150
Why is Mr. Xiao talking so much

188
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,570
to Yueniang?

189
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,690
Miss Zhu.

190
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,880
Yueniang.

191
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,120
Yueniang.

192
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,270
Miss Zhu.

193
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,620
Come on, Miss Zhu. Hurry.

194
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,050
Miss Zhu.

195
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,050
Give me your hand!

196
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,040
Give me your hand. Hurry.

197
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,590
Come on.

198
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,150
Come on.

199
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,830
It's okay.

200
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,120
It's okay.

201
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,900
You are okay.

202
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:42,490
Miss...

203
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,540
Are you crying?

204
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,360
Well.

205
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,000
Don't cry.

206
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,050
You are okay now.

207
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,080
I'm not afraid when you are fierce usually.

208
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,180
But now

209
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,610
you are crying so hard.

210
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,040
I...

211
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,070
If the teacher sees us, there will be another misunderstanding.

212
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,770
You're a daughter of the Song family.

213
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,710
This will damage your reputation.

214
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,520
Or later, if Mr. Zhou...

215
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,590
What if Mr. Zhou sees us?

216
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,670
Then why did you hug me?

217
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,970
You're a rascal.

218
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,780
Why...

219
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,990
Why is it...

220
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,950
Why is it so hard to be a woman of the Song family?

221
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,380
Why is it so hard to be a woman?

222
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,800
It's too hard for me.

223
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:24,610
Come.

224
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:43,930
Come.

225
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,900
No one is here.

226
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,450
No one will disturb us.

227
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,510
You can beat and scold me,

228
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,490
cry,

229
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,410
and be unreasonable as much as you want.

230
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,340
Anyway,

231
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,760
I won't stop you.

232
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,100
Just cry.

233
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,310
If you don't want to cry,

234
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:05,740
you...

235
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,170
you can scold me.

236
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:07,930
Scold me.

237
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,320
Hurry.

238
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,310
Otherwise, you won't have a chance

239
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,060
when they are here.

240
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:11,810
Hurry.

241
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,550
Hurry.

242
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,780
Hurry.

243
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,940
Louder.

244
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,340
Come on.

245
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,460
Three, two, one.

246
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,500
How come

247
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,840
I don't want to cry?

248
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,000
Should I

249
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,270
put you on the horseback and let you fall again?

250
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,590
How dare you mention it?

251
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,160
Are you feeling better?

252
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,970
Much better.

253
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,690
Thank you.

254
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,910
Don't look at me like that.

255
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,880
You

256
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,810
should be nice to me in the future.

257
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,380
Be nice to me.

258
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,160
Don't cause me trouble.

259
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,710
Then what I did will be worthwhile.

260
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,790
How dare you say that?

261
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,470
You always provoked me first.

262
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,430
I...

263
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,870
Am I wrong?

264
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,410
You always provoked me first.

265
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,410
You tortured me a lot too.

266
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:27,570
You...

267
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,360
How dare you!

268
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,790
Fine.

269
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,400
It's all my fault.

270
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,490
I was wrong.

271
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,500
-Why is it so hard
-What?

272
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,920
-to be a man of the Xiao family?
-You...

273
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,470
Xiao Yu.

274
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,670
-Why is it so hard to be a man?
-How dare you!

275
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,310
Why is it so hard?

276
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,100
Say it again!

277
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,390
Why is it so hard?

278
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,060
Imitate me again!

279
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,150
It's all because of

280
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,970
your family's irresponsible engagement.

281
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,780
Otherwise, this wouldn't have happened.

282
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,440
Do you think

283
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,260
we can be friends

284
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,710
if the engagement doesn't exist?

285
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,040
Look at you.

286
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,930
What you said is disappointing.

287
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,090
Even your belly can't stand it.

288
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,800
How dare you say that?

289
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,520
It's all your fault.

290
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,050
I didn't even have lunch.

291
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,860
Then,

292
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,400
what do you want to eat now?

293
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,490
I want peach mustard pastries,

294
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,460
fragrant lotus, Yunying noodles, roast pork noodles,

295
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,550
bean soup, white plum soup,

296
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,940
-mutton buns,
-Okay. Enough.

297
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,920
and lotus cakes.

298
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,420
Stop.

299
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,109
If you keep saying,

300
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,980
I'll have to buy everything in Yiyang for you.

301
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,710
Let's go.

302
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,750
I'll take you home.

303
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,119
Listen to me.

304
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,430
Go to the infirmary and rest first.

305
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,180
Let the doctor see if you're hurt.

306
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,190
I'll buy you some peach mustard pastries.

307
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:22,550
Really?

308
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,540
Don't lie to me.

309
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,069
Forget it if you don't believe me.

310
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,210
I believe you.

311
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,190
Buy as much as you can.

312
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,490
My favorite is peach mustard pastries.

313
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,530
And

314
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,610
what I just said...

315
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,280
Are we still friends?

316
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,980
If you think we are,

317
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,260
we are.

318
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,480
Let's go.

319
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,220
I told you the infirmary is in that direction.

320
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,770
Don't you have a sense of direction?

321
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,690
Who said that?

322
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,380
I just want to take a look over there.

323
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,300
I've been in the academy for so long.

324
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,530
I don't know what it looks like over there.

325
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,080
Is there a problem?

326
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,680
I think you have no sense of direction.

327
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,440
Shut up.

328
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,990
If you keep talking...

329
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,010
If you keep talking, you won't have peach mustard pastries.

330
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,820
If I can be saved by Mr. Xiao,

331
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,620
it'll be worth it even if I have to get on the horse.

332
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,910
Why was it not me who got hurt?

333
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,120
Don't say that.

334
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,390
No matter how much you like someone,

335
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,390
you can't joke about your own safety.

336
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,780
Qinruo.

337
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,950
I have to explain to you.

338
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,680
Your Teaching Assistant Xiao

339
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,570
did everything out of kindness,

340
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,630
not just because of me.

341
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,610
So don't misunderstand.

342
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,260
But that's not what you said about Mr. Xiao before.

343
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,210
Now you are speaking well of him.

344
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,270
If you don't tell me the truth,

345
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,610
I'll think too much again.

346
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,580
How should I tell you?

347
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,830
Qinruo, come here.

348
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,370
How is that possible?

349
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,710
Mr. Xiao...

350
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,000
Nonsense!

351
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,070
I promised him to keep it a secret.

352
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,590
I have no choice

353
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,440
but to tell you.

354
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,160
Promise me not to tell anyone.

355
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,690
You are not lying?

356
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,710
Think about it.

357
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,710
If there is really something

358
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,070
between me and your Teaching Assistant Xiao,

359
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,120
why would I bother to lie to you?

360
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,940
Just because he has feelings for you,

361
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,650
I don't want you to misunderstand him.

362
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,610
Fine.

363
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,460
Did he really say that?

364
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,550
Yes.

365
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,000
Why can't I feel it?

366
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,400
Junior Zhou is here.

367
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,830
He said he came to see Miss Zhu.

368
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,370
Yueniang.

369
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,940
Miss Zhu, are you alright?

370
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,540
I'm fine.

371
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,440
-Be careful.
-Does it hurt?

372
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,950
No, no, no.

373
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,800
No.

374
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,970
Senior Song.

375
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,110
I'm Junior Zhou Ji. Can I come in?

376
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,280
Please come in.

377
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,030
Shush.

378
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,460
Greetings. Seniors.

379
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,310
Why are you here?

380
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,620
I heard that you were injured while practicing horseback archery.

381
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,390
I brought some medicine.

382
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,470
I hope it can help you.

383
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,310
Of course.

384
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,910
Senior. How are you feeling now?

385
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,890
Don't worry.

386
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,360
It's just a minor injury.

387
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,930
Thank you.

388
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,260
That's good.

389
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,850
I'm just worried that if you have more wounds,

390
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,140
it'll be more serious.

391
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,920
Junior Zhou cares about her so much.

392
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,590
Not at all.

393
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,220
Yes.

394
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,300
Actually, I think Junior Zhou's medicine

395
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,440
is very effective.

396
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,350
Since Junior Zhou

397
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,910
specially came to see Yueniang,

398
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,830
why don't you apply the medicine for her?

399
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,430
Well...

400
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,720
I don't think it's appropriate.

401
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,310
Come here.

402
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,390
Right.

403
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,580
Nothing is inappropriate.

404
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,510
No one else is here.

405
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,860
Besides,

406
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,500
you are a man. Why are you dillydallying?

407
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,540
-Junior Zhou.
-Well…

408
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,220
Come here.

409
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,130
Yueniang, put your foot here.

410
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,820
What... What are we doing?

411
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,790
How can we apply the medicine if you don't remove the bandage?

412
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,460
Hurry up.

413
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,560
Qinruo.

414
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,270
I remember that you and Miss Zhao

415
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,590
are going to the teachers' room, right?

416
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,770
Why are you still here?

417
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,100
It'll be too late if you don't go now.

418
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,860
Yueniang, you hurt your foot, right?

419
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,120
Why are your eyes twitching?

420
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,730
That's right.

421
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,690
Lady Yan.

422
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,590
Aren't we going to the teachers' room?

423
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,650
Yes.

424
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,190
Go.

425
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,440
You don't want to go?

426
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,890
Yes.

427
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,830
The teachers' room.

428
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,670
I forgot.

429
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,340
The teachers' room.

430
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:01,940
Go now. Go.

431
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,390
-I'm leaving.
-We're going to the teachers' room.

432
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,350
Junior Zhou.

433
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,430
Yes.

434
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,530
Thank you.

435
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,220
Senior.

436
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,920
This medicine...

437
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:34,960
[Lyu Fu Shop]

438
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,260
Junior.

439
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,290
Is this medicine for me?

440
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,470
This medicine is made of

441
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,830
radix paeoniae alba, red peony root, frankincense, safflower carthamus, and poria cocos.

442
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,020
I believe it will be helpful.

443
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,020
Do you know how many people were there buying peach mustard pastries...

444
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,370
Mr. Xiao.

445
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,750
Since you bought peach mustard pastries for Senior,

446
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,260
Senior, you should eat.

447
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,700
I won't disturb you.

448
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,430
Don't.

449
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,030
Mr. Zhou.

450
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,550
I didn't specially come to see Miss Zhu.

451
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,660
I just know she seems to be injured.

452
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,120
So I bought something for her.

453
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,070
It's okay.

454
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:36,870
You guys talk.

455
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,600
I'm leaving.

456
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,730
Mr. Xiao, wait.

457
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,280
I also heard that Senior was hurt,

458
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,880
so I came here to give her some medicine.

459
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,760
Us.

460
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,870
Why do I feel that I'm a bit abrupt?

461
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,980
It's okay. You guys talk.

462
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,060
No, no, no.

463
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,570
Mr. Xiao.

464
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,490
You... You are not abrupt.

465
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,820
Since I've delivered the medicine,

466
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,220
I should leave now.

467
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,510
No.

468
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,700
-Junior Zhou.
-Be careful, Senior.

469
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,360
Are you okay?

470
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,330
I'm fine.

471
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,420
Move. Move.

472
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,850
Junior... Junior Zhou.

473
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,110
Well.

474
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,690
You brought me medicine

475
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,060
and chatted with me.

476
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,500
Now you are leaving suddenly.

477
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,070
This...

478
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:24,860
Well.

479
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,620
Teaching Assistant Xiao bought peach mustard pastries.

480
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,770
This is delicious.

481
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,010
Why don't you taste some before you leave?

482
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,220
You helped me a lot.

483
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,270
If you don't taste some,

484
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,750
I'll feel guilty.

485
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,100
Sit down.

486
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,660
-Have some.
-Senior, I…

487
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,060
No.

488
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,510
Come, sit down.

489
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,580
Senior, no.

490
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,740
I'm not very hungry.

491
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,590
Have a taste.

492
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,230
It's delicious.

493
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,220
You are not hungry, Mr. Zhou?

494
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:45,940
It's normal.

495
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,220
Kindness is as refreshing as drinking water.

496
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,280
Mr. Xiao. I'm afraid you've misunderstood.

497
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,570
There is nothing

498
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,000
between me and Senior Song.

499
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,870
Nothing?

500
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,860
It's fine. I was just kidding.

501
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,840
Don't take it seriously, Mr. Zhou.

502
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:00,470
Don't take it seriously.

503
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,990
Junior Zhou, eat.

504
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,820
Thank you.

505
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,250
Is this the same Miss Zhu who drank a lot of wine?

506
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:19,760
Leave.

507
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,660
Mr. Zhou.

508
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,950
Mr. Zhou.

509
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,070
I finally found you.

510
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,420
Mr. Zhang has been looking for you.

511
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,690
He wants to discuss an essay with you.

512
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,970
Hurry up.

513
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,440
In this case,

514
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,910
Senior, I'll take my leave.

515
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,260
Take care.

516
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:40,950
Zhou...

517
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,580
-We're leaving.
-Okay.

518
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,180
Junior Zhou.

519
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,190
Eat some before you leave.

520
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,100
Xiao Yu.

521
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,600
What?

522
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,090
You ruined my plan again.

523
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,300
And you are pretending.

524
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,470
Tell me, how did I ruin your plan?

525
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,240
I was kind enough to buy you pastries.

526
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,510
But you said I ruined your plan?

527
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,740
Fine. Just give it to me if you don't want to eat it.

528
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,600
No, I want to eat it.

529
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,260
This is mine.

530
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,620
You really have two faces.

531
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,890
You're a different person

532
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,150
in front of Mr. Zhou.

533
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,590
Stay out of my business.

534
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,150
I don't want to.

535
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,820
Give it to me.

536
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,360
It's mine.

537
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:25,830
This is mine.

538
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,300
Give it to me.

539
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:26,670
It's mine.

540
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,340
-Give it to me.
-It's mine.

541
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,350
It's mine.

542
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,130
It's mine.

543
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,970
Give it to me.

544
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,350
Okay.

545
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,480
It's all yours.

546
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,670
No one will take it from you.

547
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,510
Look at you. It's all over your mouth.

548
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,810
It's mine now.

549
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,070
You thief!

550
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,020
I'm going to kick you to death.

551
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,550
I'm...

552
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,990
It hurts.

553
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,180
It hurts.

554
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,140
-Enough.
-It hurts.

555
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,810
Stop pretending.

556
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,160
It hurts.

557
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,040
It hurts.

558
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,480
It really hurts.

559
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,930
Do you want to die, Xiao Yu?

560
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,630
Be gentle.

561
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:30,920
What are you doing?

562
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,960
I can't leave you alone since I hurt you.

563
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:34,970
I don't need you to take care of me.

564
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,180
Just don't cause me trouble.

565
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,550
Is this the medicine Mr. Zhou brought you?

566
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,380
What are you doing?

567
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,660
I'm applying the medicine for you.

568
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:49,720
No need.

569
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,320
Give it to me. I can do it myself.

570
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,120
I...

571
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,330
What?

572
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,940
Do you want to watch me apply the medicine?

573
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,150
Give it to me.

574
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,300
Okay, do it yourself.

575
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,820
I'm leaving.

576
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,730
Xiao Yu!

577
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,830
Be careful.

578
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,270
Mother.

579
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,830
-What happened? Why did you fall?
-I'm back.

580
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,970
No.

581
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,750
Sit down.

582
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,620
In the archery class this afternoon,

583
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,240
I rode a horse.

584
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,430
I accidentally...

585
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,180
Did you go to the doctor?

586
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,550
Did you hurt your bones?

587
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,080
Mother, don't worry.

588
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,010
She has visited the doctor.

589
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,110
Just some bruises and scratches.

590
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,900
Apply some ointment and she'll be fine.

591
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,620
She didn't hurt her bones.

592
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,870
You are

593
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,610
always careless.

594
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,110
Have a good rest.

595
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,310
Go back to sleep after dinner.

596
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,700
Take care of her.

597
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,000
Thank you. Mother.

598
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
All right.

599
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,040
Sister. Thank you for taking me back.

600
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,950
Don't

601
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,610
do such dangerous things again.

602
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,630
Mother and I are worried about you.

603
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,080
I know.

604
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,430
It was just an accident today.

605
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,860
I'll be more careful in the future.

606
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,450
Father.

607
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:15,930
Father.

608
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,340
I was reckless today.

609
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,140
I'm sorry.

610
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,610
I dare not do it again.

611
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,370
As long as you are fine.

612
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,080
Go back to your room to rest after dinner.

613
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,130
If there is anything you want to do in the future,

614
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,090
tell your sister.

615
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,930
And...

616
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,140
Nothing.

617
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,410
Go back to your room and rest.

618
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,280
What's wrong with Dad today?

619
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,490
I can't believe he didn't scold me.

620
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,190
He usually is strict with you.

621
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,980
Today, he suddenly became gentle.

622
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,250
You're not used to it, are you?

623
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,110
Yes.

624
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,990
You won't feel like this

625
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,800
if you make fewer mistakes.

626
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,580
Yes.

627
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,430
Sister, where are you going?

628
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,690
You need to take me to eat.

629
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,300
Honey. Do you have something on your mind today?

630
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,810
What do you think of Xiao Yu?

631
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,810
He's smart.

632
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,040
Although he caused some trouble,

633
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,170
he's still a good kid.

634
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,770
I heard that in the archery class today,

635
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,820
Xiao Yu saved Yueniang.

636
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,510
Really?

637
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,430
Since Xiao Yu came to the academy,

638
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,420
I haven't written a letter to Chuanzhong.

639
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,670
I think they seem to have feelings for each other.

640
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,710
Besides, not long ago, Mr. Zhang told me

641
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,550
they studied late into the night in the library

642
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,350
and got along well.

643
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,780
So you mean...

644
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,100
I want to contact Chuanzhong

645
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,310
to see when he's free,

646
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,540
so that we can choose a specific date during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

647
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,800
And we can sit together

648
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,140
and talk about their wedding.

649
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,030
That's good.

650
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,620
Honey. Have some tea.

651
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,070
Oh right.

652
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,580
Prepare more food

653
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,380
that Yueniang likes

654
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,820
to comfort her in the next several days.

655
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,820
I'm going to prepare it now.

656
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,490
Okay.

657
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,390
Judging from how you are walking,

658
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,780
I think you haven't recovered, right?

659
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,770
Did Mr. Song punish you again yesterday?

660
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,430
Sorry to disappoint you.

661
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,590
After I went back yesterday,

662
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,910
my father didn't punish me.

663
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,010
Instead, he was very worried about me.

664
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,080
Right.

665
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,030
He even asked my mother to make delicious food for me.

666
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,690
Let's talk about you.

667
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,700
Why didn't you keep quarreling with me before you left yesterday?

668
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,080
You left in a hurry, and it was not your style.

669
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,630
I'm kind.

670
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,470
I don't want to argue with a disabled person.

671
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,660
But why haven't you recovered yet?

672
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,870
I personally took care of you yesterday.

673
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,860
I thought you would recover immediately.

674
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,560
Stop it.

675
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,350
Yesterday, I thought you would say something pleasant.

676
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,660
But today, I think you're still so annoying.

677
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,760
I'll take the first sentence

678
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,980
as a compliment.

679
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,240
Shameless!

680
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,020
This way. This way.

681
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,940
I'm not playing.

682
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:56,840
Throw it here.

683
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:57,940
This way.

684
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,510
Come here.

685
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,550
I quit.

686
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,210
I quit.

687
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,320
Throw it here.

688
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,500
This is interesting.

689
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,680
Here.

690
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,440
I said I quit.

691
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,430
It hurts!

692
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,620
Yan Qinruo.

693
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,340
Go get my beanbag back.

694
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,200
When I threw it at you,

695
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,270
you could have dodged, right?

696
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,550
You were obviously picking on me.

697
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,390
Forget it.

698
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,300
If you yell at me again,

699
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,510
I'll ask my father to punish you.

700
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,620
What do you mean?

701
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,230
Get my beanbag back.

702
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:21,780
What's going on?

703
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,670
What's wrong with her?

704
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,550
What's wrong?

705
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,050
Yueniang.

706
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,990
Look.

707
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,670
She hurt me.

708
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,570
It's okay.

709
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,850
Stop crying.

710
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,380
I'm going to get your beanbag back.

711
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:33,980
Don't go.

712
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,350
It's okay.

713
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,210
You haven't recovered yet.

714
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,490
And you are here acting tough.

715
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,970
If neither of us goes,

716
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,850
what should we do?

717
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,250
How about quarreling with her?

718
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,030
We can just quit from Women's Academy.

719
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,110
Yueniang.

720
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,520
Alright.

721
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,410
I won't play with them anymore.

722
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,370
I won't play with them anymore.

723
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,350
They bully me every day.

724
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,389
This

725
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,520
is yours, right?

726
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,010
Don't lose it again.

727
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:29,940
Otherwise, you may not be able to find it again.

728
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:32,980
Thank you.

729
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,070
Right?

730
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,780
I didn't lie to you, did I?

731
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,220
But Yueniang,

732
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,190
why wouldn't Mr. Xiao

733
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,360
talk to me more?

734
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,190
Teaching Assistant Xiao

735
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,550
told me he is keen on saving face.

736
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,470
So he doesn't have the courage

737
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,260
to take the initiative to talk to you.

738
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,750
Yueniang, do you have a way

739
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,150
to let me have more contact with Mr. Xiao?

740
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,830
Or to let him take the initiative

741
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,060
to have more contact with me?

742
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,340
Fine.

743
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,340
I have an idea.

744
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:29,980
Just wait.

745
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,150
Yueniang.

746
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,160
You can't tell him

747
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,190
I asked you to do this.

748
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,240
I want to save face too.

749
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,870
I know.

750
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,460
Wait for my good news.

751
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:48,890
Let me help you.

752
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,960
You must have other purposes.

753
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:50,840
What?

754
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,340
I saw you talking with Qinruo just now.

755
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,460
What do you think?

756
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,070
What do you mean?

757
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,530
You know what I mean.

758
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,360
You stood so close to Qinruo.

759
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,190
Is she beautiful?

760
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,940
Yes.

761
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,090
Look at you.

762
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,870
You caused a lot of trouble

763
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,160
in things involving Mr. Zhou,

764
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,540
but you helped me anyway.

765
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,810
Today,

766
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,290
I'll repay you.

767
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:22,920
What do you think?

768
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,770
Let me help you.

769
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,130
How?

770
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,430
The exam is in two days, right?

771
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,270
Qinruo said she hasn't done her homework yet.

772
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,650
As the teaching assistant,

773
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,170
can you tutor her?

774
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,140
Well.

775
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,820
I don't think it's a good idea to let us be alone.

776
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:43,860
What?

777
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,770
I didn't know Mr. Xiao would be shy

778
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,230
because you usually are shameless.

779
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,790
How about this?

780
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,710
Ask Mr. Zhou out for me too.

781
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,670
Mr. Zhou left in a hurry yesterday.

782
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,900
I haven't had a chance to thank him.

783
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,380
Help me ask him out, and we can have class together.

784
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,900
And you won't feel awkward.

785
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,630
What do you think?

786
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,840
So you have your own purpose.

787
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,460
Is it really for studying?

788
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,910
Xiao Yu.

789
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,910
Mr. Xiao.

790
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,710
Just tell me if you'll help me or not.

791
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,820
Okay. I'll help you.

792
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,820
But I'll only ask him out for you.

793
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,500
It's none of my business if he will go or not.

794
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,840
Don't.

795
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,490
Please make sure he'll go.

796
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,460
If I help you,

797
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,420
can I not go?

798
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,260
No.

799
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,620
Mr. Zhou is introverted.

800
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,550
You know that.

801
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,190
If I ask him out,

802
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,270
he will definitely refuse me.

803
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,880
You have to go,

804
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,320
so that he won't refuse.

805
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,930
Xiao Yu.

806
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,470
Don't forget

807
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,940
we made a deal.

808
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,770
The deal is not about this.

809
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,380
I don't care.

810
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:03,530
You have to help me.

811
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,140
Please.

812
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,020
If you help me, I promise I'll repay you.

813
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,490
Xiao Yu.

814
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,910
Mr. Xiao.

815
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,250
Okay. I'll take that as a yes.

816
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,750
See you at the gate of the academy this afternoon.

817
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,480
Goodbye.

818
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,440
Yueniang, what's wrong?

819
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,590
It's done.

820
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,810
Really?

821
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:04,820
Yes.

822
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:05,570
Shush.

823
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,370
Listen.

824
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,220
I made an appointment for you.

825
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,230
Mr. Xiao will help you review this afternoon.

826
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,900
Yueniang.

827
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,610
No matter what you want to eat or drink,

828
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,390
just tell me.

829
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,480
I'll buy them for you, okay?

830
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,270
Qinruo,

831
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,590
if without Mr. Xiao,

832
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,310
would you still be so nice to me?

833
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,550
Of course.

834
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,850
Good for you.

835
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,030
You naughty girl.

836
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,330
How dare you tease me?

837
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,100
You teased me.

838
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,340
Fine, I won't tease you.

839
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,150
Smile. Smile.

840
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,110
I can't.

841
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:40,860
It's embarrassing.

842
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,220
He's looking at you.

843
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,410
Lady Yan, you look so beautiful today.

844
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,370
Looks like you learned a lot in the makeup class.

845
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,270
It's...

846
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,730
It's because Mr. Xiao taught me well.

847
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,050
If you can keep teaching me in person,

848
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,320
I will study harder.

849
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,590
It's my honor

850
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,010
to talk about knowledge problems with seniors.

851
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:15,910
Junior Zhou.

852
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,050
Let's go take a look at that.

853
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,790
Hurry. Come on.

854
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,780
I'm wondering

855
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,330
how much Miss Zhu has learned in the class.

856
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,090
Judging from how you dress today,

857
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,430
I think you need to pay more attention in the class.

858
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,280
That's enough.

859
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,340
You two are too quiet.

860
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,540
I'm livening up the atmosphere for you.

861
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,020
Just shut up.

862
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,380
I think today, Senior Song

863
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,140
is as elegant and beautiful as usual.

864
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,240
Mr. Xiao,

865
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,490
you are too strict.

866
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,920
Junior Zhou. Thank you for your compliment.

867
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,400
Yes, Mr. Xiao.

868
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,030
Don't criticize Yueniang.

869
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,340
She has never been interested

870
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,570
in these things.

871
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,480
That's right.

872
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,380
Go enjoy flowers with Miss Yan.

873
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,380
Mr. Xiao is indeed knowledgeable.

874
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,370
You deserve to be a teaching assistant.

875
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,240
I'm flattered.

876
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,550
Right. Junior Zhou.

877
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,610
I didn't have a chance to thank you yesterday.

878
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,910
I'm much better

879
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,170
after applying the medicine you gave me.

880
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,610
And the swelling has subsided.

881
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,560
It's nothing.

882
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,550
We are the students of the academy. We should help each other.

883
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,220
It's my duty.

884
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,610
Senior, I'm glad you're fine.

885
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,840
Junio Zhou.

886
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,100
You always call me "Senior".

887
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,080
Don't you think it's too polite?

888
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,500
Well.

889
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,010
Qinruo calls me Yueniang.

890
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,210
And Teaching Assistant Xiao calls me Miss Zhu.

891
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:15,040
How about calling me Miss Zhu from now on?

892
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,160
Okay?

893
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,190
Yes.

894
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,280
"Miss Zhu" sounds very nice.

895
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,700
"Senior" sounds so distant.

896
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,250
What do you think, Teaching Assistant Xiao?

897
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,050
Why are you looking at me?
