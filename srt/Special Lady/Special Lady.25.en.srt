[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,789
[Episode 25]

4
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,759
I'm Song Zhu.

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,120
Greetings, Your Grace.

6
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,930
Song Zhu?

7
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,979
This name sounds familiar.

8
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,180
Your Grace,

9
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,110
Song Ling, the eldest daughter of Mr. Song from Yi Yang,

10
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,180
has a sister called Song Zhu.

11
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,960
Really?

12
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,310
Yes.

13
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,259
I am the third daughter of the Song Family.

14
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,430
Come on.

15
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,140
Help me put on that bracelet.

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,510
I'm not asking you to do this.

17
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,340
Her Grace is asking you to do that.

18
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,660
Me?

19
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,010
Yes.

20
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,900
You do look pretty.

21
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,130
You may stand up, too.

22
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,970
Thank you, Your Grace.

23
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,760
Just tell me

24
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,690
why you helped that thief.

25
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,800
I was thinking that

26
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,330
maybe the person who accidentally picked up the item

27
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,100
saw that it was quite valuable, so she wanted to possess it

28
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,450
and tried to hide the truth.

29
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,500
But maybe

30
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,950
there was another possibility.

31
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,070
Your Grace, please think about it.

32
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,950
The person who picked up the bracelet accidentally

33
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,740
might want to return it to the owner who had lost it.

34
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,190
But the banquet had just started,

35
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,630
and before she had time to ask

36
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,600
who the owner of this bracelet was,

37
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,270
the officers of the government came.

38
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,060
Besides, the officers made such a big fuss.

39
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,600
Maybe she was afraid that the government might not investigate this case thoroughly

40
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,940
and then arrested her without a reason.

41
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,980
So,

42
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,310
she took the risk

43
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,070
in order to protect herself.

44
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,390
In that case,

45
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,660
why should we blame her?

46
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,470
This girl is benevolent and kind-hearted.

47
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,590
She could even think of the way of this wooden box.

48
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,270
It was a win-win situation.

49
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,420
The child raised by Song Xu

50
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,210
is really kind and elegant.

51
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,910
Thank you for your compliment.

52
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,720
I'm flattered.

53
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,510
Your Grace.

54
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,870
Please forgive me for my imprudence just now.

55
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,470
You're such a lovely girl and I like you very much.

56
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,870
How could I blame you?

57
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,000
Song Zhu.

58
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:36,110
You made a contribution this time.

59
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,630
Being rewarded for contributions is the rule.

60
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,630
Just tell me what rewards you want to get.

61
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,670
I don't dare to ask for any rewards.

62
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,750
Your Grace, I'm quite happy that you could let me

63
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,710
atone for my faults by good deeds.

64
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,790
Besides, it’s my great honor to have helped you

65
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,820
find the bracelet.

66
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,270
Look.

67
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,030
This gilr is very eloquent.

68
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,670
Your contributions outweigh your faults.

69
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,310
You should still be rewarded.

70
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,070
Since you don't want anything,

71
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,190
and I've got the bracelet back after losing it,

72
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,830
I'll give this bracelet

73
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,810
to you.

74
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,030
Although it’s not as valuable as those several bolts of ribbing silk fabrics which belong to your sister,

75
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,620
just regard it as a memento.

76
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,230
Thank you.

77
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,330
Thanks for your reward, Your Grace.

78
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:49,870
I'd like to kowtow to you and thank you, Your Grace.

79
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,670
[Duke Yue's Mansion]

80
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,190
All the records are 1,000 taels.

81
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,670
It's so neat and orderly.

82
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,310
Where is the draft?

83
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,310
I heard something over there just now.

84
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,390
Hurry up. I told you, but you don't believe me.

85
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,350
I don't think there was any sound.

86
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,790
I'm sure there was a sound. Let's look for it.

87
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,830
I'm sure I heard it right.

88
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,500
Let's go! Stop!

89
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,340
Stop! Don't run!

90
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:49,490
Stop!

91
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,210
Who are you?

92
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,340
I'm talking about you! Stop!

93
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,240
It's okay.

94
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,530
-It's late at night. Why did you yell?
-My Lady.

95
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,690
There's a suspicious person over there.

96
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,150
Let's go.

97
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,810
Let's go.

98
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,050
Junior Zhou. Feiniang.

99
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,470
Miss Yan.

100
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,270
They are Mr. Zhou and Miss Fei

101
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,410
from the Yiyang Academy.

102
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,910
Why did you yell here?

103
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,890
You may leave.

104
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,300
Yes.

105
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,530
You're still up at this hour?

106
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,790
To be honest,

107
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,970
since I entered Yiyang Academy,

108
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,490
I've never gone back home.

109
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,110
So,

110
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,350
I miss my mother very much.

111
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,179
I came back to Luoyang today.

112
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,940
I wanted to go home with Feiniang to see my mother.

113
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,600
I forgot that.

114
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,480
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,750
I forgot that your hometown is Luoyang.

116
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,270
Your mother was seriously ill a few days ago.

117
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,630
I think you must miss her more.

118
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,140
I was careless.

119
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,030
How about this?

120
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,340
I'll ask someone to send you and Feininag over there now.

121
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,360
No need.

122
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,710
We can go by ourselves.

123
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,040
Feiniang and I are like sisters.

124
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,590
You don't have to be so polite.

125
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,440
Coincidentally, I want to give some gifts to your mother.

126
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,430
Just take my advice on this matter.

127
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,150
Guards!

128
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,510
Prepare the gifts and the carriage.

129
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,310
Yes!

130
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,350
-Thank you, Senior Yan.
-Thank you, Miss Yan.

131
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,060
You're welcome.

132
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,380
I forgot my way back to my room

133
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,060
because of the chaos caused by those two servants.

134
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,890
My gosh.

135
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,230
I finally found it.

136
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,570
Who is it?

137
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,250
Stop! Stop!

138
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,360
Xiao Yu!

139
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,890
Zhu.

140
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,270
Why are you in my room in the middle of the night?

141
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,810
It's your room?

142
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,580
I went the wrong way.

143
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,810
Stop!

144
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,530
Zhu, what are you doing?

145
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,110
You look like a thief.

146
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,730
Are you trying to steal something?

147
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,830
What are you talking about?

148
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,840
You know me well, don't you?

149
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,030
I don't know the way.

150
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,710
You don't know the way,

151
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,430
so you can enter a girl's room

152
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,790
in the middle of the night?

153
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,360
Let me tell you.

154
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,030
This is not my first time

155
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,440
seeing you being so sneaky.

156
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,690
You'd better tell me honestly

157
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,940
what your purpose is.

158
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,790
I really went to the wrong way.

159
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,990
Can you let me go?

160
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,070
No.

161
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,240
If you don't tell me, I'll shout and ask for help.

162
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,620
Guards!

163
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,470
No!

164
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,070
Let go of me!

165
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,750
-Let go of me!
-Stay quiet.

166
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,070
-Let go of me!
-Go!

167
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,410
What are you doing?

168
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,710
There are many people outside.

169
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,390
Don't dawdle. Hurry up. There are still many items.

170
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:09,910
Okay.

171
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,090
Someone came just in time. I I'll ask him to catch you.

172
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,540
Actually...

173
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,690
I'm here for you.

174
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,670
Why did you come to see me?

175
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,190
You... I... You...

176
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,500
Stay away from me.

177
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,120
I'm warning you. Don't do anything indecent.

178
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,630
I...

179
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,520
What indecent thing would I do?

180
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,310
With your posture like that, it feels as if I were a philanderer.

181
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,480
You're just a philanderer, aren't you?

182
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,110
I once told you that

183
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,280
I would flirt with anyone else, but I wouldn't flirt with you.

184
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,960
Fine. Then tell me

185
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,310
why you came here.

186
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,760
I'll tell you the truth.

187
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,910
Actually, I regard this place as a toilet.

188
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,430
-You…
-I’m leaving right now.

189
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,790
I'm leaving right now.

190
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,390
What's the matter now?

191
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,790
Well...

192
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,500
Do you know where my bedroom is?

193
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,980
Tell me at once.

194
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,770
Beg me.

195
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,890
Tell me at once.

196
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,270
Fine. I'm in a good mood today.

197
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,970
I'll tell you.

198
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,800
Over there.

199
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,730
What are you waiting for? Just go.

200
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,900
You...

201
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,320
Go back inside and put on a coat.

202
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,300
Why should I put on a coat?

203
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,070
Lead the way.

204
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,420
Why should I lead the way?

205
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,480
Stop dawdling.

206
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,110
If someone sees me here,

207
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,920
and thinks that I'm meeting you privately in the middle of the night,

208
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,760
I don't know what kind of rumor he might spread.

209
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,140
I won't lead the way.

210
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,090
You asked me to show you the way.

211
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,520
But it'll be even worse if someone sees that.

212
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,180
I won't lead the way.

213
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,910
Let's talk about this first.

214
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,190
If I go to Zhou Ji’s room later,

215
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,240
and he asks me where I came from,

216
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,150
I'll just tell him the truth.

217
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,040
You...

218
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,750
What a rascal you are.

219
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,380
I have no choice.

220
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,080
Song Zhu.

221
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,470
I'm going to get changed.

222
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,100
Hold the lantern.

223
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,020
Hurry up.

224
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,680
Don't blame me for not showing you the way if you can't catch up with me later.

225
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,260
Brother.

226
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,800
Miss Yan's brother also likes you very much, right?

227
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,270
Feiniang.

228
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,590
What do you want to say?

229
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,630
I heard him say this in front of everyone

230
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,030
at the banquet.

231
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,110
He hoped that you and Miss Yan could become a perfect couple.

232
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,140
That means his family doesn't despise our family.

233
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,510
Can't you consider it?

234
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,760
We're indebted to Miss Yan.

235
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,070
I'll try to find a way to repay her kindness.

236
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,150
Oh no!

237
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,160
Has the carriage used for delivering the silver left here?

238
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,470
Goodbye, Your Grace.

239
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,000
I told you not to come,

240
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,030
but you still came here.

241
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,610
Mother, if you go back alone,

242
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,070
I'll be worried.

243
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,830
Just let me escort you back home.

244
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,640
Then I won't be worried.

245
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,690
Alright.

246
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,210
Goodbye, Prince Fu.

247
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,790
Duke Yue, please stay.

248
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,260
I came in a hurry today.

249
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,110
I couldn't talk to you properly.

250
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,350
I believe there will be a chance in the future.

251
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,920
Okay. Then I'll refuse to see other visitors

252
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,990
and wait for you exclusively.

253
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,930
Prince.

254
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,119
Did someone flash by over there just now?

255
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,030
No.

256
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,230
Mother, you were mistaken about it.

257
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,869
Let's go back.

258
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,740
Let's go.

259
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,319
Your Grace, please.

260
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,140
Young Master!

261
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,840
You've been missing for a day and a night. I've been so worried.

262
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,950
You're still eating?

263
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,210
It's not the time to eat.

264
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,110
It's lunch time now, isn't it?

265
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:39,810
Chase them!

266
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,840
How can we chase them without a horse?

267
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,810
Use your legs.

268
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,670
Everyone,

269
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,080
I won't accept the gifts.

270
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,730
I won't accept the gifts.

271
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,470
It's just a small gift to show my respect.

272
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,480
I'll accept the invitation letter.

273
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,180
[Song Mansion]

274
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,780
Okay.

275
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,440
-Thanks, everyone. -Make way, please.

276
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,230
Thanks, everyone.

277
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,860
Come on.

278
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,470
Please extend greetings to Mr. Song for me.

279
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,310
-Who is this? -Who is this?

280
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,320
-Thanks for your help. -Okay.

281
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,830
-Okay. -Thanks.

282
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,040
Okay. Thanks, everyone.

283
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,190
Okay. Thank you.

284
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,230
-Thanks for your help. -Thanks.

285
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,310
Sir, Madam,

286
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,480
there are many gentlemen coming to our house outside.

287
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,170
They're here to meet Lady Zhu.

288
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,940
After I knew that Yueniang was going to Luoyang,

289
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,440
I thought it would be good if she didn't cause trouble.

290
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,630
I didn't expect that she would make a big contribution.

291
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,430
I heard that she was even rewarded by the Empress Dowager.

292
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,830
The Empress Dowager also praised her.

293
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,230
She praised her for being clever in appearance and beautiful in mind.

294
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,190
Dear.

295
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,650
Being beautiful in appearance and clever in mind is the correct phrase.

296
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,440
They're almost the same.

297
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,180
It's really you.

298
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,350
No wonder these legs look so familiar to me.

299
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,410
How did you come back?

300
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,340
How did I come back?

301
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,680
I had diarrhea and went to the toilet,

302
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,040
so I missed your carriage.

303
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,990
Then I hired a carriage myself to come back.

304
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,740
Why did you always go to the toilet?

305
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,360
Are you feeling unwell?

306
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,350
Do you want to see a doctor?

307
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,170
Maybe I want that now.

308
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,390
Are you caring about me?

309
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,750
Who is caring about you?

310
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,310
I'm just curious why you didn't take the carriage.

311
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,830
Without me in the carriage,

312
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,870
you must have lost a lot of fun on the way.

313
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,540
Bah!

314
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,990
Let me tell you. Without you,

315
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,010
that carriage was so spacious.

316
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,200
I have to go.

317
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,370
See you later.

318
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,180
I know why you didn't take the carriage.

319
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,200
Why?

320
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,460
You must have

321
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,690
got lost.

322
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,110
What a pity.

323
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,570
How come you could find the way in the end?

324
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
What a pity.

325
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,860
I don't know what this girl has been thinking all day long.

326
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,150
Mr. Xiao,

327
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,640
let's talk if you have time.

328
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,820
Lady Zhu, hurry up. Go back inside the house first.

329
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,920
Our dean won't see any guests today.

330
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,540
Sister!

331
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,300
Everyone!

332
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,230
Everyone.

333
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:33,990
Okay.

334
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,710
Stop pushing and shoving to get inside.

335
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,550
Everyone, calm down first.

336
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,940
Yueniang, you're back.

337
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,390
Sister. Brother.

338
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,950
Good for you, Yueniang.

339
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,310
You went to Luoyang this time,

340
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,190
and you won much honor for our family.

341
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,430
Everyone in our family knows it?

342
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,220
Yes.

343
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,670
You know what?

344
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,400
When I came back today,

345
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,390
I saw a big crowd of people at the gate.

346
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,990
They were all here to send invitation letters.

347
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,550
They wanted to invite you to be a guest at their homes.

348
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,020
The gate was blocked by them.

349
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,500
Because of that, I had to come back from the side door.

350
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,400
Don't exaggerate the details.

351
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:07,920
Yueniang.

352
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,790
There are many people coming here indeed.

353
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,230
Most of them are from noble families.

354
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,910
They are very polite.

355
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,520
Sister, no matter how many people there are, I'm not interested.

356
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,550
Yes.

357
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,770
No matter how good they are, they're not as good as Mr. Xiao, right?

358
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,550
That man has a poor sense of direction.

359
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,650
Don't mention him.

360
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,770
You two always fall out with each other.

361
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,280
After falling out, you'll make up with each other again.

362
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,010
In my opinion, Mr. Xiao is the best match for you.

363
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,330
No, we're not a good match.

364
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,610
Our parents have been waiting for you inside.

365
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,420
Let's not waste time here.

366
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,490
Yueniang, go inside at once.

367
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,020
I'll go inside first.

368
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,350
Father. Mother.

369
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,230
Yueninag, you're back.

370
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,870
I'm back.

371
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,450
Come on. Have a seat.

372
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,810
After hearing that you would come back, your father

373
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,210
specially told me to

374
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,940
prepare some delicious desserts for you.

375
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,150
Sit down and eat.

376
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,990
-Sit down.
-Thank you, Father.

377
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,160
-Sit down.
-Thank you, Mother.

378
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,380
Is it delicious?

379
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,760
Yes.

380
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,590
After Yueniang

381
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,860
came back from Luoyang, she's different now.

382
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,270
She finally eats like a lady.

383
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,590
Mother, when did I not behave like a lady?

384
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,240
Alright.

385
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,020
You're like a lady.

386
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,550
Yueniang, I heard that you had received a reward from the Empress Dowager.

387
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,130
Tell us

388
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,590
what happened.

389
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,710
Actually, it was not a big deal.

390
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,820
I was just lucky.

391
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,030
Zhou!

392
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,440
Zhou, just tell me

393
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,860
about Miss Yan's birthday banquet.

394
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,350
Only you and Mr. Xiao were invited.

395
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,050
How was it? Was it beautiful?

396
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,730
I didn't notice.

397
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,780
How could a mature man like you not notice?

398
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,980
I've heard that Luoyang is full of beautiful girls.

399
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,960
Am I right?

400
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,860
You can go there yourself when you're free.

401
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,840
Yes, Xue. Let's go.

402
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,620
Let’s go.

403
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,870
How vulgar.

404
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,180
-Look at them. -Right.

405
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,400
Mr. Li.

406
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,270
Song Zhu made a contribution in front of the Empress Dowager this time.

407
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,230
The Song Family is even more famous now.

408
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,430
In my opinion,

409
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,270
if you can marry the second daughter of the Song Family,

410
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,520
then...

411
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,470
It's called

412
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,810
gaining both the beauty and the fame.

413
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,900
Yes, Mr. Li.

414
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,330
Look.

415
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,830
Among all the students,

416
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,720
I think

417
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,710
you're the one who has the biggest chance to marry a girl from the Song Family.

418
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,500
How vulgar!

419
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,320
No, this...

420
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:51,980
Then...

421
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,170
Who else can do that? That guy surnamed Xue?

422
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,890
It's sarcasm.

423
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,070
Massage my shoulders.

424
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,680
Miss Yan.

425
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,490
Why did you bring me here?

426
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,190
Nothing.

427
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,550
I just want to thank you

428
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,230
for attending my birthday party this year.

429
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,510
It's also my honor.

430
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,430
Mr. Xiao,

431
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,420
do you have a crush on me?

432
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,510
If you have a crush on me,

433
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,990
just tell me

434
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,180
so that I won't think too much anymore.

435
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,250
Miss Yan.

436
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,640
You...

437
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,940
come from a prominent family and look very pretty.

438
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,620
You have many admirers.

439
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,990
It doesn't matter if I'm your admirer or not.

440
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,780
What do you mean, Mr. Xiao?

441
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,670
I mean

442
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,990
I treat...

443
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,680
I treat you as my friend.

444
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,350
Your friend?

445
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,150
No.

446
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,570
But Yueninag has told me that

447
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,500
you have a crush on me.

448
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,510
Song Zhu is so...

449
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,720
Did Yueniang lie to me?

450
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,350
No.

451
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,860
So you lied to her?

452
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,210
I think I was drunk that day

453
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,630
and said some nonsense.

454
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,400
I might have accidentally said your name

455
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,110
and mentioned my favorite food.

456
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,870
Then I misled her with my vague descriptions.

457
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,590
She didn't hear it wrongly, but I described it incorrectly.

458
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,680
Then it caused your misunderstanding.

459
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,390
Misunderstanding?

460
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,020
It's all a misunderstanding.

461
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,150
Miss Yan.

462
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,960
I'm sorry.

463
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,760
Miss Yan,

464
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,430
you're such a good girl.

465
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,220
You'll find your Mr. Right.

466
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,630
No matter how good I am, what's the point?

467
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,210
It's just a misunderstanding, isn't it?

468
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,730
Though I was very cautious,

469
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,770
I still made a mistake.

470
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,720
My dear friend,

471
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,470
stop crying.

472
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,260
I feel so bad for you when I see you crying.

473
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,550
Okay?

474
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,160
What's the reason?

475
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,090
My dear friend.

476
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,850
Yueniang.

477
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,310
Mr. Xiao...

478
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,400
Mr. Xiao said he didn't have a crush on me.

479
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,160
What?

480
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,560
How is that possible?

481
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,500
He told me about it himself.

482
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,030
Qinruo.

483
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,280
I didn't lie to you.

484
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,750
He told me that himself.

485
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,810
It's true. I swear.

486
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,270
He said that

487
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,500
he was drunk that night,

488
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,190
which made you misunderstand that

489
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,510
he talked about having a crush on me.

490
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,590
Yueniang, why am I such a pathetic girl?

491
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,800
You're not a pathetic girl.

492
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,190
Xiao Yu is the pathetic man.

493
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,350
Qinruo is the most beautiful girl in the entire Yiyang Academy.

494
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,070
He doesn't like you because he has no taste

495
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,350
and he isn't lucky enough.

496
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,820
Yueniang, are you telling the truth?

497
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,030
Of course.

498
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,710
Back then, I let him approach you

499
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,100
because you said that he was a good man.

500
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,000
Look.

501
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,960
He made you cry.

502
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,670
We don't need a man like him.

503
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,260
Right?

504
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,000
Stop crying.

505
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,630
Qinruo.

506
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,470
I didn't handle this matter properly.

507
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,730
I told you about it after hearing just a few words.

508
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,890
If I had listened more carefully,

509
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,230
I wouldn't have

510
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,110
made you waste your passion.

511
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,190
Yueniang, it's not your fault.

512
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,810
You knew my feelings towards him.

513
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,890
You told me about it because you wanted to make me happy.

514
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,450
But I didn't make you happy.

515
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,900
But Yueniang,

516
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,090
it's not your fault after all.

517
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,670
Besides,

518
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,120
as you said,

519
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,710
Xiao Yu has no taste.

520
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,080
Xiao Yu is not lucky enough.

521
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,870
It's not a bad thing

522
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,280
if I can stop losses in time, right?

523
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,920
Qinruo,

524
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,150
you are such a good girl.

525
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,450
We are best friends.

526
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,130
Actually,

527
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,610
it seems that

528
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,040
I'm not that sad now.

529
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,350
I think I cried just now

530
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,630
because I didn't want to accept the truth.

531
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,340
That's why I felt so bad.

532
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,070
That despicable Xiao Yu.

533
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,040
I'll teach him a lesson for you later.

534
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,350
How could he make you sad?

535
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,550
Yueniang.

536
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,070
Don't go to see him.

537
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,860
I don't want to talk to him anymore.

538
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,090
I still need some dignity.

539
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Okay.

540
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,350
I won't go to see him.

541
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,730
We'll talk about it after a period of time.

542
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,390
You look good when you smile.

543
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,590
Yueniang, you're so nice.

544
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,590
I think I cried for a very long time after I came to see you,

545
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,810
and I'm a bit hungry now.

546
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,260
Yueniang.

547
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,760
I want to eat wontons.

548
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,900
Okay. I'll cook whatever you want to eat.

549
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,230
If you want the stars in the sky,

550
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,310
I'll take them off for you.

551
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,600
Yueniang, why are you so nice?

552
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,550
I don't want to go back to the dorm tonight.

553
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,500
Can I stay here?

554
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,710
Then we can have a chat tonight.

555
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,950
Okay.

556
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,790
We have to talke in a low voice.

557
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,890
Don't let my second eldest sister find out about us.

558
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,350
Otherwise, she will kick you out.

559
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,300
Young Master.

560
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,140
You're getting more and more down-to-earth.

561
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,380
Isn't it good?

562
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,190
It's good,

563
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,670
but I'm just worried that

564
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,010
you can't get used to it after you go back.

565
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,160
Why are you not eating?

566
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,520
You think it's too greasy

567
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,230
without Green Silk Roses?

568
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,290
No.

569
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,540
How is the investigation I asked you to do?

570
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,150
The donated money

571
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,300
was sent to Meisen Academy

572
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,000
Hanbo Academy and Wenshang Academy respectively.

573
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,520
They were

574
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,410
the three academies against Yiyang Academy in the tournament, weren't they?

575
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,640
However,

576
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,830
two of the academies distributed the money

577
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,460
to the students right on that day.

578
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,350
Who are you?

579
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,130
Is Jiang Tao at home?

580
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,310
Jiang Tao? Who is Jiang Tao?

581
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,770
This is not Jiang Tao's home?

582
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,480
I don’t know Jiang Tao.

583
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,790
This is not Jiang Tao's home.

584
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,190
You've found the wrong place.

585
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,170
Buddy, let me ask you one more question.

586
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,320
Is there any student in your home?

587
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,990
You're so strange.

588
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,390
I have no children. How can I have a student here?

589
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,840
He's not here.

590
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,200
Our initial speculation

591
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,520
was probably right.

592
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,310
They used the academies to embezzle the donated money.

593
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,570
That's very likely.

594
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,120
I need to keep investigating this case

595
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,520
to see how they operated it.

596
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,469
I asked you to investigate another thing.

597
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,370
How is it going?

598
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:16,190
It's the case about Mr. Zhou, right?

599
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,889
Mr. Zhou Ji comes from a good family.

600
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,510
But he and his sister have been isolated by the others since childhood.

601
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,060
They've lived a miserable life.

602
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,699
I can't believe it.

603
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,040
Their mother is seriously ill

604
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,020
and stays at home.

605
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,830
But she's been living in the side room.

606
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,719
I went to check that room.

607
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,190
It wasn't suitable for a person to live there at all.

608
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,070
People always say that a poor family can always bring forth a talented man.

609
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,550
Mr. Zhou Ji was treated like this,

610
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,969
but he still became the top scholar in Luoyang

611
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,750
and got admitted to Yiyang Academy.

612
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,270
I think he stuided very hard.

613
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,710
What about his elder brother?

614
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,480
Mr. Zhou Ji was going to enter the Imperial College.

615
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,670
But without asking for Zhou Ji's permission, the First Madam directly

616
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,410
gave the qualification to his brother Zhou Ting.

617
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,630
Zhou Ting always bullies him,

618
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,820
and often threatens him with Zhou Ji's mother.

619
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,650
It turns out that he didn't perform well in the competition

620
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,670
because of this thing.

621
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,040
He's a pitiful man.

622
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,150
Young Master,

623
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,800
on the night I went there,

624
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,230
I happened to see him and his sister go home.

625
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,720
Hearing their conversation, I knew that

626
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,160
his mother was seriously ill,

627
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,400
and it was Miss Yan

628
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,960
who sponsored them with money previously.

629
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,620
Just take it.

630
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,060
Have I misunderstood him?

631
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,290
Young Master.

632
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,550
We shouldn't interfere in

633
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,920
others' business.

634
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,700
Currently, Yiyang Academy

635
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,420
is also on the list of donation.

636
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,860
We don't know whether Song Xu

637
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,140
is related to these things.

638
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,300
I saw Instructor Shen waiting for that carriage.

639
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,380
Uncle Hu.

640
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,890
Can you help me find a book

641
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,950
that is similar to a martial arts secret manual?

642
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,250
What?

643
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,540
Martial arts and what?

644
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,500
Secret manual.

645
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,780
Since it's a secret manual,

646
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,790
how could I get it?

647
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,310
Aren't you a master of martial arts?

648
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,190
Young Master, you gave me such a big compliment.

649
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,660
I don't think I can refuse you.

650
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,020
Let's go.

651
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,980
The teacher hasn't come yet.

652
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,570
Thank you, Miss Zhao.

653
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,940
Come to my place. You're welcome.

654
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,420
Look. It's here.

655
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,660
It's here.

656
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,100
This is not right.

657
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,940
I'll go back and check it for you next time.

658
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,220
The teacher is coming.

659
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,970
Come on. Let's go back to our seats.

660
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,620
Hurry up.

661
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,540
Come on.

662
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,750
Let's review the Book of Songs first.

663
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,150
Why isn't Xiao Yu here yet?

664
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,280
Young Master.

665
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,140
Your health has become worse,

666
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,550
since you came back from Luoyang this time.

667
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,100
What have you been doing recently?

668
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,100
Don't interrupt.

669
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,740
What were we talking about just now?

670
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,460
The secret manual.

671
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,340
Right.

672
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,250
I planned to give it to you when I came.

673
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,460
Such magical skills really exist?

674
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,430
I thought the storyteller made them up.

675
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,650
Look.

676
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,120
Actually, I drew the pictures myself.

677
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,150
You...

678
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,690
Well, will this work?

679
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,720
I've used all my painting skills on it.

680
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,710
Well, look at this.

681
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,380
Will this work?

682
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,220
I drew these pictures while I was listening to the storyteller talk about the story.

683
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,570
Young Master, we are running out of time and we have a heavy task.

684
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,170
Please make do with it.

685
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,850
What a coincidence.

686
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,170
A few days ago, when I was cleaning up my room

687
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,150
and tidying up my closet,

688
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,620
I accidentally found this book.

689
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,550
I vaguely remember that

690
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,740
a martial artist gave it to me.

691
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,980
He asked me to study it carefully.

692
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,020
A martial artist?

693
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,570
Just look at your small figure.

694
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,310
This martial artist's taste was quite unique.

695
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,810
Instructor Shen, I know you love martial arts.

696
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,590
There is a big gap between you and me.

697
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,050
So,

698
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,100
I want to study

699
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,840
this secret manual with you.

700
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,020
How come

701
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,650
this painting style is so rough?

702
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,510
Really?

703
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,960
It's an old book.

704
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,920
It's normal for martial artists to be rough.

705
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,900
No, I think that

706
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,290
there is something wrong with this book.

707
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,850
If you think it's strange,

708
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,950
I'll just study it by myself.

709
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,490
Did I say I wouldn't practice?

710
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,190
Don't you see that I'm thinking about it?

711
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,040
Young people are too impatient.

712
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,480
How about this?

713
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:57,920
Let me give it a try.

714
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,020
Come on.

715
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:00,890
Come on. Let's put it here.

716
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,140
Hold it steadily.

717
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,260
Stay away from me. Don't let me hurt you.

718
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,450
Inhale.

719
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,240
Push to the left side.

720
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,820
Push to the right side.
