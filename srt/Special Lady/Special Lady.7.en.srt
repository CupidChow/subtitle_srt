[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,650
[Episode 7]

4
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,700
I've long heard that

5
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,850
the teaching method of Yiyang Academy is unique.

6
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,759
But this is so strange.

7
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,770
In the first lesson after admission to the school,

8
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,400
they even arranged us to stay in this tea garden,

9
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,390
and we are exposed to the sun and wind.

10
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,370
That's right.

11
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,380
I've heard that even the Imperial College

12
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,340
merely gave martial arts training to new students for their enrollment.

13
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,990
Look at us.

14
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,450
We came to this tea garden to pick tea leaves.

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,270
They smell so good.

16
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,190
Isn't this a job for middle-aged women?

17
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,490
So this is how they look before they're cooked and drunk.

18
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,950
They have a pleasant smell indeed.

19
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,630
Well,

20
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,240
today, the academy arranged us to come to the tea garden to experience the work.

21
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,610
There must be a certain purpose for this.

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,660
So, don't underestimate the work today.

23
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,720
And what is a real noble man?

24
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,320
Even though you're wearing coarse cloth

25
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,460
and came to the garden to pick tea leaves,

26
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,860
it's still hard to hide the nobility on you.

27
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,400
Just like me.

28
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,570
Yes.

29
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,180
Dean.

30
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,450
-Dean is here. -Dean.

31
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,040
Hello, Dean.

32
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,260
Legend has it that Shennong tasted all kinds of herbs

33
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,800
and was attracted by their fragrance.

34
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,970
Thus, he picked the tea leaves and brewed them with water.

35
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,240
After drinking it, both his ears and eyes felt refreshed.

36
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,620
He named this tea.

37
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:14,980
Today,

38
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,140
let's be Shennong for one day.

39
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,040
-Okay. -Okay. -Okay.

40
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,850
Alright. Go ahead.

41
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:23,790
Okay.

42
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,030
-Okay. -Let's go. -Let's go.

43
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,370
The tea leaves picked around Qingming Festival are treasures.

44
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,530
The tea leaves will get old after the Beginning of Summer.

45
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,250
The tea leaves picked around the Grain Rain day are just fine.

46
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,829
Xue Hanfu.

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,320
You look rough,

48
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,370
but you know this?

49
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,430
I wonder who is the rough one actually.

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,760
Did you call me?

51
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,590
I didn't call you, Instructor Shen.

52
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,150
Let’s go.

53
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,030
I didn't call you, Instructor Shen.

54
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,370
I heard you call me.

55
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,290
Be careful not to scratch the inner leaves.

56
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,500
Which place in the mortal world is like a fairyland?

57
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,690
You will see it when you carry a basket to pick tea leaves on a mountain in spring.

58
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,130
Mr. Chen has such a keen interest

59
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,940
and is so talented in poems.

60
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,840
Slow down.

61
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,200
Be careful.

62
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,830
Are you okay?

63
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,360
Mr. Xue, I did fortune-telling this morning.

64
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,630
It indicated that I shouldn't do labor work.

65
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,640
Sure enough, I've already...

66
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,270
I've already felt dizzy.

67
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,090
Don't you feel tired?

68
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,630
I used to pick tea leaves with my father,

69
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,960
and even my feet got hurt from the rubbing.

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,290
Only till then did I realize how hard it was for those workers who picked leaves.

71
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,130
They are busy for a whole year

72
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,340
just for the harvest of one season.

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,390
Hang in there for some more time.

74
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,060
Hurry.

75
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,070
I can't hold on.

76
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,630
Hang in there for some more time.

77
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,490
I can't hold on. I can't hold on.

78
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,560
Farmers plant a seed in spring,

79
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,480
and they harvest tens of thousands of grains in autumn.

80
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,870
There is no fallow field everywhere.

81
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,190
But there are still farmers who have died of hunger.

82
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,409
I used to think that it was just a poem,

83
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,530
and it merely showed the poet's talent in literary,

84
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,150
his sympathy for farmers

85
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,220
and his understanding about farmers.

86
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,690
Only until today did I really understand that

87
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,780
the sympathy in the poem

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,510
is about the hard work of labor workers.

89
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,700
Only by experiencing the hardships of labor

90
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,730
can we truly understand the labor workers.

91
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,500
Getting the first-hand experience is better than reading thousands of books.

92
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,660
When we taste the sweetness of tea,

93
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,840
we know the hardships of planting tea.

94
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,790
Though this tea leaf is small,

95
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,570
it contains the truth.

96
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,760
In terms of people's livelihood and their sufferings,

97
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,110
only by experiencing their plights

98
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,500
can you understand the meaning of

99
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,290
"The people are the foundation of a state,

100
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,010
and only when the foundation gets stable can the state be in peace".

101
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,480
Only when the people live in peace

102
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,530
can we study intently in the academy.

103
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,030
As long as the people live in peace, the state will be peaceful.

104
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,409
Thank you for your teaching.

105
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,250
Why did you talk about the truth and his teaching?

106
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,860
In terms of tasting tea,

107
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,950
who can be more knowledgeable than me, the top master

108
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,640
in tasting tea?

109
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,230
Of course.

110
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,510
Mr. Li is right.

111
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,800
In terms of tasting tea,

112
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,480
who can compare to you?

113
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,100
Let's go.

114
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,670
Go. Go.

115
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,100
Dean.

116
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,560
I know something about the art of tea.

117
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,080
The tea leaves here are not the best in terms of their quality and appearance.

118
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,210
Later,

119
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,260
I'll ask my father to send you some better tea leaves so that you can taste them.

120
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,760
I should do my own work by myself.

121
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,430
Why are you holding the basket for me?

122
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,200
Gosh.

123
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,800
Yes, it's my fault.

124
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,970
Take your time to experience it carefully.

125
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,210
Okay.

126
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,020
Yes.

127
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,940
You're smart.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,870
I've long heard that the student who ranks first is unusual.

129
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,910
What you said today is indeed extraordinary.

130
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,340
Besides, look at this person who failed in the entrance exam.

131
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,890
He must have been appreciated due to your excellence.

132
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,210
Father, be careful.

133
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,200
Did our eldest brother went to the tea garden today?

134
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,130
Yes.

135
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,380
How are the students this year?

136
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,230
Not bad.

137
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,640
How is Zhou Ji?

138
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,760
Zhou Ji?

139
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,980
He's very good.

140
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,460
Our father also thinks highly of him.

141
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,660
Sister, thank you.

142
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,390
Brother, turn around.

143
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,150
Thanks for your hard work, Brother.

144
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,220
Please have some tea, Brother.

145
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,740
But I think

146
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,420
Xiao Yu also aspires to be outstanding.

147
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,960
Our father appreciates him more.

148
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,780
What?

149
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,330
Our father appreciates Xiao Yu?

150
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:52,870
Yes.

151
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,040
How?

152
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,790
Our father thinks highly of him and cherishes his talent.

153
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,100
Have you ever seen our father

154
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,120
do this to anyone else?

155
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,110
No, that doesn't mean anything.

156
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,450
Xiao Yu is not even a student in Song's Academy.

157
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,540
Don't worry about that.

158
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,850
With Xiao Yu's knowledge and vision,

159
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,160
I think our father should make an exception

160
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,410
to enroll him as soon as possible.

161
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,950
Even if he doesn't make an exception to enroll him,

162
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,380
in next year's entrance exam,

163
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,890
Xiao Yu will surely be admitted to Song's Academy.

164
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:24,950
Yueniang,

165
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,160
I think our father particularly

166
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,820
values your marriage.

167
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,210
He said he didn't want to be a student in Song's Academy,

168
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,980
and that he just wanted to learn from Mr. Chen.

169
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,080
Luckily, I didn't fall into his trap.

170
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,760
In my opinion,

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,900
Mr. Xiao is really a good man.

172
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,540
You'll be lucky to marry him.

173
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
Don't think about breaking off the engagement.

174
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,000
That's right.

175
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,740
Both Mr. Chen and our father think highly of him very much now.

176
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,760
I'll put in a good word in a few days

177
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,690
so that we can make an exception to enroll him.

178
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,930
No.

179
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,590
Brother, you can't do this.

180
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,650
Xiao Yu told me

181
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,890
he also wanted to break off the engagement.

182
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,780
He doesn't want to be a student of Song's Academy.

183
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,690
My silly sister,

184
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,610
if he doesn't want to marry you,

185
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,280
why did he try to show his merits in front of our father?

186
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,940
Your second eldest brother once read his articles,

187
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,110
and said that

188
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,860
Xiao Yu could be admitted to the Imperial College with his talent.

189
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,900
Why do you think he came to Song's Academy?

190
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,360
He even compromised

191
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,510
to be a teaching assistant in the girls' school.

192
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,270
In my opinion, it's all because of you.

193
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,440
It looks like what Lady Jin said

194
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,130
about the order of parents and the words of matchmakers

195
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,730
should be done immediately.

196
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,480
Brother, where is Xiao Yu now?

197
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,250
When I came back from the tea garden just now, he was still there.

198
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,110
I'm not sure where he is now.

199
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,910
It suddenly occurred to me that I forgot to take my textbook.

200
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,740
I'll go back to get it.

201
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,230
No.

202
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,320
Yueniang.

203
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,090
My... My tea.

204
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,790
Didn't you smell it enough in the tea garden today?

205
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,430
Is she targeting me now?

206
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,680
I agree with you.

207
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,840
Bastard!

208
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,620
Miss Zhu.

209
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,420
Why are you here?

210
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,340
I heard that you had made a hit today.

211
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,050
I'm here to congratulate you.

212
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,530
Thank you.

213
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,290
You're welcome.

214
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,020
Do you have other things to say?

215
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,730
Not really.

216
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,510
It's not that I don't trust you.

217
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,720
I just want to ask

218
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,210
whether the agreement between us is still valid.

219
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,880
Of course.

220
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,690
That's great.

221
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,220
Since it's valid,

222
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,090
please fulfill your promise.

223
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,690
I...

224
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,460
The agreement is still valid.

225
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,120
But Miss Zhu,

226
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,510
for this thing, I...

227
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,470
You can't do anything about this, right?

228
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,410
I know you want to say this.

229
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,110
I understand.

230
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,110
Therefore, today I came here

231
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,430
not to talk with you about breaking off the engagement.

232
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,540
I just hope that you can

233
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,330
tell your father about this,

234
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,350
and ask your father to directly suggest my father

235
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,010
to break off the engagement.

236
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,490
You just need to write a letter to your father.

237
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,910
Look.

238
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,780
You have made it clear that

239
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,800
you don't want to marry me.

240
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,160
And I've

241
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,240
also said that

242
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,760
I won't marry you.

243
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,670
Only by handing this matter to your father

244
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,400
can we solve our

245
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,800
problem easily.

246
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,060
What do you think, Mr. Xiao?

247
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,280
Are you going to refuse?

248
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,990
What did I say?

249
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,550
I knew it.

250
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,960
I knew you wanted to marry me.

251
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,210
It's all due to the fact that I'm so charming

252
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,390
and smart.

253
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,430
It's hard for you to be unwilling to marry me.

254
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,510
Well...

255
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,790
It's not that I really can't marry you.

256
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,480
When this matter is delayed for long enough,

257
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,310
then we won't have to worry anymore.

258
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,960
See you on our wedding day.

259
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,180
Bye.

260
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:30,760
Wait.

261
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,190
I'll write a letter to my father.

262
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,560
I'll prepare the brushes, ink, paper and inkstones.

263
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,970
It's not hard to write a letter to my father.

264
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,160
As long as he doesn't reply to my letter all the time, it'll be fine, right?

265
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,600
Miss Zhu

266
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,560
is so easy to fool.

267
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,120
To cooperate with a man who once tricked me,

268
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,940
how can I not prepare for two eventualities?

269
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,400
You cunning villain.

270
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,620
I'll break off the engagement with you first,

271
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,880
and then I'll kick you out of the academy.

272
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,640
That's good.

273
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,150
But my eldest brother supports him so much.

274
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,100
What should I do?

275
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,600
Yueniang.

276
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,200
Brother.

277
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,300
I'm here to bring you tea.

278
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,350
Bring me tea?

279
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,390
Will you take it away midway again this time?

280
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,650
Brother.

281
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,040
My eldest brother is so handsome and graceful.

282
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,650
You won't make your sister angry, right?

283
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,390
You're here to butter me up in the middle of the night.

284
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,350
There must be something.

285
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,000
Say it.

286
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,220
It's nothing.

287
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,080
It just suddenly occurred to me that

288
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,580
you had said that Xiao Yu couldn't do anything.

289
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,010
Is it true?

290
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:27,890
Yes.

291
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,520
In the tea garden this morning,

292
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,290
he couldn't do anything at first.

293
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,610
But his comprehension ability is quite strong,

294
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,370
and he has a broad vision.

295
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,690
How can he just have a broad vision?

296
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,790
If he can't do anything,

297
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,030
and I really have to marry him,

298
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,060
how will he take care of me?

299
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,000
You have to give him some time

300
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,160
so that he can learn, right?

301
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:53,680
Brother,

302
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,440
I think now your arrangement is to

303
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,000
make him learn to take care of himself,

304
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,110
rather than take care of me.

305
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,790
What's your suggestion?

306
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,000
I've heard that after the students of the boys' school are admitted,

307
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,690
they need to do chores at the school.

308
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,170
For example, they need to work in the kitchen.

309
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,160
Brother, why don't you take this opportunity

310
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,589
to train him?

311
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,750
I don't think this is appropriate.

312
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,130
Brother,

313
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,869
are you going to

314
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,040
watch me

315
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,079
marry a man

316
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,110
who can't do any labor work?

317
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,620
Not really.

318
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,470
I know you care about me the most.

319
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,680
Brother, don't think that you're harming Xiao Yu.

320
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,730
Think about it.

321
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,170
The Xiao Family is a wealthy family.

322
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,670
He has never had the chance to learn to do such chores.

323
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,280
Why don't you take this opportunity

324
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,680
to train him?

325
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,320
Otherwise, after I marry him,

326
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,720
I'll be the one who suffers.

327
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,160
Yueniang, you don't need to worry about this.

328
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,420
The Xiao Family is a wealthy family.

329
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,000
Of course there are servants there.

330
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,430
Brother.

331
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,490
With our father's thrifty personality,

332
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,270
do you think he will let us use the servants?

333
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,310
Well...

334
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,370
If you really care about me,

335
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,210
just promise me.

336
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,260
Well, you're the one who will marry him.

337
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,610
Our father won't go there with you after you get married.

338
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,990
Brother, you don't care about me at all.

339
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,140
My lifelong happiness is entrusted to you.

340
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,930
Alright, I promise you.

341
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,630
I promise you.

342
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,350
Song.

343
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,430
Are you here to see Mr. Chen?

344
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,440
Mr. Xiao,

345
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,590
I'm here to discuss something with you.

346
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,160
What is it?

347
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,580
There are some chores in the boys' school which are hard to be arranged.

348
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,420
Besides, you're the only teaching assistant in our academy.

349
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,200
So, during your extracurricular time,

350
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,090
can you go and help?

351
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,540
What do you want me to do?

352
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,970
Just some trivial matters.

353
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,130
For example,

354
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,530
ring the morning bell.

355
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,020
Ring...

356
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,100
Ring the morning bell?

357
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,390
Do you know that roosters crow in the morning?

358
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,470
Yes, I do.

359
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,740
It's the same as that.

360
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,360
Is there any other problem, Mr. Xiao?

361
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,590
No.

362
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,720
It's settled then.

363
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,250
By the way,

364
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,590
the bell is hung in the Luwen Hall by the teaching ground.

365
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,590
Go get familiar with it first.

366
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,500
Don't delay it tomorrow.

367
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,320
How should I ring the morning bell?

368
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,030
Croton, oh, croton,

369
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,020
you'll be useful soon.

370
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,340
Brother.

371
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,420
You're finally back.

372
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,130
Yueniang.

373
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,520
Why do you always expect me to come back early recently?

374
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,010
Because I'm happy to see you.

375
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,450
Brother.

376
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,560
Have you asked Xiao Yu to help in the kitchen?

377
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,200
No.

378
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,090
I think

379
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,870
if we ask Xiao Yu to help in the kitchen right at the beginning,

380
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,010
it'll be too hard for him.

381
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,560
Thus, I suggested Mr. Chen

382
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,680
to let him ring the morning bell.

383
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,640
I think it's better to have a transition from easy work to difficult work. Right?

384
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,350
Yes.

385
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,200
Why didn't my eldest brother ask Xiao Yu to work in the kitchen?

386
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,840
Instead, he asked him to ring the morning bell?

387
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,130
This has disrupted all my plans.

388
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,030
I even specially told Mr. Zhang that

389
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,960
Xiao Yu couldn't do any labor work

390
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
so that he would have a bad impression on him first.

391
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,360
I thought about waiting for him to cause trouble,

392
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,510
and then Mr. Zhang would definitely kick him out of the academy.

393
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,100
What's wrong?

394
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,770
Nothing.

395
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,490
If I make Xiao Yu delay ringing the morning bell,

396
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,970
then I can go to Mr. Zhang to complain about him.

397
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,420
-That's it. -What is it?

398
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,060
Nothing. Nothing.

399
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,150
Nothing.

400
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,810
Nothing.

401
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,400
Why is she so unpredictable

402
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,990
and so mysterious?

403
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,230
Mr. Zhou.

404
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,550
Mr. Zhou.

405
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,870
I don't think Song Zhu can make trouble again this time.

406
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Lai Fu, what time is it now?

407
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,960
It's fine, Young Master.

408
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,020
It's only around 10 p.m. now.

409
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,370
Mr. Zhou, did you ring the morning bell?

410
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,810
Morning bell?

411
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,470
It's only around 10 p.m. now.

412
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,640
I thought you rang the morning bell.

413
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,600
Hurry up!

414
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,700
Slow down.

415
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,900
Did the bell ring?

416
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,080
Didn't you hear it?

417
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,890
The bell at the Luwen Hall rang just now.

418
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,990
What time is it now?

419
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,080
I'm so sleepy.

420
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,980
Let's see how you'll ring the bell tomorrow.

421
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,520
I'm such a charming

422
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,940
and smart girl.

423
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,330
Has it been blown away by the wind?

424
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:59,640
[Yiyang Academy]

425
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,740
Who is supposed to lead the morning reading today?

426
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,030
It's Song Zhu.

427
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,750
Why hasn't she come yet?

428
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,730
Ring the bell.

429
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,200
[Luwen Hall]

430
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,020
How is this possible?

431
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,580
Miss Zhu.

432
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,290
You only thought about setting a trap for me,

433
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,700
but you didn't know I had discovered your scheme.

434
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,160
What a coincidence!

435
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,780
How come I can encounter you everywhere?

436
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,290
It suddenly occurred to me that I had to go to the classroom.

437
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,160
I'm leaving.

438
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,080
No hurry.

439
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:41,820
Wait!

440
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,010
Don't leave in a hurry.

441
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,810
I have something to tell you.

442
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,600
But I have nothing to tell you.

443
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,470
I have something to say.

444
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,480
Did you

445
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,130
hide that hammer of the bell?

446
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,050
I don't understand.

447
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,040
You don't understand?

448
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,230
Then this handkerchief...

449
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,160
I've never seen it before.

450
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,700
You're just reluctant to admit it.

451
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,000
Look at the exquisite embroidery on the handkerchief.

452
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,310
It must be made by Song Yi from the Song Family.

453
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,410
Do you think I should I take this handkerchief

454
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,160
to the Song's Mansion

455
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,520
and ask everyone to recognize it?

456
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:41,680
You...

457
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,640
I also don't want anyone else to know this.

458
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:45,750
Zhu,

459
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,010
you shouldn't have made such a big mistake.

460
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,290
Tell me. What do you want?

461
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,910
I've promised you to write a letter to my father.

462
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,810
Why did you go back on your word?

463
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,440
How dare you say that?

464
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,000
You tried to show your merits in front of my father,

465
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,210
which made him have a better impression on you.

466
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,490
Even my eldest brother wanted to persuade my father

467
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,760
to make an exception to enroll you as a student.

468
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,720
How dare you say that?

469
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,860
That wasn't my intention.

470
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,040
Besides, I once told you that

471
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,850
I wouldn't be a student of Song's Academy. I wasn't lying.

472
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,940
Who would believe you?

473
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,370
I don't want to explain to you.

474
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,340
This time,

475
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,480
I won't hold you accountable for it.

476
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,280
But if you continue to

477
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,640
be so stubborn

478
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,160
and go against me in every aspect,

479
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,580
let alone the letter,

480
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,480
what do you think will be the result

481
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,360
if I go to see Dean Song with this handkerchief?

482
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,430
With this handkerchief as the evidence,

483
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,730
I don't think you can deny it.

484
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,800
You lifted a rock only to drop it on your own feet.

485
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,030
You didn't sleep at midnight,

486
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,430
and you came to hide my bell hammer.

487
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,970
You intended to stop me from ringing the morning bell?

488
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,530
You really took great pains to do this.

489
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,140
Unfortunately,

490
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,280
you just couldn't stop me from ringing the morning bell.

491
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,960
You want to ring the bell, right?

492
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,320
Come on. Let me help you ring it enough.

493
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,900
Come on. Ring it enough.

494
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,250
Here you are.

495
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,160
Ring the bell.

496
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,810
Time to ring the bell!

497
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,030
Time to ring the bell!

498
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,690
Ring...

499
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,100
Do you admit your mistake?

500
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,680
Yes, I do.

501
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,510
I'm willing to be punished.

502
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Do you admit your mistake?

503
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,360
Yes, I do.

504
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,150
Mr. Chen asked you to ring the morning bell,

505
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,480
not to ring the bell randomly.

506
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,740
If you can't even do this little thing well,

507
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,570
how can you be a good teaching assistant?

508
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,210
The morning reading is not just your own business.

509
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,740
It concerns the entire girls' school.

510
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,130
But you were late for no reason, which affected everyone.

511
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,640
Mr. Chen, please don't be angry.

512
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,500
I won't do it again.

513
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,670
Someone accused you of ringing the bell randomly at midnight last night,

514
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,760
which made many people unable to sleep well.

515
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,560
I don't think

516
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,810
Mr. Chen can protect you this time.

517
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,190
Since you like sleeping late so much,

518
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,430
in this semester,

519
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,630
you'll lead all the morning reading.

520
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,680
You should arrive an hour earlier than others every day to prepare for it.

521
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,210
I've heard that you can't do labor work at all.

522
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,550
Go help in the kitchen.

523
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:44,790
Yes.

524
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,270
Who is it?

525
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,580
It's Lord Zuo from the Bureau of Military Affairs.

526
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,110
What brings you here?

527
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,370
Mr. Zhang, how have you been?

528
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,170
I've been fine.

529
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,600
Come in, please.

530
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,480
I passed by Yiyang today,

531
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,760
so I took this chance to send a letter to Mr. Song

532
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,680
for Officer Wan.

533
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,920
Zuo Hongzhang is Wan Li's  trusted subordinate.

534
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,500
If it were just an ordinary consolation letter, he wouldn't have sent it personally.

535
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,190
Thank you, Lord Zuo.

536
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,750
You're welcome, Mr. Zhang.

537
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,080
In order to deliver letters, you've travelled between the capital and Yiyang many times.

538
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,750
Thanks for your hard work.

539
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,440
Don't mention it.

540
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,790
Yiyang Academy is known as a retreat away from the turmoil of the world.

541
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,460
People here don't associate with officials.

542
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,840
How come Wan Li frequently asks Zuo Hongzhang to send letters?

543
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,060
Song's Academy is famous in the world and it has students everywhere.

544
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,720
And Song's Academy is even considered as a unique sect.

545
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,290
For the students who graduated from Song's Academy,

546
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,460
many of them have become officials or businessmen.

547
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,370
Now there are still many alumni

548
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,110
who write to Mr. Song every day.

549
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,530

Your fiance Xiao Yu got into trouble because of ringing the bell wrongly.

This is just a temporary measure.

Mr. Zhang also said that

607
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,120
Song Xu had been in contact with many officials by writing letters.

608
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,090
If we want to know the connection between Song Xu and these officials,

609

we might find some clues from those letters.

610

Right.

Song Xu claimed to stay away from the official circle.

612

Actually, he associates with the officials secretly.

I think so too.

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,450
So, Young Master,
