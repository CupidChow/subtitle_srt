[Special Lady]

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,600
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,509
Trust me.

5
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,520
No one will come to inspect the room today.

6
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,150
Who is it?

7
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:49,860
Me.

8
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,500
Mr. Ding, what brings you here so late?

9
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,190
Mr. Xiao, we're playing crickets in the next room.

10
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,890
The two of us are bored.

11
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,030
Would you like to join us?

12
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,800
It's late.

13
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,310
Forget it.

14
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,740
I have to get up early tomorrow.

15
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,090
You'd better go back.

16
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,630
Let me ask Mr. Zhou if he's interested.

17
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,320
He’s asleep.

18
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,270
I just saw Zhou...

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,290
Are you guys drinking?

20
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,260
You're drinking!

21
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,130
Mr. Xiao, you're amazing.

22
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,430
How can you get this?

23
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,990
It's nothing.

24
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,100
Don't tell anyone

25
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,829
what happened today.

26
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,970
Got it.

27
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,610
Don't you know me?

28
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,490
I always keep my mouth shut.

29
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,960
I won't tell anyone about anything

30
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,650
except images of the trigrams.

31
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,300
Nice. Come on.

32
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,620
Oh, right.

33
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,079
I remember something.

34
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,630
What is it?

35
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,860
Wasn't Li Wenshu elected Dorm Supervisor today?

36
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,040
I think he has always been against you.

37
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,700
Think about what happened today.

38
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,110
He has always wanted to complain to Changshan about you.

39
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,120
What if he gets something on you?

40
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,920
You'll provide him with ammunition.

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,950
Right, Mr. Xiao. Well...

42
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,730
It doesn't matter.

43
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,120
Have a seat.

44
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,000
Li Wenshu is a reckless guy.

45
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,380
He's brave but not smart.

46
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,430
He participated in the dorm supervisor election

47
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,380
just to show off.

48
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,720
Don't worry. He won't come to inspect the room today.

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,430
Cheers.

50
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,730
That makes sense.

51
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,040
Mr. Xiao.

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,340
Mr. Xue.

53
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,910
What brings you here?

54
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,850
Mr. Ding and I were playing crickets.

55
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,520
We were bored,

56
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,190
so he came to ask you to join us.

57
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:49,910
I...

58
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,200
He hasn't come back,

59
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,620
so I just want to check if he is here.

60
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,110
He...

61
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,770
Mr. Xue, I'm inside.

62
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,079
So Mr. Ding is here.

63
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,470
No.

64
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,460
Mr. Ding.

65
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,510
You're really something, Mr. Xiao.

66
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,830
You have all kinds of good stuff.

67
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,700
Enough, stop talking.

68
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,640
Drink up.

69
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,750
It’ll be dawn if we don’t drink.

70
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,920
Mr. Zhou, why don’t you drink?

71
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,630
I can’t drink.

72
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,040
I'll drink water as wine.

73
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,790
No way.

74
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,320
Come on.

75
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,070
Have a taste.

76
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,450
You must drink some.

77
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,860
Enough.

78
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,120
Mr. Zhou still has to study.

79
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,630
I'll drink it for him.

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,090
Mr. Xiao.

81
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,000
Mr. Xiao, you can really hold your liquor.

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,450
No matter it's water or alcohol,

83
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,050
let's enjoy ourselves, okay?

84
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,330
Okay. Cheers. Okay.

85
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,620
Cheers!

86
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,150
Tonight is beautiful.

87
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,220
Tonight is beautiful.

88
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,620
Lady Jin.

89
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,850
You always look at yourself

90
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,540
in everything that reflects things

91
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,690
whether you're free or in a class.

92
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,350
It's okay you do that in the daytime,

93
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,400
but at night,

94
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,320
can't you stop doing that?

95
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,930
This is just for peace of mind.

96
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,870
Mirror and my beauty are inseparable.

97
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,040
How beautiful are you?

98
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,220
Are you crazy?

99
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,810
What are you doing?

100
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,910
Let me see how beautiful you are.

101
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,470
Look your smile.

102
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,520
I can tell

103
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,630
Lady Yan's heart has been stolen away.

104
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,460
By whom?

105
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,780
Who took her heart?

106
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,210
-Who is it?
-Yeah. Tell us.

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,570
Who is it?

108
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,590
What are you talking about?

109
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,140
-Nonsense.
-You know what?

110
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,480
Miss Zhao is talking nonsense again.

111
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,950
I don't know.

112
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,630
Since we enrolled,

113
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,370
the scenery outside the window has never changed.

114
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,320
Has anyone ever seen Lady Yan so obsessive?

115
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,870
As the saying goes,

116
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,690
the scenery goes with the heart.

117
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,900
Goes with the heart…

118
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,240
I wonder if Xiao Yu drank that pot of alcohol.

119
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,870
Guys.

120
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,830
Do you have any plans

121
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,240
for tomorrow's break?

122
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,030
What can we do in just one day?

123
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,580
Let's just walk around.

124
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,050
Yiyang is big,

125
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,720
but I haven't been able to walk around.

126
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,220
I heard there is a fortune teller in the south of the city.

127
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,840
I'm going to visit him.

128
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,140
Fortune teller?

129
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,340
He's also majoring in the same thing with you?

130
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,930
Better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it.

131
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,070
Take us with you.

132
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,270
How about Mr. Xiao?

133
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,300
I'm not going.

134
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,710
Mr. Zhou?

135
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,140
I need to study.

136
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,700
Mr. Zhou is indeed the most talented man in Luoyang.

137
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,730
You even work so hard during your break.

138
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,520
You make us ashamed.

139
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,170
I'm not that smart, so I need to work hard.

140
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,040
Mr. Zhou.

141
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,370
Since you love studying so much,

142
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,390
do you usually go to the Wenjing Hall?

143
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,630
I've been there a few times.

144
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,360
How is it? Are there many people?

145
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,300
Not too many.

146
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,070
There are some seniors.

147
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,010
But the Wenjing Hall is closed

148
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,250
at night.

149
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,040
At night,

150
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,690
Master will kick everyone out,

151
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,020
so you can't really stay there for long  in a day.

152
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,630
Are there female seniors?

153
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,840
I want to go.

154
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,370
Mr. Xue, let’s go together.

155
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,820
Is it good?

156
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,320
Why not?

157
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,180
We're all men.

158
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,590
Mr. Xue.

159
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,510
There are so many women in our academy.

160
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,660
They are all beautiful.

161
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,310
Have you ever liked any of them?

162
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,700
I'm not qualified.

163
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,260
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Xiao.

164
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,420
You're talented and handsome.

165
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,680
There must be many admirers for you.

166
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,590
Don't look at me.

167
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,930
I don't have any.

168
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,310
Wait a minute.

169
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,790
Isn't Mr. Xiao a teaching assistant for female students?

170
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,880
-He gets in touch with female students every day.
-Right.

171
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,260
Of course there must be someone.

172
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,230
Tell me who it is.

173
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,350
Let me do some fortune telling for you.

174
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,190
Tell us.

175
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,650
You should focus on study since you're in the academy.

176
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,310
-Boring.
-Can you be more serious?

177
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,270
If you think too much every day,

178
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,200
you'll forget why you're here sooner or later.

179
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,380
So stingy.

180
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,310
Song Zhu, you've been absent-minded.

181
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,130
Is there anything bothering you too?

182
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,760
No.

183
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,150
What could be bothering me?

184
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,260
I...

185
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,530
I just drank too much tea.

186
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,620
Excuse me for a while.

187
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,440
-Who is it?
-Shut up!

188
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,070
I heard that

189
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,510
the Song family's daughters are very gorgeous,

190
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,550
but

191
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,830
I haven't looked at them closely

192
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,260
since I enrolled.

193
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,350
If you say so,

194
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,030
you can find out when you go to the Wenjing Hall tomorrow.

195
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,380
Mr. Xiao, will you go to the Wenjing Hall tomorrow?

196
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,270
No.

197
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,630
I'm not interested in that kind of place.

198
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,970
Who are you?

199
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,370
Song...

200
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,750
Song Zhu?

201
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,960
Instead of staying in your dorm,

202
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,510
why did you climb up the wall

203
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,480
of our men's dorm?

204
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,190
I...

205
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,830
I'm here to admire the moon.

206
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,080
But you,

207
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,990
why did you come out in the middle of the night

208
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,890
instead of resting in your dorm?

209
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,120
What are you up to?

210
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,210
I guess you don't know.

211
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,800
I was elected

212
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,650
Dorm Supervisor.

213
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,270
I'm doing what I should do right now.

214
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,390
Dorm Supervisor?

215
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,380
You're really a good helper.

216
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,670
I should have no worries at all.

217
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,300
Hello, Dorm Supervisor Li.

218
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,380
Nice to meet you.

219
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,680
Bite it.

220
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,740
- Bite it.
-Go! Go!

221
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,610
Bite it!

222
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,400
Bite it.

223
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,750
Come on. Go on.

224
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,510
Go! Go!

225
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,470
-Whom do you want to see it fight this time?
-Bite it!

226
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,150
Bite it!

227
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,540
Hush!

228
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,700
Go on!

229
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,260
What should we do?

230
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,830
Who is it? We're all in bed.

231
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,280
Who is it?

232
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,460
Hi, Dorm Supervisor Li.

233
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:18,970
Dorm Supervisor Li.

234
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,960
What brings you here so late?

235
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,450
I'm the dorm supervisor now.

236
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,970
I came to visit you

237
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,200
to see if you're all doing well.

238
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,410
Dorm Supervisor Li.

239
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,020
Unfortunately,

240
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,300
it’s late tonight.

241
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,580
Mr. Zhou and I have already gone to bed.

242
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,580
How about

243
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,880
we catch up tomorrow?

244
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,980
Are you disrespecting me?

245
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,620
I dare not.

246
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,730
Your father is in a high position now.

247
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,500
You're the dorm supervisor now.

248
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,770
I dare not disrespect you.

249
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,610
Are you really not going to let me in?

250
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,770
Mr. Xiao.

251
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,930
Mr. Li, please come in.

252
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,010
Good boy.

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,800
Who is it?

254
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,460
Dorm Supervisor Li.

255
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,270
Sorry to disturb you so late.

256
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,420
Please forgive me.

257
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,650
What are you doing?

258
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,880
Mr. Xiao, your wardrobe is really unique.

259
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,380
Why did you say so?

260
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,480
My wardrobe is no different from others'.

261
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,810
No wonder you come from the capital. You're so meticulous.

262
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,790
I wonder what's hidden in your wardrobe

263
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,890
that you can't share with others.

264
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,580
You must be joking.

265
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,100
I dare not hide anything.

266
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,550
If you don't mind,

267
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,410
I'm willing to open it for you.

268
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,260
Please.

269
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,710
Hurry up.

270
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,210
Dorm Supervisor Li.

271
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,060
Locking it

272
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,450
is just my personal habit.

273
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,290
So poor.

274
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,830
Dorm Supervisor Li.

275
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,740
Are you satisfied?

276
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,650
Yes.

277
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,200
Sorry to bother you so late.

278
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,240
I'm gonna go.

279
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,120
See you.

280
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,480
See you.

281
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,190
Looks like I'm going to get a lot today.

282
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,700
Dorm Supervisor Li.

283
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,860
You...

284
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,940
Hello, Dorm Supervisor Li.

285
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,800
You're dead!

286
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,400
You're done for!

287
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,360
What are you waiting for?

288
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,200
Tie him up.

289
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,110
Hurry up. Tie him up.

290
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,960
Hurry up.

291
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,790
I heard that Mrs. Jin is the best matchmaker.

292
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,100
Can you tell us

293
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,210
some interesting stories?

294
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,250
Well...

295
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,590
Tell us.

296
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,630
What interesting stories can she tell?

297
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,470
Mrs. Jin, tell us something.

298
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,070
Speaking of interesting stories,

299
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,490
there are many of them.

300
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,250
-Tell us.
-Yueniang, you’re back.

301
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,430
Tell us.

302
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,710
Song Zhu.

303
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,430
What took you so long?

304
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,640
Look at her happy face.

305
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,930
She can't even hide her smile.

306
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,790
I think

307
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,260
she must have gone on a date

308
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,060
with the man she likes.

309
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,290
No.

310
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,330
I just went home.

311
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,190
Mr. Xiao, what should we do? We're in big trouble.

312
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:48,960
What should we do?

313
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,330
We can’t keep him tied like this.

314
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,340
Mr. Li. Mr. Li. Mr. Li.

315
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,660
Let's talk.

316
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,820
We can negotiate, right?

317
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,220
I...

318
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,900
You were drinking together and you want to negotiate?

319
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,960
What do you want to negotiate...

320
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,310
Hurry up. Cover his mouth.

321
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,620
What should we do?

322
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,040
What should we do?

323
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,970
Hold that.

324
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:09,960
Give me the cup.

325
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,440
Don't drop it.

326
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,580
If you make a mistake too,

327
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,210
you can't only blame us.

328
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,570
There was a daughter from a rich family.

329
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,890
She got engaged even before she was born.

330
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,800
The counterpart was also from a noble family.

331
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,140
They were a good match.

332
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,990
Unfortunately,

333
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,330
as this woman grew up,

334
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,190
she realized that

335
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,520
she didn't like

336
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,100
who she was engaged to.

337
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,450
So what?

338
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,990
The engagement has been decided.

339
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,540
Isn't she supposed to follow?

340
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,830
Isn't this the novel I read last time?

341
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,440
Hold on.

342
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,770
Listen to me.

343
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,330
Not only did she not like the person who she was engaged to,

344
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,290
but also fell in love with someone else.

345
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,240
She even found my mother.

346
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,590
My mother said,

347
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,350
I can't help you with this.

348
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,950
I can do nothing about it.

349
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,710
But my mother also said,

350
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,680
unless there's a marriage letter,

351
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,950
otherwise, it's hard to change the engagement.

352
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,830
Guess what happened next?

353
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,490
What happened?

354
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,030
What a shame.

355
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,990
That person was enlightened,

356
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,790
so she eloped

357
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,310
with her loved one.

358
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,210
Eloped? She's so brave.

359
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,180
What about her now?

360
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,280
How is she doing now?

361
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,600
Go on.

362
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,550
Tell us.

363
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,280
Well...

364
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,940
How's she doing? Tell us.

365
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,800
Tell us!

366
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,550
Come on. Just tell us.

367
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,480
To be honest,

368
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,780
I don't know what happened next.

369
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,470
You're so annoying.

370
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,960
You're annoying. You're lying.

371
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,080
Miss Song.

372
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,310
Miss Song.

373
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,500
Who is it?

374
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,829
Miss Song, where are you?

375
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,060
Song… Miss Song.

376
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,380
Heaven and earth

377
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,980
can witness my love for you.

378
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,119
I didn't expect Li Wenshu to be so crazy after drinking.

379
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,790
Right.

380
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:44,910
Song...

381
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,680
Song...

382
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,350
Get away.

383
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,950
Help.

384
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,710
Mr. Li, this is the women's dorm.

385
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,410
Right.

386
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,710
Sober up.

387
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:20,370
Being sensitive is more painful than being heartless.

388
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,350
Wait, wait.

389
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,800
I told you to eat less.

390
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,930
One becomes thousands.

391
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,830
There's a boundary

392
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,890
of the world,

393
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,140
but love is endless.

394
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,700
Miss Song.

395
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,190
What do you think of

396
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,290
my poem?

397
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,230
You want Miss Song?

398
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,070
Bah!

399
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,820
Will Miss Song like

400
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,480
a shameless and lewd pervert like you?

401
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,440
No way.

402
00:18:59,460 --> 00:18:59,970
Look.

403
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,000
I almost forgot about it.

404
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,090
Give me some clothes.

405
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,960
It's cold.

406
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,760
Let me tell you.

407
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,000
This is getting worse. Let's go.

408
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,240
I'm warning you.

409
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,140
Stay away from me.

410
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,430
I just feel a little cold.

411
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,030
Look at me, I…

412
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,810
I'm warning you. Stay away from me.

413
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,760
Stay away from me!

414
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,920
Miss Song.

415
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,970
Good for you, Xiao Yu.

416
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,140
It really has something to do with you.

417
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,390
Come here.

418
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,380
This has something to do with him.

419
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,020
This has something to do with Xiao Yu.

420
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,150
-This has something to do with Xiao Yu.
-It was a misunderstanding.

421
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,090
Misunderstanding.

422
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,440
-What misunderstanding?
-It was really a misunderstanding.

423
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,480
Why is everything related to you?

424
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,200
What's wrong with you?

425
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,750
What's wrong with me? What happened tonight?

426
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,550
What is he doing?

427
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,330
-Did you see that?
-It really was a misunderstanding.

428
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,110
-It was really a misunderstanding.
-You all saw what happened today, right?

429
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:39,780
Well…

430
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,870
♫ Waiting for a rain to fall, painting the mountains green♫

431
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:52,950

♫ Fate, with its twists and turns, brought you to me♫

433

Xiao Yu.

451
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,900
-Mr. Li.
-Xiao Yu.

452
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,370
You kissed my girl.

453
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,750
Slap his mouth!

454
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,400
Song Zhu.

455
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,520
-Slap him on the lips.
-Mr. Li.

456
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,780
Mr. Li, hit his mouth.

457
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,480
Calm down.

458
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,950
Hit his mouth.

459
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,180
Hit his mouth.

460
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,240
I'll hit your mouth.

461
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,100
Hit your mouth.

462
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,350
She's not your Miss Song.

463
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,940
She is Song Zhu.

464
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,690
Get up.

465
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:14,970
Come on.

466
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,040
I didn't kiss her.

467
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,680
I bumped into her.

468
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,990
I bumped into her.

469
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,120
What happened?

470
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,590
Why is it so noisy?

471
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,740
Miss Song.

472
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,870
Miss Song.

473
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,680
How could you let Xiao Yu kiss you?

474
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,240
It's disgusting.

475
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,680
What did he say?

476
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,750
He's drunk.

477
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,320
It's okay.

478
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,120
Senior, he's drunk.

479
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,950
Don't you know drinking is forbidden in the academy?

480
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,830
Look how drunk he is.

481
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,940
Take him back.

482
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:52,800
Miss Song.

483
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,990
Come on.

484
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,000
Well, Mr. Zhou.

485
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,090
Mr. Zhou.

486
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,020
Let me help you.

487
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,580
Have a rest.

488
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,560
Fine. I'll have a rest...

489
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,200
Be careful.

490
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,220
Mr. Xiao, why do you need to have a rest?

491
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,630
I...

492
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,380
I...

493
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,950
I'll go help them.

494
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,340
He's just left?

495
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,720
Bastard!

496
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,070
Well…

497
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,560
How can I go to class?

498
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,140
I'm so embarrassed to see others.

499
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,810
Did Mr. Zhou see it too?

500
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,720
Could he misunderstand?

501
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,390
No.

502
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,750
He must have seen it.

503
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,100
He bumped into me.

504
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,380
It was a misunderstanding.

505
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,960
But...

506
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,940
What if he didn't see it clearly at night?

507
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:48,690
Then...

508
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,560
So annoying.

509
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,270
Song Zhu.

510
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,430
Song Zhu.

511
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,350
Why are you walking so fast?

512
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,830
Qinruo, it's getting late.

513
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,520
Let's catch up tomorrow.

514
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,190
Don't go.

515
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,090
You must tell me clearly today.

516
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,250
What happened

517
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,200
between you and Mr. Xiao just now?

518
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,080
You...

519
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,320
You...

520
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,350
I can't even say it.

521
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,260
Say it yourself.

522
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,160
Fine.

523
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:43,620
I'm telling you.

524
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,820
There was really nothing

525
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,260
between me and Mr. Xiao.

526
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,670
Just now,

527
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,950
Li Wenshu accidentally bumped into Xiao Yu.

528
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,970
-Then Xiao Yu accidentally...
-Fine.

529
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,640
Stop talking.

530
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,270
Well...

531
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,190
Did you and Mr. Xiao...

532
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,440
Did you...

533
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:09,720
Kiss...

534
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,560
No, not kiss.

535
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,320
We bumped into each other.

536
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,720
Look.

537
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,650
Look here.

538
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,440
Right here.

539
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,710
It must have swollen now.

540
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,250
Qinruo, you were there just now.

541
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,290
As you saw,

542
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,770
I wish I could chop that bastard into pieces.

543
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,070
Now what?

544
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,570
You're here to misunderstand me. You don't even believe me.

545
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,960
I'm so wronged.

546
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,000
It hurts so much.

547
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,980
Really?

548
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,020
I'm the victim.

549
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,020
It hurts so much.

550
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,530
Does it hurt?

551
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,290
Alright, Yueniang.

552
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,900
I was within.

553
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,150
You know my temper.

554
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,490
I can't control my temper when I get anxious.

555
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,220
Don't be mad at me.

556
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,070
Let me blow on it for you.

557
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:16,920
How about this?

558
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,130
Later,

559
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,130
I'll go back to my room and get the ointment.

560
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,930
I'll apply it for you. It will be healed tomorrow morning.

561
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,710
I'll only take it if you're willing to give it to me.

562
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,280
Of course.

563
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,840
I'll give you whatever you want.

564
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,580
Yueniang.

565
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,740
I'm sorry.

566
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,720
I shouldn't have wronged you,

567
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,240
but you have to promise me

568
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,670
you won't lie to me.

569
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,100
Otherwise, I won't treat you as my best friend.

570
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,160
What's wrong?

571
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,690
Nothing.

572
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,980
Put him on the bed.

573
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,070
He's so heavy.

574
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,180
Hurry up.

575
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,490
Miss Song.

576
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,460
Shoes.

577
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,780
That shoe. That shoe.

578
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,420
Miss…

579
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,980
He stinks.

580
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,450
Miss Song.

581
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,030
Alright.

582
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,230
Let's go.

583
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,650
Mr. Xiao.

584
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,990
How did you feel about it?

585
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,440
Feel about what?

586
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,550
That...

587
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,940
Kissing a girl.

588
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:37,910
Kissing a girl?

589
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,620
How many times have I told you that it wasn't a kiss?

590
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,550
It was an accident.

591
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,740
My mouth still hurts.

592
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,120
Mr. Xiao, aren't you going back?

593
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,400
Right away.

594
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,460
Listen.

595
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,600
Don't mention this again after you leave this room.

596
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,180
Besides,

597
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,420
don't spread rumors.

598
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,710
Mr. Xiao, I’m going back to my room.

599
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,340
Okay.

600
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,360
I...

601
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,470
I'll clean this up.

602
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,710
Okay.

603
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,070
Since you kissed her,

604
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,180
you should be responsible for her.

605
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,810
Is...

606
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,890
Isn't it that serious?

607
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,610
Isn't it?

608
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,590
No.

609
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,020
It's nothing.

610
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,470
Mr. Zhou.

611
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,580
Clean up.

612
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,020
No.

613
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,120
Have a rest.

614
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,860
You have a rest.

615
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,470
I'll clean up.

616
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:03,840
I'll clean it up.

617
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,700
I'm too embarrassed to see others in the future.

618
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,810
Mr. Xiao.

619
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,290
I saw you stay up all night.

620
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,370
You also look worried today.

621
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,990
Are you still thinking about what happened last night?

622
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,180
No, no.

623
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,390
I don't really care about that.

624
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,970
Don't mention it again.

625
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,030
Si.

626
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,090
The hut ahead

627
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,370
is the kitchen.

628
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,890
Go help them when you get there.

629
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,860
-Understood?
-Got it.

630
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,970
I'll wait here.

631
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,450
Just go.

632
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:50,840
Okay.

633
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,120
Wait. Wait.

634
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,990
Don't let them know

635
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,080
I asked you to go there.

636
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,610
Don't worry, My Lady.

637
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,490
You can count on me.

638
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,400
Go.

639
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:00,970
Hurry up.

640
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,830
Hurry up!

641
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,530
Hurry up.

642
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,040
Hello, Misters.

643
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,570
Hurry up. Move.

644
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,530
Get in there.

645
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,500
Go.

646
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,560
Hurry.

647
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,050
Hey, you...

648
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,530
You are...

649
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,880
We're here to help.

650
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,490
Help?

651
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,540
This is fun.

652
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,420
Give it to me.

653
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:25,860
Let me see.

654
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,050
I saw it first.

655
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,220
Give it to me.

656
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,330
Stop.

657
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,550
Okay.

658
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,790
Guys, stop.

659
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,590
Let's make it clear first.

660
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,450
What are you...

661
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,720
Who asked you to come?

662
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,760
You won't tell us?

663
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:43,990
Fine.

664
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,240
Stand there.

665
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,540
No, we still need to work.

666
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,490
Her Lady sent us here

667
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,450
to work.

668
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,070
We can't just stand here like a fool.

669
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,960
-Her Lady?
-Her Lady?

670
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,000
Her Lady said

671
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,840
we can't say we were sent by the Yan family.

672
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,330
Hey...

673
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,850
-You said it.
-The Yan family?

674
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,850
I didn't.

675
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,060
It was you! You said it.

676
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,450
Yan Qinruo?

677
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:05,630
Mister.

678
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,160
You said

679
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,370
Her Lady's name.

680
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,200
We didn't say it.

681
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,030
We didn't.

682
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,980
Is Her Lady there?

683
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,020
My Lady.

684
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,060
They have found out.

685
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,270
What should we do?

686
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,140
Mr. Xiao.

687
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,630
You’d better not go.

688
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,750
Right?

689
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,650
You're right.

690
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,440
She's a girl anyway.

691
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:33,880
How about this?

692
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,280
You go back first.

693
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,070
Tell Miss Yan

694
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,440
not to cause trouble here.

695
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,400
Go back?

696
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,180
Listen to him.

697
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,270
Just go back.

698
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,500
We can't leave.

699
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,530
Go back.

700
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,060
-I haven’t finished the work.
-Just go.

701
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,310
I haven’t finished the work.

702
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:56,940
Mr. Zhou.

703
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,860
What do you think Lady Yan meant by doing this?

704
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,080
I wonder

705
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,800
if she likes you.

706
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,620
Mr. Xiao.

707
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,230
Can't she like you?

708
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,050
Why are you nervous?

709
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:13,700
I...

710
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:14,590
Are you nervous?

711
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,690
I'm not.

712
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,430
-Aren't you?
-Don’t…

713
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,710
Why are you blushing?

714
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,180
I'm nervous

715
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,740
because I don't like her.

716
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,240
Well, you're nervous because you don't like her?

717
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,410
Well, you're blushing now.

718
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,610
-I’m not.
-You're blushing scarlet.

719
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,470
Stop it.

720
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,730
-You're sweating.
-Let’s clean up.

721
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,980
You're like sitting on a needle.

722
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,130
What?

723
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,320
Kiss?

724
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,090
Not kiss.

725
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,650
It was an accident.

726
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,430
We just bumped into each other.

727
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:38,900
That can't do either.

728
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,880
How can there be a physical touch between a man and a woman

729
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,340
if they're not related to each other?

730
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,020
Is it that serious?

731
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,870
I'm afraid

732
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,240
no one

733
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,700
dares to marry this girl in the future.

734
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,470
Really?

735
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,110
Is it true?

736
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,520
Yueniang, who kissed you?

737
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,980
Not me.

738
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,400
No one kissed me.

739
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,090
How is that possible?

740
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,280
What are you talking about?

741
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,380
I was only making an assumption.

742
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,510
An assumption is an assumption.

743
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,520
Why did you tell me an assumption?

744
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,740
You scared me.

745
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,470
It's not exactly an assumption.

746
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,580
It's…

747
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,820
Half of it.

748
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,170
Bro, calm down.

749
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,930
It didn't happen to me,

750
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,070
but others.

751
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,040
Whom did it

752
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,500
happen to?

753
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,810
Come on.

754
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,610
It's girl's stuff.

755
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,510
Why did you ask as a man?

756
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,460
Tell me what to do,

757
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,530
so that I know how to respond to her.

758
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,670
What to do?

759
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,420
Just make it clear.

760
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,520
How?

761
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,770
There's nothing can't be explained

762
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,690
between men.

763
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:19,860
But...

764
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,090
These two men...

765
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,550
These two men are living together.

766
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:25,750
Then...

767
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,130
What should I say?

768
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,179
What are you mumbling?

769
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,520
You can make it clear no matter how many men it involves.

770
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,639
They always say

771
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,790
you girls make things complicated.

772
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,330
If there's any misunderstanding,

773
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,250
just go find them and explain.

774
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,260
Yueniang.

775
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,280
The reputation of a girl is very important.

776
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:50,489
Don't let Mr. Xiao misunderstand.

777
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,989
You are engaged.

778
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,820
Don't mess around.

779
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,770
Who's messing around?

780
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,170
I told you it didn't happen to me.

781
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,330
Forget it.

782
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,290
I won't talk to you.

783
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,370
-I’ll make it clear.
-Well.

784
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,690
Talk to him nicely.

785
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,100
Bro, forget what I told you today.

786
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,160
Otherwise...

787
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,570
Miss Song, I have something to do. I have to go.

788
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,930
You have to make it clear.

789
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,040
I told you. It didn't happen to me.

790
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:31,500
Bro.

791
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,720
Where is Yueniang going in a hurry?

792
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,230
She didn't want me to tell you. Stop asking.

793
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,450
What do you want me for?

794
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,260
I need your help.

795
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:46,970
Yu…

796
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,520
You...

797
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,830
-You...
-You...

798
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,500
-I...
-I...

799
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:18,970
Senior Song.

800
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,130
Greetings, Senior.

801
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,350
Hi, Junior Zhou.

802
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,820
What brings you here?

803
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,550
My brother asked me to give you the fruit.

804
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,060
Thank you, Senior Song.

805
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,930
Please thank him for us.

806
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,820
I have to sweep the floor.

807
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:45,920
Junior Zhou.

808
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,670
I have something to tell you.

809
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,410
Well...

810
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,230
Are fireworks allowed in the academy?

811
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,210
That's strange.

812
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,010
Fireworks should be prohibited by the academy.

813
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,220
We'll get back to work.

814
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,530
Junior Zhou.

815
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,970
Junior Zhou.

816
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,010
Junior Zhou.

817
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,010
Senior Song, do you have something to say?

818
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:38,820
Actually, I...

819
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,960
I want to say

820
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,070
last night...

821
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,620
You guys talk. I'm heading out.

822
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,820
No.

823
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,010
Since you're here,

824
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,070
you have to stay.

825
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,930
What are you doing?

826
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,070
Just stand here.

827
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,660
Don't say or do anything.

828
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,570
Just stand here.

829
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,230
Only cleaning is left.

830
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,910
Senior Song. Mr. Xiao.

831
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,080
You guys continue.

832
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,510
I'll clean up the mess.

833
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,580
You have to be here as well.

834
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,250
Zhou…

835
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,970
Go. Help me explain to Junior Zhou.

836
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,810
-Let’s go.
-Song Zhu.

837
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,980
If you're free,

838
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,260
you can help me clean.

839
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,020
I'm not free.

840
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,080
I'm not here to wander around.

841
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,540
I...

842
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,230
I want to explain what happened last night.

843
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,890
Don't mention it again.

844
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,320
Can you forget it?

845
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,300
Forget what? It's easy for you to say.

846
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:28,930
I don't care.

847
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,660
You have to explain this

848
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,360
to Junior Zhou.

849
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,550
Otherwise,

850
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,840
it'll never end.

851
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,780
I just told Zhou Ji

852
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,040
not to mention it again.

853
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,240
If you pick up this topic again,

854
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,190
I'm afraid it can never be over.

855
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:41,980
Song Zhu.

856
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,580
If you insist on talking about this,

857
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,370
explain to Zhou Ji yourself. Don’t get me involved.

858
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,520
Do you think I want to involve you?

859
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,990
I wish I could never see you again.

860
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,800
Thank you for your words.

861
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,660
Hope we don't see each other again in this life.

862
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,520
So beautiful.

863
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,200
Isn't setting off fireworks in the academy against the rules?

864
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,410
Do I know you well? Stay away from me.

865
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,850
Childish.

866
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,450
What's there to see?

867
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,650
What is this?

868
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,320
Well…

869
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,200
Are you okay?
