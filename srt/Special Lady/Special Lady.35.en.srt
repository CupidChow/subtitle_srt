[Special Lady]

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,800
[Episode 35]

4
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,090
Open the door!

5
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,910
Zhou Ji!

6
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,390
Zhou Ji, open the door.

7
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,310
I said I don’t have the ledger.

8
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,910
Zhou Ji.

9
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,520
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,420
Are you here to laugh at me?

11
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,110
You're drunk.

12
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,720
Alright, stop drinking.

13
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,980
You're drunk.

14
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,770
None of your business.

15
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,820
Go away.

16
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,640
Can you change the situation

17
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,620
by getting drunk?

18
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,230
You won't stop drinking?

19
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,510
I'll drink with you.

20
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,540
Leave!

21
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,150
-Go!
-Even you want me to go.

22
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,810
-Where else can I go?
-Get out!

23
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,350
Your brother bullied you,

24
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,480
not me.

25
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,630
How could you do this to me?

26
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,710
Don't mention him.

27
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,160
He is a beast.

28
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,470
Sooner or later,

29
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,160
I will make them pay a hundredfold

30
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,280
for the suffering my mother endured.

31
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,079
The day my mother passed away

32
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,070
was my brother's birthday.

33
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,160
The banquet tables filled my house that day.

34
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,850
But my mother

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,340
was almost abandoned in the wilderness, leaving her fate to the mercy of the wolves.

36
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,320
I thought my return this time

37
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,500
could let my mother's memorial tablet

38
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,260
enter the ancestral hall of the Zhou family.

39
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,240
But I didn't expect myself

40
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,240
to be fooled like this.

41
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,790
How can there be

42
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,480
such a ridiculous person like me in the world?

43
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,750
How ridiculous!

44
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,280
Yan Qinruo.

45
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,180
You don't have to be so nice to me.

46
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
You know what?

47
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,270
You're just a pawn to me.

48
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,800
From the beginning,

49
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,360
I used my mother's bracelet

50
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,330
to touch you.

51
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,040
All I did

52
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,720
was just for the Duke Yue's Mansion behind you.

53
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,860
I need the power

54
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,760
to take revenge on the Zhou family.

55
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,740
And you

56
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,640
are too silly.

57
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,760
So silly.

58
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,270
I know.

59
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,270
I know it all.

60
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
However, Zhou Ji,

61
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,090
no matter what your purpose is to get close to me,

62
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,909
because of you,

63
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,840
I could go through those days.

64
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,050
Tomorrow,

65
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,840
I'll leave here with my father.

66
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,320
I do have a ledger to save Dean Song.

67
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,290
But your father...

68
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,120
Miss Zhu.

69
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,430
Just say it if there's anything.

70
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,160
Don't keep it to yourself.

71
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,260
Why

72
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,380
do I always make things worse?

73
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,350
I can't save my father.

74
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,940
Neither can I save Qinruo.

75
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,930
What exactly can I do?

76
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,360
Everything has nothing to do with you.

77
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,600
You've tried your best.

78
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:09,870
Zhu.

79
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,360
You only need to know

80
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,700
no matter when

81
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,440
or what happens,

82
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,650
I'll always be by your side to protect you.

83
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,390
Your Highness.

84
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,710
I think our son

85
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,750
is under Song Zhu's control.

86
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,390
What a disappointment.

87
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,340
I

88
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,650
have so many advantages he can learn from.

89
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,690
But he just...

90
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,440
Will he not end up like me?

91
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,200
What's wrong with that?

92
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,520
Darling.

93
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,730
Do you think

94
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,070
we should play hard

95
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,550
on him?

96
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,630
I can't let him indulge himself.

97
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,760
Don't you know his temper?

98
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,910
It's no use to play hard.

99
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,670
You want to take a soft approach?

100
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,570
Tomorrow is the execution day of Song Xu.

101
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,760
After tomorrow,

102
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,360
Song Zhu will be mourning for three years.

103
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,130
Let's send her back to the Song Mansion in Yiyang

104
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,950
and settle down with her family.

105
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,010
Three years later,

106
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,970
their relationship will be over.

107
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,160
We must keep an eye on them.

108
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,070
They are still young.

109
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,360
If something more intimate happens between them,

110
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,960
it won't be easy to deal with.

111
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,480
That's right.

112
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,500
You are right.

113
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,280
Yu...

114
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,070
Guard Yu.

115
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,970
Your Highness.

116
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,830
Keep an eye on him.

117
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,010
Don't leave him for a moment.

118
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,270
Report to us

119
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,260
at any time if there's any news.

120
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:11,850
Yes.

121
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,340
Keep a close watch.

122
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,480
Be careful.

123
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,550
Chen Yan.

124
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,080
Are you still there?

125
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,830
Yes.

126
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,980
I'm going to sleep.

127
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,190
Okay.

128
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,910
Tomorrow morning,

129
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,880
I will go to the place of execution to farewell my father.

130
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,850
I don't want him to worry about me.

131
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,040
I will always be with you.

132
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,280
Father asked you to spy on me?

133
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,780
To protect you.

134
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,170
The word sounds disgusting when you say it.

135

[Prince Fu's Mansion]

136
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,720
His Highness went out.

137
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,550
He asked me

138
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,630
to protect you.

139
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,810
My Lady, someone wants to see you.

140
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,470
Who is it?

141
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,050
She's the lady who was here you see you.

142
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,940
You may leave.

143
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,840
I'll go see her myself.

144
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,010
Yes, My Lady.

145
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,120
Wait.

146
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,190
Don't tell my father

147
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,740
about her visit today.

148
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,830
Yes.

[Zhao Mansion]

150

Lady Zhao.

151
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,530
My father will be executed today.

152
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,830
I beg you

153
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,260
to farewell him with me.

154
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,830
I'm sorry, Lady Zhu.

155
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,610
Lady Zhao.

156
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,770
My father has been teaching all his life.

157
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,310
He has never done anything to humiliate the Song's Academy.

158
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,580
But now he's going to be executed unjustly.

159
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,840
I can't change it.

160
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,640
I just hope

161
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,810
the scholars he taught

162
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,260
and my friends

163
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,570
can show him respect during his final moments.

164
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,800
Miss Zhu, what are you doing?

165
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,570
Get up.

166
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,340
I beg you

167
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,610
to farewell him with me

168
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,300
so that he can leave with dignity.

169
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,520
Let him know

170
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:09,030
he left as the dean of Yiyang Academy,

171
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,550
not a corrupt criminal.

172
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,640
I'm sorry, Miss Zhu.

173
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,250
I don't feel well today.

174
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,170
I'm afraid I can't go with you.

175
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,420
Lady Zhao.

176
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,230
Can you really bear

177
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,910
to watch my father die

178
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,350
an unjust death?

179
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

180
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,330
It was your idea to borrow the boat that day.

181
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,490
Then my father was framed.

182
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,540
You must know.

183
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,990
I know nothing.

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,109
Please stand up and tell the truth.

185
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,190
-Miss Zhu, what are you doing?
-Don't let my father die unjustly.

186

Miss Zhu.

187
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,000
-Please stand up...
-I’m sorry.

188
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,170
And tell the truth.

-Don’t let my father die unjustly.
-I’m sorry, Miss Zhu.

190
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,020
Miss Zhu, you...

191
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,700
-Don’t push me, OK?
-Please stand up

00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,859
and tell the truth.

193
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,510
Miss Zhu, I'm sorry.

194
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,440
Don't let my father die unjustly.

195
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,150
Miss Zhu, stop forcing me.

196
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,310
-Lady Zhu, I'm sorry.
-Please...

197
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,640
Stand up and tell the truth.

198
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,830
Don't let my father die unjustly.

199
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,870
Miss Zhu, I'm sorry.

200
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,360
Miss Zhu, I'm sorry.

201
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,400
Please stand up and tell the truth.

202
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,710
Don't let my father die unjustly.

203
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,790
Please stand up and tell the truth.

204
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,670
Don't let my father die unjustly.

205
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,590
Please stand up and tell the truth.

206
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,630
Don't let my father die unjustly.

207
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,830
Look at yourself.

208
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,430
Your Highness.

209
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,170
Are you here to show your superiority?

210
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,690
I am never the viscount in front of you.

211
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,630
I am your roommate,

212
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,360
classmate,

213
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,030
and your friend.

214
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,590
This painting is for you

215
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,440
as a souvenir.

216
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,910
I hope you don't mind.

217
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,260
We're brothers.

218
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,610
Let's not talk about this.

219
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:32,930
Try it.

220
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,180
I'll drink it for him.

221
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,360
I also want to hear

222
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,040
your opinion.

223
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,970
Mr. Zhou, look at mine.

224
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,000
Well...

225
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,280
So at least,

226
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,720
we are friends.

227
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,370
Yes.

228
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,490
You must be joking.

229
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,570
Do you remember the first time we met?

230
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,370
Be careful.

231
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,870
Don't make it difficult for him.

232
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,440
I'll pay for his accommodation.

233
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,600
How ridiculous was I to show off

234
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,580
in front of the viscount?

235
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,980
You were not showing off.

236
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,830
You were responsible as a man.

237
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,730
Zhou Ji.

238
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,130
From a man’s point of view,

239
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,170
you were once a good man who was courageous

240
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,730
and responsible.

241
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,070
A good man?

242
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,090
Don't belittle yourself.

243
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,330
You deserve it.

244
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,210
I've witnessed

245
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,520
your knowledge, literary talent,

246
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,760
and efforts.

247
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
And our relationship as classmates

248
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,160
can't be erased.

249
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,920
I really

250
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,500
treat you as a friend who I truly love.

251
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
You really thought of me as a friend?

252
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:55,770
Yes.

253
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,780
I don't have many friends in my heart.

254
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,320
Besides the Crown Prince,

255
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,550
there's only you.

256
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,420
Zhou Ji.

257
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,990
As a man, you should admit your mistake.

258
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,290
Don't you have any feelings

259
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,040
for the Yiyang Academy?

260
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,060
Don't you have any feelings for Dean Song,

261
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,110
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Chen,

262
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,850
and Instructor Shen?

263
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,910
After today,

264
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,040
Dean Song will be beheaded.

265
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,920
Instructor Shen and Mr. Zhang will be exiled.

266
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,630
Is that what you want?

267
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,670
I...

268
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,400
I'm sorry for Mr. Chen.

269
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,070
I'm sorry.

270
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,060
That night,

271
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,480
I saw Mr. Chen being beaten to death.

272
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,110
I saw it with my own eyes.

273
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,250
But didn't stand up.

274
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,510
I...

275
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,370
I really wanted to stand up.

276
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,410
But I didn't dare to die.

277
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,820
I can't die either.

278
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,460
I want to keep my life

279
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,280
and be a superior person.

280
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,300
That's the reason why I lost my mind.

281
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,140
Because of that thought,

282
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,960
I will regret it for the rest of my life.

283
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,830
Even if you stood up,

284
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,470
you would still be dead.

285
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,060
You have the ledger, right?

286
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,950
Lady Zhao. Please tell the truth.

287
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,840
Don't let my father die unjustly.

288
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,720
Lady Zhao. Please tell the truth.

289
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,610
Don't let my father die unjustly.

290
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,990
Lady Zhao. Please tell the truth.

291
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,890
Don't let my father die unjustly.

292
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,410
Lady Zhao. Please tell the truth.

293
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,300
Don't let my father die unjustly.

294
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,520
Lady Zhao. Please tell the truth.

295
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,410
Don't let my father die unjustly.

296
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,190
Miss Zhu.

297
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,350
Please, Lady Zhao.

298
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,940
Why are you doing this?

299
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,070
This is the only thing

300
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,790
I can do as a daughter.

301
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,950
Lady Zhao. Please tell the truth.

302
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,850
Don't let my father die unjustly.

303
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,310
Lady Zhao. Please tell the truth.

304
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,190
Don't let my father die unjustly.

305
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,920
Lady Zhao. Please tell the truth.

306
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,810
Don't let my father die unjustly.

307
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,490
-Miss Zhu, I beg you.
-Please tell the truth.

308
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,160
-Miss Zhu, I beg you.
-Don’t let my father die unjustly.

309
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,930
No matter what you do,

310
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,210
I know nothing.

311
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,750
Miss Zhu.

312
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,380
Lady Zhao, please tell the truth.

313
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,070
Don't let my father die unjustly.

314
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,150
Miss Zhu, stop forcing me.

315
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,790
Don't force me.

316
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,630
I beg you.

317
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,330
I know

318
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,910
you know

319
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,220
my father was wronged.

320
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,220
But can you really stand idly by

321
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,530
while my father dies,

322
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,280
not caring about me

323
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,400
dying in front of your house?

324
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,300
Mr. Song.

325
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,210
This is your last meal.

326
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:18,930
Have some.

327
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,280
You can't be a starving ghost.

328
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,480
Miss Zhu.

329
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,480
Miss Zhu.

330
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,950
Go save my father!

331
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,940
[Supreme Court]

332
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,520
I can prove Dean Song's innocence.

333
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,480
Let me in.

334
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
I beg you.

335
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,190
My father was wronged.

336
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,850
I can prove Dean Song's innocence.

337
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,520
Let me in.

338
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,110
You can't go in.

339
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,310
I beg you.

340
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,520
-My father was wronged.
-Sir.

341
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,150
Stop!

342
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,170
They are my friends.

343
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,800
Greet the viscount.

344
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,880
Greetings, Your Highness.

345
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,810
The viscount?

346
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,990
You are the viscount?

347
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,120
I can prove that Dean Song was wronged.

348
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,420
I followed my father's arrangement

349
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,100
and borrowed the boat from Song Zhu with Yan Qinruo as an excuse.

350
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,060
Guards!

351
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,970
Take this lady to take her statement.

352
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,330
Yes.

353
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,350
Hurry up.

354
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,910
Let's go.

355
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,620
My father...

356
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,820
Is it too late? My father...

357
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,790
Don't worry.

358
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,910
I'm here.

359
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,160
This ledger

360
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,100
records the truth of the corruption case.

361
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,680
It can clear Dean Song's name.

362
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,000
I know

363
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,250
I'm in no position to make any request.

364
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,270
But I want to beg you.

365
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,420
I can only beg you.

366
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,040
Please help

367
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,200
take care of Feiniang

368
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,930
because we used to be friends.

369
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,860
Where are you going?

370
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,580
I can't keep making mistakes.

371
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,940
I betrayed Qinruo.

372
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,280
I have to make up for her with my life.

373
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,700
She wants to be exiled with her father.

374
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,000
I'll go with her.

375
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,910
But I can't bring my sister to suffer.

376
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,740
Are you going to the border with Yan Qinruo?

377
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,600
I don't know

378
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,260
if she will give me the chance.

379
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,300
But I must do this.

380
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,870
You're quite responsible.

381
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,880
Don’t worry.

382
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,270
I’ll take care of Zhou Fei.

383
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,110
Chen Yan.

384
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,440
Thank you.

385
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,720
Thank you

386
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,760
for giving me a chance to atone.

387
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,680
I don't want to see anything happen to Dean Song.

388
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,410
I'll leave the rest

389
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,830
to you.

390
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,040
I'll go to His Majesty today

391
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,930
to beg him to cancel the execution

392
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,350
and send the case back for retrial.

393
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,300
I'm sorry for Miss Zhu.

394
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,070
I hope after this,

395
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,160
you can give her happiness.

396
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:44,900
Of course.

397
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,500
I'm leaving.

398
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,400
Take care.

399
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,660
Take care.

400
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,610
Why is Chen Yan

401
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,880
so nosy?

402
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,260
He cares about whether Song Xu is wronged.

403
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,520
He will take care of his friend's family.

404
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,440
I also heard that

405
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,880
he's trying to get the officials' support for tax reform.

406
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,160
I'm so mad.

407
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,340
Why

408
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,330
is he so nosy?

409
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,280
Isn't he afraid that I'll worry?

410
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,250
Does he

411
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,090
act like a viscount?

412
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,070
Your Highness.

413
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,150
May I ask,

414
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,530
in your heart,

415
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,480
what a viscount should be like?

416
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,700
[Zhao Mansion]

417
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,910
Cautious.

418
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,180
Cautious.

419
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,340
I usually

420
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,570
tell you the most about being cautious.

421
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,130
How did this happen?

422
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,520
Lord Zhao.

423
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,290
I told you

424
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,010
to find someone else to get this done.

425
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,120
Then kill that person afterwards.

426
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,010
Then everything will be settled.

427
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,960
No matter what,

428
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,440
I never thought that unfilial daughter

429
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,280
would stand up

430
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,570
to fight against her father because of Song Xu.

431
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,770
You...

432
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,260
The case of Song Xu is undergoing a retrial today.

433
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:32,840
The opinions

434
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,760
on the tax reform in the court changed immediately.

435
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,800
The officials who opposed the reform

436
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,260
are now supporting it.

437
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,530
If his daughter confesses everything,

438
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,080
we

439
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,150
can’t escape unscathed.

440
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,190
Lord Zhao.

441
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,120
How much more does your daughter know?

442
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,560
I don't know either.

443
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,250
Don't you know your daughter?

444
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,610
But...

445
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,190
I searched in the house.

446
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,510
The letters between me and Duke Yue and Lord Zuo

447
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,780
were all lost.

448
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,600
What?

449
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,930
What's the content of the letters?

450
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,150
It's about

451
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,050
the distribution of benefits from tax evasion.

452
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,030
Also...

453
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,780
Also,

454
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,200
the secret orders from you.

455
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,520
Why didn't you burn them?

456
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,390
I was going to...

457
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,710
To make it a life-saving Charm

458
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,000
when necessary.

459
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,100
Bastard, now it’s a killing charm.

460
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,600
Zhao...

461
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,640
Lord Zhao.

462
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,420
Your actions will kill us, Lord Zhao.

463
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,570
-I…
-You…

464
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,520
I know I'm sorry.

465
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,110
How can I make up for it?

466
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,940
Officer Wan. Please think of a way.

467
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,220
I'm willing to do anything.

468
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,800
Mr. Song,

469
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,989
someone asked me to bring you this bottle of wine.

470
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,020
If you don't drink it,

471
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,580
we will send it to your son.

472
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,880
Anyway, someone

473
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,489
must drink it tonight.

474
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,949
They can't wait, right?

475
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,920
Okay.

476
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,639
Let me drink it.

477
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,370
Thank you, Mr. Song.

478
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,760
I'm late.

479
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,820
Please forgive me.

480
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,980
Arrest this bold servant.

481
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,060
Mr. Song.

482
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,020
His Majesty wants to see you.

483
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,370
Please.

484
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,540
Greetings, Your Majesty.

485
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,160
Rise.

486
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,590
Get up, Mr. Song.

487
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:25,810
Thank you.

488
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,960
Have a seat.

489
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,430
Mr. Song.

490
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,260
Take a look.

491
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,430
Is there a solution to this game?

492
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,200
You can lure the tiger out and take over the cave, then you will win.

493
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:52,880
Wonderful.

494
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,220
Your Majesty is not a chess player,

495
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,550
but an observer.

496
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,330
Unfortunately, you don't like to be an official.

497
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,340
Otherwise, you can help me rule the world.

498
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,520
I'm obsessed with the academy.

499
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,300
I just want to educate people

500
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,280
and cultivate pillars for the court.

501
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,410
Good.

502
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,110
Then I will fulfill your wish.

503
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,750
I've decided

504
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,940
to reopen Yiyang Academy.

505
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,970
You're welcome, Sir.

506
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,050
Get out of the way!

507
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,170
Move! Move!

508
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,190
What are you doing?

509
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,860
Move!

510
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Get out of the way!

511
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,450
Bastard!

512
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,690
Move!

513
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,520
Move!

514
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,110
Get out of the way!

515
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,250
Qinruo!

516
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,580
Yueniang.

517
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,630
How could you leave only a letter and then leave?

518
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,930
Do you know how sad I would be

519
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,150
if I didn't see you?

520
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,830
Qinruo.

521
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,650
I can't bear to part with you.

522
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,840
Me too, Yueniang.

523
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,760
After we part today,

524
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,400
I don't know when we can meet again.

525
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,940
You must

526
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,090
take good care of yourself.

527
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,030
Yueniang, don't worry.

528
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,800
No.

529
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,370
You must take good care of Qinruo.

530
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,760
I will protect her with my life.

531
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,620
I'll take care of Zhou Fei for you.

532
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,390
You take care of Qinruo for me.

533
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,360
Miss Zhu. Thank you.

534
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,900
We're friends.

535
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,660
No need to thank me.

536
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,610
Aren't you going to say goodbye to me?

537
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,550
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

538
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,240
If you take good care of Yueniang,

539
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,850
when we meet again, we will still be friends.

540
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,720
If you hurt my Yueniang,

541
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,030
I won't spare you.

542
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,110
Do you hear that?

543
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,130
I dare not let her suffer.

544
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,740
Don't worry.

545
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,220
Your Yueniang is also my Yueniang.

546
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,750
I will take good care of her.

547
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,040
Take good care of yourself.

548
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:31,990
I will.

549
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,960
It's getting late. Let's hurry.

550
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,290
I'm leaving.

551
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,470
Chen Yan.

552
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,630
Take out

553
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,470
the most valuable things on you.

554
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,310
Yueniang, no need.

555
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,320
No.

556
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,270
-Yueniang.
-No.

557
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,380
If you suffer during the trip,

558
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,490
I'll be worried.

559
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:56,900
Take care.

560
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,740
I'm leaving.

561
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Silly girl.

562
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,480
See you again.

563
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,400
See you again.

564
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,350
Yueniang.

565
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,650
I'm leaving.

566
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,630
Go back.

567
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,830
Take good care of Zhou Ji.

568
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,010
Take good care of Yueniang.

569
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,030
