00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,039
[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,680
[Episode 3]

4
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,600
You look familiar.

5
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,910
Are you the third daughter of the Song family in Yiyang?

6
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,390
You must have mistaken me

7
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,230
for someone else.

8
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,840
The Song family is famous.

9
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,350
The ladies of the Song family are famous for their virtues,

10
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,759
especially the third daughter.

11
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,210
How am I comparable with her?

12
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,570
How could you be so shameless to say that?

13
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,170
I see.

14
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,130
But this door is thick and heavy.

15
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,579
Are you a martial arts master?

16
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,480
How could you be so destructive?

17
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,440
Well…

18
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,680
It happened suddenly.

19
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,840
I don't know why

20
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,550
the door fell off

21
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,920
when I came nearby.

22
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,890
Mr. Xiao, you don't know.

23
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,579
The door was broken before.

24
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,730
It just hasn't been repaired yet.

25
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,120
Mr. Xiao, don't be too harsh on this lady.

26
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,450
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

27
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,930
You...

28
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,230
You know me?

29
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,180
No, I don't.

30
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,350
I just heard that gentleman calling your name.

31
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,000
Did he?

32
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,010
Probably…

33
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,560
I heard you

34
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,630
calling my name just now.

35
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,829
You know me?

36
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,700
Since the door is fixed,

37
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,720
I shall leave you two alone.

38
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,320
Take care.

39
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,170
Miss, let me…

40
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,510
send you off…

41
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,260
No, thanks.

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,150
Miss, keep fixing it.

43
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,660
I'll fix the door.

44
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,720
No need.

45
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,310
I'll discuss with the landlord

46
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,050
and find a new place for you guys.

47
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,230
I'll pay for the accommodation.

48
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,180
How can we accept that?

49
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,870
Why not?

50
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,060
Let’s go.

51
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,910
Mr. Zhou, please wait here.

52
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,390
I’ll go with him.

53
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,860
Take care.

54
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,690
-Stand still.
-What are you doing?

55
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,050
You shameless bastard! Are you trying to go against me?

56
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,550
How can a person like you

57
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,870
deserve to live with Mr. Zhou?

58
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,240
I didn't expect the daughter of the Song family who's famous for her virtue

59
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,770
is so rude

60
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,480
and has such a bad character.

61
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,900
You're even thinking about another man.

62
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,850
How dare you blame me?

63
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,310
I...

64
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,300
What?

65
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,180
You chased after me

66
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,950
in front of so many people today.

67
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,230
It's a blessing to you that I didn't report it to the police.

68
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,560
-You...
-What?

69
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,930
I suggest that

70
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,960
you return the letter to me,

71
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,820
then I'll give it a second thought.

72
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,010
If I'm in a good mood,

73
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,610
I won't hold you accountable.

74
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,320
You want that letter, right?

75
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,760
Then give my letter back to me.

76
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,550
Otherwise, end of story.

77
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:52,550
Fine.

78
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,420
I've thought about it.

79
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,480
There's no need for us to fight.

80
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,440
As for the letter...

81
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,100
It's easy.

82
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,310
You're giving in?

83
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,950
I came to Yiyang this time

84
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,190
to take the entrance exam of the academy.

85
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,270
I'll also drop by and visit Mr. Song.

86
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,780
Unfortunately, we had a few conflicts.

87
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,090
I'm also responsible

88
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,190
for what have happened.

89
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,510
Why don't we both take a step back

90
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,670
and get along peacefully?

91
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,400
What do you think?

92
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,880
You are a bit weird.

93
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,230
You're the one who started this,

94
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,760
and now you're trying to make peace.

95
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,320
Fine.

96
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,530
I’m not an unreasonable person.

97
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,950
As long as you cancel the engagement

98
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,130
and return the letter to me,

99
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,130
we'll be in peace.

100
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,830
This engagement is the order of our parents.

101
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,870
How can I cancel it?

102
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,180
It's none of my business.

103
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,140
Since you raised the request,

104
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,800
you have to do as I said.

105
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,180
Fine.

106
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,140
Give me back the letter.

107
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,790
After I see Mr. Song,

108
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,820
I'll tell him as you said.

109
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,000
Fine.

110
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,430
But what if you go back on your word

111
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,130
after I agree?

112
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,290
Besides, I don't know if you have the letter.

113
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,750
[To Xiao Yu]

114
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,860
Do you believe me this time?

115
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,710
I believe you.

116
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,840
Luckily I was quick.

117
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,900
-You want to steal it from me?
-Give it back!

118
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,650
Give it back!

119
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,340
No.

120
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,950
Give it back.

121
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,420
What?

122
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,010
Return…

123
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,920
I'm taking it.

124
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,510
Why should I give it back?

125
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,550
Give it back to me!

126
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,230
Give it back!

127
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,120
Don't try to take it from me.

128
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,740
So you were at a disadvantage.

129
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,930
Right.

130
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,300
Although we are engaged,

131
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,740
well...

132
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,680
Come here! Hurry!

133
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,880
Lower your voice.

134
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,010
I'm telling you.

135
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,840
You're ruining my reputation like this.

136
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,720
Shameless!

137
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,580
Same to you.

138
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,030
What are you doing?

139
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,850
Listen.

140
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,350
Honey trap doesn't work on me.

141
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,450
No.

142
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,070
I'm just curious.

143
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,030
Why do you care so much about that letter?

144
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,730
Is it very important to you?

145
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,020
It's just a family letter,

146
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,390
but it means a lot to me.

147
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,090
Anyway, it's useless to you.

148
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,250
In that case,

149
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,730
you should focus on your exam.

150
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,340
The letter is not important anyway.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,260
Pay the rent first.

152
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,390
Then I can only be kicked out

153
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,940
with Mr. Zhou.

154
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,690
Just now in the corridor…

155
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:18,810
Mr. Zhou.

156
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,410
What did you see?

157
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,160
I...

158
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,520
No matter what you saw,

159
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,580
it was a misunderstanding.

160
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,950
Just pretend that you didn't see it.

161
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,060
There you go, Mr. Xiao.

162
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:35,970
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

163
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,860
Mr. Xiao.

164
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,440
Why did you say

165
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,110
that lady is the third daughter of the Song family?

166
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,250
I met the third daughter of the Song family several times before.

167
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,350
Mr. Xiao, mind your words.

168
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,620
I heard that the Song family is quite famous in Yiyang.

169
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,780
Besides, we came here

170
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,570
to take the entrance exam of the Yiyang Academy.

171
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,560
I'm afraid it'll cause trouble for us

172
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,480
if we slander the Song family by accident.

173
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,610
Slander?

174
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,250
I don't know who is slandering whom,

175
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,060
judging from her behavior today.

176
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,790
Today, she chased after me on the street.

177
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,540
She knocked over a wooden shelf by accident

178
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,440
and splashed paint on her.

179
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,080
Look at the colors on her.

180
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,370
And just now…

181
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,180
Forget it.

182
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,750
Then why did she pester you?

183
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,490
Is she crazy?

184
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,780
Mr. Xiao, you had such a conflict with the Song family.

185
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,200
I'm not sure

186
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,750
if it'll have a bad impact on your exam result.

187
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,410
I was careless.

188
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,640
I must do well this time.

189
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,050
Right.

190
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,090
The academy's recruitment is strict.

191
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,350
They even assigned students at different locations to take exams.

192
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,260
Right.

193
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,500
Mr. Xiao, which room are you in?

194
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,630
I'm at Room Jie.

195
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,100
Who is it?

196
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,830
I'm in the same exam room as yours.

197
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,800
What's wrong, Mr. Xiao?

198
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,050
Nothing.

199
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,370
I just remembered something.

200
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,890
Mr. Zhou, you can go in first.

201
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,500
Pay attention to the time.

202
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,390
Don't miss the exam.

203
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:49,930
Okay.

204
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,350
What do you want?

205
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,170
I thought about it carefully.

206
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,520
I was very wrong yesterday.

207
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:08,740
That's why

208
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,000
I came to apologize to you early in the morning.

209
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,460
Are you trying to ruin my exam?

210
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,980
Of course not.

211
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,530
I thought about it.

212
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,410
It's really hard for you to cancel the engagement,

213
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,450
so I won't stop you from taking the exam

214
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,140
or visiting my father.

215
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,160
It's just

216
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,380
can you not tell my father

217
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,170
about the letter I wrote?

218
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,450
Fine.

219
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,210
Also, tell Mr. Xiao that you've met me

220
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,740
but we didn't get along well,

221
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,420
so you don't want to continue our engagement. How about that?

222
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,800
Give me some time to think about it.

223
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,220
Why do you need to think about it?

224
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,180
Do you want to marry me?

225
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,260
No, not really.

226
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,200
That's it.

227
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,170
It's good for both of us to cancel the engagement.

228
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,330
Right?

229
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,950
I have to take the exam now.

230
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,780
After the exam,

231
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,260
I'll tell my father about this.

232
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,350
Okay.

233
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,850
I won't disturb you.

234
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,330
Why are you following me?

235
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,790
I'm not following you.

236
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,540
I'm on the way to the academy.

237
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,220
Didn't you say you are going to take the exam?

238
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,610
Where are you going?

239
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,660
Room Jie.

240
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,980
Over there.

241
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,330
[Jie]

242
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,600
What are you waiting for?

243
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,790
It'll be too late if you don't go now.

244
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,570
It's rare to see you so kind.

245
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,170
Goodbye.

246
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,050
The classroom must be inside.

247
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,840
It should be the exam room.

248
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,660
How can you study well

249
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,310
if you can't be punctual?

250
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,950
Has the exam started?

251
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm late.

252
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,000
Please forgive me, sir.

253
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,720
Please give me a second chance to take the exam.

254
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,310
Why are they all women?

255
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,890
Because this is a woman's academy.

256
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,950
What a handsome guy.

257
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,380
Yan Qinruo.

258
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,490
You know him?

259
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,830
Sir.

260
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,280
No, I don't.

261
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,350
Then why did you come up?

262
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,010
That's right.

263
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,520
So embarrassing.

264
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,640
Who are you?

265
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,520
How dare you break into a women's academy?

266
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,670
I'm student Xiao Yu.

267
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,280
I came to take this year's entrance exam of the academy.

268
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:14,099
I got lost when I was looking for the exam room

269
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,079
and ended up here.

270
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,790
Good for you.

271
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,180
Everyone knows that the women's academy is located at the back of the mountain.

272
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,740
I've never seen Mr. Chen so strict.

273
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,089
I think

274
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,180
you just care about that young man.

275
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:31,920
What are you talking about?

276
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,440
We women are weak.

277
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,300
Of course our teacher should be strict with

278
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,680
those men who covet the women's academy.

279
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,800
Mr. Chen may seem gentle,

280
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,710
but he's as strong

281
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,580
as Instructor Shen.

282
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,510
The Dean chose him to be a teacher for female students

283
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,440
because he's smart and strong.

284
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,840
I'm telling the truth.

285
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,830
Please trust me.

286
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,190
You said there was a road sign.

287
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,480
Can you take me there?

288
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,190
I'm willing to lead the way for you.

289
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,160
Please.

290
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,100
Let me see what you can do.

291
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,710
Sir, please.

292
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,200
Sir.

293
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,380
Sir, look.

294
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,020
I need to go to the exam room Jie,

295
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,230
but this road sign here…

296
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,420
What else do you want to say?

297
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,270
I must have been set up by Song Zhu.

298
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,570
With all due respect,

299
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,270
I might have had some conflicts

300
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,560
with Song Zhu from the Song family

301
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,530
this time I came to Yiyang.

302
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,590
I believe that

303
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,730
she can explain.

304
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,890
Are you talking nonsense or are you sure about it?

305
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,490
I dare not talk nonsense.

306
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:57,890
Sir.

307
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,540
The exam is about to start.

308
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,850
Can you let me go first?

309
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,200
I'll come to explain to you after the exam.

310
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,820
Go ahead.

311
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,920
Thank you, sir.

312
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,620
Stop!

313
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,550
[The high hill is looked up to.]

314
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,860
Sir.

315
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,210
Those who miss the exam time

316
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,940
must not enter.

317
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,330
Sir, I've been in there once.

318
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,860
I just went out to the restroom.

319
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,850
Look.

320
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,280
Don't drink too much water before the exam.

321
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,580
-Okay.
-Go in.

322
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,450
Thank you, sir.

323
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,120
Sir.

324
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,350
Now you can remember people's looks?

325
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,770
What are you doing here

326
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,220
instead of of invigilating the exam?

327
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,060
Hurry.

328
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,530
Yes.

329
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,870
So this invigilator can't remember people's looks.

330
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,490
That's good.

331
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,160
Stop!

332
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,880
Come here.

333
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,540
Those who miss the exam time

334
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,180
must not enter.

335
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,190
Sir, you misunderstood.

336
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,170
I entered the exam room once.

337
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,700
I just went out to the restroom

338
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,640
with that guy.

339
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,740
Have you forgotten?

340
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,970
You also went out to the restroom?

341
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,920
I dare not lie to you.

342
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,130
Sir.

343
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,030
You took me into the exam room.

344
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,740
I was greeting you.

345
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,570
It's just that you were busy.

346
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,950
It's normal that you don't remember me.

347
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,610
It's okay.

348
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,020
So what if I live in a shabby shelter, have nothing to eat and come a long way?

349
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,260
It's time.

350
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:06,890
It's life.

351
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:07,850
Wait.

352
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,740
Let me see.

353
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,120
No.

354
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:14,890
Left.

355
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,960
Stop acting.

356
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,360
Let me tell you what I mean.

357
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,090
Come with me.

358
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,270
Everyone, raise your head.

359
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,890
Take a look.

360
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,860
Look carefully.

361
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,610
Do you see it clearly?

362
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,370
Before every student came in,

363
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,360
I drew a dot on their faces.

364
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,470
I admit

365
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,460
I have prosopagnosia.

366
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,350
This is a brilliant idea I came up with

367
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,920
to deal with those sneaky people.

368
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,320
Sir, do you need help?

369
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,200
Mr. Song.

370
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,570
Didn't I ask you to invigilate the exam?

371
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,010
Why are you back?

372
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,750
I've already taken a round here.

373
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,200
Come here.

374
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,010
Look at you.

375
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,840
You have nothing on your face.

376
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,120
How dare you lie to me?

377
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,520
Listen.

378
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,810
The Yiyang Academy is famous.

379
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,490
Do you think you can get in

380
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,780
by playing some tricks?

381
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,220
Go away.

382
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,270
Sir, please calm down.

383
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,250
Sir.

384
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,550
Please take a closer look.

385
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,930
Closer…

386
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,700
Wait.

387
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,970
It wasn't there just now.

388
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,230
Sir, you're mistaken.

389
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,300
Actually, I always had this on my face.

390
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,400
You made it yourself.

391
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,480
Could that be wrong?

392
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,100
I made it?

393
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,790
You made it.

394
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,550
Sir.

395
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,550
The exam is starting.

396
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,860
The exam is starting.

397
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,550
Alright, get in there.

398
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,510
What are you waiting for?

399
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,020
Invigilate the exam.

400
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,670
Yes.

401
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,840
Well…

402
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,470
You didn't see Mr. Chen.

403
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,940
I could tell

404
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,790
that he was furious.

405
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,220
Although I don't know

406
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,250
who he really is,

407
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,020
judging from his appearance, clothes

408
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,350
and extraordinary temperament,

409
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,100
I've already had some clues.

410
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,280
You...

411
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,300
If you want to know what happened next, stay tuned.

412
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,170
Sir.

413
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,230
Sir.

414
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,030
Mr. Zhang.

415
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,130
Mr. Chen,

416
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,590
what brings you here?

417
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,090
I have something to tell you.

418
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,460
You...

419
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,040
It's him.

420
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,940
I want to have some words with him. I'll leave after that.

421
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,040
You want to take him out?

422
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:46,900
Yes.

423
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:48,880
I'm afraid you can't.

424
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,990
The exam is not over.

425
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,460
Isn't it against the rules?

426
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,250
I'm almost done.

427
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,360
Song Zhu.

428
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,120
Why did you came to the men's academy?

429
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,610
Mr. Chen.

430
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,860
You broke the rules by breaking into the exam room.

431
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,870
Now you even brought a female student to a men's academy.

432
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,620
Female student?

433
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,170
Silence!

434
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,920
Silence!

435
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,570
Silence!

436
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,890
Silence!

437
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,990
This is a men's academy.

438
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,100
Leave here with your female student as soon as possible.

439
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,820
Get out of here!

440
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,240
-Hurry up.
-Mr. Zhang.

441
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,160
The students are in an exam.

442
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,540
It's inappropriate for us

443
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,570
to argue like this.

444
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,430
You broke the rules first.

445
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,130
Aren't you afraid

446
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,580
the Dean will hear about this?

447
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,270
This is about the exam.

448
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
If this goes wrong,

449
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,070
I'll take the blame from the Dean.

450
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,240
It's none of your business.

451
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,820
Excuse me.

452
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,850
Come with me.

453
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,730
Let's go.

454
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,870
How dare you!

455
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,930
Words from you guys are contradictory.

456
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,050
Come on. Explain.

457
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,180
Who's right and who's wrong.

458
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,250
Xiao Yu, you're really something.

459
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,150
How dare you report it to the teacher?

460
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,400
Song Zhu, I thought you really wanted to make peace.

461
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,150
In the end, you're just playing tricks.

462
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,120
A gentleman should keep his word.

463
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,510
I overestimated you.

464
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,850
Sir, I don't know him.

465
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,960
What do you mean by

466
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,670
contradictory words?

467
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,980
You really don't recognize me?

468
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,050
Just now, you and I entered the academy together.

469
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,310
At the corner,

470
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,340
you asked me where my exam room is

471
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,480
and pointed out the direction of the women's academy to me.

472
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,380
You are really something.

473
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,290
How dare you tell on me?

474
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,220
Since you messed with me on purpose,

475
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,110
I can't just sit and do nothing.

476
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,310
After hearing what you said,

477
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,590
you do look familiar.

478
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,420
But I only remember

479
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,550
I showed you the way

480
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,600
because your exam was about to start.

481
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,380
As for the women's academy,

482
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,700
I really know nothing about it.

483
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,450
Can I ask you a question?

484
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,080
Please.

485
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,880
Where did you go after we separated?

486
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,290
I went to study.

487
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,460
You're from the Song family.

488
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,790
I'm sure you can find the way even with your eyes closed.

489
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,380
Since you went to study at the women's academy,

490
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,120
why didn't I see you come along?

491
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,000
How can you explain that?

492
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,170
You cunning boy.

493
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,110
Cunning?

494
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,410
Do you want me to show this letter to the teacher as well?

495
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,730
Sir.

496
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,730
I just remembered

497
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,390
I may have accidentally hit the road sign

498
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,800
so I pointed the wrong way for him.

499
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,890
I made such a mistake

500
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,690
because I was in a hurry to go to class.

501
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,660
It's my fault.

502
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,890
Xiao Yu.

503
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,700
I've apologized.

504
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,390
Could you please forgive me?

505
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,450
Then I'll give you another chance.

506
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,170
Sir, I've thought about it.

507
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,940
I did miss the exam time.

508
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,030
She did it for my own good.

509
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,490
That's why she made a mistake accidently.

510
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,860
I know I was wrong

511
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,550
by accidentally entering the women's academy.

512
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,870
I’d take the punishment, sir.

513
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:23,790
Senior.

514
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,850
I didn't behave well just now.

515
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,550
Please forgive me.

516
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,920
Since you're so sincere,

517
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,710
I won't blame you anymore.

518
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,460
Okay.

519
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,430
Since it was a misunderstanding

520
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,490
and you also reflected on yourself…

521
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,390
It's good to acknowledge your mistake.

522
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,860
Go ahead.

523
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,180
Thank you, sir.

524
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,860
I'll keep your words in mind.

525
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,200
I hope I can pass the entrance exam and get enrolled as soon as possible,

526
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,230
so that I can learn more from you.

527
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,560
Senior.

528
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,360
Goodbye.

529
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,510
Goodbye.

530
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,940
Sir, I didn't do it on purpose.

531
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,170
Please forgive me, sir.

532
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,310
Don't do it again.

533
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,000
Thank you, sir.

534
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,180
Unfortunately, I know no one in the academy.

535
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,170
Otherwise, I can ask someone to ask around.

536
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,090
I do know someone

537
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,940
in the academy.

538
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,270
Maybe he can help.

539
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,700
Who is it?

540
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,580
By then...

541
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,570
Come here.

542
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,690
I'll ask him to find out

543
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,500
and tell me, then I'll tell you.

544
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,270
Okay.

545
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,930
But you can't tell others.

546
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,780
It's only among us here around this table.

547
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,060
Are you still thinking about that student?

548
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,240
Nonsense.

549
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,240
I'm not.

550
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,090
I, Yan Qinruo,

551
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,440
am always the one who is missed.

552
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,350
How could I miss him?

553
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,670
But I wonder if that student

554
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,810
made it in time for the literature exam.

555
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,280
The archery exam is tomorrow.

556
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,980
If he passes the literature exam,

557
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,070
he will go to the martial arts test.

558
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,820
So in the martial arts test…

559
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,030
Right.

560
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,480
Zhao.

561
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,570
Go to the martial arts test with me tomorrow.

562
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,170
I probably can't go.

563
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,970
I haven't finished my music homework.

564
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,020
I'm gonna go.

565
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,550
Don't.

566
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,350
Let me try your dish.

567
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,750
-Yours.
-Okay.

568
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,740
How's that? Let's go over there.

569
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,900
-And yours.-Not too bad.

570
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,620
Try it.

571
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,220
It's delicious.

572
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:02,920
Yueniang.

573
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:04,890
Yueniang.

574
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:05,740
Eat this.

575
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,910
I'll sit here.

576
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,170
Yueniang.

577
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,590
Let me help you.

578
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,460
Here, eat up.

579
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,110
Yueniang.

580
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,420
Can you accompany me to the martial arts test tomorrow?

581
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,240
No.

582
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,380
Please come with me.

583
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,700
I heard that

584
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,980
there's a handsome guy

585
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,990
this time

586
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,910
at the men's academy.

587
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,710
Who is it?

588
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,930
You won’t know him even if I tell you,

589
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,520
but I heard his surname is Xiao.

590
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,910
Are you talking about

591
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,510
the pervert this morning?

592
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,380
Yueniang, how could you call him that?

593
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,590
He explained it.

594
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,110
That was an accident.

595
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,680
An accident?

596
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,910
Qinruo, listen.

597
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,690
You can't judge people only by their appearance.

598
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,590
You have to look at their characters.

599
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,070
One's character is the most important.

600
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,050
You sound like you know him well.

601
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:56,600
I...

602
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,480
I met him several times.

603
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,330
You've met

604
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,140
all the new students.

605
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,100
Good for you.

606
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,070
I...

607
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,630
I'm telling you, I don't want to…

608
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,510
I don't want to

609
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,280
have anything to do with him in my entire life.

610
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,950
Really?

611
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,280
Yes.

612
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,030
Eat more.

613
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,900
That pervert behaves recklessly and is rude.

614
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,560
I hate him so much when I think of him.

615
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,370
I advise you to stay away from him.

616
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,850
I don't want to listen to you.

617
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,230
By the way,

618
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,220
you and your beloved Mr. Zhou...

619
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,220
Don’t you want to…

620
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,410
It's so funny.

621
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,530
Eat up.

622
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,870
I told you.

623
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,340
I just like his paintings.

624
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,140
No way.

625
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,590
If you keep liking his paintings only

626
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,480
like this,

627
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,500
I'm telling you,

628
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,100
he will be taken away.

629
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,440
Well, I want to get something.

630
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,340
Get whom? I'm good at getting people.

631
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:55,860
Let me help you.

632
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,660
I want to get something else. You didn't get it.

633
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,450
What do you want to get?

634
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,860
What are you doing?

635
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,970
-I’m sorry.
-Why are you so careless?

636
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,250
Let me take you to wash up.

637
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,250
Okay.

638
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:09,659
Let's go.

639
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,469
Getting the letter back will be so easy this time.

640
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,310
Senior Song.

641
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,280
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

642
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,080
Please come in.

643
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,770
I brought some food

644
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,260
to apologize to you two.

645
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,190
Where did you get the food?

646
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,630
Is there any problem in the food?

647
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,790
I cooked it myself.

648
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,150
I hope you'll like it.

649
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,310
You can cook?

650
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,680
Of course.

651
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,650
Kids, time to eat.

652
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,670
Why are there some dishes missing?

653
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,250
You are so kind and virtuous.

654
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,820
Thank you for your compliment.

655
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:56,820
By the way,

656
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,340
I didn't dare to face you yesterday because of my inappropriate behavior.

657
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,890
Please forgive me.

658
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,600
What happened yesterday has passed.

659
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,550
Don't worry about it.

660
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,600
Mr. Zhou is so generous.

661
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,840
I really appreciate it.

662
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,940
Shouldn't you thank me too?

663
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,010
If I hadn't stopped you in time

664
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,580
so you could compensate the landlord for this door,

665
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:25,140
I'm afraid the reputation of the Song family would have been ruined by you.

666
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,170
Mr. Xiao, just eat.

667
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,320
The food is getting cold.

668
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,950
Mr. Zhou, please.

669
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,950
Thank you. I can do it myself.

670
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,290
Aren't you here to apologize to the two of us?

671
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,190
What do you mean?

672
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,570
I'm here to negotiate peace.

673
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,080
Is this a peace negotiation?

674
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,530
This is an accident.

675
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,530
Mr. Xiao, eat up. The dishes are getting cold.

676
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,200
Mr. Zhou.

677
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,380
Thank you.

678
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,340
Mr. Zhou, how does it taste?

679
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,380
Do you like it?

680
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,390
It's delicious.

681
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,340
Words can't express how delicious it is.

682
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,620
There you go. Eat more.

683
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,430
Thank you.

684
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,210
The ingredients are all good,

685
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,610
but the heat and the amount of salt

686
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:42,930
could have been better.

687
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,010
That said,

688
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,770
it's good enough though.

689
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,490
Mr. Xiao.

690
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,200
Which dish do you think is the best?

691
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,240
If I must say,

692
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,570
the rice is very good.

693
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,580
Then enjoy your rice.

694
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,700
Mr. Zhou, there you go.

695
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,250
Mr. Xiao may not have been adapted to the new environment.

696
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,970
Don't be angry.

697
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,410
I'm fine.

698
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,100
I'm not angry.

699
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:33,140
There you go.

700
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:33,920
Thank you.

701
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,180
Senior.

702
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,420
After eating your food,

703
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,280
we can't trouble you anymore.

704
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,330
Let me do it.

705
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,430
Are you going to watch

706
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,350
Mr. Zhou clean it up alone?

707
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,210
It doesn’t matter.

708
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,120
You're right.

709
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,530
I won't look at him.

710
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,350
You...

711
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:28,850
I...

712
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,580
You eventually

713
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,860
spilt the soup on me.

714
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,900
Sorry, Mr. Xiao.

715
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,000
I was careless.

716
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,910
Let me clean it for you.

717
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,190
You...

718
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,060
Well…

719
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:50,850
Give it to me.

720
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,110
Senior Song, you're really meticulous.

721
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,600
Don't bother.

722
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,630
I’ll get changed.

723
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,870
By the way, Mr. Zhou,

724
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,390
it came to me that I happen to have a perfume with me

725
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,600
which can remove the smell of oil.

726
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,370
I'll send it to Mr. Xiao.

727
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,060
Are you looking for this?
