[Episode 10]

4
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,100
What is this?

5
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,070
Are you okay?

6
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,760
Xiao Yu.

7
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,380
Come on.

8
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,720
Don't touch me.

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,930
Are you okay?

10
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,550
Are you okay?

11
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,380
She...

12
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,750
Maybe she was scared.

13
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,600
I don't know what happened to her.

14
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,310
Miss Yi.

15
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,150
You're here.

16
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,310
I... I've been waiting for you.

17
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,470
Song Yi asked me to return this to you.

18
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,150
And

19
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,010
fireworks are forbidden in our academy.

20
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,630
Well. My...

21
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,060
My father asked me to set off fireworks.

22
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,500
My father doesn't allow it.

23
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,670
How about...

24
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,960
Who's there?

25
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,190
Who's there?

26
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,290
Come out now.

27
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,750
I'll scream if you don't come out.

28
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,170
You.

29
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,150
Mother.

30
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,960
Yueniang.

31
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,540
You're still up at this hour?

32
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,930
So you know it's so late.

33
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,159
You are a girl. But you are so messy.

34
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,820
Where did you go?

35
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,550
You mean I'm a mess, right?

36
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,170
So you know you are a mess.

37
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,980
Who again?

38
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,510
Brother Li?

39
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,560
Song Li?

40
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,890
Song Li.

41
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,900
You've learned to play around with her, huh?

42
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,190
Where did you go?

43
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,630
I went to enjoy fireworks.

44
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,360
Fireworks?

45
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,720
He saw what happened in the kitchen?

46
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,730
A student was setting off fireworks in the back of the academy.

47
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,990
So I went to have a look.

48
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,340
You went there too?

49
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,740
Where did you enjoy the fireworks?

50
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,900
-In the kitchen.
-On the back hill.

51
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,630
You. Tell me.

52
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,900
Where did you enjoy the fireworks?

53
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,360
On the back hill.

54
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,620
Alright.

55
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,670
Go back to sleep.

56
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,330
Yes.

57
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,300
Yes. Mother.

58
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,270
Stop!

59
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,270
I didn't mean you.

60
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,470
Yueniang.

61
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,690
It's fine

62
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,550
you wander around all day.

63
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,330
But you've led your big brother astray.

64
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,400
Come with me to see your father later.

65
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll ask him how he's been disciplining you.

66
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,780
No, no, no.

67
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,550
I'm going to kneel in the ancestral hall.

68
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,420
Come back!

69
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,310
Brother Li.

70
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,750
How did it go?

71
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,000
That was close.

72
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,200
Mother almost punished me just now.

73
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,080
Why did Li Wenshu ask me out today?

74
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,410
Luckily, you didn't go today.

75
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,450
The scene was really horrible.

76
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,570
Brother Li.

77
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,780
Don't let Yueniang know about this.

78
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,480
If she goes to teach Li Wenshu a lesson,

79
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,860
there will be a bigger problem.

80
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,310
Besides, I've showed him my attitude today.

81
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,450
Li Wenshu knows what it means.

82
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,950
I don't want to have anything to do with the Li family.

83
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,700
Let's just let it go.

84
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,050
I heard that the Li family proposed a marriage again and again.

85
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,159
But Dad turned them down.

86
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,230
It seems that it's true.

87
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,300
If Li Wenshu comes to you again,

88
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,720
you have to let me go with you.

89
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,540
There is something wrong with his brain.

90
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,110
Did you see the fireworks tonight?

91
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,150
-Yes.
-Fireworks? Of course.

92
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,670
I wonder who set off the fireworks.

93
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,310
He just ignored the academy's rules.

94
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,240
Have you taken a shower?

95
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,030
Yes.

96
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,420
He is so bold.

97
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,750
Right.

98
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,450
If the teacher saw it,

99
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,670
he will be severely punished.

100
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,970
Come on. Let's read the letter.

101
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,980
Finally, I cleaned it.

102
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,590
Mr. Xiao.

103
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,430
Do you think

104
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,860
Dean will know what happened today?

105
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,950
I don't care.

106
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,180
I won't be punished.

107
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,870
It was quite a scene.

108
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,060
If someone will be punished,

109
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,800
maybe he'll be asked to clean the library.

110
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,790
What's so hard about cleaning the library?

111
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,870
Mr. Xiao.

112
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,720
I guess you've never been in the library.

113
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,630
The library of Yiyang Academy is quite famous.

114
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,880
It is said that there are tens of thousands of books inside.

115
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,190
Many precious books can be found there.

116
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,860
If someone is asked

117
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,050
to clean every book in it,

118
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,150
it will be an exhausting job.

119
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,950
Is it that big?

120
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,000
Mr. Zhou.

121
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,540
Your letter.

122
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,060
Thank you.

123
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,510
Right. Mr. Zhou.

124
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,190
I've got two new crickets.

125
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,110
Do you want to play?

126
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,710
I'm tired today. I don't want to go.

127
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,750
Mr. Ding, enjoy yourself.

128
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,950
Alright then.

129
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,630
You go.

130
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,610
So boring.

131
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,730
I'm leaving.

132
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,760
I won't disturb you from replying.

133
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,130
I'm going out.

134
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,510
Mr. Xiao.

135
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,419
I saw you rubbing your shoulder all day.

136
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,930
Did you get hurt in the kitchen again?

137
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,300
I'm fine.

138
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,800
I just got hit by the ladder.

139
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,430
Son.

140
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,180
Everything is fine at home.

141
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,730
You should take good care of yourself in the academy.

142
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,870
The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching. The weather is getting cold.

143
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,220
Remember to put on more clothes.

144
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,590
Don't worry about me.

145
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,460
Mother.

146
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,870
I'm coming.

147
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,210
It's going to be turned over.

148
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,340
Bite it!

149
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,680
Bite it! Go!

150
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,570
Bite it! Bite it!

151
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,720
Go! Go!

152
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,750
Bite it!

153
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,070
Why is this so weak?

154
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,140
Are you really doing cricket fighting?

155
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,390
Bite it.

156
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,510
Bite it.

157
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,950
-It's not bad.
-Go bite it!

158
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,380
Bite.

159
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,990
Move.

160
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,510
See? I told you it will bite.

161
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,360
Bite it.

162
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:41,790
Come on.

163
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,030
Let's go and have a look.

164
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,470
Go. Go.

165
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,830
Stir them with chopsticks.

166
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,130
Don't.

167
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,700
Be gentle.

168
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,540
You were hit heavily, Young Master.

169
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,430
Are your bones alright?

170
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,630
They are fine.

171
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,390
It's just recently, I...

172
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,760
Be gentle.

173
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,030
Please. Uncle Hu.

174
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,010
It's just I haven't practiced for a long time.

175
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,600
I was a bit careless,

176
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,030
so that I forgot to discharge the power somewhere.

177
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,810
Since it hurts,

178
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,580
you shouldn't be so reckless next time. Okay?

179
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,190
I didn't want to do that.

180
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,380
But I can't just let that wooden ladder

181
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,660
hit Miss Zhu on her face.

182
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,280
What should I do

183
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,910
if something happens to you?

184
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,020
Nothing.

185
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,430
I'll be fine in two days.

186
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,350
Two days?

187
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,500
Can you recover in two days?

188
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,510
Two days.

189
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,780
Uncle Hu.

190
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,500
Fireworks appeared out of nowhere in the academy today.

191
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,660
So what?

192
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,320
Zhou Ji said

193
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,480
the academy has a rule that fireworks are forbidden.

194
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,350
What's so strange about the rule?

195
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,780
The teachers will know about the fireworks tomorrow.

196
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,470
I guess no one will go to receive punishment.

197
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,620
So?

198
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,830
I will go to receive punishment.

199
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,730
You didn't set off the fireworks.

200
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,830
Why would you do that?

201
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,470
Because it's a big deal.

202
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,270
Maybe I can go to the place where I want to go.

203
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,210
I will take the initiative to receive punishment.

204
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,590
And I will propose how I should be punished.

205
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,630
Young Master.

206
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,510
I'm getting more and more confused.

207
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,590
I have a plan.

208
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,650
Do you need me

209
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,530
in your plan?

210
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:57,900
Come.

211
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,550
Impressive.

212
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,380
Honey.

213
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,670
Drink it while it's hot.

214
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,510
Okay.

215
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,730
Yueniang is still kneeling?

216
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,890
Yes.

217
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,290
Song Li has learned from her to come back late.

218
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,070
Song Li went there too?

219
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,540
Yueniang is very smart.

220
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,910
But she's not interested in studying.

221
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,050
Actually, she didn't mean to take Song Li.

222
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,230
So stop giving her a hard time.

223
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,340
I think what she's best at

224
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,950
is being adorable.

225
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,590
Since Xiao Yu came to the academy,

226
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,670
she's been more mischievous.

227
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,580
She has even led Song Li astray.

228
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,630
If I don't discipline her properly,

229
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,470
how can she get married in the future?

230
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,870
If she wants to kneel, let her kneel.

231
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,340
I hope she is really reflecting on herself.

232
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,550
You're right.

233
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,430
But Xiao Yu hasn't become a student of Song's Academy yet.

234
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,090
I think we should talk about their wedding later, right?

235
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,830
Xiao Yu is talented.

236
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,880
It's not difficult for him to be admitted to the academy.

237
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,290
He can take the exam again next spring.

238
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,830
But in these years,

239
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,660
Chuanzhong and I haven't finalized the wedding.

240
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,870
Let's go visit the Xiao family someday

241
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,580
and talk about the marriage certificate.

242
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,670
That's good.

243
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:56,980
Honey.

244
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,350
It's getting late.

245
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,350
Yueniang hasn't had dinner yet.

246
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,580
Let her kneel.

247
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,040
She should be punished for coming back late.

248
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,980
How do you want to punish her?

249
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,180
Ground her and ask her to copy books in the library.

250
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,500
Honey.

251
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,210
Enough.

252
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,510
It's not negotiable.

253
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,380
Brother Li.

254
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,480
Keep your voice down.

255
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,690
Dad won't let anyone in.

256
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,070
You must be hungry.

257
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,580
Eat.

258
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,770
Mom and Dad are still in the room.

259
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,630
I don't know how long you have to kneel.

260
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,720
Sister.

261
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,660
What are you hiding behind you?

262
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,410
-Nothing.
-Stop hiding.

263
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,110
She

264
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,830
made the dim sum for you.

265
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,540
Eat.

266
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,590
Sister.

267
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:27,830
Brother Li.

268
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,060
You were making fun of me.

269
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,590
You scared me.

270
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,880
I'm starving.

271
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,180
I'm going to eat.

272
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
Go ahead.

273
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,440
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

274
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,670
If you behave yourself in daily life,

275
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,150
you wouldn't have been punished frequently.

276
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,900
You should learn lessons.

277
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,330
Otherwise, you'll suffer losses in the future.

278
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,630
I agree.

279
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,800
What you said is right.

280
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,830
Right. Brother Li.

281
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,570
You went to see the fireworks today?

282
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,430
Yes.

283
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,150
Where did you see the fireworks?

284
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:16,670
On the back hill.

285
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,600
Why did you go there for no reason?

286
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,350
I went to take a walk.

287
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,060
Then why did you go to the kitchen?

288
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,780
Thank God. He doesn't know what happened in the kitchen.

289
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,550
I went to see Xiao Yu.

290
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,190
When I asked you this morning,

291
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,150
you said...

292
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,230
said...

293
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,060
I'm full. Brother Li.

294
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,970
You should go back.

295
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:46,780
Sister.

296
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,030
You should go back.

297
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,600
Otherwise, you'll be punished

298
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,940
if Mom and Dad come here and see you.

299
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,340
Brother Li, go.

300
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:52,990
Go now.

301
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,970
I'm here.

302
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:57,990
Dad.

303
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,630
Dad.

304
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,630
Kneel properly.

305
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,339
You don't like studying, right?

306
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,119
Then I'll ground you and ask you to copy books in the library.

307
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,180
You can't go back to Women's Academy within three days.

308
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,099
Three days?

309
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:17,829
Four days.

310
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:18,849
Three days.

311
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,110
Who set off fireworks here?

312
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,100
Mr. Chen,

313
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,120
many people are lining up in front of the teachers' room.

314
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,000
Why?

315
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,830
Let's go.

316
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,060
Look at Xiao Yu.

317
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,690
What is he doing?

318
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,390
I don't know.

319
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,310
What are they doing?

320
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,300
Xiao Yu.

321
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,980
What are you doing?

322
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,390
I'm here to receive punishment.

323
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,940
What did you do?

324
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,870
I set off fireworks.

325
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,320
It was you.

326
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,390
Then why are they here?

327
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,070
These workers

328
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,790
were hired by me to clean up the fireworks residues

329
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,780
and repair the kitchen.

330
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,130
They will restore the two places within one day.

331
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:28,940
In this way,

332
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,940
Mr. Chen can explain

333
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,280
to other teachers and Dean.

334
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,510
Looks like you came prepared.

335
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,540
I dare not speculate Mr. Chen's thoughts.

336
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,880
But this is

337
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,940
the only solution I can think of.

338
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,310
Fine,

339
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,820
since you are a first offender.

340
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,400
Don't make the same mistake again.

341
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,610
Mr. Chen. Thank you.

342
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,630
Then I won't be punished, right?

343
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,690
You wish.

344
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,770
You want to get away just like this?

345
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,580
Xiao Yu.

346
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,800
You caused trouble again and again.

347
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,550
How can you be forgiven so easily?

348
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,230
You're right, Mr. Zhang.

349
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,140
How do you want to punish me?

350
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,800
Looks like you need more punishment.

351
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,190
For what happened to the goose,

352
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,060
I sincerely apologize to Mr. Zhang here.

353
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,790
Do you think I want to punish you

354
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,910
because of that goose?

355
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,150
You are petty.

356
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,140
Mr. Zhang is a man of noble character.

357
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,770
I dare not speculate your thoughts.

358
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,910
But after what happened to the goose,

359
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,570
I have always felt guilty.

360
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,380
So I kept looking

361
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,200
and have found your Yaya.

362
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,740
Yaya?

363
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:05,900
Come.

364
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,180
Isn't this a big goose?

365
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,540
Yaya.

366
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,420
Don't think you can bribe me with a goose.

367
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,420
I'm not that kind of person.

368
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,200
Mr. Zhang has always been fair and upright.

369
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,430
I dare not.

370
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,040
Mr. Chen will decide

371
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,110
how to punish you.

372
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,820
You're his man.

373
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,220
I don't want others to say that I stretch my hand too far.

374
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,080
Yaya.

375
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,940
Yaya, let's go.

376
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,280
Come home with me.

377
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,660
You're disobedient.

378
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,020
Let's go.

379
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,390
Come home with me.

380
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,870
Yaya is back.

381
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,980
Yaya is back.

382
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,390
Although you made up for your mistake,

383
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,690
you still have to be punished.

384
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,980
I can't break the rules.

385
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,150
Mr. Chen. You are right.

386
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,620
I'm willing to receive the punishment of cleaning the library.

387
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,320
Mr. Chen. What do you think?

388
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,860
You want to clean the library alone?

389
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,740
That's a large place.

390
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,640
I should be punished severely,

391
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,110
so that

392
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,480
I can learn a lesson

393
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,380
and I won't make mistakes again.

394
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,700
Indeed, it's been a long time since the library was cleaned.

395
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,750
Why are you still standing here?

396
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,840
Get to work.

397
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,270
Yes.

398
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,720
It seems he has arranged everything.

399
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,110
Oh no.

400
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,620
I forgot to ask Uncle Hu how to do the sweeping and sprinkling.

401
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,030
Sweeping and sprinkling.

402
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,700
Sweep the floor first, and then sprinkle water?

403
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,730
[Library]

404
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,920
In order to punish me, Dad even closed the library.

405
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,230
How should I spend the three long days?

406
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,120
I can't believe Song Zhu, who is loved by everyone,

407
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,980
can get bored.

408
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,030
I'm so bored.

409
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:47,030
I feel sleepy whenever I see the Book of Songs.

410
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,410
Why are you more efficient than the Buddha?

411
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,690
Where did the water come from?

412
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,840
Today, I finally know

413
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,700
what "bright and clean" means.

414
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,540
Miss Zhu?

415
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,110
Why are you here?

416
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,420
I want to ask you the same question.

417
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,220
Why can I see you wherever I am?

418
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,770
I'm sprinkling water and sweeping the floor.

419
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,340
Am I wrong?

420
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,680
Of course you are wrong.

421
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,970
This is not how you should do the sweeping and sprinkling.

422
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,980
You are making all the books below wet.

423
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,970
Xiao Yu, are you okay?

424
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,080
Let me help you up.

425
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:43,900
Stop.

426
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,530
I can't move.

427
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:45,920
I can get up myself.

428
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,810
I'll be gentle.

429
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,790
I'll be gentle.

430
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,650
Slowly.

431
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,140
What are you looking at?

432
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,500
You...

433
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,710
Is this the wound you had yesterday?

434
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,070
It's nothing.

435
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,420
I'm fine.

436
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,770
Does it still hurt?

437
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,750
Miss Zhu, you don't have to be too touched.

438
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,790
I...

439
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,420
didn't want to save you.

440
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,060
I just saved you by chance.

441
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,950
By chance?

442
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,220
Do you think I'm a wild flower?

443
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,680
That's not what I meant.

444
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,900
Why do you always get me wrong?

445
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,630
Help tie it for me.

446
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,840
You don't know how to tie a belt?

447
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,650
As a man, you don't even know how to tie a belt.

448
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,870
Then how did you tie it before?

449
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,750
It's none of your business.

450
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,050
Just tie it for me.

451
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:53,820
No.

452
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,240
It hurts. I can't even lift my arm.

453
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,330
You have no conscience.

454
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,610
-You have no conscience.
-Fine.

455
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,350
I'll tie it for you.

456
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,440
Lift your arm.

457
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,850
Be gentle.

458
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,230
Okay.

459
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,450
I'll be gentle.

460
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,090
Straighten my clothes.

461
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,820
Listen.

462
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,650
Remember to explain to Mr. Zhou for me

463
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,620
about what happened yesterday.

464
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,530
What's there to explain?

465
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,180
It's up to him to believe it or not.

466
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,170
Stop!

467
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,460
We can discuss this.

468
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,040
This is about my reputation.

469
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,100
The misunderstanding from two nights ago haven't even been resolved, and then yesterday...

470
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,000
It's done.

471
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,310
Will you help me or not?

472
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,300
It hurts.

473
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,450
If you like Zhou Ji,

474
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,630
you can just ask him out, right?

475
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,360
Why do you have to get me involved?

476
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,700
I'm a man. I'm standing between you two.

477
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,910
I think it's annoying, even if you don't.

478
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:03,970
You...

479
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,880
You are quite something, aren't you?

480
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,010
Look at what you are saying.

481
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,520
Do you think I want to get you involved?

482
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,230
Tell me. What good things can you do

483
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,420
in addition to bad things?

484
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,610
And let me tell you.

485
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,860
-If it weren't for you, I…
-Why don't you deal with

486
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,150
the sweeping and sprinkling first?

487
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,550
What does it have to do with me?

488
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,580
I've never done this before.

489
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,660
No way.

490
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,000
What kind of person are you?

491
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,870
I don't know.

492
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,810
Marrying you

493
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,040
will be a great misfortune for whoever marries you.

494
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,060
Aren't we engaged?

495
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,010
You will be the one marrying me.

496
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,070
How dare you mention the engagement to me?

497
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,860
How dare you mention it?

498
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,050
Have you written a letter home?

499
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:55,960
Have you sent it?

500
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,760
Yes.

501
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,660
I planned to send it today.

502
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:00,980
Miss Zhu.

503
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,630
If you don't hurry,

504
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,280
the books on the first floor will have to be deserted.

505
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,020
Don't lie to me.

506
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,330
Isn't this cleaning?

507
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,800
How muddleheaded my father was back then

508
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,910
to approve of my engagement to this man?

509
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,550
Xiaoyue, hurry up.

510
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,300
We're going to be late.

511
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,300
Hurry up.

512
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,240
Okay.

513
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,480
Are you Senior Jin Xiaoyue?

514
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,690
Yes.

515
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,830
Are you the son of the county magistrate, Mr. Li?

516
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,070
Yes.

517
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,280
Nice to meet you.

518
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,330
Let's go to a place with fewer people.

519
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,720
Wait a minute.

520
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,460
Let's go.

521
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,270
This way, please.

522
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,300
No one is here.

523
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,650
I'm prepared.

524
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,630
What should come will come eventually.

525
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:53,980
Wait.

526
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,110
I came to you because I want to ask you for a favor.

527
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,600
I understand.

528
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,140
Come on.

529
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,720
Just say whatever you want to say.

530
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,750
No, no, no.

531
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,540
I heard that Mrs. Jin

532
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,020
is the best matchmaker in the world.

533
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,620
You've been influenced by her since childhood.

534
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,170
You must be an expert too, right?

535
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,350
You came to me for this?

536
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:18,940
Yes.

537
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,510
I do know a trick or two.

538
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,020
Good.

539
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,760
I...

540
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,300
I...

541
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,500
I have a friend.

542
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,590
He just fell in love.

543
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,350
He wants to learn some skills from me

544
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,820
to make the girl he likes happy.

545
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,360
So I thought of you.

546
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,660
I want to learn some skills from you.

547
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,150
What kind of person is your friend?

548
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,050
He is a talented

549
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,690
and handsome boy.

550
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,320
He emanates a kind of heroic spirit.

551
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,320
What about the girl he likes?

552
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,090
She is

553
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,270
beautiful,

554
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,960
intelligent,

555
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,400
gentle, and lovely.

556
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,370
If I ever have a girl like her,

557
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,340
I will die without regrets.

558
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,990
Mr. Li.

559
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,940
Were you describing

560
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,230
the girl you like?

561
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:50,860
No.

562
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,770
My friend told me that.

563
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,600
You are just creating something out of nothing.

564
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:07,300
Girls like romantic surprises.

565
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,190
Surprises?

566
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,800
I'm all ears.

567
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,060
Women are like flowers.

568
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,420
No woman in this world

569
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,050
doesn't like flowers.

570
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,220
Flowers?

571
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,490
What are you looking at?

572
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,980
What is that place?

573
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,790
It's none of your business.

574
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,820
Are there many precious books inside?

575
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,120
Of course.

576
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,020
No.

577
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,630
Why do you want to know?

578
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,710
That's Dean's Room.

579
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,790
Should we clean it?

580
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,770
No.

581
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,300
Do you think anyone can enter Dean's Room?

582
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,920
Then I can save a lot of strength.

583
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:24,750
Look at this.

584
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,260
The red one is also good.

585
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,980
Right? Look.

586
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,760
There's pink and red.

587
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,590
See for yourself.

588
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,070
Okay.

589
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,540
Isn't this Mr. Li?

590
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,380
Keep your voice down.

591
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,679
Mr. Li, what can I do for you?

592
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,790
May I ask

593
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,780
whom the flowers are for?

594
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,460
You don't need to know.

595
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,790
Just give me the best.

596
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,690
Mr. Li, you misunderstood me.

597
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,870
I just want to know what you need,

598
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,220
so that I can find the best for you.

599
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,670
What's wrong?

600
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,890
I helped you clean the library.

601
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,660
Shouldn't you repay me?

602
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,390
Do you want me to help you copy books?

603
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,620
No.

604
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,770
Even if you copy them for me, I still need to be grounded for three days.

605
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,660
Then you...

606
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,880
Go ahead.

607
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,810
No, you don't want me to give myself to you, do you?

608
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,180
Who wants you?

609
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,310
I'm not someone you would dare to desire.

610
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,030
Fine.

611
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,780
Stop acting.

612
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,640
I want you to help me with something else.

613
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,830
What is it?

614
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,540
After you go back tonight,

615
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,320
I want you to ask Junior Zhou out for me.

616
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,070
Do I have another choice?

617
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,540
No.

618
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,350
I have something to do today. I'm not going back.

619
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,170
Why are you pinching me?

620
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,800
You asked me to ask him out to make it clear.

621
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,900
Now you won't help me.

622
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,300
I asked you to ask him out.

623
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,780
I didn't say I'll ask him out for you.

624
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,030
And I really have something to do tonight.

625
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,200
I wish you the best of luck.

626
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,400
You...

627
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,300
You have things to do every day.

628
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,300
You have so many excuses.

629
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,710
I think you just don't want to help me.

630
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,570
What I'm going to do today is sending a letter home.

631
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,950
Didn't you say I ruin your plans every day?

632
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,300
I won't be part of it today.

633
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,590
Good luck, Miss Zhu.

634
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,330
Are you really not going back tonight?

635
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:36,850
I'm not.

636
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,240
Hurry up.

637
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,530
What are they doing?

638
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,120
Hurry up.

639
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,270
Hurry up.

640
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,160
What are these flowers for?

641
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,460
Miss Yi, I love you with all my heart.

642
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,090
Now everyone knows.

643
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,930
There's nothing to hide then.

644
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,300
I'm here today to confess my love.

645
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,370
Let's go.

646
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,540
Miss Yi.

647
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,670
Miss Yi, the flowers...

648
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,160
Why did she leave?

649
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,380
These flowers are for deities.

650
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,300
The guys don't go to sleep even at this hour?

651
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,750
I guess I came too early.

652
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,540
I didn't expect

653
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,000
that Mr. Xiao set off the fireworks.

654
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,350
He's really generous.

655
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,790
I wonder why he set off the fireworks.

656
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,900
Xiao Yu set off the fireworks?

657
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,520
Yes.

658
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,360
Don't you know?

659
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,500
He went to Mr. Chen to receive punishment proactively yesterday.

660
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,820
He went to receive punishment proactively?

661
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,090
What is he up to?

662
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:07,820
Get him.

663
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,540
Go to our place and tell us.

664
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,180
Come here.

665
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:09,790
Let's go.

666
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,300
What are you doing?

667
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,230
-Go inside.
-Get him inside.

668
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:11,920
What are you doing?

669
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,470
Xue Hanfu, help me!

670
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,460
Coming.

671
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,360
What are you doing?

672
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,180
Xue Hanfu, help me!

673
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,480
Xue Hanfu, help me!

674
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,540
Xue Hanfu.

675
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,550
Hurry up.

676
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,140
Hurry.

677
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,290
Coming.

678
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,830
That was close.

679
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,980
Luckily, Mr. Zhou is not here.

680
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,820
Otherwise, he would think I'm a pervert.

681
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,260
Senior?

682
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,310
Ju... Junior Zhou.

683
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,500
I...

684
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,940
I'm not a pervert.

685
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,590
I took the risk to be here because I want to explain to you

686
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,610
-about what happened on the night before last.
-Senior.

687
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,610
You can't stay here.

688
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,980
If someone sees you,

689
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,050
it'll be hard to clear your name.

690
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,460
Well...

691
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,770
Let's go to your room and talk.

692
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,450
You can't.

693
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,810
Come here, you two.

694
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,940
Why haven't you gone to bed?

695
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
-Instructor Shen.
-Instructor Shen.

696
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,120
Go. Go. Go.

697
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,490
This way.

698
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:16,980
Go to bed now.

699
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,780
Yes.

700
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,140
Junior Zhou, are you alright?

701
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,840
I'm fine.

702
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,320
Fortunately, we are smart

703
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,540
and didn't get caught.

704
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,420
Senior Song.

705
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,440
You shouldn't take the risk

706
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,900
to come to the men's dorm at night again.

707
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,300
It'll damage your reputation.

708
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:02,990
I...

709
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,740
As for what happened between you and Mr. Xiao,

710
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,280
you don't need to explain.

711
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,510
I trust you.

712
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,930
Junior Zhou, do you really trust me?

713
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:12,930
Of course.

714
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,310
I know very well

715
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,740
what kind of person you are.

716
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,270
As for the gossip,

717
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,620
don't take it seriously.

718
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,210
A clean hand wants no washing.

719
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,790
Picking a lock is not something a gentleman should do.

720
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:45,650
Come.

721
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:48,970
Come.

722
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,100
Come.

723
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,820
Then I'm going to step on you.

724
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,490
What are you doing?
