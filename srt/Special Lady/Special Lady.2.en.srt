[Special Lady]

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,780
[Episode 2]

4
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,740
He is your future husband.

5
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,860
Uncle, is that true?

6
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,190
Mr. Xiao Yu.

7
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,759
This is Song Zhu, the third daughter of my parents.

8
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,530
I'm Song Yi, the second daughter of my parents.

9
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,880
I'm sorry for our imprudence just now.

10
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,600
So you're the third daughter of the Song Family?

11
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,050
It's none of your business.

12
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,870
Step aside!

13
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,200
The county magistrate is here.

14
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,380
Step aside!

15
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,350
Step aside!

16
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,270
-Step aside! -Step aside!

17
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,730
The county magistrate is here!

18
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,490
My dear son,

19
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,260
I already paved the way for you yesterday.

20
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,480
The gate of Song's Academy is open for you.

21
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,950
Just go inside,

22
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,990
choose a daughter of the Song Family to be your wife,

23
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,670
and bring glory to our Li Family.

24
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,090
Don't worry, Father.

25
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,950
I won't let you down.

26
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,220
This is what my son should be like.

27
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,380
Where is the person in charge of registration?

28
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,130
I'm here.

29
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,120
We'd like to register!

30
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,250
Father, father, father.

31
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,250
Mr. Xiao, may I have a word with you?

32
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,550
Let me tell you.

33
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,720
I will never

34
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,510
marry someone like you.

35
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,290
Someone like me?

36
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,490
You're not able to marry someone like me even if you want to.

37
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,020
Good!

38
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,700
That's great!

39
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,000
Since we don't like each other,

40
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,400
we can have a talk.

41
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,480
There's nothing we can talk about.

42
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,160
You stole my lucky pouch. Give it back to me.

43
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,190
You are funny.

44
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,720
I stole your lucky pouch?

45
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,840
You stole my lucky pouch and you should give it back to me first.

46
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,850
I don't want to argue with you.

47
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:47,810
Your lucky pouch is here.

48
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,690
What?

49
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,510
We're at the gate of your house, so you want to snatch it so openly?

50
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,230
I just want to test your martial arts skills.

51
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,290
Don't be angry. Don't take it seriously.

52
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,140
Hurry up.

53
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,100
Let's exchange the lucky pouches with each other.

54
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,110
I went out in a hurry today.

55
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,530
Your lucky pouch should still be at my home now.

56
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,180
Why don't you return mine to me first?

57
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,269
Then I'll go home and fetch yours for you.

58
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,250
What do you think?

59
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:22,970
Okay.

60
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,890
We'll talk about it after you fetch it.

61
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,280
Right.

62
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,110
I suddenly feel

63
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,300
what you said really makes sense.

64
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,280
I can't take advantage of you for nothing.

65
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,750
Anyway, I will just lose a few taels of silver.

66
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,710
It doesn't matter.

67
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,780
However, don't let it influence your big plan.

68
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:41,620
But I don't think

69
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,290
you have a big plan, right?

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,480
I must have thought too much.

71
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,120
Wait.

72
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,140
Anything else, Mr. Xiao?

73
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,090
Let's discuss it, Miss Zhu.

74
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,920
Compensate me for that umbrella.

75
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,780
You have to compensate me with the same one.

76
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,570
I don't care even if I have to compensate you with an umbrella shop.

77
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,640
You always brag.

78
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,360
You're really addicted to bragging.

79
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,900
Besides,

80
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,320
don't tell my family that

81
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,960
you're Xiao Chuanzhong's son. Got it?

82
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,640
Then who am I?

83
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,900
I don't care who you are.

84
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,880
If you don't agree, there's nothing to talk about.

85
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,030
-Go away. -No, no, no.

86
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,430
Go away.

87
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,600
Please. Please.

88
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,700
You stole my lucky pouch. Give it back to me.

89
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,950
If you agree to my conditions,

90
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,050
I'll return it.

91
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,909
I agree to your conditions.

92
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,080
I'll wait for you at the No.2 First-class Room

93
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,310
in Jixian Inn tonight.

94
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,230
I'll stab you. I'll stab...

95
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,240
Young Master, what's going on

96
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,390
between you and Miss Zhu?

97
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,900
Did you get the letter back?

98
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,130
We've reached an agreement.

99
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,810
You've reached an agreement?

100
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,350
Young Master, please be careful with your identity.

101
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,230
Stop nagging.

102
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,870
Go find out what is going on

103
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,140
with my engagement.

104
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,390
I'll have to see Song Xu in the end.

105
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,440
The engagement will be exposed.

106
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,920
I have to go back to the capital if I need to investigate the engagement.

107
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:53,950
It will take a long time.

108
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,850
Enough.

109
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,310
-If you're here alone... -Without you,

110
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,970
I'll get twofold results with half the effort.

111
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,900
Young Master, what you said is too...

112
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,650
Time is limited and the task is heavy.

113
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,040
Just go at once.

114
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,420
Young Master, take good care of yourself.

115
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:06,910
Go!

116
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,710
Okay!

117
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:17,990
What a playboy!

118
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:22,970
Mother.

119
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,240
Let me help you.

120
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,450
Why are you back so early?

121
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,800
Didn't you go to help with the examinees' registration with your second eldest sister?

122
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,140
The students registering for the exam were all in order.

123
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,390
My sister can do it alone.

124
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,390
It's so tiring for you to do the housework.

125
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,659
Of course I have to come back to help you.

126
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,680
I just like the way you look wilful and domineering.

127
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,960
Mother,

128
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,170
are you sure you're not talking about being obedient and smart?

129
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,340
Almost the same.

130
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,090
If you think they're almost the same, then they're almost the same.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,409
Mother.

132
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,350
Mother, I've heard that I'm engaged.

133
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,500
That's true.

134
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,000
Which family is he from?

135
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,680
Xiao Yu, the eldest son of the Xiao Family.

136
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,430
His father Xiao Chuanzhong is your father's best friend.

137
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,560
But why didn't I know about this?

138
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,330
This engagement was made when you were three years old.

139
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,570
Later, for some reason,

140
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,820
your father gave an order,

141
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,140
and we never mentioned it again.

142
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,440
Mother,

143
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,159
I don't know if I should tell you something.

144
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,640
Just tell me about it.

145
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,220
Mother, look.

146
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,960
Father and Uncle Xiao are best friends.

147
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,150
I'm sure he knows the situation

148
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,669
of our family well.

149
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,580
My eldest sister has been famous in the capital since childhood.

150
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,940
My second eldest brother has just become an official.

151
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,060
My second eldest sister has excellent embroidery skills.

152
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,140
Her embroidery works are priceless.

153
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,900
My eldest...

154
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,340
My eldest brother will definitely be the pillar of the Song's Academy.

155
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,690
But I...

156
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,970
As you know,

157
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,640
I'm not good at studying,

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,270
and I do badly in embroidery.

159
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,650
I also don't have any good skills.

160
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,770
From this perspective,

161
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,870
my father must have arranged this marriage for me

162
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,130
for my own good.

163
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,730
He was far-sighted.

164
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,220
So?

165
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,540
So for this matter,

166
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,340
it depends on from what perspective we should condider it.

167
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,860
If we consider it from the perspective of the Xiao Family,

168
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,250
Mother, what do you think?

169
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,360
I think it must be a mistake.

170
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,640
That's right.

171
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,430
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,710
Don't beat around the bush.

173
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,580
Mother.

174
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,630
I think we shoud break off this engagement.

175
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,290
Yueniang.

176
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,240
Let me tell you.

177
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,310
You can talk about

178
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,370
such ideas in front of me.

179
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,060
But don't fool your father with these ideas.

180
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,440
Understand?

181
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,170
Yes.

182
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,290
I was just saying it.

183
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,860
I should listen to my father.

184
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,910
It's good that you know it.

185
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,080
Sister!

186
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:27,880

371
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,520
If the engagement my father has made is considered as a spear,

372
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,370
then the rule that the daughters of the Song Family

373
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,620
can only marry students of Song's Academy is considered as a shield.

374
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,450
My father is also a man who values rules so much.

375
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,100
I can only use my father's shield to block my father's spear.

376
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,650
I can use a stalling tactic first.

377
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,640
I'll make him miss the exam that is going to be held in two days.

378
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,170
Then I'll force him to break off the engagement.

Is there someone in your room?

387
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,490
Ridiculous.

388
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,590
How could I share a room with someone?

389
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,120
It's not appropriate

390
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,690
for a man and a woman to stay alone in a room.

391
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,100
It's also not convenient.

392
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,290
It's even more inconvenient if a man and a woman

393
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,120
are seen staying outside alone.

394

and told me that you wanted to apply for admission to the Yiyang Academy.

427
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,210
I think you should have a bigger prospect.

but also pretended to be her father to reply to me.

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,390
even if they've been studying hard all their lives,

555
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,580
you got it so easily.

556
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,700
If you got everything so smoothly,

557
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,050
it's inevitable that you're proud

558
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,760
and arrogant.

559
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,420
Don't be blinded by the glory in front of you.

560
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,910
To some people, this might be sugar, but to others, this might be poison.

561
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,980
Only by getting focused on your work sooner

562
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,530
can you see the path in front of you clearly

563
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,150
and make the right choice.

564
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:42,810
Why are you at my home?

565
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,280
To visit you.

566
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,040
Yueniang.

567
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,040
Don't be rude.

568
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,990
Brother, you've mistaken him for someone else.

569
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,370
Sir, please come out with me.

570
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,460
I have something to tell you.

571
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:56,820
I have nothing to say to you.

572
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,890
Do you think you're Xiao Yu

573
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,810
if you say so?

574
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,950
How can you prove that you're Xiao Yu?

575
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,140
-If you don't go out with me now, I'll burn that letter. -You...

576
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,280
Yueniang.

577
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,460
Go!

578
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:08,910
-Go! -Bro...

579
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:14,780
You...

580
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,930
What do you mean?

581
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,130
Miss Zhu, what do you want to tell me?

582
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:21,720
I...

583
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,020
You promised me that

584
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,310
you wouldn't enter my house with the identity of Xiao Yu.

585
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:25,740
You...

586
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,480
Didn't you also promise me that

587
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,040
you would return the letter to me?

588
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:29,810
I...

589
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,860
I gave it back to you.

590
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,100
How dare you say that?

591
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,900
Is that the letter your father wrote to me?

592
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,010
How about I ask your brothers and sisters

593
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,880
to have a look at it together?

594
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:41,970
I'll go take a look.

595
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,700
You even tampered with the letter.

596
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,980
What a good daughter of the Song Family.

597
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,360
You must be her eldest brother.

598
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,650
-I have something to tell you. -Go back!

599
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,170
See?

600
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,050
When my father is not here, I have the final say at my home.

601
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,510
Go on making trouble.

602
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,120
You can also bring your parents here to make trouble.

603
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,040
Right.

604
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,780
Just take this chance to break off the engagement.

605
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,080
Your...

606
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,280
Your father is not here?

607
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,820
It's not that my father is not here.

608
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,900
He won't be here for this period of time.

609
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,080
Go on making trouble.

610
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,100
Make trouble. Just go ahead.

611
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:24,770
Make trouble now.

612
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,330
Hurry up.

613
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,250
Alright.

614
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,710
Give me some money.

615
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,510
Bah!

616
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,360
I'll give it to you.

617
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,020
You're an adult.

618
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,730
How could you come to our home to cheat us?

619
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,120
I just pity you.

620
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,580
Don't do this again.

621
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,929
Go. Go, go, go.

622
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,520
I'll give you money. I'll give you money.

623
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:54,920
Who are you calling a cheater?

624
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,510
Shut up!

625
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,449
Listen.

626
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,360
For what you did,

627
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,450
I'll wait for Mr. Song to come back,

628
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,280
-and tell him about it. -Keep your voice down.

629
00:34:59,300 --> 00:34:59,610
Look.

630
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,530
Let's see whether my father will trust you or me.

631
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:01,960
Go.

632
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,720
Just see whether he'll trust you or my letter.

633
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,780
Take it and leave.

634
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,490
Be a good man from now on.

635
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,690
Don't cheat people out of their money again.

636
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,320
-Brother. -This...

637
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,620
This man is a cheater. Let me tell you.

638
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,120
Luckily, I kicked him out.

639
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,590
You call Xiao Yu a cheater?

640
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,810
This man is not Xiao Yu.

641
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,460
His father is Xiao Dali.

642
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,810
His father is a businessman.

643
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,180
-Let's go. -A businessman?

644
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,640
Let's go.

645
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,070
Steamed buns.

646
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,500
They're freshly cooked.

647
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,580
What's the rush? Haven't you eaten steamed buns before?

648
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,470
Give me a portion of steamed buns.

649
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,480
-Okay. -I'll put the money here.

650
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,170
That playboy

651
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,150
was so bold that he came to my home to tell on me.

652
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,850
I have to get the letter back quickly

653
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,300
before Yi finds out that I've gone out.

654
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,910
Here are the steamed buns.

655
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,550
Eat them.

656
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,870
They'll get cold if you don't eat them now.

657
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,650
You've never eaten seamed buns before indeed.

658
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,880
Do you have the Persian sesame oil?

659
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,190
Sir,

660
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,610
do you want Persia or sesame oil?

661
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,010
Persia is a place.

662
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,000
Persian sesame oil.

663
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,270
I don't have it.

664
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,890
What a pity.

665
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,950
You playboy!

666
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,410
Where did this crazy woman come from?

667
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,910
Yiyang is so chaotic.

668
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,480
I'd better go back and eat.

669
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,030
Xiao Yu, stop right there!

670
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,770
You'll be dead if I catch you.

671
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,230

A crazy woman bumped into me on the street.
