[Episode 5]

4
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,350
Come here.

5
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:50,890
Mother.

6
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,910
We don't know when you'll

7
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,580
return from the capital after this departure.

8
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,229
Take care of yourself since you're alone out there.

9
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,290
Don't worry, Mother.

10
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,870
Mother.

11
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,630
If you keep saying these things,

12
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,150
Second Brother may not want to leave.

13
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,640
Father.

14
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,080
Father.

15
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,810
Do you have anything to advise me

16
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,600
about my trip to the capital?

17
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,380
Now there's the late spring chill.

18
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,110
Wear more at night when you study.

19
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,790
-Don’t get sick.
-The ink...

20
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,310
Yes. What's more, Father?

21
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,829
This is Xiao Yu's test paper.

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,000
The weather is dry over there. Pay attention to the food.

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,600
Drink more soup and water.

24
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,290
Do what you can

25
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,560
and follow the flow.

26
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,079
I understand.

27
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,520
I will speak and act cautiously.

28
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:44,690
Father.

29
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,280
Where is Big Brother?

30
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,110
I told him to do something.

31
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,890
Don't wait for him.

32
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,320
Do you have something to say to him?

33
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,920
No.

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,380
I was thinking

35
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,790
he also participated in the imperial exam...

36
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,670
It's indeed Xiao Yu's test paper.

37
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,210
Did Father know I went to the Teachers' office?

38
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,220
Sister, may I have a word with you?

39
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,790
Yueniang, I told Father that Mr. Xiao

40
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,840
has come to Yiyang.

41
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,220
Sister.

42
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,270
Mr. Zhang would hand over the test papers of unsuccessful candidates

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,320
to Father for review every year.

44
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,190
Father will find out sooner or later.

45
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,300
Second Brother, look at you.

46
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,329
You betrayed me and will go to the capital yourself.

47
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,550
What should I do now?

48
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,420
Don't worry.

49
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,890
You still have Big Brother.

50
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,950
I told him

51
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,090
to cooperate with you in the future.

52
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,480
If Xiao Yu bullies you,

53
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,690
just tell him.

54
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,790
OK, I got it.

55
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,510
Second Brother, you should go.

56
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,070
Don’t go back if there's nothing important.

57
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,650
Go.

58
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,000
Just go.

59
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,520
Father, Mother.

60
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,000
I didn't expect

61
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,160
the Number One Scholar to expose me.

62
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:08,940
Young Master.

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,000
Cakes, porcelain, wine and tea,

64
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,480
the "Four Treasures of the Study" and the calligraphy and painting works are all prepared.

65
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,579
Let's go if we are prepared.

66
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,410
Sir, this way.

67
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,370
Sir, someone is looking for you.

68
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,370
Please.

69
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,310
Sir, who are you looking for?

70
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,260
I'm Song Li from the Song family.

71
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,400
I'm here on behalf of my father

72
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,060
to invite Mr. Xiao to our house.

73
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,330
Young Master.

74
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,100
Mr. Song?

75
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,400
Mr. Xiao.

76
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,790
I apologize for the previous

77
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,970
misunderstanding.

78
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,930
About what?

79
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,320
Nothing.

80
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,200
What should I do?

81
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,940
Second Brother.

82
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,230
Others tend to speak the truth when questioned.

83
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,100
But you don't need to be asked. You voluntarily share.

84
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,910
How did you manage to be the Number One Scholar?

85
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,360
Come on.

86
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,210
Last time you came in a hurry,

87
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,800
and there wasn't enough time to show you around properly.

88
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,600
It was indeed a bit rushed.

89
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
After you finish talking with my father,

90
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,350
I'll take you around properly.

91
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,620
Okay.

92
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,050
Mr. Xiao.

93
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:41,980
[Propriety and Loyalty]

94
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,909
Please have a seat.

95
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,710
I'll go get my father.

96
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,230
OK.

97
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,860
How about

98
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,130
I go and apologize to Father first?

99
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,720
But what if Father doesn't understand the whole situation,

100
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,230
given Father's temperament,

101
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,430
if he finds out...

102
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,760
Greetings, Uncle Song. I'm Xiao Yu.

103
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,400
No need to be polite.

104
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,950
Have a seat.

105
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,400
How is your father and mother?

106
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,530
They're good.

107
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,740
You've suffered recently.

108
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,530
I didn't take good care of you.

109
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,360
Uncle Song, you're too kind.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,690
Uncle, you have been in seclusion for a few days.

111
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,030
I didn't dare to bother you.

112
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,040
I've read your test paper.

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,870
I have some questions for you.

114
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,040
Yes.

115
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,940
Father.

116
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,150
That's what I know.

117
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,500
Uncle Song, I think you're

118
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,070
a reasonable person.

119
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,800
Why does this voice sound so familiar?

120
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,940
Big Brother, do you think so too?

121
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,310
Why is Big Brother also here?

122
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,760
No.

123
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,970
If I go to apologize now, I'll die.

124
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,050
Xiao Yu will definitely smear my reputation.

125
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,550
No way. I'll wait a bit longer.

126
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,400
Yueniang.

127
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,300
Come in.

128
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,340
Father, what do you want from me?

129
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,070
Yueniang.

130
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,360
This is Uncle Xiao's son, Xiao Yu.

131
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,350
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

132
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,420
Yueniang,

133
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,180
when you were young, I arranged a marriage between you and the Xiao family.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,550
I didn't tell you this

135
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,780
because both of you were young.

136
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,330
Now that you've grown up,

137
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,890
you should know this.

138
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,720
Although this meeting is hasty,

139
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,289
you've technically been acquainted.

140
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,429
In the future, you can interact more.

141
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,560
Hello, Lady Zhu.

142
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,460
Xiao,

143
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,250
what did you say to my father?

144
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,600
Take a guess.

145
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,910
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

146
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,960
It's not surprising if anything comes out of your ear.

147
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,520
Yu.

148
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,910
Why didn't your father

149
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,160
Your father came with your mother.

150
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,730
My father asked me to bring you a letter.

151
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,810
But I met a thief on the way...

152
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,010
Mr. Xiao...

153
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,910
Looks exactly like when he...

154
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,670
Was young.

155
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,810
Yueniang, stop joking.

156
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,810
You were only three then.

157
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,920
You must be mistaken.

158
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,950
I remember Mr. Xiao

159
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,230
looked quite sickly as a child.

160
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,710
But I didn't expect

161
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,910
he's so robust now.

162
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,280
I'm flattered.

163
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,350
I used to be a picky eater when I was young.

164
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,200
So my father punished me thoroughly.

165
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,690
That's why I've grown a bit more sturdy now.

166
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,410
However,

167
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,970
Lady Zhu hasn't changed at all.

168
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,830
She's just

169
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,490
as knowledgeable,

170
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,240
gentle, and virtuous as before.

171
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,180
She'll be a perfect wife.

172
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,120
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

173
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,140
I'll leave you two to get to know each other.

174
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,370
Yu.

175
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,060
If not for the blotchy ink on your exam paper,

176
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,000
passing the exam would have been easy for you.

177
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,400
It was an accident.

178
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,700
I was careless.

179
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,270
Uncle,

180
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,970
may I ask you for a favor?

181
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,610
Uncle,

182
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,820
would it be possible for me to take the exam again as an exception?

183
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,560
No.

184
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,180
Although our families are close,

185
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,340
it was because of your negligence.

186
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,630
Making an exception

187
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,110
would set

188
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,230
a dangerous precedent.

189
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,180
I believe your father can understand my intention.

190
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,100
I'm sorry for this exam.

191
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,150
Your father is really stubborn.

192
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,560
I told you.

193
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,310
Are you willing to give up now?

194
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:10,740
By the way,

195
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,010
where do you live now?

196
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,310
I'm staying at the inn for now.

197
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,460
You can come and stay at our house.

198
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,300
Li can help you with your studies,

199
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,760
and you can retake the exam next year.

200
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,360
Thank you, Uncle.

201
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,830
How is this acceptable?

202
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,350
Yueniang, why do you say that?

203
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,550
Father.

204
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,750
I think, although our families are close,

205
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,760
he and I were kids then.

206
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,610
Now we have grown up.

207
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,520
Plus, Second Sister is not married.

208
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,780
Mr. Xiao is a man.

209
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,360
It's really inconvenient for him to move in.

210
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,020
If this gets out,

211
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,310
it won't sound good.

212
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,610
Yueniang is getting more and more considerate.

213
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,850
Yu.

214
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,240
When will your mother come back?

215
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,820
I'll send someone to invite your father to come over.

216
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,030
Uncle, I thank you on behalf of my parents.

217
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,480
I'll be back in the capital in a few days.

218
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,640
Come and visit when you're free before you leave.

219
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,510
Tell me if you need anything.

220
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,850
Yes, Uncle.

221
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,520
I shall take my leave.

222
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,720
OK.

223
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,520
I'll see Mr. Xiao out.

224
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,050
Take care, Mr. Xiao.

225
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,470
Yueniang, stay here.

226
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,580
Did you stain the exam paper?

227
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,830
Yes.

228
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,700
No.

229
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,540
It's partly my fault.

230
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,680
That means there are other reasons, right?

231
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,240
And...Didn't Xiao Yu tell you?

232
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,700
What else?

233
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,730
Nothing else.

234
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,170
Kneel in the ancestral hall.

235
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,000
Tell me when you've made up your mind.

236
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,390
Yes.

237
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,230
You've met Mr. Song.

238
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,080
He has known your identity.

239
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,350
It will be easier for us to take the next step.

240
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,960
You can pay more visits

241
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,100
based on this relationship.

242
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,040
But I can’t always go visit.

243
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,540
Besides, Song Zhu will definitely play tricks.

244
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,700
I have to find another way to get close to Song Xu.

245
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,890
What is it?

246
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,330
Stay in the academy.

247
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,360
Young Master, don't forget

248
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,930
you failed.

249
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,120
You're narrow-minded.

250
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,420
Do I have to be a student to stay in the academy?

251
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,340
Young Master, you want to...

252
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,510
Go and check

253
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,900
the situation of the teachers in the academy.

254
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,320
As soon as possible.

255
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,860
Young Master, I’ve checked it.

256
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:40,900
Tell me then.

257
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,880
Mr. Zhang is pedantic and old-fashioned.

258
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,080
Instructor Shen is so rough.

259
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,680
Mr. Chen is hard to get along with.

260
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,580
Young Master, who else do you want to investigate?

261
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,120
The most difficult one to get along with,

262
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,350
Mr. Chen.

263
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,750
Lady Zhu.

264
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,400
I'm here to ask you a question.

265
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,580
Shall we

266
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,640
talk inside?

267
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,440
No need.

268
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm here to ask

269
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,950
what you have told my father.

270
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,550
What did I tell your father?

271
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,630
I forgot.

272
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,480
You...

273
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,910
You're really scared

274
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,380
that I would tell your father about you stopping me from taking the exam.

275
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,490
So you came to a man's room early in the morning to question me like this?

276
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,470
What exactly did you tell my father?

277
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,930
Nothing.

278
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:47,970
Really?

279
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,690
Why didn't you tell him?

280
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,050
What are you up to?

281
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,990
I hope we can stay out of each other's business.

282
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,950
You don't have to pester me anymore.

283
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,220
Sure.

284
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,630
As long as you break off the engagement with me,

285
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,030
we'll stay out of each other's business.

286
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,310
I’ve told you

287
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,079
I'm not qualified to break off the engagement

288
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,270
and I can't do it.

289
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,990
Mr. Xiao.

290
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,420
Mr. Xiao.

291
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,250
I know it was my mistake

292
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,200
to stop you from entering the academy.

293
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,160
I...

294
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,660
I wanted to discuss with my father

295
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,860
to let you enter.

296
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,190
But my father found you're here first.

297
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,470
I admit

298
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,490
I was wrong to stop you from entering the academy.

299
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,420
I apologize.

300
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,440
How about

301
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,260
we cooperate again?

302
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,440
Lady Zhu.

303
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,520
If you really have a way,

304
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,410
you wouldn't have come here to beg me.

305
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,950
I've thought about it.

306
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,560
It's better to rely on myself.

307
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,600
Please leave.

308
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,480
Mr. Xiao.

309
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,520
Mr. Xi...

310
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,400
Xiao Yu.

311
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,530
How dare you!

312
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,880
You stupid Xiao Yu!

313
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,120
Bad guy!

314
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,520
You stupid Xiao Yu!

315
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,240
Are you Mr. Chen's attendant?

316
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,420
Yes, I am.

317
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,310
Are you looking for Mr. Chen?

318
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,210
Mr. Chen is having a ritual in the hall.

319
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,070
I'm here for you, not him.

320
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,920
Thank you. Senior.

321
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,870
Before learning culture, learn virtue.

322
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,710
Before establishing goals, establish an upright character.

323
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,260
After taking over the wolf hair brush,

324
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,610
you will be the students of Yiyang Academy.

325
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,610
You should obey the will of the heavens and respond to the people's will.

326
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,520
Don't be envious, don't be greedy, and maintain integrity.

327
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,810
Please think carefully

328
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,530
about these words

329
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,710
[Xianxian Hall]

330
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,040
and work hard every day.

331
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,070
Don't let the past efforts go to waste.

332
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,660
Thank you, Sir.

333
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,530
Washing can clean hands and also cleanse the heart.

334
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,180
Perform the Vegetables Offering Ceremony.

335
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,470
Senior.

336
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,070
This is the plaster I use to refresh myself

337
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,170
while studying at night.

338
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,830
You won’t feel sleepy if you apply it between your eyebrows.

339
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,570
Thank you, Junior Zhou.

340
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,210
Offer the wine goblet.

341
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,180
Bow.

342
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,660
Disciples, offer the vegetables to the late sage as a token of respect.

343
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,790
Excuse me.

344
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,230
Excuse me.

345
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,160
Please help me.

346
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,650
Sirs, I, Xue Hanfu, bow and thank you.

347
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,090
Don't stand on ceremony.

348
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,010
The Vegetables Offering Ceremony is meant to show reverence and respect.

349
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,050
You don't need to be overly elaborate.

350
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,030
No.

351
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,010
My father said

352
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,040
you have worked hard in teaching.

353
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,900
He asked me to bring some local specialties

354
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,030
for you.

355
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,120
What are these?

356
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,430
Dates.

357
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,080
All right.

358
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,860
I appreciate your kindness.

359
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,560
Hurry up and pack these.

360
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,420
Put them away.

361
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,560
Do you dislike these grains?

362
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:58,990
It's OK.

363
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,460
I also brought

364
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,280
the most expensive black-bone chicken

365
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,820
to replenish your health.

366
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,330
I'm warning you.

367
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,280
If you come closer to me,

368
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,620
I won't go easy on you.

369
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,500
This...

370
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,030
Go.

371
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,650
I...

372
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,870
I won't be polite.

373
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,550
Mr. White.

374
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,800
I have no grudge against you.

375
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,360
I won't eat you either.

376
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,250
But please go somewhere else.

377
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,140
Go!

378
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,560
Senior, I caught the chicken.

379
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,880
-I caught the chicken.
-I got you.

380
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,830
Ouch!

381
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,630
Senior.

382
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,240
Alright.

383
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,450
Back to your place.

384
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,720
Groom yourselves.

385
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,350
Stop! Give it back!

386
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,760
I won't.

387
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:10,880
Yueniang. Yueniang.

388
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,120
-What’s wrong with you?
-Here.

389
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,360
Do you want to go to the archery class later?

390
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,680
Shouldn't you be in the archery class?

391
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,620
Why are you all here?

392
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,540
Sir,

393
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,480
we are all delicate women.

394
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,240
How can we stand the torture of Instructor Shen?

395
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,640
That's right.

396
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,710
The archery class was arranged by the late Mrs. Song.

397
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,130
You all have let down her earnest efforts.

398
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,440
But Sir,

399
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,820
here's the Women's Academy.

400
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,950
Why aren't there classes for women?

401
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,740
Tell me what you want to learn.

402
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,340
I'll report to the Dean.

403
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,930
Of course, it would be a makeup class.

404
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,000
Not bad. Right?

405
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,950
Yes.

406
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,340
Fine.

407
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,530
If you all want to have the makeup class,

408
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,080
I'll inform the Dean

409
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,840
to change the archery class into the makeup class.

410
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,450
Thank you, Sir.

411
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:09,820
Yueniang.

412
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,030
No.

413
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:11,690
I object.

414
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,380
Yueniang.

415
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,490
Sir.

416
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,330
I'm not interested in the makeup class.

417
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,770
Lady Zhu.

418
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,660
If you are not interested in the makeup class,

419
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,690
come with me to the cosmetics shop tomorrow

420
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,340
to pick some materials for the makeup class

421
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,340
to cultivate interest.

422
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,320
Yueniang.

423
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,390
It's OK.

424
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,120
Makeup class?

425
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,370
Tomorrow, Mr. Chen

426
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,370
will go to the cosmetics shop in the west of the city to buy cosmetics.

427
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,470
Keep these.

428
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,990
It should be enough for you to buy land and a house.

429
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,390
Filial piety comes first.

430
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,630
It's good to spend more time with your parents.

431
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,600
I've put the letter of resignation on Mr. Chen's desk.

432
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,270
But it's inappropriate

433
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,940
to leave suddenly.

434
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,120
Mr. Chen...

435
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:13,760
It's fine.

436
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,170
Don't worry.

437
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,450
As long as you did as I say

438
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,070
by writing in the letter that there's an emergency at home,

439
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,800
Mr. Chen won't blame you.

440
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,030
Go ahead.

441
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,230
OK.

442
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,100
Young Master.

443
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,170
Uncle Hu, calm down.

444
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,670
Have a bun.

445
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,930
The buns here taste just OK.

446
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,520
Try it.

447
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,280
Mr. Chen has gone out.

448
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,630
He's coming this way.

449
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,680
Don't worry. Have some buns.

450
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,560
Come on, try it.

451
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,640
Young Master.

452
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,740
The buns here are delicious.

453
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,000
That's good.

454
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,920
Take your time.

455
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,520
I'll go first.

456
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,810
Young Master, do you want me to go with you?

457
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,470
I can go alone.

458
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,400
I...

459
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,510
I know what you want to say.

460
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,410
You just eat here.

461
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,190
If I see you moved even a little when I return,

462
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,080
you'll be punished.

463
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,200
Waiter.

464
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,460
Keep replenishing buns for him without limit.

465
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,200
How dare he say that with just a small sum of money?

466
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,680
What's wrong with him?

467
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,420
I...

468
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,870
No need to replenish.

469
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,410
It's enough.

470
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:58,240
[Chen's Cosmetics Shop]

471
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,110
The attendant

472
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,540
left the letter of resignation and disappeared.

473
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,060
Where am I supposed to find someone to fill the vacancy in such a short time?

474
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,210
Take it.

475
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,550
You again?

476
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,850
I should be asking you that.

477
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,880
What are you doing here?

478
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,970
Do I need to explain to you?

479
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,050
What do you want?

480
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,570
Tell me where you're going.

481
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,940
The cosmetics shop.

482
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,380
What for?

483
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,470
To buy some cosmetics, of course.

484
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,390
You're lying.

485
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,440
You'll know if it's true if you go with me.

486
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:43,680
Fine.

487
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,770
I'll see what tricks you can still play.

488
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,400
Smell it.

489
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,090
This is not bad.

490
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,280
Sir.

491
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,250
Lady Zhu.

492
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,870
What time is it now?

493
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,660
Aren't you...

494
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,990
Greetings, Mr. Chen. I'm Xiao Yu.

495
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,620
Why are you two here together?

496
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,500
It's just a coincidence.

497
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,670
Mr. Chen, are you looking at the cosmetics?

498
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,310
I'm warning you. Don't think about doing anything bad.

499
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,390
Look at you.

500
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,700
Eyebrow powder comes in colors such as dark blue-black,

501
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,510
copper green, teal blue, and black-green.

502
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,710
Not many women in the capital use graphite for eyebrow makeup.

503
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,340
More prefer to use eyebrow ink.

504
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,990
I didn't expect Mr. Xiao to know such things.

505
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,860
It's just some common sense.

506
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,860
You'll understand after listening to some girls.

507
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,330
What's so special about it?

508
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,380
The prevailing eyebrow shape in the capital city is slender and elongated,

509
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,410
resembling a crescent moon,

510
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,520
or it could be the eyebrow shape of another type called Qingquetou.

511
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,000
As for lip makeup,

512
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,490
they are narrower and lighter compared to the previous dynasty.

513
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,320
So, it's better not to choose colors like Dahongchun, Xiaohongchun,

514
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,020
and Shengtanxin.

515
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,650
You might consider colors like Tiangongqiao and Nenwuxiang.

516
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,370
As for forehead decoration,

517
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,540
the noble ladies of the capital

518
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,290
prefer using pearls as ornaments.

519
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,230
I heard it originated from the imperial palace

520
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,390
and is exceptionally exquisite.

521
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,330
Lady Zhu.

522
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,430
You should learn these.

523
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,620
Last time I noticed

524
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,740
Mr. Chen's clothes and fabrics,

525
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,480
I knew that

526
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,300
Mr. Chen is meticulous in details.

527
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,800
If you start the makeup class,

528
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,910
it'll definitely benefit the Women's Academy.

529
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,780
You're my confidant.

530
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,100
Women nowadays are not as delicate as you,

531
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,640
let alone men.

532
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,430
I'm flattered.

533
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,900
I'm just a failed student.

534
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,300
How could I qualify to be your confidant?

535
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,750
So what if you failed?

536
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,110
Don't ask about the origin of a hero.

537
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,200
By the way,

538
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,160
coincidentally, my teaching assistant has resigned.

539
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,680
I'm short of hands now.

540
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,590
If you're interested and don't mind the effort,

541
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,490
you can be my assistant

542
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,240
and we can have more communication.

543
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,520
No.

544
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,880
Sir, if you need help,

545
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,180
I can help you.

546
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,610
You don't need to hire someone else.

547
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,990
We are teachers and students.

548
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,870
I can't order you around.

549
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,240
Besides, I need someone to carry heavy things for me.

550
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,780
You're a girl.

551
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,910
It's not OK.

552
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,650
Mr. Chen, it's my honor to be by your side

553
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,770
and learn from you.

554
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,400
OK.

555
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,750
Meet me tomorrow at the academy.

556
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,050
Yes.

557
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,280
Sir.

558
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,630
Sir, please think twice.

559
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,730
Mr. Xiao is right.

560
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,200
You should trim your eyebrows.

561
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,790
Sir, look at this one.

562
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,420
Lady Yi, am I beautiful today?

563
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,280
Yes.

564
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,770
So beautiful!

565
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,030
A standout among the rest.

566
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,230
Beautiful.

567
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,820
I don't know how to do it.

568
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,950
Ladies, come and take a look.

569
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:34,780
Come here.

570
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,240
You make me feel embarrassed.

571
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,220
Let's take a look.

572
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,060
It's always like this when she shows up.

573
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,470
So many people revolve around her.

574
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,990
Lady Yan's makeup today is exquisite.

575
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,120
Is it that a little touch of makeup can make me as beautiful as a fairy?

576
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,540
You're as beautiful as a fairy.

577
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:53,970
She's an ugly girl who imitates a beauty.

578
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,980
Aren't we having a makeup class today?

579
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,880
So,

580
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,400
I brought

581
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,160
my favorite white jade rouge cream.

582
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,180
I want to learn it well.

583
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,640
Let me see.

584
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,380
It smells so good.

585
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,940
It smells so good.

586
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,180
Lady Jin, do you want to take a look?

587
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,280
Lady Yan, your white jade rouge cream

588
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,750
is really a rare item.

589
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,270
Even our first madam's

590
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,490
is not as good as this in quality.

591
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,390
My father dotes on me the most.

592
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,270
So all the good things

593
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,520
are mine to use first.

594
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,120
But this white jade rouge cream

595
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,070
is not a precious item in my house.

596
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,870
If you like it,

597
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,290
I can give you one tomorrow.

598
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,400
Really?

599
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:31,980
If you don't believe me,

600
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,350
I'll give you this box.

601
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,250
That's great.

602
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,600
I want one too.

603
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,390
I wish I could have one.

604
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,190
Lady Zhao, you should have one too.

605
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,540
Thank you.

606
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,260
You're so considerate and generous.

607
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,500
But I don't usually wear makeup.

608
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,180
I don't need such an expensive thing.

609
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,380
Lady Yan, if you give me one,

610
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,870
I can ask my mother

611
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,100
to inquire about the young masters of Yiyang for you.

612
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,400
My mother is the best matchmaker in Yiyang.

613
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,790
I don't need you to inquire for me.

614
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,160
It's just a box of rouge cream.

615
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,190
I'll give it to you.

616
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,180
Thank you.

617
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,260
Who is it?

618
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,110
Good morning, ladies.

619
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,890
Isn't this Mr. Xiao?

620
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,050
Why is Mr. Xiao here at the Women's Academy?

621
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
Yeah. What happened?

622
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,180
You may put down the cosmetic case.

623
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,690
Mr. Xiao.

624
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:10,949
From today onwards,

625
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,980
Xiao Yu will be the teaching assistant at the Women's Academy.

626
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,380
He'll assist me in teaching.

627
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,800
It must be the help of Yueniang

628
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,230
that Mr. Xiao could come here.

629
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,080
I'm sorry.

630
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,320
Sir, I'm late.

631
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,650
Why are you late?

632
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,270
I saw a snake.

633
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:27,810
Snake?

634
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:28,679
Where is it?

635
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,239
In the forest.

636
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,080
Sir, can you sprinkle some realgar?

637
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,909
Otherwise, after class,

638
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,239
I won't dare to go out.

639
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,840
I'll go take a look and sprinkle some realgar powder.

640
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,770
You get familiar with Mr. Xiao.

641
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:42,590
All right.

642
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,219
Song Yi. Lu Jia.

643
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,429
Follow me.

644
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,170
Hello, ladies.

645
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,040
You can call me Teaching Assistant Xiao.

646
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,570
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

647
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,290
I hope I can get along with you in the future.

648
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,390
I also have some knowledge about makeup.

649
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,890
I hope we can discuss this together.

650
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,980
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

651
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,050
I have some questions for you.

652
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,200
Please go ahead.

653
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,240
Mr. Xiao.

654
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,830
Do you have any experience as a teaching assistant in other academies?

655
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:42,700
No.

656
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,640
Have you written any books on makeup?

657
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,870
No.

658
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,730
Have you learned from renowned teachers?

659
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:54,660
No.

660
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,190
You have no qualifications. Why are you here?

661
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,800
It seems that Mr. Xiao doesn't have

662
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,450
convincible qualifications.

663
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,610
Exactly.

664
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,390
Why is he teaching us if he doesn't have any qualifications?

665
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,320
How can he teach us?

666
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,270
That's right.

667
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,020
Yueniang.

668
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,100
Why do you bully Mr. Xiao like this?

669
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:26,050
Miss. You're wearing the Red Marks Makeup, aren't you?

670
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,180
Mr. Xiao, you can tell?

671
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,660
Miss. Please come with me.

672
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:37,840
OK.

673
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,220
Here.

674
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,640
Have a seat.

675
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,060
Thank you.

676
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,740
Don't paint the eyebrows as long, paint them short.

677
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,660
Red marks should be hanging, not vertical.

678
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,190
Do you know the origin of the Red Marks Makeup?

679
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,350
It is also known as Morning Dawn Makeup.

680
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,640
During the reign of Emperor Wen of Cao Wei,

681
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,210
a palace maid named Xue Yelai

682
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,610
accidentally shattered a crystal screen.

683
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,640
The fragments of crystal cut her face,

684
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,440
and the palace maid believed her appearance was ruined,

685
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,960
fearing she would no longer receive favor from the emperor.

686
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,330
However,

687
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,970
Emperor Wen, upon seeing her wound resembling the dispersing morning glow,

688
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,060
unexpectedly felt a sense of compassion and tenderness towards her.

689
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,330
Afterwards, the women in the palace all imitated her

690
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,880
in hopes that the emperor would view them differently as well.

691
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,680
It's also known as Morning Dawn Makeup.

692
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,940
Mr. Xiao,

693
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,800
you know so much.

694
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,690
He's really good at bluffing.

695
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,650
Lady Yan,

696
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,960
I didn't expect your makeup to have such a history.

697
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,670
Lady Zhao, do you mean it?

698
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,630
I really like it.

699
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,190
Qinruo.

700
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,280
Mr. Xiao knows so much.

701
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Mr. Xiao.

702
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,450
Could you provide an evaluation of my makeup

703
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,550
and that of other ladies?

704
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,820
Come up, ladies.

705
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,140
Let Mr. Xiao take a closer look at your makeup.

706
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,360
Hurry up.

707
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,150
Mr. Xiao.

708
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,680
Stay away from him.

709
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,680
This is not good.

710
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,750
Mr. Xiao.

711
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,100
Yueniang.

712
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,170
Come closer. He needs to take a closer look.

713
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,800
You don't have to be so close.

714
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:40,450
You...

715
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,590
As to short eyebrows, the length of yours is just right.

716
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,830
Ask one by one.

717
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,510
One by one.

718
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,590
Mr. Chen has always adhered to proper etiquette.

719
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,420
Why is he so intimately interacting with the female students?

720
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,400
Sir, why don't you put on your glasses

721
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,860
to see more clearly?

722
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,120
All right, stop it.

723
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,260
How dare you!

724
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,340
Stop!

725
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,720
Nonsense!

726
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,710
In broad daylight,

727
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:21,590
what kind of decorum is it for a man to be interacting so casually with a group of women?

728
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,530
Why are you so close to him?

729
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,980
Go away!

730
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,320
Hey you, come here.

731
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,190
Who are you?

732
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,300
Why are you here at the Women's Academy?

733
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,210
I, Xiao Yu, was newly appointed by Mr. Chen as the teaching assistant.

734
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,230
Nonsense.

735
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,500
Mr. Chen knows so many capable men.

736
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,700
Why would he appoint a young man like you?

737
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,840
Talent and knowledge have nothing to do with age.

738
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,850
Besides,

739
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,790
I can help the ladies study.

740
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,210
Why can't I be a teaching assistant?

741
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,840
Ridiculous.

742
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,630
That's right.

743
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,350
Sir.

744
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,950
This pervert came to Song's Academy secretly.

745
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,780
Now he came again.

746
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,580
If someone hadn't told me

747
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,520
that a man has come to the Women's Academy,

748
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,240
I wonder what ridiculous things

749
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,000
this pervert would do.

750
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,610
Get out now.

751
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,870
Or I'll report to the authorities.

752
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,640
Report to the authorities.

753
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,360
-Well.
-Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang.

754
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,200
Calm down.

755
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,370
Don't be angry.

756
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,810
It's such a sunny day.

757
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,410
Why don't we sit inside?

758
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,100
Go away.

759
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,610
Mr. Zhang.

760
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,390
Lady Zhu, lead the way.

761
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,330
Kick him out.

762
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,600
Yes, let's go.

763
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,410
Let go of me!

764
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:40,950
Go.

765
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,340
-Mr. Zhang.
-I’m not a pervert.
