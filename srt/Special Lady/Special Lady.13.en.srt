00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,979
[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,850
[Episode 13]

4
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,620
Can you call me Zhu from now on?

5
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,710
Yes, yes.

6
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,670
It sounds so nice to call her Zhu.

7
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,160
You sound distant if you call her Senior.

8
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,670
What do you think, Teaching Assistant Xiao?

9
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,870
Why are you looking at me?

10
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,110
What do you think?

11
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,970
If you want,

12
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,390
just call her Zhu.

13
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,070
Senior Yan is close to Senior Song.

14
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,420
Of course she can call her by her first name.

15
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,920
You're the teaching assistant of the Women's Academy.

16
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,240
It's reasonable that you call her Zhu.

17
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,140
I...

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,440
I'm just a student of the Men's Academy.

19
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,020
If I call her that,

20
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm afraid if this gets out,

21
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,480
it'll be bad for her reputation.

22
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,610
Well, there's a beverage shop ahead. It's quiet there.

23
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,079
Why don’t we go there to take a rest?

24
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,500
Junior Zhou, what do you think?

25
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:49,990
Okay.

26
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,920
Aged wine.

27
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,250
The drinks of this beverage shop are very delicious.

28
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,500
I often come here.

29
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,050
Sorry to keep you waiting.

30
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,120
Senior Song.

31
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,520
Thank you, Junior Zhou.

32
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,650
Please enjoy.

33
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,440
-Thank you. 
-Thank you.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,160
Teaching Assistant Xiao is such a perfect match for Qinruo.

35
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,560
Even their movements are the same when they eat.

36
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,060
Mr. Xiao, you like eating like this, too?

37
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,770
It tastes better to eat in this way.

38
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,460
I think so too.

39
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,140
Yueniang.

40
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,230
Well...

41
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,700
It's boring for us to eat Frozen Milk like this all the time.

42
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,079
Why don't we buy some snacks?

43
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,450
You can also take this chance to relax.

44
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,480
Okay.

45
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,310
I'll go then.

46
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,170
I'll go with you.

47
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,700
I... I'll go, too.

48
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,550
Then you can go.

49
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,300
We're not going.

50
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,280
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

51
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,500
Yueniang, I'll go, too.

52
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,140
Mr. Xiao, wait for me.

53
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,909
The candied dried fruits here

54
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,360
are the most famous in Yiyang County.

55
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,340
Sir, Miss, to be honest,

56
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,750
many rich families

57
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,330
ask their maids to buy them.

58
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,200
What kind of candied fruits do you like to eat normally?

59
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,460
I seldom eat these snacks.

60
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,180
These.

61
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,830
And these.

62
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,150
Give me a portion of them respectively.

63
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,200
Okay.

64
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,510
Miss, select some more.

65
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,220
Yueniang

66
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,830
normally likes eating sweet food.

67
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,160
But she likes the sour taste

68
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,520
of this candied haw jelly.

69
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,850
It tastes better if you eat it

70
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,170
with Frozen Milk.

71
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,190
You and Miss Zhu are really close to each other.

72
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,510
Of course.

73
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,370
Do you know what is the best match

74
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,800
for Frozen Milk, Junior Zhou?

75
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,670
What do you think?

76
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,740
We should eat it with candied haw jelly.

77
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,640
Frozen Milk is for relieving summer-heat,

78
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,100
while candied haw jelly tastes sour and sweet, and is also yummy.

79
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,240
If these two foods are eaten together,

80
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,660
it can stimulate our appetite and help with digestion.

81
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,600
But if you take a bite of them at the same time,

82
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,870
it will be the most delicious.

83
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,640
Miss, sir,

84
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,430
would you like to try our new drink,

85
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,380
Fragrant Tea?

86
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,610
If you buy two portions, you can get another one for free.

87
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,070
I need some fresh air.

88
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,220
Since your last name is Yan,

89
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,870
are you a relative of Duke Yue?

90
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,780
I am the legitimate daughter of Duke Yue.

91
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,150
Sorry that I didn't recognize you.

92
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,860
It's not your fault.

93
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,360
You didn't know it.

94
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,890
You're so kind.

95
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,040
Duke Yue's family is a noble family.

96
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,360
It's my honor to study with you.

97
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,610
Mr. Xiao, you're too courteous.

98
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,410
If you don't mind,

99
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,710
how about I ask Yueniang

100
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,600
and Mr. Zhou

101
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,170
to come with you to visit my home together in a few days?

102
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,770
My father can also take this chance

103
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,910
to meet the students of Yiyang Academy.

104
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,860
Well, it's inappropriate.

105
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,610
Your father has sent you here.

106
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,640
He must be close to the staff of the academy.

107
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,010
He must know

108
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,860
the level of the students in the academy, too.

109
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,659
I don't know much about my father's things.

110
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,380
But if he sees you, he'll have a clearer impression.

111
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,600
I see.

112
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,060
So you agree, Mr. Xiao?

113
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,900
The exam is coming.

114
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,030
Let's talk about it in a few days.

115
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,730
Okay.

116
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,940
I'll prepare in advance.

117
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,610
Ma'am, please pack this for me.

118
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:03,950
Okay.

119
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,530
Mr. Zhou.

120
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,290
Mr. Xiao.

121
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,750
Yueniang.

122
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,270
Yueniang.

123
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,820
What's wrong?

124
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,890
Let me tell you something.

125
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,480
Just now, Mr. Xiao

126
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,540
asked me about my family background.

127
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,190
Do you think he'll go to my home

128
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,390
to propose marriage soon?

129
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,190
Mr. Zhou.

130
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,810
-Mr. Xiao
-Have a seat.

131
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,360
even told me that...

132
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,060
-Mr. Xiao.
-Junior Zhou.

133
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,790
I don't understand some parts of this book.

134
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,150
Can you explain them for me?

135
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,020
Which parts do you not understand?

136
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,960
This, this, this and this

137
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,380
are the parts that I don't understand.

138
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,110
Miss Yan.

139
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,570
Please speak louder.

140
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,720
I didn't hear you clearly just now.

141
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,710
Since you think

142
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,880
this beverage shop is too noisy,

143
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,390
why don't we go somewhere quiet?

144
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,360
Somewhere quiet?

145
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,470
Okay. Just go at once.

146
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,390
Go. Go.

147
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,150
Mr. Zhou, pack up your things at once.

148
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,340
Hurry up. Pack up your things.

149
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,060
No.

150
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,640
Why did you ask Junior Zhou to do this?

151
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,740
Didn't you hear Miss Yan say that

152
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,900
it was too noisy here?

153
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,390
Didn't she say that she wanted to go somewhere else?

154
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,450
Okay.

155
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,310
No!

156
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,940
No, Junior Zhou.

157
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,180
Actually, I think if I sit next to Mr. Xiao,

158
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,700
he can definitely hear me.

159
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,540
Junior Zhou, sit down.

160
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,340
There's no need to go somewhere else.

161
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,330
You don't need to pack up your things, either.

162
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,140
I also think that

163
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,650
it's a bit too troublesome to go somewhere else.

164
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,350
Let's just sit here.

165
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,570
Okay.

166
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,870
Yes.

167
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,010
Mr. Xiao,

168
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,760
help me take a look.

169
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,250
I don't understand these parts.

170
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,300
You don't understand?

171
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:32,820
Junior Zhou.

172
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,620
There's also one part here which I don't quite understand.

173
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,060
Take a look.

174
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,600
A man travelling far away from his home...

175
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,530
What a coincidence.

176
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,620
There's also something I don't understand.

177
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,600
I want to hear Mr. Zhou's opinion, too.

178
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,630
Mr. Zhou, look. Look at mine.

179
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,550
No, no, no.

180
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,250
Look at mine first.

181
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,800
Look at this.

182
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,320
This one.

183
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,290
With Mr. Xiao's knowledge,

184
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,690
I wouldn't dare to talk about my shallow ideas.

185
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,100
Mr. Zhou, don't be nervous.

186
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,730
Let’s discuss it together.

187
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,530
Discuss it together.

188
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,340
Don't you also have a question, Miss Yan?

189
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,040
Why don't we discuss it together?

190
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,470
Okay?

191
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,770
Let's discuss it together.

192
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,340
Discuss it together.

193
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,830
Sit down. Sit.

194
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,330
Zhu, just sit down.

195
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,770
Sit.

196
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,040
Sit down. Let's discuss it together.

197
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,200
♫Sir, you're well-versed with the tonal patterns of poems and have read thousands of books♫

198
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,650
Then let's discuss it together.

199
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,270
♫But you can't figure out what I'm thinking♫

200
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,080
Mr. Xiao,

201
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,800
if there's any question which I can't answer,

202
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,150
♫We talked to each other passionately and read the Spring and Autumn Annals♫

203
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,590
remember to make an additional explanation for me.

204
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,910
No problem.

205
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,290
♫I closed my eyes gradually♫

206
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,690
Mr. Xiao.

♫I want to be a guest in your poems♫

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,600
Junior Zhou.

218
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,750
Thanks, Senior.

219
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,380
You're welcome.

220
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,040
Qinruo.

221
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,900
Thank you, Yueniang.

222
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,340
Junior Zhou,

223
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,610
when you explained this sentence just now,

224
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,760
Confucius said, "We should advocate good morality"...

225
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,590
Mr. Xiao,

226
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,940
can I discuss something with you?

227
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,830
Sure.

228
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,140
Look. Don't you think Yueniang and Junior Zhou are a perfect match?

229
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,390
Maybe.

230
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,090
As the teaching assistant of the Women's Academy,

231
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,860
do you want to see that

232
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,250
or do you also hope that

233
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,290
Yueniang can marry a good man?

234
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,180
So?

235
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,170
So later, let's find

236
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,660
an excuse to sneak away.

237
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,600
Then both of them can stay in a room alone.

238
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,690
It'll also be a good chance to make them fall in love with each other.

239
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,770
This is my opinion.

240
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,320
Repeat what you've just said.

241
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,240
What about us?

242
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,020
Of course we can spend more time together.

243
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,190
We can just take a walk casually.

244
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,630
Just take a walk.

245
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,550
Okay.

246
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,700
It's settled then.

247
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,850
I’ll go pack up my things.

248
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,400
Junior Zhou, are you alright?

249
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,060
Get out of the way.

250
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:39,630
I'm fine.

251
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,150
I'm fine.

252
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,580
Are you alright?

253
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,560
I'm fine.

254
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,640
I can do it myself.

255
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,540
Did you do it on purpose?

256
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,240
Zhu, you misunderstood me.

257
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,980
Mr. Xiao didn't do it on purpose.

258
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,080
Senior,

259
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,550
don't be angry.

260
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,110
Sorry to have spilt the tea on you.

261
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:01,860
It's all right.

262
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,700
Please taste it.

263
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,510
By the way,

264
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,520
it's getting late today.

265
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,410
Miss Yan has also finished her homework.

266
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,400
Why don't we just

267
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,730
call it a day?

268
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:14,950
Okay.

269
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,510
No!

270
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,970
I just think that we've been studying for so long.

271
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,750
We should at least take a rest.

272
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,110
Why don't we have a lake tour?

273
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,870
A lake tour is great.

274
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,710
It's great.

275
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,070
It's very interesting.

276
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,080
-Okay.
-It's very interesting.

277
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,550
Okay.

278
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,120
You agreed?

279
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,160
Let's go pack up our things.

280
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,140
Let's pack up our things.

281
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,340
This one, this one.

282
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,240
Junior Zhou, hurry up.

283
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,300
Coming.

284
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,180
Yueniang, what should we do later?

285
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,200
Just act according to the circumstances.

286
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,360
Take care, my dear guests.

287
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,540
Young Master,

288
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,440
I've asked around according to your order.

289
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,300
Xiao Yu is going to the Taohua Lake to row a boat.

290
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,980
Act as planned.

291
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,440
Yes.

292
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,880
Yueniang, slow down.

293
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,570
I'm fine.

294
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,850
It's such a nice view.

295
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,070
We must have fun later.

296
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,230
Why don't we go buy some wine and then drink it during the lake tour?

297
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:50,780
Okay.

298
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,700
Why don't you and Mr. Xiao go book a boat first?

299
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,880
Then Mr. Zhou and I

300
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,020
will go buy some wine.

301
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,010
Let's meet later.

302
00:16:59,330 --> 00:16:59,730
Let's go.

303
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,230
No!

304
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,520
Why not?

305
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,910
For something like this,

306
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,730
just let Mr. Zhou and me do it.

307
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,210
Do you mean that you want Qinruo and me to book a boat?

308
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,030
No, no.

309
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,460
I don't know how to book a boat.

310
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,380
Well,

311
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,130
how about I go book a boat?

312
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,579
Then I'll go with you.

313
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,750
No, you can't go with Mr. Zhou.

314
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,480
It's useless for you to glare at me.

315
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,380
Miss Yan is weak.

316
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,070
She can't carry heavy things.

317
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,520
Right?

318
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,280
Yes.

319
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,040
I can't carry heavy things.

320
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,220
-I can't.
-You can't.

321
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,470
You can't.

322
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,730
Do you mean that I can carry heavy things?

323
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,950
At least, you're better than Miss Yan.

324
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,670
Right?

325
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,590
Of course.

326
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,870
That's it.

327
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,730
It's settled then.

328
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,850
Zhu and I will go prepare some wine together.

329
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:56,520
Miss Yan,

330
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,000
you and Mr. Zhou should go  book a boat.

331
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,450
Okay?

332
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,480
Junior Zhou.

333
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,150
Mr. Xiao.

334
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,190
Junior Zhou, I'll go with you!

335
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,720
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

336
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,610
I'll go with you!

337
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,160
Junior Zhou!

338
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,880
Don't worry, Mr. Xiao.

339
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,080
-Yueniang!
-Junior Zhou!

340
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,750
Let go of me!

341
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,260
Hurry up.

342
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,920
Junior Zhou!

343
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,090
Junior Zhou, I'll go with...

344
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,310
Let go!

345
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,170
Let go of me!

346
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,250
Junior Zhou!

347
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,010
Stop yelling.

348
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,710
Let go!

349
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,350
Hurry up.

350
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,650
Junior Zhou!

351
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,670
Let go of me!

352
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,470
Junior Zhou!

353
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,570
Junior Zhou!

354
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,870
He's gone far.

355
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,000
Xiao Yu, what are you doing?

356
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,210
-What’s wrong?
-I…

357
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,370
We had a deal.

358
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,640
You'll deal with your Qinruo,

359
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,480
and I'll have a date with my Mr. Zhou.

360
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,740
You tried to stop me again and again.

361
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,990
I don't know what you're up to.

362
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,010
Zhu.

363
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,280
Do you think

364
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,040
I am handsome?

365
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,060
Handsome?

366
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,130
Where did you get the confidence?

367
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,500
Stay away from me.

368
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,370
Although I'm so popular

369
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,590
and charming...

370
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,360
Don't tell me that

371
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,660
you have a crush on me.

372
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,800
I have a crush on you?

373
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,210
I may have a crush on anybody else,

374
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,130
but not on you. Okay?

375
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,610
Why would I have a crush on you?

376
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,200
-Is it possible that I would have a crush on you?
-Say it again to me?

377
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,610
Come on.

378
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,710
Don't always hit me.

379
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,530
Say it again to...

380
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,880
-Don't always hit me. -Say it...

381
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:41,830
Say it...

382
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,800
Stop, stop, stop!

383
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,690
-I won’t stop.
-Stop!

384
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,150
I'm angry.

385
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,840
You said you had no interest in me.

386
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,080
But do you know why?

387
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,620
Why? Because I hate you.

388
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,440
No.

389
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,000
Since I entered the academy,

390
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,070
we've been in contact frequently.

391
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,120
Just because of such frequent contact,

392
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,130
we don't like each other.

393
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,120
Therefore,

394
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,900
absence makes the heart grow fonder.

395
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,160
Remember this.

396
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,830
Don't be so eager like a hungry tiger hunting its prey as you did before.

397
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,970
If you destroy the sense of distance,

398
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,240
his interest will gradually decrease.

399
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,670
Miss Yan and I have kept a distance from each other

400
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,680
because of the same reason.

401
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,200
Xiao Yu.

402
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,770
You talked about dignity with me before.

403
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,910
Now you're telling me that absence makes the heart grow fonder.

404
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,740
Just tell me whether you're tricking me.

405
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,420
Zhu.

406
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,210
Why don't you look at me again?

407
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,020
Do you want to die?

408
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,490
Mr. Zhou, why are you back?

409
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,870
Didn't you go book a boat?

410
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,680
Zhou...

411
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,400
Xiao Yu.

412
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,190
Why are you leaving again?

413
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,780
Bloody Xiao Yu!

414
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,450
How dare you make fun of me?

415
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,350
I'll beat you to death!

416
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,620
Bloody Xiao Yu!

417
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,270
Stop!

418
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,760
Senior Yan, I'll buy ferry tickets over there.

419
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,260
Just wait for me.

420
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,770
Okay.

421
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,850
Zhu.

422
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,040
Are you tired?

423
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,260
What do you think?

424
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,680
Do you want to take a rest?

425
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,920
I'll find a boatman

426
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,600
and ask him to do all the work for us.

427
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,640
Why didn't you suggest this earlier?

428
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,630
I forgot.

429
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,940
It's my fault. I didn't think of it.

430
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,150
Just wait for me.

431
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:26,840
Wait for me.

432
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,980
This morning,

433
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
Song Xu sent a letter to Xiao Chuanzhong.

434
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,910
I intercepted it.

435
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,010
Besides,

436
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,610
when I passed by here just now,

437
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,590
I found that several people were following you.

438
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Judging from the fabric of their clothes,

439
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,210
I think they might come from the mansion of Lord Li, who is the assistant magistrate.

440
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,720
Don't stay too long, Young Master.

441
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
I'll investigate the assistant magistrate.

442
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,620
What's wrong with each of them?

443
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,310
We agreed to have a lake tour.

444
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,950
But I'm the only one left here now.

445
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,080
That bloody Xiao Yu.

446
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,840
He said that absence makes the heart grow fonder.

447
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,840
I think he deliberately tricked me.

448
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,450
It's been so long.

449
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,000
Qinruo and Junior Zhou haven't come back yet.

450
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,200
If this chance had been given to me,

451
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,130
I would have succeeded.

452
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,440
Bloody Xiao Yu!

453
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,640
Oh no.

454
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,860
Sir, please wait.

455
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,070
Have you seen a gentleman

456
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,380
who looks handsome and graceful?

457
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,570
He went to buy ferry tickets just now,

458
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,740
but he hasn't returned yet.

459
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,160
He went that way.

460
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,730
Thank you.

461
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,400
What are you doing?

462
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,440
You want to run away?

463
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:23,750
Don't move!

464
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:26,980
Who are you?

465
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,340
Our young master said that

466
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,140
you should mind your own business.

467
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,310
Did you hear that?

468
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,340
Stop!

469
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,910
I'll kill you!

470
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,740
How dare you!

471
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,700
I'm the legitimate daughter of Duke Yue.

472
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,360
I am the only daughter of my father.

473
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,210
Let me tell you.

474
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,730
If you dare to hurt me,

475
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,300
even your master can't protect you.

476
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,620
What a good legitimate daughter of Duke Yue!

477
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,190
Stop! Don't move!

478
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,330
Don't move.

479
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,440
Now you're so scared that you're yelling?

480
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,030
Where is the courage you showed just now?

481
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,810
Go away!

482
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,270
Senior.

483
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,560
You're hurt.

484
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,810
I'm fine.

485
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,830
We can't stay here for long.

486
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,240
Let's go back first.

487
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,590
Let's go.

488
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,020
You're lucky.

489
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,370
All right.

490
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,570
Bandage it up.

491
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,890
Thank you.

492
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,710
You're a knowledgeable man in daily life, but I didn't expect that

493
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,910
you would be so considerate, too.

494
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,630
Don't listen to

495
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,040
those people who always say that Yueniang is careless.

496
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,970
But in fact,

497
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,980
Yueniang is very considerate.

498
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,400
Senior Song is indeed a rare girl.

499
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,170
Hearing what you said,

500
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,700
I think your impression on Yueniang is quite good.

501
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,590
I...

502
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,440
I wonder what kind of girl you like.

503
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,490
Is there someone you like?

504
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,990
I came to Yiyang Academy to study.

505
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,080
I dare not have other thoughts.

506
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,610
You've never even thought about it?

507
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,100
No.

508
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,320
Senior, let's go back at once.

509
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,650
Otherwise, Mr. Xiao and Senior Song will be worried.

510
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,330
He left just like that?

511
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,180
Why would Yueniang

512
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,270
fall in love with such a blockhead?

513
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,910
How boring.

514
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,610
Song Zhu!

515
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,280
Song Zhu!

516
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,080
Song Zhu!

517
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,700
Don't come over.

518
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,900
I won't be on the same boat with you.

519
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:18,850
I...

520
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,640
I want to be on the same boat with Junior Zhou.

521
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,460
Don't just stand there. Come here now.

522
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:24,780
Hurry.

523
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,930
No!

524
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,610
I don't want to be on the same boat with you.

525
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,960
Where is Junior Zhou?

526
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
I’m going to find him.

527
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,740
Just check if there are oars on your boat first.

528
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,470
You even want to go find him?

529
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,160
Xiao Yu, did you trick me on purpose?

530
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,250
Come here now.

531
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,090
Don't just stand there anymore.

532
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,730
If you go on standing there, you won't be able to find Junior Zhou.

533
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,280
Hurry.

534
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,300
Come on.

535
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,040
Up!

536
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,600
Xiao Yu!

537
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,530
Come here now!

538
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,330
Help!

539
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,680
Help! Help!

540
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,210
Help! Come on!

541
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,500
-Help!
-Hold my hand.

542
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,670
Xiao Yu!

543
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,140
Zhu!

544
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,910
Zhu, help!

545
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,330
Xiao Yu, give me your hand!

546
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,040
-Help!
-Hurry up!

547
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,080
Help! Help!

548
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,640
Help!

549
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,830
-Give me your hand.
-Help!

550
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,820
-Give me your hand.
-Help!

551
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,320
-Give me your hand.
-I can't find it.

552
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,460
Xiao Yu, let me drag you!

553
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,200
What are you doing?

554
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,230
What are you doing?

555
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,400
What are you doing?

556
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,160
I stood up.

557
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,290
The river is so shallow.

558
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,730
Why is it so shallow?

559
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,750
You...

560
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,930
Bloody Xiao Yu!

561
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,130
Did you make fun of me deliberately?

562
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:47,580
No.

563
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,060
I'll beat you to death.

564
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:51,890
No.

565
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,350
No.

566
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,750
I gave you a chance to save the hero as a beauty.

567
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,040
Nasty Xiao Yu!

568
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,870
I'll beat you!

569
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,850
I'll beat you to death!

570
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,600
I'll beat you to death!

571
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,790
I'll beat you to death!

572
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,460
Yueniang.

573
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,690
Let's just follow the original plan.

574
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,270
Okay?

575
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,990
You should go show concern for Mr. Zhou and explain it.

576
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,030
I'll go to Teaching Assistant Xiao.

577
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,510
Just go now.

578
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,330
Senior Song.

579
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,310
Junior Zhou.

580
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,660
Were you okay just now?

581
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,880
There's nothing serious about my wound.

582
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,530
Thanks for your concern.

583
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,940
Junior Zhou,

584
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,640
just now, we fell into the lake...

585
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,970
I know it was an accident.

586
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,760
Mr. Xiao explained it to me, too.

587
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,540
I just hope that you're fine.

588
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,410
I didn't find any other clothes.

589
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,270
But I have a cloak for girls.

590
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:36,920
Put it on.

591
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,520
If you want to see the doctor whom you saw a few days ago,

592
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,830
you don't need to wear it.

593
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,140
Senior.

594
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,840
Mr. Xiao is right.

595
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,200
Put on the cloak.

596
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,480
If you get sick,

597
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,770
it'll be bad.

598
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,140
It's okay.

599
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,690
It'll be fine for me to get warm by the fire.

600
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,570
Senior, why are you doing this?

601
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,270
Put on the cloak.

602
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm not that bad.

603
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,300
If you catch a cold,

604
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,570
I'll feel sad.

605
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,370
Qinruo, you are so nice.

606
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,480
Wrap it around you tightly.

607
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,220
If you've put on the cloak,

608
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,030
let's go back.

609
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,580
What about you, Mr. Xiao?

610
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,490
I'm fine. I'm strong.

611
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,130
How about this?

612
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,620
It's getting late.

613
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,280
And it's windy here.

614
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,590
Let's go back and get changed.

615
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,810
Alright. Don't catch a cold.

616
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,620
Let's go.

617
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:12,950
Broom!

618
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:14,890
Stand here.

619
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,510
Hurry up!

620
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,040
I told you to teach them a lesson,

621
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,750
but you were hit by them instead.

622
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,730
You've embarrassed me!

623
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,260
I...

624
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,480
I'll kick you!

625
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,540
Young Master, I'm sorry.

626
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,920
Young Master, I'll do it well next time.

627
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,510
Next time?

628
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,300
Will I let you do this next time?

629
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,480
Can you still do this next time?

630
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,020
What else can you do?

631
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,570
Why are you shouting at them?

632
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,900
Sorry for his rudeness.

633
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,340
Get lost!

634
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,240
Yes.

635
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,390
Who is it?

636
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,090
Father, who is it?

637
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,000
You don't need to know.

638
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,110
Why were you shouting at them?

639
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,230
They...

640
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,520
I asked them to go to Yiyang Academy

641
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,500
and take revenge on those two annoying guys,

642
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,890
but they were hit by them in the end.

643
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,940
This is such a disgrace for me now.

644
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,020
Son,

645
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,370
for the humiliation you suffered in Yiyang Academy,

646
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,890
I'll vent the anger for you some other day.

647
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,680
Really?

648
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,770
Don't worry.

649
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,380
Father. You're really my father.

650
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,280
You're really my father.

651
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,680
Of course I'm really your father.

652
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,800
Father, let me massage your shoulders.

653
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,880
-Let me massage your shoulders.
-Okay.

654
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,410
My father is so nice.

655
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,800
You should send Qinruo back.

656
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,700
Didn't you say that you would never talk to me again?

657
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,780
I'm worried that Qinruo might be unhappy.

658
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,520
Besides, you like her, don't you?

659
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,890
Send her back and take this chance to confess your love to her.

660
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,400
Then you two will become a couple.

661
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,200
I'm not ready to confess my love yet.

662
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,050
Don't arrange it arbitrarily.

663
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,020
How about this?

664
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,940
Teaching Assistant Xiao, please send Qinruo back.

665
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,050
Junior Zhou can send me back. What do you think?

666
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,010
Okay.

667
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,530
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

668
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,090
By the way,

669
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,240
I've heard that the moon will be full in a few days.

670
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,290
I've heard that the full moon this time will be very beautiful.

671
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,450
Junior Zhou,

672
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,810
shall we go to the mountain to admire the moon together?

673
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,120
Yueniang's idea is good.

674
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,280
What about you, Mr. Xiao?

675
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,489
What do you think, Mr. Zhou?

676
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,000
If Senior Song wants to go,

677
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,080
let's go together.

678
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,530
Good! Great!

679
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,000
Don't go back on your word.

680
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,760
Why didn't you say no?

681
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,270
I gave you a hint.

682
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,710
Didn't you mean to say yes?

683
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,429
Where is our tacit understanding?

684
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,389
Let's go.

685
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,380
Let's go.

686
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:06,020
[Song Mansion]

687
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,190
After you go back,

688
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,610
you should drink more hot ginger soup to remove the coldness.

689
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,700
Well... Rest early.

690
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,280
Well... I'm going back now.

691
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,240
Goodbye, Mr. Zhou.

692
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,170
By the way, Mr. Zhou,

693
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,160
I need your guidance about something.

694
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,540
I forgot it because of

695
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,790
the messy situations today.

696
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,610
I'm not qualified to give you guidance,

697
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,030
but I'm willing to help you solve your problem.

698
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,070
A few days ago,

699
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,550
I read Nine Songs—Madam Xiang, which was written by Qu Yuan.

700
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,380
Here are a few lines from it.

701
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,340
I'm looking around while stepping on the waterweeds.

702
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,890
I have a date with a beautiful girl tonight.

703
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,150
Why did the birds gather on the waterweeds?

704
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,930
Why is the fishing net hung on the tree?

705
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:11,190
The angelica is green by the Yuan River and the Orchids are beautiful by the Li River.

706
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:17,660
How do you explain these four words of

707
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,620
Angelica, Yuan, Orchids and Li?

708
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,690
The original line refers to the fragrant grass grown on the two shores of Yuan and Li.

709
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,190
Yuan means Yuan River.

710
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,360
Angelica refers to a kind of grass.

711
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,060
It's easy to understand these things.

712
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:42,250
And the next line means...

713
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,100
Yueniang.

714
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,170
Hello, Senior Yi.

715
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,170
Your clothes...

716
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,660
Sister, I'll explain to you after we go back inside.

717
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,600
See you, Junior Zhou.

718
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,180
It's getting late.

719
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,080
Miss Yan, just go back and rest.

720
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,560
Mr. Xiao.

721
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,690
What else can I do for you, Miss Yan?

722
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,430
Today,

723
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:34,570
I saw that Yueniang was very concerned about Junior Zhou.

724
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,030
They like each other.

725
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,760
I envy them very much.

726
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,800
I also hope that

727
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,910
the person I like

728
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,350
is also the one who likes me.

729
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,070
Though you might laugh at me, I still want to tell you about it.

730
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,480
Since you became the teaching assistant of the Women's Academy,

731
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,760
it seems I've liked

732
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,100
studying in the Women's Academy more and more.

733
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,170
Thanks for your fondness.

734
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,320
Well,

735
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,570
do you understand what I mean?

736
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,990
Actually, I also have something to tell you.

737
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,750
Please say it.

738
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,760
Here's the thing.

739
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,260
My clothes are still wet. I'm going back to get changed first.

740
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,770
You should rest early, too.

741
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,010
Mr. Xiao.

742
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,970
That's all?

743
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,170
Did he understand

744
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,310
or not?

745
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:04,620
Come on.

746
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,350
Have some ginger tea to remove the coldness.

747
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,510
If you had come a little later today,

748
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,290
I would have succeeded.

749
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,540
Why did you say so?

750
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,090
Nothing.

751
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,490
I was just talking to myself.

752
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,660
Sister,

753
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,280
our mother doesn't know that you've made me some ginger tea, right?

754
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,710
She has gone back to her room.

755
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,060
Look at you.

756
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,930
You always cause trouble.

757
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,390
You make me worry about you frequently.

758
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,870
You're the one who makes me worry frequently.

759
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,580
It was just an accident.

760
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,680
I didn't make trouble.

761
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,890
Speaking of which, I want to ask you

762
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,410
why Junior Zhou was the one who sent you back tonight.

763
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,210
Didn't you go out

764
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,060
with Mr. Xiao and Miss Yan?

765
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,040
What's wrong with Mr. Zhou sending me back home?

766
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,060
You and Mr. Xiao are engaged.

767
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,580
Of course Mr. Xiao should be the one who sends you back home.

768
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,610
Mr. Xiao is sending Qinruo back to the dorm now.

769
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,050
Why?

770
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,370
It suddenly occurred to me that

771
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,250
Mr. Xiao's clothes also got wet.

772
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,010
He and Qinruo can go back to the dorm together.

773
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,190
This is a better way for him to get changed quickly.

774
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,130
Mr. Xiao is sending Miss Yan back to the dorm.

775
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,090
Junior Zhou sent you back home.

776
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,550
I feel something is wrong.

777
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,110
Have you ever liked anyone, Sister?

778
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,080
How can I answer your question?

779
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:17,990
If I say yes,

780
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,880
it's like leaking my own secret.

781
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,110
If I say no,

782
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,050
you'll laugh at me for being ignorant.

783
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,660
I wonder

784
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,780
why you asked me this question.

785
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,930
You want to get the truth out of me?

786
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,030
I won't fall into your trap, either.

787
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,050
Is it related to Mr. Xiao?

788
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,260
Yes, it is.

789
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,330
But it's not related to him as well.

790
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,810
I'm just curious

791
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,580
how it feels to like someone.

792
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,740
Is it a feeling with full of  expectation?

793
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,400
I think

794
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:02,850
it might be like that.

795
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,270
I think so, too.

796
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,380
Do you have any expectations for Mr. Xiao?

797
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,020
Yes, I do.

798
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,080
I just expect that

799
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,410
he'll bring the letter from his father to break off the engagement at once.
