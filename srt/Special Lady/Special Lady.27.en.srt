[Episode 27]

4
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,390
Let me tell you.

5
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,680
The pastry is very delicious.

6
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,289
Really? I want to try it too.

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,200
Lady Yan,

8
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:50,380
what happened?

9
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,729
Miss Yan.

10
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,530
Did you two...

11
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,950
know Xiao Yu and Song Zhu

12
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,600
are engaged long ago?

13
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,350
-They are...
-Engaged?

14
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,430
Am I the only one

15
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,350
in the academy

16
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,330
who was fooled like an idiot?

17
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,630
Miss Yan, calm down first.

18
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,550
Lady Yan,

19
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,240
-we really didn't know this.
-Get out.

20
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,950
I asked you to get out. Didn't you hear me?

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,170
Get out!

22
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,000
-Miss Yan.
-Lady Yan.

23
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,790
Why don't we...

24
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,640
go to my room, Lady Zhao?

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,560
Qinruo.

26
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,060
Let me explain first.

27
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,210
The engagement was made by my father

28
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,980
when I was three.

29
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,320
I planned to cancel the engagement.

30
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,230
And?

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,070
All this time,

32
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,340
you've been engaged, right?

33
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,940
You've been lying to me

34
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,260
all along.

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,790
Right?

36
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,450
If there's nothing else,

37
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,300
I want to rest.

38
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,450
Qinruo.

39
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,420
Qinruo, let me explain first.

40
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,240
Qinruo.

41
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,440
Qinruo, open the door first.

42
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,040
Let me explain.

43
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,910
Qinruo.

44
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,100
Fortune-telling. Fortune-telling.

45
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,310
Fortune-telling. Fortune-telling. Does anyone want to try fortune-telling?

46
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,220
Does anyone want to try fortune-telling? Fortune-telling.

47
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,480
Let's go.

48
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:38,430
Mr. Zhou?

49
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,200
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou.

50
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,580
Fortune-teller Ding Miao is here.

51
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,950
Mr. Zhou, do you believe in fate?

52
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,900
Mr. Zhou,

53
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,370
do you want us to read your marriage fate?

54
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,970
Xue Hanfu just learned it.

55
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,340
Why don't you... give him a chance to try it?

56
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,470
Yes, I just learned it.

57
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,900
Let me read your fortune.

58
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,640
Mr. Zhou, come on.

59
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,720
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou.

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,360
Let's go.

61
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,870
It's all my fault.

62
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,140
What exactly do you want to say?

63
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,650
What can you say even if you go to Zhou Ji now?

64
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,720
The result will be the same,

65
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,960
just like when you went to Yan Qinruo.

66
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,150
You've been following me.

67
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,180
It's raining.

68
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,750
Let's go home.

69
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,900
It's none of your business.

70
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,100
Don't joke about your health, okay?

71
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,330
You're the one who will suffer if you catch a cold.

72
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,520
It's all your fault.

73
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,490
It's all your fault. It's all your fault.

74
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,690
Why didn't you help me explain just now?

75
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,230
You were there just now.

76
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,750
Why?

77
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:50,970
I...

78
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,870
What could I possibly say?

79
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,750
Why?

80
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,410
Why?

81
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,710
Why are we engaged?

82
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,820
Why has my life been arranged since I was born?

83
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,260
Why should I take responsibility

84
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,370
for a decision made by someone else?

85
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,740
Why?

86
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,440
Xiao Yu, stop following me.

87
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:44,500
I don't want to see you.

88
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,470
Xiao Yu,

89
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,260
why did you appear in my life?

90
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,070
Do you hate me that much?

91
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:09,910
Yes.

92
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,450
I hate you so much.

93
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,420
Can't I hate you?

94
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,280
Shouldn't I hate you?

95
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,850
I'm a liar.

96
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,030
You're a liar too.

97
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,960
Stop following me.

98
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,850
Actually...

99
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
Actually, I...

100
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,700
I'm not Xiao Yu.

101
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,330
Untie me!

102
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,220
Untie me!

103
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,250
Untie me!

104
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,270
How dare you kidnap me!

105
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,830
How dare you...

106
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,660
You...

107
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,120
Father?

108
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,840
Chen Yan,

109
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,450
are you done?

110
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,070
Father,

111
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,230
what is this about?

112
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,760
Untie me now.

113
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,310
Have you had enough fun

114
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,220
all these days?

115
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,030
Xiao Yu.

116
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,450
Your Highness, do you think he looks familiar?

117
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,680
He is the teaching assistant of Women's Academy of Yiyang Academy.

118
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,350
His name is Xiao Yu.

119
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,930
Father,

120
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,690
I'm not doing this to have fun.

121
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,580
I have something important to do.

122
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,440
Ridiculous.

123
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,550
What's so important

124
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,280
that you have to be the teaching assistant

125
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,350
with someone else's identity?

126
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,460
Tell me.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,650
I was just going to tell you.

128
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,040
Actually, I...

129
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,900
Actually, I

130
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,420
like the study atmosphere of Yiyang Academy.

131
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,330
Stop playing tricks with me.

132
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,460
Do you know your mother has been so worried about you

133
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,020
that she has been unable to eat or sleep every day?

134
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,650
You have to go back

135
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,720
with me today.

136
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,450
Father,

137
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,960
if I leave without saying goodbye like this,

138
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,190
the people in the academy will worry about me.

139
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,290
I knew you would say this.

140
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,100
Don't worry.

141
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,500
I've asked someone to deliver

142
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,750
a letter of resignation to Mr. Chen.

143
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,120
No one will worry about you.

144
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,830
Father,

145
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,110
how could you submit a letter of resignation for me without my permission?

146
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,790
Can you be reasonable?

147
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,560
You want me to reason with you?

148
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,360
What's the use of reasoning with you?

149
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,150
You left without saying goodbye to me or your mother.

150
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,450
Have you ever thought

151
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,570
if we would worry about you?

152
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,130
No.

153
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,330
I'm going back.

154
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:07,960
Father,

155
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,860
why are you so cruel?

156
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,720
If you keep being unreasonable,

157
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,790
I can be crueller.

158
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,440
In your eyes, I'm always unreasonable.

159
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,030
I don't care what you're doing now.

160
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,730
You have to go back with me today.

161
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,670
There's no room for discussion.

162
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,250
What if I refuse?

163
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,150
Try it.

164
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,050
Jump off the ship

165
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,130
if you dare.

166
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,830
Fine.

167
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,630
I'm going to give it a try today.

168
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,620
-Young Master!
-Young Master!

169
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,350
Let me go!

170
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,300
-You can't jump.
-You can't jump.

171
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,930
Let go!

172
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,070
Let go!

173
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,780
Let go of me!

174
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,400
Be careful.

175
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,770
Let go! I'm going to jump into the river!

176
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,890
Yueniang.

177
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,080
Yue...

178
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,880
What's wrong with her?

179
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,670
Yueniang,

180
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,440
get up for lunch.

181
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,930
Yueniang,

182
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,630
I won't wait for you if you don't get up now.

183
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:43,990
Yueniang?

184
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,130
Yueniang

185
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,570
is getting lazier.

186
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,810
Where's Yueniang? Why hasn't she come here yet?

187
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,990
Mother, I went to get her just now.

188
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,450
I guess she's still sleeping.

189
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,840
Why hasn't she got up at this hour?

190
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,390
Maybe she just fell asleep

191
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,940
after burning the midnight oil copying books last night.

192
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,280
Right.

193
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,880
I saw Yueniang yesterday.

194
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,390
It seemed she...

195
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,710
It seemed what?

196
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,530
It seemed she was unwell.

197
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,210
She was all wet.

198
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,210
Uncle Dai, hurry up.

199
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:37,820
Okay.

200
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,670
Yueniang. Yueniang.

201
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,730
Yueniang.

202
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:44,720
This...

203
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,160
Uncle Dai, force the door open.

204
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:54,820
Yueniang,

205
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,640
I'm going to burst the door open.

206
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,550
Do it.

207
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,090
Yueniang, what happened?

208
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,680
What's wrong?

209
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,950
Yueniang.

210
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,360
No matter what happened, you can just tell me.

211
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,310
Don't keep it to yourself.

212
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,610
Don't make me worried.

213
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:25,990
Mr. Song.

214
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,890
-Darling.
-Mr. Song.

215
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,690
Yueniang...

216
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,870
Leave.

217
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,550
Yueniang,

218
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,230
do you have anything to tell me?

219
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,480
Father,

220
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,830
I made a mistake.

221
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,950
They will forgive me

222
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,480
after I finish copying these books, right?

223
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,790
Tell me

224
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,460
what mistake you made.

225
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,200
Father,

226
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,260
do you think

227
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,420
they will forgive a liar?

228
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,150
Darling,

229
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,300
what on earth happened to Yueniang?

230
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,780
Uncle Dai.

231
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,510
Mr. Song.

232
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,670
Did anything happen in the academy recently?

233
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,980
I've never heard of anything.

234
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,240
Yueniang was fine the day before yesterday.

235
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,130
Darling, do you mean

236
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,180
what happened to Yueniang is related to the academy?

237
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,470
I'll ask around.

238
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,850
Don't disturb Yueniang.

239
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:08,440
[Prince Fu's Mansion]

240
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,349
Mother.

241
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,720
Yan.

242
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,190
Mother, you're finally here.

243
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,530
You've lost weight.

244
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,410
Come on.

245
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,720
I specially asked them to make chicken soup for you.

246
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,069
Drink it while it's hot.

247
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:25,960
Here.

248
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,010
Drink slowly.

249
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
Look how hungry you are.

250
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,800
Mother,

251
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,350
can you hold a blind date party for me?

252
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,310
Why?

253
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,100
Well.

254
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,830
Father and you

255
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,980
can't always keep an eye on me like this.

256
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,790
So I want you to hold a blind date party for me.

257
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,210
I'll marry a girl I like.

258
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,350
And you can let her keep an eye on me.

259
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,940
Do you agree?

260
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,540
Of course I agree.

261
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,210
Well...

262
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,800
Let's put it on the agenda, Mother.

263
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,360
Let's... Let's get this done in the next few days.

264
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,400
Okay.

265
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,950
Yan has become sensible.

266
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,850
Come on, drink more while it's hot.

267
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,980
[To Xiao Chuanzhong]

268
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,280
Yueniang,

269
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,850
you are no longer a liar.

270
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,550
I've asked around in the academy.

271
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,270
I know what's troubling you.

272
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,500
In terms of the engagement,

273
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,550
I was thoughtless.

274
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,470
This is a letter I wrote to your Uncle Chuanzhong.

275
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,320
You can use this to explain it to your friends.

276
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,870
After that, you can send the letter yourself.

277
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,790
Darling,

278
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,060
if you do this,

279
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,580
what should we say to Chuanzhong?

280
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,950
If the letter is sent, the engagement will really be cancelled.

281
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,790
We haven't met Chuanzhong for so long.

282
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,460
Now we suddenly want to cancel the engagement.

283
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,720
Don't you think it's... inappropriate?

284
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,190
Darling,

285
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,380
do you still remember Ling's marriage?

286
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,000
That was the empress dowager's order.

287
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,500
What could we do?

288
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,470
Due to the empress dowager's order,

289
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,460
Ling got married and went to the capital.

290
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,150
It's been so many years.

291
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,120
All these years, as parents,

292
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,990
we just want our children to be happy and safe.

293
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,860
But have we ever understood

294
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,800
Rongniang's thoughts?

295
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,540
That's right.

296
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,760
We feel guilty towards Ling.

297
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,410
Her marriage was decided by the empress dowager. There was nothing we could do to change it.

298
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,850
But Yueniang's marriage was decided by us.

299
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,460
We can't leave regrets on ourselves again.

300
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,840
Yueniang's happiness

301
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,480
is more important than my friendship with Chuanzhong.

302
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,890
I'd rather he blames me.

303
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,580
But I believe Chuanzhong will understand me.

304
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,590
We're old friends.

305
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,430
But I'm also Yueniang's father.

306
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,020
Darling,

307
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,260
Chuanzhong is also a father.

308
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,910
I believe he will understand.

309
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,700
He will.

310
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,340
Song Zhu.

311
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,240
Where did you go? Where did you go?

312
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,570
Where did you go?

313
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,330
What?

314
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,820
Do you miss me?

315
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,180
Who misses you?

316
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,440
Shameless.

317
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,200
You don't miss me?

318
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,540
Then I'll disappear if you don't miss me.

319
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,200
Okay. Just disappear.

320
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,980
Junior Zhou.

321
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,330
Did you hear that?

322
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,090
Xiao Yu said he will disappear.

323
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,880
You believe me now, right?

324
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,560
That's good.

325
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,270
Yueniang, let's go.

326
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,540
Let's go.

00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,760
His Highness said you can't leave the room.

343
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,750
Okay.

[Zhou Mansion]

345
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,070
Be careful.

346
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,320
Is it okay?

347
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,680
Young Master.

348
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,040
Why did Young Master come back?

349
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,780
Why didn't Young Master tell us in advance that he would come back?

350
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:10,950
Brother,

351
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,400
Mother is seriously ill.

352
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,190
But they still have the mood to celebrate here.

353
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,030
That means Mother's illness is not that serious.

354
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,880
But Uncle Mao said in the letter

355
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,230
Mother is seriously ill.

356
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,860
Don't worry. I'm here.

357
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,660
Everything will be fine.

358
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,780
Let's go see our mother now.

Mother.

362
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,430
Mother, don't leave me.

363
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,540
Mother.

364
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,310
You can't leave me and my brother behind.

365
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,990
Mother, you can't leave me and my brother behind.

366
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,380
No wonder Teaching Assistant Xiao hasn't come these days.

367
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,210
It turns out that such a serious thing happened.

368
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,540
Lady Yan, why aren't you eating?

369
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,700
I have no appetite.

370
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,570
The food is cold. I'm going to replace it with a hot serving.

371
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,300
No need.

372
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,170
I'll still have no appetite even if you replace it.

373
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,450
Lady Yan,

374
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,760
it's already happened.

375
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,740
I don't think Zhu did it on purpose.

376
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,060
Why don't you forgive her first?

377
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,930
Why are you all looking at me?

378
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,840
I'm the one who likes Mr. Xiao.

379
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,020
I'm also the one who had been deceived since the beginning.

380
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,040
I'm the victim.

381
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,520
It was Miss Song Zhu who did something wrong.

382
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,760
Why should I forgive her?

383
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,190
I won't forgive her.

384
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,350
I won't forgive her for the rest of my life.

385
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,980
Stop looking.

386
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,910
Let her be.

387
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,610
I know the root cause of this matter is not with you.

388
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,800
Leave the rest to time.

389
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,550
Alright, stop crying.

390
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,320
You haven't gone to class in Women's Academy for a few days.

391
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,670
Sister,

392
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,080
do you think is there...

393
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,710
is there anything I can do?

394
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,620
I'll help you choose a gift tomorrow.

395
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,280
Talk to her and make it clear some other day.

396
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,630
There are too many people here today.

397
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,480
Right.

398
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,750
Teaching Assistant Xiao has resigned.

399
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,190
Do you know why?

400
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,060
He has resigned?

401
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,750
Looks like I asked the wrong person.

402
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,300
I just told him not to follow me.

403
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,150
I didn't expect him to resign directly.

404
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,670
You drove him away?

405
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,220
I didn't.

406
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,320
Are you going to men's dorm again?

407
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,870
Mother, don't leave me.

408
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,780
Young Master Ji,

409
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,350
It's Master's order.

410
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,790
We... have to obey his order.

411
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,720
I understand.

412
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,600
Did Mother... have any last words?

413
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,720
When we arrived,

414
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,290
Madam Li had already died.

415
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,010
A doctor came this morning.

416
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,580
He said no one answered the door in the side yard.

417
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,760
That was when they found...

418
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,550
Mother.

419
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,550
Uncle Mao,

420
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,350
take care of her for me.

421
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,470
Brother.

422
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,720
Brother, where are you going?

423
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,160
I can't let Mother die like this.

424
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,920
But we have no money now.

425
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,990
I'll figure out a way.

426
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,110
Y-Young Master Ji.

427
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,740
Madam Li gave this bracelet

428
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,440
to me earlier.

429
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,010
She asked me to give this bracelet to you

430
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,250
when you two need money in the future.

431
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,160
At first, I didn't know what she meant.

432
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,640
Now that I think about it,

433
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,710
maybe Madam Li knew

434
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,510
she didn't have much time left long ago.

435
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,180
This is the bracelet my father gave her.

436
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,670
My son is studying in the Imperial College.

437
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,030
Please take care of him in the future.

438
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,270
Master Zhou, no problem.

439
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,230
Mr. Zhou Ting is handsome.

440
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,760
I'm flattered.

441
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,760
Please take care of me in the future.

442
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,600
Sure.

443
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,680
Have a few more drinks tonight.

444
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,750
Okay.

445
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,970
I will.

446
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,580
Please come in.

447
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,270
Okay.

448
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,830
Well. It's an honor

449
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,200
to have you here.

450
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,330
Good morning, Senior Song.

451
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,030
Junior Ding,

452
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,290
let me ask you something.

453
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,670
Do you know why Xiao Yu resigned?

454
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
I don't know.

455
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,180
Aren't you in Women's Academy?

456
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,710
How would I know if you don't know?

457
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,590
Aren't you two close?

458
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,080
He didn't tell me, and I felt embarrassed to ask him.

459
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,620
And it seems he hasn't come back for a few days.

460
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,190
What about Zhou Ji?

461
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,620
It seems something happened to his family.

462
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,520
He asked for a leave and left.

463
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,760
Something happened to his family?

464
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,710
I think... so.

465
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,880
And... he left in a hurry with his sister.

466
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,040
If there is nothing else,

467
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,350
I... I'm leaving.

468
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,350
Thank you.

469
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,650
Why did they all leave suddenly?

470
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,430
Brother,

471
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,600
now you are my only family

472
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,410
in this world.

473
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,250
Young Master Ji,

474
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,250
let's seal the coffin with nails.

475
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,230
Mother.

476
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:30,969
Mother,

477
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,360
I'm unfilial.

478
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,360
I haven't let you enjoy an easy or carefree life.

479
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,710
Sachets for sale.

480
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,140
Miss, look at my sachets.

481
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,450
Let me take a look at this.

482
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,490
The sachets are in all kinds of colors.

483
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,860
Ladies, please have a look.

484
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,560
This just arrived yesterday.

485
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,150
Look.

486
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,160
Is it pretty?

487
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,710
Yes.

488
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,100
We're here to buy something for Lady Yan.

489
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,140
Why are you absent-minded?

490
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,630
Boss.

491
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,610
Get out of the way!

492
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,300
Get out of the way!

Stop eating. Get out of the way!

494
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,160
What are you looking at? Get out of the way!

495
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,210
I'm talking to you.

496
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,010
Lord Zhao.

497
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,030
Isn't this... Mr. Liu?

498
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,020
I didn't see you just now.

499
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,200
I was wrong.

500
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,360
What?

501
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,990
You have money to do business.

502
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,790
But you have no money to pay taxes?

503
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,030
My Lord, please give me a few more days.

504
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,330
I will give the money to you.

505
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,960
How can he be so arrogant in broad daylight?

506
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,070
Don't be nosy.

507
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,470
Ladies, who are you?

508
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,040
Come here.

509
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,770
I'm a daughter of Song Xu, the dean of Yiyang Academy.

510
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,400
We are his daughters.

511
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,830
Who?

512
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,050
Song Xu.

513
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,220
That nerd.

514
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,910
I'm so scared.

515
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,640
Now it's my turn to ask you.

516
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,190
Do you know who I am?

517
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,960
What does it have to do with us?

518
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,860
Aren't you a local ruffian?

519
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,790
Who else could you be?

520
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,440
Speaking of my name,

521
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:17,750
I'm afraid even Li Shancai, the county magistrate of Yiyang County,

522
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,010
needs to show me some respect.

523
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:21,900
Really?

524
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,940
Miss,

525
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,440
are you scared?

526
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,950

After them!

531
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,230
Okay, let's go. After them!

532
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,470
Get out of the way!

533
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,750

-Stop!

[Yiyang County Government]

550
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,230
I'd like to see if Li Shancai, the county magistrate of Yiyang,

551
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,930
cares about the civilians here.

I've always been impartial.

00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,270
Lord Li,

566
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,000
it took you so long.

567
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,790
And you only caught two scapegoats?

568
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,160
Well, this...

569
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,750
I serve the people wholeheartedly.

570
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,550
I've done my best and carried out my duties.

571
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,470
I think you did your best to delay the opening of the court trial,

572
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,660
so that you could inform those people.

573
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,280
Well...

574
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,390
What do you mean?

575
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,340
Don't you know what I mean?

576
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,560
Those people were very arrogant.

577
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,210
They said even the government couldn't do anything to them.

578
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,870
How could they?

579
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,980
It must be a rumor.

580
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:02,990
Whether it's a rumor

581
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,250
or the truth,

582
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,470
everything will be clear

583
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,760
when the prime culprit is arrested.

584
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:07,800
Okay.

585
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,220
Don't worry.

586
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,040
Don't worry, everyone.

587
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,620
I'm here.

588
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,520
No matter what backgrounds the criminals have,

589
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,390
I will bring them to justice.

590
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,590
Bring them to justice.

591
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,330
Guards,

592
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,450
break their... legs.

593
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,840
Let's see if they dare to harass civilians again.

594
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,090
My Lord, didn't you just say...

595
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,480
My Lord, please don't.

596
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,060
My Lord! My Lord!
