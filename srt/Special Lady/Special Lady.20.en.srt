[Special Lady]

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,680
[Episode 20]

4
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,190
Is Zhou Ji that good?

5
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,030
I...

6
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,250
It's none of your business.

7
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,680
I just don't want this marriage.

8
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,910
Besides, no matter how bad he is,

9
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,930
he is better than you.

10
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,670
Fine.

11
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,470
Since he's so good,

12
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,830
I'll leave.

13
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,660
Liar. You promised me.

14
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,310
Yueniang.

15
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,310
Mother.

16
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,310
You went to see Mr. Xiao off?

17
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,610
I didn't send him off.

18
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,490
Yueniang.

19
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,820
Although you're not young anymore,

20
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,430
to me and you father,

21
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,750
you are always a child.

22
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,020
So,

23
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,470
if there's anything,

24
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,150
just tell us.

25
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,550
Don't keep it to yourself.

26
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,829
Mother.

27
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,050
What do you mean?

28
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,710
I can tell

29
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,740
you don't want to marry Mr. Xiao.

30
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,240
Of course, I do.

31
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,390
I do.

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,520
I do.

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,060
Yueniang.

34
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,470
If you have something to tell,

35
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,450
you can tell us directly.

36
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,820
You don't need to let others pass the message.

37
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,590
We are a family.

38
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,990
We can talk about anything.

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,450
What do you mean by "others"?

40
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,730
Who else could it be other than Mr. Xiao?

41
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,530
Xiao Yu?

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,120
Did he tell you?

43
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,600
You two

44
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,740
put on a drama so seriously today.

45
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,829
Didn't you want to tell us

46
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,310
you don't want to get married?

47
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,270
Oh no.

48
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,010
I wronged him.

49
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,380
Your father and I won't blame you.

50
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,660
And your father agreed to suspend the engagement.

51
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,790
If you fall in love with each other in the future,

52
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,880
we can discuss it again.

53
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,020
How could we fall in love with each other?

54
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,810
Who can predict the future?

55
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,270
I'm very certain about this matter.

56
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,630
All right.

57
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,950
It's getting late.

58
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,390
Go back and rest.

59
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,510
Mother.

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,540
All right.

61
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,100
Mother, rest early.

62
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,370
The engagement has finally been broken off.

63
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,120
Great!

64
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,250
I finally broke off the engagement.

65
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,970
I finally broke off the engagement.

66
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,200
But I wronged him.

67
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,400
What should I do?

68
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,830
No.

69
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,740
He lied to me.

70
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,630
He deserves it.

71
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,430
Mr. Zhou.

72
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,150
Mr. Xiao.

73
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,110
I'm back.

74
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,630
By the way,

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,230
Mr Zhou,

76
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,080
has your sister settled down?

77
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,700
Yes.

78
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,610
Thank you for asking, Mr. Xiao.

79
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,150
That's great.

80
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,240
You can see your sister every day in the future.

81
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,630
I envy people who have siblings.

82
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,170
Your family must be lively.

83
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:38,990
By the way,

84
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,080
how many siblings do you have?

85
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,310
I also have...

86
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,790
An elder brother.

87
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,400
I shouldn't have asked.

88
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,390
It's fine.

89
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,409
My brother was First Madam's child.

90
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,050
Zhou Fei and I share the same mother.

91
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,100
Mr. Xiao. Why are you back so late today?

92
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,150
We had a relative over at home

93
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,290
and had dinner together.

94
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,120
Did you memorize the passage starting with "The Master was diligent in teaching..."?

95
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,110
Yes, I did.

96
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:36,960
Look.

97
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,950
I haven't finished embroidering the handkerchief last night.

98
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,720
Who is this?

99
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,430
I don't know.

100
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,030
Who is this?

101
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,670
Really?

102
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,470
Come here.

103
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,190
That was so pretty.

104
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,110
Yes, I think so too.

105
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,440
Look, this is Zhou Ji’s younger sister.

106
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,230
Really?

107
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,150
Yes, she is.

108
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,430
Is the Women's Academy recruiting new students?

109
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:52,870
Yes.

110
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,550
Are you transferring to our academy?

111
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,680
What's your name?

112
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,750
-You can...
-Lady Qi.

113
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,830
Don't scare her.

114
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,110
You must be Junior Zhou's sister.

115
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,090
Don’t be afraid. What’s your name?

116
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,360
My name is Zhou Fei.

117
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,460
I didn’t hear you clearly.

118
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,740
Zhou what?

119
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,990
What Fei?

120
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,170
Her name is Zhou Fei.

121
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,490
Yes, Zhou Fei.

122
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,270
Feiniang.

123
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,750
Miss Yan.

124
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,950
What are you doing?

125
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,950
Are you bullying Feiniang?

126
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,720
Lady Yan, you misunderstood.

127
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,910
It's the first time we've seen Feiniang.

128
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,860
We're curious.

129
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,390
I asked her which family she was from.

130
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,070
Feiniang is Zhou Ji's sister.

131
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,030
-What's happening?
-She'll be our classmate from now on.

132
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,830
A newcomer?

133
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,190
My name is Qi Xi.

134
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,790
If you need any help,

135
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,830
just let me know.

136
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,520
Yes.

137
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,460
We will take good care of you for Mr. Zhou.

138
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,250
That's right.

139
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,430
That's right.

140
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,590
All right.

141
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,830
If you keep talking,

142
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,030
Feiniang will be shy.

143
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,830
Lady Zhou.

144
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,740
Follow me.

145
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,550
Don't worry.

146
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,350
They are not bad people.

147
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,170
Just study hard.

148
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,790
If anyone bullies you,

149
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,990
just tell me. I'm Jin Xiaoyue.

150
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,630
Sit here.

151
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,010
It's close to me.

152
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,750
Come on.

153
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,600
Thank you, Miss Jin.

154
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,750
Great.

155
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,790
Give it to me.

156
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,830
Thank you.

157
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:17,790
Come on.

158
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,110
Suspect not things, but be straightforward without arrogance.

159
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,190
When sitting, be as if in meditation. when standing, be dignified.

160
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,510
Let rituals follow appropriateness, customs follow utility.

161
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,510
Do not overdo rituals,

162
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,750
do not intrude or offend, and do not indulge in frivolity.

163
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,030
Suspect not things, but be straightforward without arrogance.

164
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,830
When sitting, be as if in meditation...

165
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,100
Looks like he's really angry.

166
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,660
Let rituals follow appropriateness, customs follow utility.

167
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,830
Do not overdo rituals,

168
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,120
do not intrude or offend, and do not indulge in frivolity.

169
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,510
Okay, that's all for today.

170
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,870
Go back and memorize this article.

171
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,270
I will test you

172
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,950
during class tomorrow.

173
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,930
Yes.

174
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,190
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

175
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,310
About what happened last night...

176
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,670
What happened last night?

177
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,840
You're not done yet?

178
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,500
Well, I...

179
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,510
Qinruo.

180
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,390
Yueniang.

181
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,440
Is there anything between you and Mr. Xiao?

182
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:37,950
Nothing.

183
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,820
Mr. Xiao acted strangely.

184
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,980
What's the matter?

185
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,600
Yueniang, come here.

186
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,140
Mr. Xiao has returned to the academy.

187
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,640
So I thought

188
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,590
to buy him a gift.

189
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,870
First,

190
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,750
to celebrate his return to the academy.

191
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,470
Second, I want to use it to express my feelings.

192
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,190
What do you think?

193
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
Why don't you just express your feelings?

194
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,750
That won't do.

195
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,710
I'm the daughter of Duke Yue.

196
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,510
It's not appropriate for me

197
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,670
to confess my feelings to someone.

198
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,050
Didn't you say that

199
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,090
Mr. Xiao is so dignified?

200
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,510
If I say it out loud,

201
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,070
it would be an affront to his dignity.

202
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:18,930
That makes sense.

203
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,470
Yueniang, go with me.

204
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,740
You and Mr. Xiao are friends.

205
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,470
You know him well.

206
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,950
I don't know him well.

207
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,000
You can decide your own business.

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,190
Yueniang,

209
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,230
you must know Mr. Xiao better than I do.

210
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,150
Go with me.

211
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,270
I don't know him...

212
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,870
You know him well.

213
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,190
I don't.

214
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,910
How could I know him well?

215
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,000
You know him best.

216
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,230
Ladies. What do you need?

217
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,230
Boss.

218
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,110
Do you have any beautiful handkerchiefs

219
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,720
or pouch?

220
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,750
Take a look here.

221
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,390
This way.

222
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,950
Boss.

223
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,510
Coming.

224
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,310
Yueniang.

225
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,710
Do you think it's beautiful?

226
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,550
Mandarin ducks?

227
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,590
Isn't this too straightforward?

228
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,400
I'm afraid if I don't be straightforward,

229
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,230
Mr. Xiao may not know what I mean.

230
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,270
Actually,

231
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,560
I hinted at him many times.

232
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,030
But he didn't seem to understand.

233
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,350
So I want to be straightforward this time.

234
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
Then you decide.

235
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,510
I wronged Xiao Yu last night.

236
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,150
Giving him a gift

237
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,670
would also be a way to show my sincerity, wouldn't it?

238
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,890
This wolf-hair brush is quite delicate.

239
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,430
It is.

240
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:50,970
Right?

241
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,860
Yueniang.

242
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,560
Do you want to send it to Junior Zhou?

243
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,130
Zhou...

244
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,830
What?

245
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,070
It’s not for Junior Zhou?

246
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,160
It is.

247
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,220
How about this, Yueniang?

248
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,670
You send this one

249
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,710
and I'll send this one.

250
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,380
Let's send them together, okay?

251
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,190
Boss.

252
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,030
Coming.

253
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,850
Help me pack these two.

254
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,670
I want this.

255
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,950
How about

256
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,710
a rosewood box?

257
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,670
It matches your handkerchief.

258
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,070
Then I'll take the rosewood box.

259
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,790
Okay.

260
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,060
This lady.

261
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,460
What box do you want for your wolf-hair brush?

262
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,630
I want a red lacquered wooden box.

263
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,590
Okay.

264
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,300
Which one is supposed to be placed in the rosewood box?

265
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,870
The wolf-hair brush should be for the scholar.

266
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,340
It should be placed in the rosewood box.

267
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,160
[Duobao Hall]

268
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,820
Take care, Ladies.

269
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,390
Come again.

270
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,150
Yueniang.

271
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,830
Tell me. When Mr. Xiao

272
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,110
sees the Mandarin ducks on the handkerchief,

273
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,800
would he know how I feel?

274
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,310
If he still doesn't understand,

275
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,510
he must be a nerd.

276
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,830
Then I'm relieved.

277
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,840
Yueniang.

278
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,550
How should I give it to him?

279
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,430
Of course, you should give it to him face-to-face.

280
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,880
Can you go with me later?

281
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,950
In this way,

282
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,750
you can also give your gift to Junior Zhou.

283
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,510
Well...

284
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,100
I don't think it's a good idea.

285
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,520
How can you get a lot of people to be present?

286
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,000
Ask him out yourself.

287
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,310
I'll ask Junior Zhou out myself.

288
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,510
Let's send the gifts to them separately.

289
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,500
Yueniang.

290
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,770
Why are you more shy than me now?

291
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,630
You're not usually like this.

292
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,630
How can it be as usual?

293
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,310
After all,

294
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,040
this isn't about creating a scene.

295
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,830
That's true.

296
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,510
Then once I go back,

297
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,430
I'll go ask Teaching Assistant Xiao out.

298
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,630
Let's hurry up and go back.

299
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,230
Okay.

300
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,630
Is anyone here?

301
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,060
No one is here.

302
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,150
Since Qinruo asked him out,

303
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,080
I won't feel awkward.

304
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,460
Why am I so smart?

305
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,310
Xiao Yu. This will be considered my apology to you.

306
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,470
Don't be angry anymore.

307
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,270
Miss...

308
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,410
Miss Zhu?

309
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,240
It's none of my business.

310
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,540
[I'm sorry about last night. A gift for you to apologize. From Song Zhu]

311
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,560
Mr. Xiao, you're back.

312
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,680
I just came back.

313
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:45,950
Mr. Xiao.

314
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:46,920
-You’re back.
-Mr. Zhou.

315
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,000
They are...

316
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,870
Mandarin ducks?

317
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,670
Mr. Zhou.

318
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,940
Was anyone here?

319
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,190
No.

320
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,760
I just came back.

321
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,860
I see.

322
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,120
What's the matter, Mr. Xiao?

323
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,390
Nothing. I'm just asking.

324
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,240
I'll go ask Ding Miao.

325
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,069
Mr. Ding.

326
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,170
Mr. Xiao.

327
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,270
Do you know

328
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,109
that pet is forbidden in our academy?

329
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,230
Mr. Xiao.

330
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,099
Both you and I will keep the secret.

331
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,569
Who else will ever know?

332
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:20,990
Then I...

333
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,869
That makes sense.

334
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,940
What's up?

335
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,430
Yes.

336
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,490
I need to talk to you.

337
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,150
Mr. Ding.

338
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,710
Do you understand

339
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,640
a girl's thoughts?

340
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,430
A little.

341
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,170
What if

342
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,620
a girl gives you a handkerchief with Mandarin duck embroidery, what does it mean?

343
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,310
Mandarin ducks?

344
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,550
Mandarin ducks?

345
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,440
I have Mandarin ducks in my house.

346
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,760
Do you want to keep them?

347
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,300
We'll talk about that later.

348
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,270
Later.

349
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,040
Keep your voice down.

350
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,310
Look at you.

351
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,840
So you received a handkerchief

352
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,550
embroidered with Mandarin ducks from a girl?

353
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,510
Not me.

354
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,110
It doesn't matter who it is.

355
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
What does it mean?

356
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,020
Either she wants to pair up with you

357
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,950
or when she bought it,

358
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,290
she didn't know they were Mandarin ducks.

359
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,310
Right.

360
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,880
With her intelligence,

361
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,570
she would think they're ducks.

362
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,350
Mr. Xiao,

363
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,650
who gave you the handkerchief?

364
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,670
How about I do some divination for you?

365
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,800
No need.

366
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,540
Mr. Xiao, you are so bad.

367
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,910
You didn't even tell me who it was.

368
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,660
Forget it. I'm leaving.

369
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,290
Mr. Xiao, don't you talk about Mandarin ducks?

370
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,170
No.

371
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,350
We'll talk about it later.

372
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,740
Don't tell anyone.

373
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,080
Does she really not know that they are Mandarin ducks?

374
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,590
It's good if she doesn't know.

375
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,430
What if she wasn't being unintentional?

376
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,790
How could it be?

377
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,250
She can’t like me.

378
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,630
She likes Zhou Ji.

379
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,350
Mr. Xiao.

380
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,640
Are you going to sleep?

381
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,870
If you are, I'll turn off the lights.

382
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,490
Yes, I am.

383
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,780
Son.

384
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
Play crickets with me.

385
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,500
Come on.

386
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,260
Well, you...

387
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,710
You father is here.

388
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,860
Why are you so quiet when I'm talking to you?

389
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,010
It's your favorite. It smells good.

390
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,030
Look.

391
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:22,910
You...

392
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,730
Play a few rounds with me.

393
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,420
Ten taels for one round.

394
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,150
You can have the money if you win.

395
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,710
If you lose,

396
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,230
you...

397
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,020
eat this.

398
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,060
I don't want to play.

399
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,270
I feel annoyed.

400
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,030
You're annoyed?

401
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,870
Well.

402
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,350
What's bothering you?

403
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,650
Tell me.

404
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,950
Don't you know

405
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,190
what's bothering me?

406
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,660
Didn't you see how Xiao Yu stole my thunder?

407
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,290
He's just a villain. Don't care about him.

408
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,550
How good can he be?

409
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,750
He's just a teaching assistant.

410
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,940
Even though, he's better than me.

411
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,710
Father.

412
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,460
Am I a loser?

413
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,500
What are you talking about?

414
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,550
Of course not.

415
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,230
You will

416
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,210
become a high official when you grow up.

417
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,440
He's a villain, yet he's better than me.

418
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,630
How can I be a high official?

419
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,950
I'm doomed.

420
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,990
I'm doomed.

421
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,410
Well.

422
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,390
I need to teach that guy a lesson.

423
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,700
I'm doomed.

424
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,970
Waiter.

425
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,840
Coming.

426
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,550
Mr. Xiao.

427
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,220
Are you here to see Yueniang?

428
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,150
No.

429
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,410
Please tell her

430
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,670
I have something to say.

431
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,740
I'll wait for her at the riverbank.

432
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,230
Okay.

433
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,640
I'll go tell her now.

434
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,350
Thank you.

435
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,390
Let's go.

436
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,730
Zhu.

437
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,730
Do you know there are many types of birds?

438
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,610
Zhu.

439
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,260
You must have bought the wrong gift.

440
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,150
Zhu.

441
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,070
If you have no feelings for me,

442
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,910
why did you buy me such a gift...

443
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,620
Why are you here?

444
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,710
Lower down.

445
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,770
Zhu.

446
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,150
I saw some people

447
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,950
watching you sneakily.

448
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,160
No.

449
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,730
Don't look back.

450
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,300
They are still watching you.

451
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,190
Let's go.

452
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:06,970
Let's go.

453
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,980
Let's go.

454
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,070
Let's go.

455
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,110
Master, they've changed direction.

456
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,030
Should we follow them?

457
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,190
Go after them! Go!

458
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,000
Hurry up!

459
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,960
Stop walking! Run!

460
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,350
Raise the sedan chair.

461
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,110
Who will carry me?

462
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,590
Brother.

463
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,310
Brother.

464
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,670
You may not know

465
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,390
that all the sisters in the academy are nice to me.

466
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,110
Especially Miss Yan.

467
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,440
She protected me on the day of admission.

468
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,350
Brother.

469
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,510
It would be great

470
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,740
if someone as beautiful and kind as Miss Yan

471
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,090
could become my sister-in-law.

472
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,990
Feiniang.

473
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,190
Don't talk nonsense.

474
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,160
Lady Yan is the only daughter of Duke Yue.

475
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,300
Her status is unique and noble.

476
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,270
Mother

477
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,070
didn't ask you to go to the academy

478
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,870
to think about these things.

479
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,820
You should learn from Mr. Chen and study hard.

480
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,040
Got it.

481
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,620
Who is your favorite

482
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,070
among the girls at the Women's Academy?

483
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,470
I don't favor anyone.

484
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,960
Hurry up.

485
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,230
Miss Song Zhu.

486
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,950
Brother.

487
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,670
Was that Miss Song Zhu?

488
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,070
Miss Zhu.

489
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,870
Mr. Xiao.

490
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,630
It was really Miss Song and Teaching Assistant Xiao.

491
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,110
But why were they so anxious

492
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,830
and holding hands?

493
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,750
They didn't avoid it.

494
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,110
Go after them!

495
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,480
Hey, man!

496
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,510
You bumped into her.

497
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,190
So annoying.

498
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:06,710
Go away.

499
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,490
You...

500
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,290
Brother.

501
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,720
Calm down.

502
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,910
They are so fierce.

503
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,920
Feiniang, wait for me here.

504
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,830
I’ll be back soon.

505
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,700
Be careful. Brother.

506
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,990
Who asked you to come?

507
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,700
It's him.

508
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,270
He's Mr. Xiao's servant.

509
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,060
Why did he suddenly appear here?

510
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,400
He has such great martial arts.

511
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,270
Despite having such martial skills, he's willing to be a household servant.

512
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,320
This is unusual.

513
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,520
Is Mr. Xiao hiding something?

514
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,990
-Let go.
-Let go.

515
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,710
-Let go.
-Let go.

516
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,120
-Let go.
-Let go.

517
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,630
You let go first.

518
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,270
You're holding me.

519
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,310
How can I let go?

520
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,760
Don't use so much strength.

521
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,220
You...

522
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,110
See, you're still using your strength.

523
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,120
Why did those people chase you?

524
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,470
Did you get into trouble?

525
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,190
Chasing me? Didn't they chase you?

526
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,590
What did you do this time?

527
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,240
They were obviously chasing you.

528
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,950
I don't know them.

529
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,730
Maybe we both made a mistake.

530
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,830
We misunderstood.

531
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,530
They were not after us at all.

532
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,430
A new notice.

533
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,560
Take a look.

534
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,830
Take a look.

535
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,180
This...

536
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,750
With immediate effect,

537
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,920
stallholders within Yiyang county

538
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,030
face a twofold increase in taxes.

539
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,910
What?

540
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,710
How are we going to live?

541
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,320
The officials are so greedy

542
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,900
and disregard the people.

543
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,830
I have to argue with them.

544
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:19,680
What're you doing?

545
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,510
What are you doing?

546
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,190
Don't go.

547
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,710
Let's leave here.

548
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,470
I want to argue with them.

549
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,830
That's too much!

550
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,710
-Don’t make trouble. Let's leave.
-They’ve gone too far!

551
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,430
Brother!

552
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,650
Did you catch up with them?

553
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,070
Brother.

554
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,130
Don't worry.

555
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,990
We'll know when we go back and ask them.

556
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,790
Feiniang.

557
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,270
Don't tell anyone in the academy about this.

558
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,470
Are you talking about them holding hands

559
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,190
or being chased?

560
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,000
Both.

561
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,430
Brother.

562
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,930
I think you treat Miss Song differently.

563
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,430
Don't think too much.

564
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,240
Both of them are my friends.

565
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,630
I just don't want any rumors circulating about them.

566
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,870
But I also think

567
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,150
the relationship between Teaching Assistant Xiao and Miss Song is a bit special.

568
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,470
You little smart girl.

569
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,910
Everything you see is special.

570
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,350
Brother.

571
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,830
I've been in Yiyang for so long.

572
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,270
I haven't taken a good look.

573
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,670
How about you accompany me for a stroll today?

574
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,230
Okay, let's go for a good stroll.

575
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:38,960
Okay.

576
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,470
I didn't know

577
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,910
when you became so timid.

578
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,790
Coward.

579
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,230
I'm not timid.

580
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,650
It's just that this isn't how you should solve it.

581
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,630
Then tell me how to solve it.

582
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,600
You're not an official.

583
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,080
Let alone you,

584
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,430
even Dean Song was there,

585
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,630
it wouldn't be helpful.

586
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,820
If you rashly confront people like that,

587
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,920
what else will it bring besides trouble?

588
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,230
You said everything.

589
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:16,950
Then tell me

590
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,200
why you asked me out.

591
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,830
Tell me.

592
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:21,560
Can't I

593
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,670
just hang out with you without any particular reason?

594
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,750
Are you kidding me?

595
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,000
If there's nothing else, let's each go home.

596
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,590
Wait, wait.

597
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,700
That day, you gave me the...

598
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,140
Can't you just...

599
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,150
I don't even have money to save our child.

600
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,830
Let's just die.

601
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,950
Calm down.

602
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,730
You can’t kill yourself.

603
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,430
Calm down.

604
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,750
I wanted to sell these gourds in the city

605
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,350
in exchange for money to treat my child.

606
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,300
But I ran into those tax collectors.

607
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,810
I didn't have money.

608
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,870
It was useless no matter what I said.

609
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,510
They even ruined my gourds.

610
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,030
Calm down.

611
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,950
Calm down.

612
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:09,950
How about this?

613
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,710
I'll buy all your gourds, okay?

614
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,230
Here.

615
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,470
Take the child to see a doctor.

616
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,730
Thank you. Miss.

617
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,280
Ma'am.

618
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:18,740
Ma'am.

619
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,310
You're older than me. You can't kneel to me.

620
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,350
Hurry and take the money

621
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,440
to see a doctor.

622
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,350
Go see a doctor.

623
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,350
Hurry up.

624
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,590
Thank you, Young Master.

625
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,710
Don't try to kill yourself again.

626
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,550
Thank you, Miss.

627
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,170
Go now.

628
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,120
Don't cry.

629
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,990
We have money for treatment.

630
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,980
Damn the government!

631
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,510
Zhu.

632
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,160
What are you going to do with all these gourds?

633
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,510
I'll think about it.

634
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,070
There will be a solution.

635
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,780
There is always a way out.

636
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,030
Be careful.

637
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,690
Wait for me.

638
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,960
I'm exhausted.

639
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,790
You bought so many gourds at once.

640
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,880
I have to carry them back for you.

641
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,270
You did a good deed,

642
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,650
yet I'm the one left to do the work.

643
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,750
You can't do physical work.

644
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,910
And you don't study hard.

645
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,580
Slow down, mind my gourds.

646
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,880
Xiao, slow down!

647
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,670
Our Xiao family is big.

648
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,680
There's no such work in my family.

649
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,710
I don't need to do this either.

650
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,750
Thank you

651
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,150
for being considerate of us common people.

652
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,710
You're sweating. Let me wipe it for you.

653
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,110
No.

654
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,510
Stay away from me.

655
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,830
You...

656
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:27,750
Stop!

657
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,590
Slow down!

658
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,630
Stop!

659
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,150
Wait.

660
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,230
Put it down.

661
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,370
Have you figured it out?

662
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,500
Yes.

663
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,160
That's why you need to do some work for me.

664
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,680
You want me to do more work for you?

665
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,310
You're a man.

666
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,470
Why do you keep

667
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,510
picking on me, a frail girl, all the time?

668
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,310
Find your own way back if you can.

669
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,630
Fine.

670
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,990
Vegetables.

671
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,450
Sir, may I borrow your bench?

672
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:06,950
Okay.

673
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,840
Do you remember the way back?

674
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:14,820
Oh no.

675
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,950
I got lost again.

676
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,840
By the way,

677
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,240
you still have money on you, right?

678
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,110
Go buy some paint.

679
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,230
Let's work on the gourds.

680
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,790
Otherwise,

681
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,290
I'll leave you alone.

682
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,460
Ridiculous.

683
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,970
Do I look like someone who can't find the way back?

684
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,100
Young Master. What else do you need?

685
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:43,730
Nothing.

686
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,600
That's all.

687
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:45,650
Okay.

688
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,110
Take them.

689
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,660
Fresh gourds.

690
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,470
Come and take a look.

691
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,580
Take a look.

692
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,440
You...

693
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,080
You should be in charge of calling out the sales.

694
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,590
I...

695
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:22,429
What did you ask me to do?

696
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,710
Call out the sales.

697
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,630
I won't.

698
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,610
Do it yourself if you want.

699
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,870
You were so obedient just now.

700
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,190
I wanted to give you 30% of the profit.

701
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,030
Even though, I won't do it.

702
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,960
You're useless being here.

703
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,630
Leave.

704
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,130
Who said I'm useless?

705
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,110
I can help you pass something.

706
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,870
Stand still.

707
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,720
Raise your right hand.

708
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,040
Higher.

709
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,630
Higher.

710
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,290
Raise this hand, too.

711
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,390
Towards that way.

712
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,670
Smile.

713
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,270
Hold it up.

714
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,480
What are you doing?

715
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,440
Turn your face.

716
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,630
Smile.

717
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,730
Gourds!

718
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,710
What are you doing?

719
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,590
I'm selling the gourds.

720
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,510
Selling gourds?

721
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,490
Look.

722
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,630
They saw it.

723
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,620
Who saw it?

724
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,290
Look, he saw it.

725
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,800
Look.

726
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,470
Didn't you see it?

727
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,950
Why are you here?

728
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,430
Mother, I want this.

729
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,950
I just bought you candied haws.

730
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,610
Let's go.

731
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,610
Look.

732
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,220
They saw it.

733
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:19,920
50%.

734
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,240
Go now.

735
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,390
If you keep talking, I won't share any profit with you.

736
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:23,760
Go.

737
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,550
Gourds.

738
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,770
Gourds.

739
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,470
Gourds.

740
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,310
40%.

741
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,280
Gourds!

742
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,470
Don't miss it.

743
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,990
Both adults and children like them.

744
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,980
Little items made of gourds.

745
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,040
Come and have a look.

746
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,230
There are all shapes of them.

747
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,150
The price is negotiable.

748
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,030
Don't miss it.

749
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,290
Take a look at our gourds.

750
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,800
Do you want a gourd?

751
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:13,900
Take a look.

752
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,920
Is she peeping at me?

753
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,800
What...

754
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,910
Are you drawing?

755
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,720
Look.

756
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,240
How lively is the little figure I've drawn!

757
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,620
It will sell at a good price later.

758
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,710
Who did you draw? It's so ugly.

759
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,300
Doesn't it look like you?

760
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,950
I think it looks like you very much.

761
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,830
So pretty.

762
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,470
Are you drawing the handsome me?

763
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,430
Yes.

764
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,070
It's the handsome you.

765
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,550
Look.

766
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,170
He looks like you so much.

767
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,460
Hode it tightly.

768
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,670
Don't ruin it.

769
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,940
Are you done?

770
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,870
Put it back if you're done.

771
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,470
I'm selling it.

772
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,990
No.

773
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,640
It's too ugly to sell.

774
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:22,760
I...

775
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,670
I drew a chubby little figure.

776
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,750
It's so cute.

777
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,750
I want to sell it.

778
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,510
Gourds!

779
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,190
No.

780
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,230
It's too ugly.

781
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,440
It'll be a laughing stock.

782
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,190
How cute.

783
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:32,870
I must sell it.

784
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,630
No.

785
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,390
-Give it to me.
-No.

786
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,020
Give it to me.

787
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,750
No, no.

788
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,870
I must sell it.

789
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,950
-I said no.
-Just give it to me.

790
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:38,670
This is not for sale.

791
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,190
Fine.

792
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,590
You don't have to sell it.

793
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,510
I tried so hard to draw this.

794
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,420
I will give it to you as a reward.

795
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,300
It's included in the 40% profit.

796
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:55,650
By the way.

797
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,790
Take it back to the dorm and take care of it.

798
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,550
Don’t break it, okay?

799
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,250
I've lost my cash and I've got to keep it for you.

800
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,310
If it weren't for the fear of losing face over these items,

801
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,590
I wouldn't keep them for you.

802
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,210
Well.

803
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,990
Your drawing skill is so bad.

804
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,070
Why don't you stop drawing?

805
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,110
No one will buy it anyway.

806
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,510
Do it if you can.

807
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,670
I can draw better than you.

808
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,530
Go ahead.

809
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,820
I can draw it now.

810
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,430
But I just don't want to.

811
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,150
Draw it. Don't just say it.

812
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,230
I don't want to draw now.

813
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,950
I'm not in the mood now.

814
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,750
Draw now.

815
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,710
I don't want to draw now.

816
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,430
Then stop talking.

817
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,070
Master.

818
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,910
That man defeated us

819
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,430
effortlessly.

820
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,250
I was very scared.

821
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,170
So I told him.

822
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,880
Useless!

823
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,820
Guards!

824
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,910
Beat him and the one kneeling outside

825
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,190
fifty strokes each.

826
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,510
Master. Please spare my life.

827
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,600
I know I was wrong.

828
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,030
-Hit him harder!
-Master!

829
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,620
Useless!

830
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,480
Master, please come in.

831
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,150
Get out.

832
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,510
How did it go?

833
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,210
My Lord. You may not know

834
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,230
that Xiao Yu is a teaching assistant in the Women's Academy.

835
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,570
Well,

836
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,390
we can't investigate the Women's Academy.

837
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,110
But don't worry.

838
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,130
I have taught him a lesson in another way.

839
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,000
Tell me.

840
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,890
I asked someone to beat him up.

841
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,500
You loser!

842
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,470
Loser!

843
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:37,960
Well.

844
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,750
Lord Zuo.

845
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,960
Take a look here.

846
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,600
The dried gourds I just painted.

847
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,160
-Ma'am. Come and take a look.
-Sir. Do you want a gourd?

848
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,150
No.

849
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,720
Look.

850
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,030
Take a look at the gourds.

851
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,750
Have a look at gourds.

852
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,150
Sir, look at the gourds.

853
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,020
The dried gourds I just painted.

854
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,950
Take a look.

855
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,730
Do you want a gourd?

856
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,240
Don't miss it.

857
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,190
Freshly painted gourds.

858
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,250
I told you.

859
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,200
You can't sell them.

860
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,630
What else can you do

861
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,150
apart from making sarcastic remarks?

862
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,240
It's fine if you can't sell them.

863
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,910
You've dirtied your face.

864
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,510
Why are you so annoying?

865
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,190
Don't move.

866
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,920
-Let me see.
-What’s wrong?

867
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,300
There seems to be something dirty here.

868
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:29,590
Look.

869
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:30,870
Really?

870
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,770
Go take a look.

871
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,310
Childish.

872
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:40,830
Come here.

873
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,390
Don't come over.

874
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,790
Childish, come here.

875
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,310
My clothes are new.

876
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,270
So what?

877
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,550
Why did you poke me?

878
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,440
Come here.

879
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,270
Don't get my clothes dirty.

880
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:48,990
Come here.

881
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:49,850
Brother.

882
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,470
Teaching Assistant Xiao and Miss Song.

883
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,910
I just want to poke you.

884
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,610
Mr. Xiao.

885
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,660
Miss Zhu.
