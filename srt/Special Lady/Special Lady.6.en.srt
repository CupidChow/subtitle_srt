[Special Lady]

[Episode 6]

4
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,070
The door is over there.

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,720
Don't try to escape.

6
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,479
-Sir.
-Take him out.

7
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,630
You bold pervert.

8
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,270
Pervert.

9
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,770
Stop!

10
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,240
I need to take a closer look at you.

11
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,680
Don't.

12
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,509
Don't. Sir.

13
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:51,870
This...

14
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,590
You're doomed.

15
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,130
I remember your face.

16
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,950
If you come to the academy again,

17
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,670
I'll report to the government.

18
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,430
Report to the government.

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,690
Get lost.

20
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,130
Get lost.

21
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,520
I...

22
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,420
-Get lost.
-Get lost.

23
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,590
-Mr. Zhang.
-Sir.

24
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,320
Calm down.

25
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,700
Don't be angry. It's bad for your health.

26
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,040
I'll close the door.

27
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,640
Close the door.

28
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,930
Close the door.

29
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:10,680
Close the door.

30
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,520
Mr. Xiao, I suggest you

31
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,190
don't think too much.

32
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,390
After all, the Song family has its rules.

33
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,030
I can't marry you if you can't be admitted to Song's Academy.

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,270
If you don't want me to break off the engagement,

35
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,430
you'd better propose it yourself.

36
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,050
What do you think?

37
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,870
Miss Zhu.

38
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,030
Let's wait and see.

39
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,230
Mr. Xiao, we may go separate ways.

40
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,930
We may never see each other again.

41
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,050
Never see you again. Goodbye.

42
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,540
Yueniang, where is Mr. Xiao?

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,079
Mr. Xiao left.

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,720
I didn't leave. I'm Xiao Yu.

45
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,400
Is Mr. Chen looking for me?

46
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,800
Mr. Xiao.

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,960
My dad wants to see you.

48
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,790
Why did father want to see him?

49
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,680
How would I know that?

50
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,630
Mr. Song must have something important to tell me.

51
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,630
Important things can't be delayed.

52
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,150
Miss Zhu, you are hindering us.

53
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,150
See you, Miss Zhu.

54
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,730
Dad wants to see him.

55
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,740
What could the reason be?

56
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,030
That day, he accidentally broke into Women's Academy.

57
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,920
He is a pervert.

58
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,520
Why did Mr. Chen admit him to the academy?

59
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,640
I hired Xiao Yu as the teaching assistant of Women's Academy

60
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,470
because he's indeed capable.

61
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,310
Based on my insight into people,

62
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,450
Xiao Yu is a rare talented man.

63
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,829
Besides,

64
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,350
it's really tiring

65
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,760
for me alone to be responsible for Women's Academy.

66
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,240
I should find a helper.

67
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,150
Xiao Yu

68
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,390
needs to prepare for Yiyang Academy's exam next year, right?

69
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,190
He can study and teach at the same time.

70
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,270
It's an important thing.

71
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,900
Did you report to Dean?

72
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,890
I'm reporting to Dean now.

73
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,650
Mr. Zhang.

74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,490
Any other objections?

75
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,140
Well.

76
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,730
Teaching Assistant Xiao is so young.

77
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,330
If he is with these female students all day,

78
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,210
I'm afraid people will gossip.

79
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,950
By that time,

80
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,570
how can you protect the reputation of the women in the academy?

81
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,480
What I see is

82
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,450
the female students are devoted to studying,

83
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,620
and Teaching Assistant Xiao is diligent.

84
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,430
But what Mr. Zhang sees is

85
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,220
Xiao Yu is a pervert,

86
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,590
and the reputation of the female students will be damaged.

87
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,480
I wonder what on earth is different.

88
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,270
What we see or our vision?

89
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,080
We both are teachers of Song's Academy.

90
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,720
I have the responsibility to remind you

91
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,150
that you should pay attention to his motivations and concerns

92
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,600
when using someone.

93
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,390
I believe Xiao Yu

94
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,159
will pay attention to his words and actions.

95
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,650
If he breaks the rules, you don't need to do anything.

96
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,080
I'll punish him.

97
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,820
In that case, it will be too late

98
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,620
to regret.

99
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,950
Let me remind you.

100
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,340
When you make a decision related to the students,

101
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,350
you should consider other teachers' opinions.

102
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,400
If your opinions are right,

103
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,170
of course I should consider them.

104
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,220
If they are nonsense,

105
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,460
there's no need to consider them.

106
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,200
Dean. Please make the decision.

107
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,600
Drink more tea in this season

108
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,490
to detoxify and reduce internal heat.

109
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,120
Dean.

110
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,000
Several days ago, Rongniang asked someone

111
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,770
to deliver some dried high-quality tea to me.

112
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,750
I'll ask Song Li to deliver some to you someday.

113
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,280
Come. Try it.

114
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,909
Dean. You agree to let Xiao Yu be the teaching assistant?

115
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,810
You should try it too.

116
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,500
Songzhi.

117
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,160
I want to hear Juntang's opinions about Women's Academy.

118
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,370
You go back first.

119
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,910
Similarly,

120
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,380
I will hear Songzhi's opinions

121
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,650
about Men's Academy.

122
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,940
Okay.

123
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,200
I'm leaving.

124
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,760
Have a seat.

125
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,450
Mr. Zhang.

126
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,840
I wonder why Mr. Zhang

127
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,180
dislikes me so much.

128
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,810
Mr. Zhang is traditional.

129
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,970
Mr. Xiao, don't mind him.

130
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,980
I didn't expect you

131
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,580
to speak so highly of Xiao Yu.

132
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,360
I sincerely think

133
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,660
meeting Xiao Yu

134
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,150
is like finding a bosom friend.

135
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,050
It's easy to find a child, but hard to find a bosom friend.

136
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,080
Besides, with his knowledge of women's makeup,

137
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,100
he can help me with my makeup class.

138
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,320
What about his morality?

139
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,540
If I want to know someone's morality,

140
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,630
I only look at his eyes.

141
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,470
If his eyes are clear,

142
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,250
I believe he has good morality.

143
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,500
If his eyes are not clear,

144
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,430
it's hard to say.

145
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,900
Xiao Yu has pure eyes.

146
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,790
He doesn't have any evil thoughts.

147
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,300
I think

148
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,530
Xiao Yu is more than enough to be the teaching assistant of Women's Academy.

149
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,350
Since you're responsible for Women's Academy,

150
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,030
it's up to you.

151
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,870
Thank you. Dean.

152
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,620
Come in.

153
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,580
Father. Mr. Chen.

154
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,800
Mr. Xiao is here.

155
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,580
Okay.

156
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,470
Greetings, Dean.

157
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,690
Greetings, Mr. Chen.

158
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,780
I've explained to Dean.

159
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,690
You can continue to be the teaching assistant of Women's Academy

160
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,050
and help me give classes.

161
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,420
Okay.

162
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,480
Mr. Chen. Thank you for your acknowledgement of my ability.

163
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,560
Don't let me down.

164
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,490
Dean. You and Xiao Yu talk alone.

165
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,500
I'll take my leave then.

166
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,440
Okay.

167
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,980
Yu. How have you been?

168
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,610
I'm fine. Don't worry, Dean.

169
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,240
I asked Uncle Dai to deliver daily supplies to you.

170
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,970
Do you like them?

171
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,240
Yes.

172
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,190
Thank you, Dean.

173
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,840
I thought you would return to the capital.

174
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,870
I didn't expect you to stay.

175
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,780
More importantly, I didn't expect you to stay

176
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,990
with the identity of the teaching assistant of Women's Academy.

177
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,650
I didn't expect

178
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,720
to meet Mr. Chen either.

179
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,230
And I have gained his recognition.

180
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,800
It was really a coincidence.

181
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,890
You two are similar.

182
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,530
You chose each other because of a coincidence.

183
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,960
Also,

184
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,060
I'm very regretful

185
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,140
that I failed to be admitted this year.

186
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,960
I admire Song's Academy for its studying atmosphere.

187
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,220
I want to be the teaching assistant.

188
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,550
I believe with the atmosphere in Song's Academy,

189
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,990
I'll be admitted to Yiyang Academy next year.

190
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,000
Yueniang,

191
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,140
you went too far today.

192
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,740
What did I do?

193
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,510
Are you talking about the distraction?

194
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,520
You know what I'm talking about.

195
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,990
Why did Mr. Zhang suddenly come to Women's Academy?

196
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,690
Why was Mr. Xiao suddenly kicked out?

197
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,840
How would I know?

198
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,970
We grew up together.

199
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,630
I know very well

200
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,740
what kind of person you are.

201
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,620
Sister.

202
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,210
I'm not Brother Li.

203
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,060
It's useless to act cute in front of me.

204
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,960
Sister,

205
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,030
why are you so smart?

206
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,960
You're not only beautiful,

207
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,720
but also smart.

208
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,350
Other girls are no match for you.

209
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,310
I'm not our second brother.

210
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,590
It's useless to be smooth-tongued.

211
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,330
This time, I'll go easy on you.

212
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,830
If you play the same trick

213
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,870
with Mr. Xiao again,

214
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,910
I will tell our parents about everything.

215
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,200
I dare not do it again.

216
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,230
I wonder what kind of good luck he had.

217
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,460
You are a girl.

218
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,380
How can you talk so vulgarly?

219
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,710
Sorry.

220
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,420
And...

221
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,670
And

222
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,170
100 handwritten copies of Women's Moral Code.

223
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,520
Sister, can you take my books back to the study?

224
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,650
I'm going to see Dad.

225
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,740
Thank you. Sister.

226
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,400
Uncle Dai.

227
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,410
Who are in this room now?

228
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,650
Mr. Song and Young Master Li.

229
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,870
Uncle Dai, have a rest.

230
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,860
I'll deliver the tea for you.

231
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,940
Well. You?

232
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,000
Uncle Dai. It's just delivering a pot of tea.

233
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,300
You don't think I can do it?

234
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,970
But

235
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,200
you behave too well today.

236
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,550
Did something happen?

237
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,590
No.

238
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,290
I behave well every day.

239
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,260
Look at what you said.

240
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,320
Thank you, Uncle Dai. Just go.

241
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,500
Have a rest. Go.

242
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,740
-Okay.
-Go.

243
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,020
Yueniang.

244
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,100
Hush.

245
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,290
What are you doing here?

246
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,500
I'm here to deliver the tea to our father.

247
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,370
Then go ahead.

248
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,680
Brother Li, wait.

249
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,910
Come here.

250
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,400
Where are you going?

251
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,860
Dad asked me to do something for Xiao Yu.

252
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,480
Brother Li, wait.

253
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,670
Did Dad ask you to accompany Xiao Yu to go back to the capital?

254
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,340
Back to the capital?

255
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:56,990
No?

256
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,780
Then what did he ask you to do for Xiao Yu?

257
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,070
Dad agreed to let Xiao Yu be the teaching assistant of Women's Academy.

258
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,550
Now I'm going to prepare a room in men's dorm for him.

259
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,770
In men's dorm?

260
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,290
Yes.

261
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,670
Xiao Yu is the son of Dad's friend.

262
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,650
And he has an engagement with you.

263
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,890
Of course I need to prepare it carefully.

264
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,020
Yuniang hasn't married off.

265
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,140
Otherwise,

266
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,420
he would have been allowed to live in our house this time.

267
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,270
What's your plan then?

268
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,400
I'm trying to figure it out.

269
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,540
Xiao Yu has an engagement with you.

270
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,570
He'll be a family member in the future.

271
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,770
I should make arrangements carefully.

272
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,450
But the Song family has its rules.

273
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,770
No one should be an exception.

274
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,180
After thinking about it,

275
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,210
I think it's better to be impartial.

276
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,100
Although he'll marry you in the future,

277
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,110
he should follow the local customs now.

278
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,210
He should follow the rules of the Song family.

279
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:42,940
I won't make an exception of him.

280
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,170
You're right.

281
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,060
I'm going to the men's dorm now

282
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,020
to check the list

283
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,550
and see which room is still available.

284
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,710
I remember

285
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,800
there is a vacancy

286
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,550
in Zhou Ji's room.

287
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,860
Mr. Zhou?

288
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,380
Brother Li, wait.

289
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,820
I suddenly remember that I need to go to Teachers' Office.

290
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,650
I have something to do.

291
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,750
Help me deliver the tea.

292
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,710
I'm going to get the list for you.

293
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,430
I'm going. Wait for me. Wait for me.

294
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,050
Who is it?

295
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,680
So rude.

296
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:19,980
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

297
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,970
It's me.

298
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,160
Miss Zhu.

299
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,680
Miss Zhu.

300
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,810
Women should be virtuous and decent.

301
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,470
You shouldn't be impatient,

302
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,330
mad, or ill-behaved.

303
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,000
Yes.

304
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,480
You're right.

305
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,940
Why are you here in such a hurry?

306
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,600
Brother Li asked me to help him get the list of the men's dorm.

307
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,500
The list of the men's dorm

308
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,420
is over there.

309
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,310
Thank you. Sir.

310
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,590
Li Wenshu is the son of the county magistrate.

311
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,140
He is wildly arrogant.

312
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,170
If Xiao Yu lives with him,

313
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,550
it's going to be interesting.

314
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,150
I'm not gonna make it easy for you. If you can't handle it, you'll retreat.

315
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,120
[No.1 Zhou Ji]

316
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,590
I think we came out from here this afternoon.

317
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,510
Mr. Xiao.

318
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,640
Why are you here?

319
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,650
Senior Song.

320
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,100
Dean told me this afternoon

321
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,100
that you'd come to me tonight.

322
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,550
I'm free after class.

323
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,580
So I've been waiting for you here.

324
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,320
I see.

325
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,020
Come.

326
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,430
Senior Song.

327
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,630
Uncle Dai led me out from the academy this afternoon.

328
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,880
That was when I knew

329
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,680
the academy and your house are connected.

330
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,710
My father didn't want to establish this academy back then.

331
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,800
Only some students came here because of his reputation.

332
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,310
So my father built some studies in the backyard.

333
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,069
But later, there were more and more students.

334
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,619
And the studies kept being expanded.

335
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,619
That was how the academy was established.

336
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,720
I see.

337
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,410
Senior Song.

338
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,829
Where are we going?

339
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,210
I'm taking you to the dorm.

340
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,079
Let's go.

341
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,380
Come.

342
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,810
My father always advocates thrifty.

343
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,270
Two students live in one room in both men's and women's dorms.

344
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,090
Please understand.

345
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,940
-Thank you
-Come.

346
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,880
for making arrangements for me.

347
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,830
I've checked the dorm list.

348
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,650
There is a vacancy

349
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,920
in Li Wenshu's room.

350
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,690
Live with him first.

351
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:45,920
Okay.

352
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,540
Come.

353
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,760
Mr. Xiao.

354
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,380
You should tidy up the room first.

355
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,570
Senior Song.

356
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,330
Are you sure this is a room for two?

357
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,250
I...

358
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,670
This

359
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,600
is too crowded.

360
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,690
Mr. Xiao.

361
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,840
You don't know how to make the bed?

362
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,580
To be honest,

363
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,230
when I was at home,

364
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,270
I barely did things like this.

365
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,560
Sorry.

366
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,670
Mr. Xiao,

367
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,810
let me do it.

368
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,220
Okay.

369
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,020
Senior Song.

370
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,010
Please make that end of the quilt at right angles.

371
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,870
When I sleep,

372
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,820
I'm used to making the quilt at right angles.

373
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:01,900
Okay.

374
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,580
Is that okay?

375
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,150
It's fine.

376
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,070
I'll

377
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,280
make myself get used to it.

378
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,430
By the way, Mr. Xiao,

379
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,330
go to the dorm supervisor later

380
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,260
to get a cloth,

381
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,310
so that you can clean the tables and chairs at ordinary times.

382
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,750
I should do the cleaning?

383
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,410
Yes.

384
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,180
Okay. Okay.

385
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,130
Senior Song.

386
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:41,830
Where...

387
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,220
Where is the dorm supervisor?

388
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,260
Turn right after you go out.

389
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,340
Then turn left. And you'll arrive at the destination.

390
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,830
Turn right after I go out. Then turn left.

391
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:55,950
Right.

392
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,820
Left.

393
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,390
Right, right, right.

394
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,100
Right, right, right.

395
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,030
Turn left after I go out. Then turn right.

396
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,400
Turn left.

397
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,300
Senior.

398
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,840
Junior Wenshu.

399
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,710
I was looking for you.

400
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,940
Women's Academy has a new teaching assistant.

401
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,970
His name is Xiao Yu.

402
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,060
Xiao Yu?

403
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,270
Teaching assistant?

404
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,100
Do you know each other?

405
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,130
No. I just heard of him.

406
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,550
Just now, I asked him to live in your room.

407
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,450
From now on, you should get along well with each other

408
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,090
and help each other.

409
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,850
My...

410
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,550
My room?

411
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,370
You are just leaving like that?

412
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,860
This...

413
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,060
Xiao Yu?

414
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,340
Xiao Yu.

415
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,100
What the hell?

416
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,680
Who is Xiao Yu?

417
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,410
Xiao Yu is from the capital.

418
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,170
It's not easy

419
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,630
to deal with someone from the capital.

420
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,590
So what?

421
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,140
Nothing to be afraid of.

422
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,470
I don't care at all.

423
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,510
Right.

424
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,420
How about...

425
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,310
How about

426
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,440
showing him your authority?

427
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,880
Okay.

428
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,440
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

429
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:15,710
Young Master.

430
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,840
Brother, are you alright?

431
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,620
Mr. Xue, are you okay?

432
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,260
Don't you know

433
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,490
where the wooden basin should be put?

434
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,300
If anything goes wrong in my room,

435
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,930
it will damage my reputation if they know.

436
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,440
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

437
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,250
It's okay.

438
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,680
I don't think Mr. Zhong and Mr. Tu did it on purpose.

439
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,320
I was careless.

440
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,370
The floor is wet.

441
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,610
-Let me wipe it. Otherwise, someone else will slip.
-I know there are wise people.

442
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,750
Like I said, it's easy to slip.

443
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,920
What a sweet-talker.

444
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,290
What's going on?

445
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,550
My room is a mess.

446
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,750
Do you remember me?

447
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,130
This is my room.

448
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,030
Mr. Xiao, why are you here?

449
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,560
I just became the teaching assistant of Women's Academy.

450
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,190
I was assigned to this room.

451
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,520
That's great.

452
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,910
What happened to your head?

453
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,920
I'm fine. The floor is slippery.

454
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,850
I fell down accidentally.

455
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,790
I'll wipe the floor.

456
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:39,930
Good boy.

457
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,440
Wait.

458
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,070
You don't need to wipe it.

459
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,900
I heard you are from the capital.

460
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,590
Then you should play by the rules.

461
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,670
That's right.

462
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,460
It's generous of me to share this room with you.

463
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,140
You should be grateful.

464
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,760
How about

465
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,660
you wipe the floor?

466
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:05,770
What did you say?

467
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,360
I said

468
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,840
you should wipe the floor.

469
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,510
What? Wiping the floor is not something a person from the capital should do?

470
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,890
You are right.

471
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,170
Wiping the floor is not something I should do.

472
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,690
Interesting.

473
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,520
People like you

474
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
are boring.

475
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,530
Calm down.

476
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,870
Let... Let me wipe the floor.

477
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,100
Mr. Xiao is not suitable for doing this kind of thing.

478
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,020
Get out!

479
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,460
You two.

480
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,050
Get lost!

481
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,540
Close the door, right?

482
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,070
Close the door.

483
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,160
Who are you

484
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,130
to give a command in my room?

485
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,640
I'm talking to you.

486
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,960
This is my room too.

487
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,820
If you don't want to live with someone from the capital,

488
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,160
you should get out too.

489
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,820
You... You're being unreasonable.

490
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,130
Magpies...

491
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,760
Magpies have built nests,

492
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,100
but they are occupied by turtledoves.

493
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,140
Well...

494
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,400
A woman is going to marry off, and 100 chariots will be there to welcome her.

495
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,930
You occupied my room.

496
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,740
You are shameless.

497
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,200
You want to have a competition of reciting poems?

498
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,590
I'm willing to recite one with you.

499
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,260
I'm a poet.

500
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,890
Even if you want to recite 100 poems,

501
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,150
it won't be a problem for me.

502
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,170
They agreed to have a competition of reciting poems. Why are they fighting?

503
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,720
That's right.

504
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,040
Why are they fighting?

505
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,520
What are they doing?

506
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:07,440
I also want to know.

507
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,480
What are you doing here?

508
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,830
Come if you dare.

509
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,040
Get out!

510
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,440
Tell me what you are thinking.

511
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,060
-I don't want to live with him.
-I don't want to live with him.

512
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,040
I mean

513
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,520
how you should treat your classmates

514
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,110
in this academy in the future.

515
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,380
Shouldn't you be tolerant and united

516
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,440
and help each other?

517
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,550
Fine.

518
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,270
Such being the case,

519
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,740
now you two should work together

520
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,970
to tidy up this room.

521
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,620
From now on, if I know

522
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,390
you two have a fierce fight again

523
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,450
because of a trivial matter,

524
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,370
the academy

525
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,060
won't be partial to any of you.

526
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,100
Senior.

527
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:17,680
I...

528
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,090
want to change my room.

529
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,040
Mr. Xiao.

530
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,020
Even if you change your room, you have to share it with someone

531
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,770
and get along with your roommate.

532
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,470
Isn't there a student named Zhou Ji in the academy this year?

533
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,730
I want to live with him.

534
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,830
Zhou Ji?

535
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:35,920
Mr. Xiao.

536
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,580
You have been admitted to the academy too?

537
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:39,780
Mr. Zhou.

538
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,120
You came at the right time.

539
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,540
Can I live with you?

540
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,170
Live with me?

541
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,210
Zhou Ji, who's your roommate?

542
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,370
I'm alone.

543
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,140
You can let Mr. Xiao live with me.

544
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,110
Alone?

545
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,650
That's great.

546
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,500
This is weird.

547
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,990
Today, I feel so happy, even though I'm copying a book.

548
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,020
I wonder

549
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,900
what's happening between Xiao Yu and Li Wenshu.

550
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,040
What a pity.

551
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,140
I planned the show, but I can't enjoy it with my own eyes.

552
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,900
Wontons with fine stuffing.

553
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,680
Brother Li.

554
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,500
Why did you

555
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,690
bring me wontons with fine stuffing today?

556
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,790
Great. I'm hungry now.

557
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,940
-Thank you.
-Be careful.

558
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,420
No one is taking it from you.

559
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,740
If Dad sees you eating like this,

560
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,680
you'll be punished to copy many books.

561
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,340
Why are you so happy today?

562
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,140
Normally,

563
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,380
you would have given a curtsy.

564
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,620
Right. Brother Li.

565
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,350
I heard you took Xiao Yu to the dorm.

566
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,250
How did it go?

567
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,170
How are they getting along?

568
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,560
You were right.

569
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,290
After Mr. Xiao moved in,

570
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,900
he had a conflict with Li Wenshu.

571
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,540
How was the conflict?

572
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:34,710
Was it severe?

573
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,020
No.

574
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,900
I guess they have personality clashes.

575
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,610
But Xiao Yu

576
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,830
doesn't want to live with Li Wenshu anymore.

577
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,700
He said he wants to live with Zhou Ji.

578
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,850
What... What did you say?

579
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,220
He wants to live in Mr. Zhou's room?

580
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,100
Yes.

581
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,920
It seems they know each other.

582
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,680
And there happens to be

583
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,810
a vacancy in Junior Zhou's room.

584
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,230
So I let them live together.

585
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,530
But it seems Mr. Xiao

586
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,960
can't take care of himself.

587
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,720
He doesn't even know how to make a bed,

588
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,500
let alone doing the cleaning in the future.

589
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,210
Besides, Junior Zhou and I

590
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,670
helped him a lot.

591
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,770
Why does Xiao Yu want to live with Mr. Zhou?

592
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,860
If he talks about the engagement

593
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,350
in front of Mr. Zhou...

594
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,600
Let me tell you.

595
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,290
I'm relieved

596
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,240
because of Junior Zhou's help.

597
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,740
Xiao Yu

598
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,680
looks lazy,

599
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,910
but he's smart.

600
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,300
I think if he stays in the academy for a year and a half,

601
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,490
he'll definitely learn it.

602
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,190
Let me see.

603
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,170
Did you bite yourself badly just now?

604
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,300
Brother Li.

605
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,870
Why are there so many obstacles in life?

606
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,680
Like this?

607
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:05,560
Yes.

608
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,640
So complicated.

609
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,800
Put it here.

610
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,350
It seems it's not easy to be a servant.

611
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,110
Right. Mr. Xiao.

612
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,930
I haven't had a chance to ask you

613
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,780
how you came back to the academy.

614
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,380
Has the academy decided to recruit more students?

615
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,480
Or...

616
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,060
Well. I feel embarrassed about this.

617
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,310
I came back to the academy

618
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,050
not as a student,

619
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,090
but the teaching assistant of Women's Academy.

620
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,160
Women's Academy?

621
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,210
It's

622
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,450
a long story.

623
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,470
Anyway, I'm very grateful that I can

624
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,940
continue to stay in the academy.

625
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,500
Mr. Xiao.

626
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,020
One more thing.

627
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,320
I think Senior Song

628
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,350
seems to be very close to you.

629
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,620
He even said you are one of them?

630
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,300
No. No.

631
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,310
I think he was just being friendly.

632
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,080
I have nothing to do with the Song family.

633
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,080
Mr. Zhou, do you have something to say?

634
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,030
I know I shouldn't say too much about this.

635
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,570
But I'm worried that you'll be taken advantage of again in the future.

636
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,400
It's okay. Just say it.

637
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,160
Mr. Xiao.

638
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,360
As you know, most of the students admitted to Yiyang Academy

639
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,890
have a good family background,

640
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,810
especially Li Wenshu.

641
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,870
He is the son of Li Shancai, the county magistrate.

642
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,190
Mr. Xiao.

643
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,000
You must have heard a saying.

644
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,510
Forgive

645
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,400
and forget.

646
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:06,670
I can't do that.

647
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,450
If I forgive and forget,

648
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,600
I will feel uncomfortable

649
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,030
all over my body.

650
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,400
Mr. Xiao.

651
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,590
A gentleman does not contend with petty people.

652
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,570
It makes sense.

653
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,840
But

654
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,640
ignoring petty people

655
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,670
is something new.

656
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,600
Take your time.

657
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,070
Mr. Zhou is really tolerant.

658
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,860
About generosity,

659
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,280
I should learn more from you.

660
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,130
I'm flattered.

661
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,400
Mr. Xiao, let's read books together.

662
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,510
I...

663
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,510
I'm going to get some water.

664
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,060
He forgot to take the basin.

665
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,080
No.

666
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,300
Instead of being a sitting duck,

667
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,100
I'd better take the initiative.

668
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,260
I can't let that bad guy

669
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,350
ruin my good image in front of Mr. Zhou.

670
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,180
But it seems

671
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,820
I haven't had a chance to leave a good impression.

672
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,770
-Why are you here?
-Where are you going?

673
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,160
I'm making sure the door is firmly closed.

674
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,680
Well. The door just...

675
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,040
Brother Li, is this for me?

676
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,190
I'll apply it later.

677
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:03,730
You can go back first.

678
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,710
-I'm sleepy.
-Well.

679
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,430
Wait.

680
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,420
I left not long ago.

681
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,780
What happened again?

682
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,730
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

683
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,240
I...

684
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:16,930
Who is it?

685
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,280
Who's outside?

686
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,190
Who is it?

687
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,460
Hurry up.

688
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,730
Hide!

689
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,020
Keep quiet.

690
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:52,810
Keep quiet.

691
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,020
Can I make a sound?

692
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,880
What are you doing, you pervert?

693
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:09,730
You...

694
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,720
You are a pervert!

695
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,600
I helped you.

696
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,480
Helped me?

697
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,680
If someone sees

698
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,440
you are intimate with a man in the middle of the night,

699
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,160
it will damage your reputation

700
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,090
if this gets out.

701
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:25,710
Let me ask you.

702
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,580
Why did you climb over the wall in the middle of the night?

703
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,150
I... was enjoying the moon.

704
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,010
Enjoying the moon?

705
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,980
Bright moonlight wakes perched magpies.

706
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,030
Deep into night, breeze brings cicadas' chirping.

707
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,760
Such an atmosphere

708
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,330
is not commonly had.

709
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,330
Let's talk about you.

710
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,520
Why did you climb over the wall in the middle of the night?

711
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,020
This is my house.

712
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,220
It's none of your business.

713
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,120
I'm not afraid to tell you directly.

714
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,170
I was going to see you.

715
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,740
I know you live with Mr. Zhou.

716
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,510
Don't tell Mr. Zhou

717
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,960
about our engagement.

718
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,260
Otherwise...

719
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,390
Otherwise,

720
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,640
I'll let you know what the most vicious woman is like.

721
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,770
Men and women should not be too intimate.

722
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,080
I... What you are doing makes it look like we are very close.

723
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,900
If Mr. Zhou finds out about this...

724
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,280
How can you be so vicious?

725
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,990
I think I'm soft-hearted enough to you.

726
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,060
This is my house.

727
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,190
It's reasonable no matter where I am.

728
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,290
But you

729
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,150
sneaked into Song Mansion at night

730
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,470
with an ulterior motive.

731
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,410
Tell me. If I suddenly scream "Someone",

732
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,300
what would happen?

733
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,900
Someone.

734
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:09,920
Hush.

735
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,510
I don't care whether you think

736
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,610
this is a negotiation

737
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,770
or a threat.

738
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:31,860
Anyway,

739
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,770
you can't tell Mr. Zhou

740
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,140
about our engagement.

741
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,480
Fine, I promise you.

742
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,790
I won't tell Mr. Zhou about the engagement.

743
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,050
But you have to promise me

744
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,700
you won't pester me

745
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,480
and cause me trouble.

746
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,580
Fine.

747
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,800
Didn't you say

748
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,270
the Song family's daughters only marry the students of Song's Academy?

749
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,540
I'm not a student.

750
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,150
I'm just a teaching assistant.

751
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,880
Let me ask you.

752
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,240
Do you really not want to marry me?

753
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,200
When she's not speaking, she is pretty and cute.

754
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,780
And a little witty.

755
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,020
Do you think

756
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,830
when I'm not speaking, I'm very cute

757
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,020
and a little witty?

758
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,890
Miss Zhu. Don't worry.

759
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,110
I will never marry you.

760
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,040
Or let me put it this way.

761
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,960
I will never be the person who will marry you.

762
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:42,450
That's good.

763
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,550
You don't deserve me.

764
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,000
Let me ask you.

765
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,100
Why do you want to be admitted to Song's Academy?

766
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,480
I...

767
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,790
I...

768
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,460
You what?

769
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,520
I admire Mr. Chen's knowledge and character.

770
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,910
I hope to be his teaching assistant

771
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,320
to learn from him,

772
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,580
so that I can improve myself.

773
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,840
When I learn well enough,

774
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,530
I will leave Song's Academy.

775
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,890
Learn from him as his teaching assistant?

776
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,120
That's enough.

777
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,970
As long as I can be with Mr. Chen

778
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,020
and learn from him,

779
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,000
it's fine even if I'm not a student of Song's Academy.

780
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,450
It's not a pity that I'm not a student of Song's Academy.

781
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,550
Really?

782
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:37,830
Yes.

783
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:41,430
Fine.

784
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,540
As long as you promise me

785
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,910
you won't be a student of Song's Academy

786
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,140
and you won't tell Mr. Zhou about our engagement,

787
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,510
I won't make things difficult for you anymore.

788
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,960
We'll stay out of each other's business.

789
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,630
Okay.

790
00:40:59,450 --> 00:40:59,980
A word spoken

791
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,230
is past recalling.
