[Special Lady]

3
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,530
[Episode 16]

4
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,250
Was Miss Song Zhu here just now?

5
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,390
Did she come here in the middle of night

6
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,960
in order to scold you?

7
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,229
She came here to apologize to me.

8
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,789
She apologized?

9
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,520
Young Master, stop bragging.

10
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,280
I'm not bragging.

11
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,080
When she saw me, the first thing she said was...

12
00:01:58,729 --> 00:01:59,470
"I'm sorry."

13
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,030
I don't believe it.

14
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,590
Come here. I'll prove it to you.

15
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,570
Zhu!

16
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,550
Miss Song Zhu!

17
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,020
Please speak louder

18
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,570
and say sorry to me again!

19
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,650
Get lost!

20
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,760
Was Miss Song Zhu born in the year of Pig?

21
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,000
How could she change her mind so quickly?

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,190
She just changed her mind in the blink of an eye.

23
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,270
Young Master,

24
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,350
please forgive her.

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,490
What is this?

26
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,840
The school rules sent by Miss Song Zhu.

27
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,710
She sent the school rules here

28
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:36,700
in the middle of the night?

29
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,079
What was her purpose?

30
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,230
When I copied the school rules as a punishment tonight,

31
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,829
I noticed a speical article.

32
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,829
I've marked it.

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,800
You can read it.

34
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,160
The Song Family has its own rules.

35
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,430
I can only tell you that

36
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,790
the Literature and Martial Arts Tournament

37
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,820
will be held in seven days.

38
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,630
The Literature and Martial Arts Tournament?

39
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,010
I got it.

40
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,180
Miss Song Zhu sent the school rules here

41
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,350
in order to give you a chance to return to the academy.

42
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,230
Young Master,

43
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,520
there's no need for you to go back to the academy anymore.

44
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,590
I know.

45
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,230
I've emphasized it 800 times.

46
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,190
You...

47
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,870
Can you stop worrying?

48
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,590
How is the investigation

49
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,590
I've asked you to do?

50
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,790
Young Master,

51
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,140
I've figured out the truth.

52
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,950
The students of the Imperial College

53
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,270
and the students of the three academies in Luoyang

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,070
lived in the Yiyang Inn together.

55
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,710
They booked all the first-class rooms there.

56
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,480
Besides, all of them received training together.

57
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,990
That means they will definitely help

58
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,860
these three academies cheat at the competition.

59
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,880
Uncle Hu.

60
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,430
Go to the Imperial College again.

61
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,910
Check these several men's backgrounds

62
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,060
and find out who's the mastermind behind them.

63
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,310
Young Master, let me escort you back first.

64
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,920
The Crown Prince is waiting for you impatiently.

65
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,750
How can you escort me back first?

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,160
This matter concerns

67
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,930
whether the Imperial College

68
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,480
takes action under the orders of the Bureau of Military Affairs.

69
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,710
It even concerns the relationship between the Bureau of Military Affairs and Song's Academy.

70
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,360
It also concerns

71
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,170
the reason why I came to Yiyang

72
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,310
to inspect the Yiyang Academy this time.

73
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,550
Let me tell you.

74
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,700
What kind of academy is this?

75
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,410
Why is this academy so fathomless?

76
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,710
That's why I can't leave.

77
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,950
I must complete the task

78
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,070
which the Crown Prince gave me.

79
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,590
Right?

80
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,750
How about this? You should go to the Imperial College first.

81
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,480
Just go there.

82
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,990
I'll observe the movements here.

83
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:16,630
Go.

84
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,050
But the Crown Prince...

85
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,660
Stop talking about the Crown Prince.

86
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,079
Let's deal with the serious matters first.

87
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,380
Okay.

88
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,909
It feels so good after I've apologized.

89
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,290
I finally let go of the burden in my heart.

90
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,550
I feel so relaxed.

91
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,070
Father.

92
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,510
Father.

93
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,990
I...

94
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,200
Come inside from the door in the future.

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,420
Yueniang.

96
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,730
Mr. Chen, where are the others?

97
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,630
Miss Zhu.

98
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,870
I saw that everybody came on time,

99
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,550
but they are all spiritless.

100
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,659
Are they not interested in the competition?

101
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,350
Miss Zhu.

102
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,830
This...

103
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,900
Let's see what Zhu wants to do.

104
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,580
A female student is so ill-mannered like this.

105
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,040
You spoiled her.

106
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,210
Sister, help me.

107
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:09,920
Brother, help me.

108
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,590
I know you all have your own ideas

109
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,830
about this Literature and Martial Arts Tournament,

110
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,020
and you all think that

111
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,700
in terms of the competition system,

112
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,790
the content and so on,

113
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,020
it's quite unfair.

114
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,250
Exactly.

115
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
Our academy has always attached much importance to literature.

116
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,600
But the content of this tournament is more about marital arts.

117
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,380
It's obvious that the other three academies

118
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,530
have colluded with each other to bully us.

119
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,240
I really don't know what is

120
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,320
the meaning of such a matter.

121
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,570
Exactly.

122
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Do they want us, the students of the Yiyang Academy,

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,690
to give our dignity away so that they can humiliate us?

124
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,710
-Right. -He's right.

125
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,909
Delicate girls like us

126
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,990
are not suitable for this kind of competition.

127
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,730
What if my beautiful

128
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,860
face is hurt accidentally?

129
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,230
Don't you think it'll be too bad?

130
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:53,860
Right.

131
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,710
I think what you all have said makes sense.

132
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,380
But as you said just now,

133
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,950
since the other three academies have made this decision,

134
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,160
they must think that

135
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,150
the Yiyang Academy will definitely lose.

136
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,220
So, this competition

137
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,110
is not only a good chance to test ourselves,

138
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,390
but also an occasion to prove to the other three academies that

139
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,190
the students of the Yiyang Academy

140
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,830
are not just good at the Six Arts.

141
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,590
I still hope that all of you

142
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,950
can cherish this rare opportunity

143
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,990
and work hard on the training

144
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,420
so as to bring glory to our Yiyang Academy.

145
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,940
This bird looked ordinary because it didn't fly.

146
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,180
Once it flies, it'll soar up into the sky directly.

147
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,960
This bird looked ordinary because it didn't chirp.

148
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,410
Once it chirps, it'll surprise the people.

149
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,460
Yes.

150
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,030
This bird looked ordinary because it didn't chirp.

151
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,380
Once it chirps, it'll surprise the people.

152
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,070
-Yes! -Yes, yes!

153
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,670
Come on. Let's applaud enthusiastically.

154
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,350
Just applaud. Applaud.

155
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:53,950
Just applaud!

156
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,990
Let's applaud.

157
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,920
Miss Yan.

158
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,430
Your attitude wasn't like this just now.

159
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,730
Yueniang is my best friend.

160
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,430
Even Zhou Ji supports her so much.

161
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,580
How can I fall behind?

162
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,070
But...

163
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,210
But I...

164
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,110
How come she's like this?

165
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,700
All those female students who take an active part

166
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,840
in this competition

167
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,670
will get a box of White Jade Cream from me.

168
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,150
-This White Jade Cream -White Jade Cream?

169
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,750
can only be acquired in the palace.

170
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,440
Really?

171
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,180
Of course.

172
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,880
How could I break my promise just because of

173
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,960
several boxes of White Jade Cream?

174
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,110
Well,

175
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,350
This bird looked ordinary because it didn't fly. Once it flies, it'll soar up into the sky directly.

176
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,710
This bird looked ordinary because it didn't fly. Once it flies, it'll soar up into the sky directly.

177
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,570
This bird looked ordinary because it didn't chirp. Once it chirps, it'll surprise the people.

178
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,429
Come on.

179
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,510
Move the bows and arrows aside.

180
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,590
Coming.

181
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,059
Hurry up.

182
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,429
Move the goal to the right a little further.

183
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,780
Hurry up. Put it in the center.

184
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,270
Okay.

185
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,990
Go on moving it to the center.

186
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,150
Move this away.

187
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,750
Take this over there.

188
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,670
Push it a little higher.

189
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,350
Okay.

190
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,110
Push it higher.

191
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,180
Let's go.

192
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,260
Don't be afraid.

193
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,430
They pushed it so high.

194
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,780
We have to push it higher than they did.

195
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,230
Swing higher.

196
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,150
Stand steadily.

197
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,390
Help!

198
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,270
Help!

199
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,720
Help, beauties!

200
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,700
Who did this?

201
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,840
How did you hit the ball?

202
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,990
Instructor Shen.

203
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,130
Your nose is bleeding.

204
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,020
Is it that obvious?

205
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,090
Raise your head.

206
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,230
It's very obvious.

207
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:28,950
Come on.

208
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,230
Walk slowly.

209
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,150
Senior Song.

210
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,850
Give me the bat.

211
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,820
Miss Song Zhu hit the ball so well.

212
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,910
You're indeed my student.

213
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,790
Senior Song, you're amazing.

214
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,640
Teach me.

215
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,830
Come on. Let me teach you.

216
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,060
Aim at the center of the goal.

217
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,590
Miss Song Zhu!

218
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,170
Then...

219
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,030
How come a female student like you

220
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,620
can teach our male students?

221
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,860
Don't you think you've interfered too much?

222
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,990
If we need someone to teach the male students,

223
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,310
as the best cricket player of the Yiyang Academy,

224
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,990
I, Li Wenshu, should be the one teaching them.

225
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,000
Li Wenshu, the best cricket player?

226
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,100
Then what was wrong with that nice hit of the ball just now?

227
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,430
That was only about strength just now,

228
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,540
instead of precision.

229
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,310
Look at me.

230
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,500
Go to the opposit side.

231
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,500
Okay.

232
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,720
Put the ball between your feet.

233
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,190
Put your hands like this and hold the bat.

234
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,170
The look in your eyes should be fierce and your movements should be correct.

235
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,550
Both your waist and legs should use strength at the same time.

236
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,350
Then shout.

237
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,460
Did you cheat at the game

238
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,700
when I rubbed my eyes just now?

239
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,810
No.

240
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,460
You must have cheated.

241
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,020
This doesn't count.

242
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:40,830
Let's do it again.

243
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,710
It's my turn this time.

244
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,160
Go over there.

245
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,940
Two copper coins.

246
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,150
We had a deal.

247
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,180
Hurry.

248
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,420
Hurry up.

249
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,650
A gentleman never retracts a false move in a chess game.

250
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,550
You've lost and you should give me the money.

251
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,240
What's wrong with you?

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,590
What am I doing?

253
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,980
How come I did something like this?

254
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,350
Isn't this something that Miss Song Zhu would do?

255
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,520
I've learnt these bad behaviors from her.

256
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,130
Why did I go towards the direction of the academy?

257
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,370
Zhu, come and do this.

258
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,640
Look.

259
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,630
Zhu will do it?

260
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,500
Miss Song Zhu

261
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,140
is seen in every event.

262
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,310
She is seen in every event.

263
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,110
Junior Zhou.

264
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:46,790
Come on.

265
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,870
Yueniang, be careful.

266
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,380
Okay.

267
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,360
Let me help you.

268
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,760
Zhu is the best!

269
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,910
My ball!

270
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,430
Where is it?

271
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,020
The ball.

272
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,120
I'll go pick it up.

273
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,310
Isn't it the Literature and Martial Arts Tournament?

274
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,260
Why did they throw the embroidered...

275
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,960
It's none of my business.

276
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,850
My feet are out of control and they should be blamed.

277
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,060
I'm already here.

278
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,490
I was even hit by the ball.

279
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,050
I can't just leave like this, right?

280
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,100
Right.

281
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,630
I have to figure out who dared to

282
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,000
offend me.

283
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,030
Look at him.

284
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,620
This...

285
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,750
You're not good at this.

286
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,720
How bad your skills are.

287
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,070
Xue Hanfu is so stupid.

288
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,420
-Help!
-Just act like a real man.

289
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,490
He's still the same coward as I remember.

290
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,240
Where's Miss Song Zhu?

291
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,490
I guess she's so stupid that

292
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,820
she's not even qualified to receive training.

293
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,280
Who is the stupid person you talked about?

294
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,070
Who?

295
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,260
Who is stupid?

296
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,320
Who is the stupid person I talked about?

297
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:05,950
Who is stupid?

298
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,400
Who is it?

299
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,750
Let me ask you.

300
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,960
Are you coming back to us?

301
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,110
Of course not.

302
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,340
I just want to see who was so blind

303
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,430
and dared to kick this embroidered ball

304
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,500
towards me.

305
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,990
Alright.

306
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,670
In that case, please leave at once.

307
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,940
Now it's the internal training time of the Yiyang Academy.

308
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,700
Outsiders are not allowed to peep.

309
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,140
Go.

310
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,750
No.

311
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,710
Just go.

312
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,230
Wait, wait.

313
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,300
I was kind enough to bring the embroidered ball back for you.

314
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,030
You asked me to leave without saying something nice?

315
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,570
Thank you. I really appreciate your hard work.

316
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,210
Bye.

317
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:49,660
Wait.

318
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,080
Here you are.

319
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,370
Let's play a round.

320
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,860
No.

321
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,860
You adults are liars.

322
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,180
A young man cheated me and got two copper coins from me.

323
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,710
No.

324
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,900
Those are bad young men.

325
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,060
Look at me.

326
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,860
I'm a good young man.

327
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,340
If you don't believe me,

328
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:12,870
you can ask him.

329
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,170
Let's play a round.

330
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,930
If you win,

331
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,370
all of them will be yours.

332
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,440
Young Master.

333
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,860
It's you.

334
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,100
Young Master, please.

335
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,980
This thing looks good but doesn't taste good.

336
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,700
Let me see who was so bold

337
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,830
and dared to bully our young master's best friend.

338
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:11,950
It was him.

339
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,700
I'm giving you some money,

340
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,450
and it's enough to buy many candies.

341
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,060
Go home.

342
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,270
Keep a low profile during the trip.

343
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,760
Don't make it public.

344
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,060
Understood.

345
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,820
Young Master.

346
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,380
Take it.

347
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,220
This...

348
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,460
Young Master.

349
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,960
Three cards of Empty Plum Patterns.

350
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,350
Pass.

351
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,180
Ten Thousand Strings of Copper Coins.

352
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,590
I have no cards to win at this.

353
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,000
Young Master.

354
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,620
Keep a low profile during the trip.

355
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,110
Don't make it public.

356
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,550
You...

357
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,550
You've lost weight.

358
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,270
Actually, you've gained weight.

359
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,580
You know how to play this?

360
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,010
I've just defeated a master.

361
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,240
Actually, I'm a master.

362
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,180
I'm sorry, Young Masters.

363
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,360
I won again.

364
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,770
It was just a game, wasn't it?

365
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,070
Why are you so serious?

366
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,290
I won't steal cards again.

367
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,650
125.

368
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,560
I won't steal cards again.

369
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,040
126.

370
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,590
Young Master, I won't steal cards again.

371
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,210
127.

372
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,580
The person who was looking for you

373
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,300
went to the mountain to pray with the Empress Dowager this morning.

374
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,500
I guess

375
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,760
it'll take several days.

376
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,740
So,

377
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,660
you're safe.

378
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:27,940
Great.

379
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,140
You came here just in order to tell me this thing?

380
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,800
Not really.

381
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,430
There are two things.

382
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,250
Firstly,

383
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,530
I miss you.

384
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,820
So I came to see you.

385
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,550
Secondly,

386
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,890
I have a new mission.

387
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,060
A new mission?

388
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,930
Last time, Uncle Hu brought an account book.

389
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,020
I checked it

390
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,990
and found that the amount of money which Duke Yue's Mansion donated every year was huge.

391
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,700
There were probably 10,000 taels of gold.

392
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,350
So much money?

393
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,320
The National Treasury gave the local governments

394
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,150
no more than several thousand tales every year.

395
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,780
I suspect that this is a big corruption case,

396
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,750
and it involves many people.

397
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,560
But

398
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,440
if we start investigating this case from the capital,

399
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,690
we might alert the suspects easily.

400
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,610
I think since Song's Academy might be related to

401
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,550
this donation case,

402
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,870
and the competition this time involves

403
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,580
the Imperial College and the Bureau of Military Affairs,

404
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,220
the relationships between these people must be complex.

405
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,180
Why don't we start with Song's Academy?

406
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,780
However...

407
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,070
I heard that you were expelled from Song's Academy.

408
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,820
I have a way to go back.

409
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,320
Okay.

410
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,220
Go back to Song's Academy

411
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,820
and find out about the truth of this case.

412
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,430
Yes.

413
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,140
This bird looked ordinary because it didn't fly. Once it flies, it'll soar up into the sky directly.

414
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,350
This bird looked ordinary because it didn't chirp. Once it chirps, it'll surprise the people.

415
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,230
Yiyang Academy is the Red Team.

416
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,170
The Three Academies of Luoyang will constitute the Blue Team.

417
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,330
In the competition, we'll adopt the method of keeping scores.

418
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,810
In each event, the winning team will get one point.

419
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,160
The team getting two points first

420
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,730
will be the winner.

421
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,330
The focus of this competition is about participation and communication.

422
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,490
I hope that all the students

423
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,210
can think of the result calmly.

424
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,430
[Yiyang Academy Will Surely Win!]

425
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,780

427

Take it away.

433
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,570
The teachers from both teams will draw lots to select

434
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,100
the contestants of the first event,

435
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,460
namely, Ride the Wind to Take the Ball.

436
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,160
It's kicking an embroidered ball on a swing.

437
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,980
The contestants can kick the ball three times in total.

438
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,890
They can take turns to kick the ball.

439
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,470
Pick me. Pick me.

440
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,670
The team whose contestants hit the ball twice first

441

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,940
will get one point.

443

are Yan Qinruo...

445
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,300
Yan Qinruo!

446

Ding Miao.

454
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,060
Ding, how are you?

455
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,750
Ding Miao.

The contestants of the Blue Team are He Qin...

457
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,540
It's the luckiest draw.

458
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:25,980
It's the luckiest draw.

459
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,220
Wake up, Ding. Wake up.

460
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,140
It's the luckiest draw.

461
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,060

Yueniang, I want to quit.

You have to stand up.

502
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,620
Look.

I'm not the one who's swaying.

504
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,300
It's the swing that's swaying.

505
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,980
Don't panic.

506
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,580

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,310
If you disgrace the Yiyang Academy,

566
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,770
I'll make you swing for a day.

567
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,240
Don't let others look down upon you.

568
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,500
Ding Miao stood up!

569
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,300
Ding Miao stood up!

570
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,220
You can surely do it!

571
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,340
Come on!

572
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,060
Good.

573
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:48,060
You are invincible!

574
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,300
Ding Miao, come on!

575
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,030
Come on!

576
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,860
Come on, Ding Miao!

577
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,780
He'll kick it soon.

578
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,460
Come on!

579
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,220
I'm invincible!

580
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,670
Good!

581
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:15,740
We won!

582
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,620
We won!

583
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,860
We won!

584
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:22,980
Ding Miao.

585
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,500
Come back! Come back!

586
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,230
Come back!

587
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:27,850
Ding Miao.

588
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,480
You're amazing.

589
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,700
You're so amazing.

590
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,190
The Red Team won this round.

591
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,400
Yiyang Academy won.

592
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,600
Yiyang Academy is better at

593
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,830
such a game for girls.

594
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,020
We

595
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,190
admit defeat.

596
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,990
Thank you.

597
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,180
Great.

598
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,020
One, two.

599
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,300
One, two, go.

600
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,270
One, two, go.

601
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,670
One, two, go.

602
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,380
Ding, you're amazing.

603
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,340
You're amazing.

604
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,380
Yueniang.

605
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,080
The next event is playing chess.

606
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,120
Do you think we can get another point?

607
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,980
I hope the three best chess players

608
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,580
in our academy will be selected.

609
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,250
Waiter!

610
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,570
[Imperial College]

611
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,180
It's okay to do it now.

612
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,380
Let's go.

613
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,940
All the first-class rooms of the Yiyang Inn

614
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,600
have been booked by the students of the Imperial College.

615
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,450
Why are there some martial arts masters?

616
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,150
Oh no.

617
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,460
The second event is

618
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,770
the Life & Death Deciding Game.

619
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,490
In other words, among these three groups,

620
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,060
if two groups solve

621
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,560
the Life & Death Questions and save the stalemate

622
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,220
[Zhou Ji]

623
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,940
within the time of burning a joss stick, that team will win.

624
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:21,750
The Red Team.

625
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,970
Zhou Ji.

626
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,180
Li Wenshu.

627
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,260
Zhao Yuanzhen.

628
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,940
The Blue Team.

629
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,220
Zhou Ting.

630
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,770
Gao Longkuan.

631
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,350
Sun Weichao.

632
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,820
Go for it!

633
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,780
The Blue Team will surely win!

634
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,460
Go for it!

635
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,100
Blue Team, go for it!

636
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,020
The Blue Team will surely win!

637
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,940
Don't be nervous. Go for it!

638
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,770
Zhou Ting from the Blue Team versus Zhou Ji from the Red Team.

639
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,290
Gao Longkuan versus Zhao Yuanzhen.

640
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,930
Sun Weichao versus Li Wenshu.

641
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,090
Be careful.

642
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,290
Qinruo.

643
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,930
Don't you think Junior Zhou is a bit weird?

644
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,170
Even if your white chessmen can go ten steps first,

645
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,410
you won't be able to defeat me as I'm the Sage of Chess.

646
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,820
I've heard that

647
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,680
your identity as an illegitimate son has been discovered.

648
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,690
Why were you so careless?

649
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,540
I'm so nervous.

650
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,460
Zhou put down a chess piece.

651
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,810
Do you think Junior Zhou can win?

652
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,220
Don't worry. We will definitely win.

653
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,410
Just wait and see.

654
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:25,780
Just wait.

655
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,160
Give one point to the Blue Team.

656
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,100
It's okay.

657
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,200
Young Master.

658
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,140
Come on.

659
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,660
Sir.

660
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:35,570
Come on.

661
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,220
Thank you.

662
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,700
Miss Zhao!

663
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,300
She won!

664
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,300
She won!

665
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,060
Great!

666
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,820
You've become like this at the Yiyang Academy now.

667
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,430
Your situation is really not satisfactory.

668
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,350
Just tell me

669
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,080
why you didn't go to the Imperial College back then.

670
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:22,890
Right.

671
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,460
You gave away the admission qualification for the Imperial College.

672
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,350
Look. I have a bad memory.

673
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,110
In my opinion,

674
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,820
our parents should have left the admission qualification to you.

675
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,820
Do you

676
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,570
think so?

677
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,860
By the way,

678
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,580
I almost forgot this.

679
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,380
Our father said that he would give 50 taels of silver

680
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,350
to your mother every month so that she could see the doctor.

681
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,270
But my mother opposed this idea strongly.

682
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,710
He's a talented scholar in Luoyang

683
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,630
and the top student of the academy.

684
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,760
Mr. Zhang,

685
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,250
you should have faith in your students.

686
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,090
Of course I have faith in my students.

687
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,660
Impressive!

688
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,239
My father has been asking me about my opinions lately.

689
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:11,909
What do you think

690
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,750
I should say?

691
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,350
Zhou… Junior Zhou, come on!

692
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,310
Come on!

693
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:25,870
Come on, Zhou Ji!

694
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:26,750
Come on!

695
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,070
Keep your voice down. Don't disturb him.

696
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,190
Do you want to ignore her and just let her die

697
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,969
or give her 50 taels of silver every month so that she can stay alive?

698
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,380
You'll make the decision.

699
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,780
Come on, Junior Zhou.

700
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,550
Junior Zhou.

701
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,360
I told you about it earlier.

702
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,350
-What's going on?
-We don't have much time left.

703
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,690
Filial piety comes first.

704
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,920
Is this saying not true?

705
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,750
Relax.

706
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,730
We don't have much time left

707
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,350
Put down the chess piece at once.

708
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,550
Time's up.

709
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,530
The game is over.

710
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,800
The Blue Team won.

711
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,660
How could this happen?

712
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,780
How could this happen?

713
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,730
He's the No.1 talented scholar in Luoyang?

714
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,310
I think he is the No.1 illegitimate son in Luoyang.

715
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,900
You've gone too far.

716
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,060
Are we on the same team?

717
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,480
Though he didn't win, it doesn't matter.

718
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,620
Why did you slander him?

719
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,300
I was telling the truth.

720
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,400
Just think about it. The next event is cricket.

721
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,640
If they pick these female students by drawing lots,

722
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,690
we'll lose again, won't we?

723
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,380
What's the problem with picking female students after they draw lots?

724
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,180
Who says that we female students will definitely lose?

725
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,090
She's right.

726
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,700
Whom are you looking down upon?

727
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,740
Besides,

728
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,800
since our Yiyang Academy has established a women's school,

729
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,550
it means that this women's school is also part of the academy.

730
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,580
If our internal members don't even respect our own people,

731
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,980
how would the opponents respect us?

732
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,980
-Right?
-Stop arguing.

733
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,820
Don't expose our internal scandals.

734
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,510
They're watching.

735
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,980
The Blue Team will surely win!

736
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,570
Besides, the game is not over yet.

737
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,940
How can you talk about winning or losing so soon?

738
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,570
The Blue Team will surely win!

739
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,670
I didn't win.

740
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,810
It's my fault.

741
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,990
We wanted to rely on you to reverse the situation.

742
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,250
Where was the knowledge you had learnt?

743
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,570
Stop criticizing him.

744
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,450
Can't you see that Junior Zhou is in a bad mood?

745
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,920
My skills are not as good as my opponent's.

746
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,550
I'm sorry.

747
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,100
Hush.

748
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,880
It's all right.

749
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,940
It's all right, Zhou.

750
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:48,980
Zhou.

751
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,160
It's all right, Zhou.

752
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,080
The third round is about to begin.

753
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,370
The third round.

754
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:05,820
The third round.

755
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,210
It's the cricket.

756
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,180
That's what we're good at.

757
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,820
It's the cricket.

758
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,540
Don't worry.

759
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,490
Mr. Xiao.

760
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,300
Uncle Dai.

761
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,970
Mr. Xiao,

762
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,820
are you going to watch the competition?

763
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:19,550
Yes.

764
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,130
But the competition is not held over there.

765
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,330
They've changed the venue to the academy.

766
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:24,990
Thank you.

767
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,300
But what happened?

768
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,100
I'll explain to you later.

769
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,310
The teachers of the Red Team and the Blue Team

770
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,080
should draw lots to pick the players and the substitute players.

771
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,700
Each team has six players.

772
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,130
Without malicious attacks

773
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,160
on the opponents' bodies,

774
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,090
the team with the highest score will win.

775
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,460
Blue Team, go for it!

776
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,570
Go for it! Go for it! Go for it!

777
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,190
Our opponents all consist of male students.

778
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,530
However, in our team,

779
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,510
there's a weak and delicate senior female student.

780
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,440
Because of that, our chance of winning has become smaller.

781
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,450
That's right.

782
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,340
Cut the crap.

783
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,090
Shut up.

784
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,930
I think that

785
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,740
the system of the third event is quite unfair.

786
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,860
In the previous two events,

787
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,770
neither the cotent nor the rules

788
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,030
could embody the differences

789
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,820
between boys and girls.

790
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,390
But in the third event,

791
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,060
power and speed are the keys to success.

792
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,030
In this aspect,

793
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,920
boys are more outstanding than girls.

794
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,470
If we still let a girl take part in the match,

795
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,440
it shows disrespect for women.

796
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,990
It also shows partiality for the other three academies.

797
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,850
Thus, I think

798
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,000
we should replace her with a male student.

799
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,410
Li Wenshu, what are you talking about?

800
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,740
I'm doing this for your own good.

801
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,990
Why can't I take part in the match?

802
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,570
I'm considerate towards you, but you're so ungrateful.

803
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,030
Why?

804
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,420
Stop arguing.

805
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,170
I think

806
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,950
Yiyang Academy has established a women's school

807
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,930
because we hope that just like men, women can receive education

808
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,410
and refuse to be an appendage.

809
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,920
Besides, the education we receive

810
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,540
includes not only lute-playing, chess, calligraphy, and painting,

811
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,120
but also horsemanship and archery skills.

812
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,900
Since the system of the competition has been decided,

813
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,410
we should respect it.

814
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,700
Why is she so unreasonable?

815
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,700
Since a female student has been picked after you drew lots,

816
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,060
as the female student who is about to take part in this match,

817
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,810
I will definitely be a player in the match.

818
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,600
This is fairness.

819
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,650
If you don't let me take part in the match

820
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,980
just because I'm a woman,

821
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,690
and you want to deprive me of the chance to win honor for our academy,

822
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,300
that's the biggest injustice.

823
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,060
What Yueniang said is right.

824
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,820
What she said is right.

825
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,620
Besides, I think that

826
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,220
in the Literature and Martial Arts Tournament this time,

827
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,460
it is not just a battle of strength.

828
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,740
It will also test all the students

829
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,800
to see if they have the courage to face the challenge

830
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,570
when they're selected by the unknown danger

831
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,900
and to see if our power of unity is big enough.

832
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,330
Anyway, we female students

833
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,050
are never afraid of any difficulties.

834
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,470
We are not afraid!

835
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,180
-We're just not afraid!
-Yueniang, go for it!

836
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,410
Well said, Senior Zhu.

837
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,980
A woman can be brave,

838
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,900
but her capability is actually not good enough.

839
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:00,220
Yes.

840
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,340
Do you believe that I'll defeat you?

841
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:01,940
What are you talking about?

842
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,980
Just get out of the cricket ground.

843
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,290
Who said that we female students

844
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,500
will lose if we take part in the match?

845
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,220
In my opinion, Yueniang won't lose.

846
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:08,930
Am I right?

847
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,570
Yes!

848
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,730
We're just not afraid.

849
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,750
Let's cheer for Yue Niang.

850
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,420
Yue Niang, go for it!

851
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,960
Yueniang, you're the best.

852
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,430
Yue Niang, go for it!

853
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,770
Defeat them!

854
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,260
Be careful. I'll beat you to tears.

855
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,240
This is just a game.

856
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,730
I hope that all the students

857
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,970
can improve themselves through the communication.

858
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,490
Don't take winning and losing too seriously.

859
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:31,870
Otherwise,

860
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,590
we'll lose the original intention of the tournament.

861
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,290
Did you hear that?

862
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,540
Just mind your own business.

863
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,410
Mr. Han is coming.

864
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,810
What Dean Song said is right.

865
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,700
Players, get ready to start the match.

866
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,230
Come on.

867
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,190
-Yiyang Academy! -Go for it!
