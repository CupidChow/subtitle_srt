I saw her in a picture book.

That goddess

is Sanshengmu.

10
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,079
She was the daughter of the God of Mount Hua.

11
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,970
One day, the goddess came to the mortal world

12

13
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,420
But her father and brother were strongly against their relationship.

20
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
I think

21
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,300
it was because the scholar was too weak

22
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,200
that his beloved woman was taken away by her father and brother.

23
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,650
If I had been that scholar,

00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,770
I would have destroyed Mount Hua,

00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:35,600
Hurry.

196
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Let's go.

197
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,370
Miss Yan, are we still going?

198
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,330
Well.

199
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,570
I want to go.

200
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,640
Qinruo, Qin Ruo.

201
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,330
Don't be impulsive.

202
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,500
If Mr. Chen is in danger,

203
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,050
we boys should go and save him first.

204
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,040
Miss Yan.

205
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,830
Listen to my brother.

206
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,120
Feiniang, stay with Miss Yan.

207
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,400
Brother, be careful.

208
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,520
Mr. Chen.

209
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,930
Mr. Chen.

210
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,410
What happened?

211
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,640
Mr. Chen.

212
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,770
-Yueniang.
-Mr. Chen.

213
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,329
Yueniang.

214
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,010
Mr. Chen.

215
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:11,680
Yueniang.

216
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:12,609
Yueniang.

217
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,240
-Zhu.
-Yueniang.

218
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,099
Where have you been?

219
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,240
Didn't you say you were good at martial arts?

220
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,410
Where were you

221
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,500
when he needed you to protect him?

222
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,240
Mr. Zhang.

223
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,609
Don't blame Instructor Shen.

224
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,690
We were going after another man in black.

225
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,540
Instructor Shen was almost killed.

226
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,990
Dean Song.

227
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,720
This is a serious case.

228
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,050
Dean Song, please ask the students to go back with you as soon as possible.

229
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,370
We'll soon seal off this place.

230
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,880
Got it.

231
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,760
Got it.

232
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,540
Yueniang.

233
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,280
Li Wenshu.

234
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,400
Go with us.

235
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,450
Take him.

236
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,710
Go.

237
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,390
It's suddenly so quiet everywhere.

238
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,040
Since my father opened the academy,

239
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,700
it's never been so quiet.

240
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,000
Mr. Chen wouldn't want the academy to be so quiet.

241
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,770
[Song Ling, the eldest daughter of the Song family]

242
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,130
That day, we said goodbye to each other.

243
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,840
[Tomb of Mr. Chen Juntang]

244
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,050
I didn't expected

245
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,260
that it would be the last time I saw you.

246
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,250
I still remember

247
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,610
it was very windy that day.

248
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,230
You were standing under a tree in white.

249
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,730
You seemed to have a lot to tell me.

250
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,810
I didn't ask.

251
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,220
And you didn't tell me.

252
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,560
Juntang.

253
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,160
What would you have said to me

254
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,670
if I had asked you what you wanted to tell me?

255
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,990
Get up.

256
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,730
Yueniang.

257
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,660
If you meet someone

258
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,040
who you love very much,

259
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,620
you must do everything to be with him.

260
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,870
Don't make choices that you'll regret.

261
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,420
Mr. Song.

262
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,360
Invite him tomorrow.

263
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,080
Don't tell my brother about it.

264
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,200
Okay.

265
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,330
Well.

266
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,950
What happened?

267
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,160
Another person died?

268
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,110
What's going on?

269
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,970
Why do you have to close our academy?

270
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,920
We're about close your academy.

271
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,170
Why? Why do you have to do it?

272
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,650
-We have classes. 
-Why?

273
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,600
We have classes.

274
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,690
What are they doing?

275
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,820
Give us an explanation.

276
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,690
What's going on?

277
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:57,890
We don't know.

278
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,330
Dean Song.

279
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,240
Mr. Ming.

280
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,810
What are you doing?

281
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,450
Dean Song.

282
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,950
We've found some clues about Chen Juntang's death.

283
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,200
It has something to do with a corruption case.

284
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,800
I've got an order to close the academy

285
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,010
and investigate the case thoroughly.

286
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,190
How come the academy is involved in a corruption case?

287
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,610
You definitely made mistakes.

288
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,610
Yueniang.

289
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,330
Don't be rude.

290
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,570
You definitely made mistakes.

291
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,120
You should investigate it more carefully.

292
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,810
Yes, you should.

293
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,320
Give us an explanation.

294
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,170
We have procedures to follow when investigating a case.

295
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,490
You don't get to judge us.

296
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,640
What do you mean?

297
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,230
Calm down, everyone.

298
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,870
Mr. Ming, do what you should do.

299
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,810
Dean Song, thanks for your cooperation.

300
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,730
From today onward,

301
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,210
Yiyang Academy will be closed.

302
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,450
It cannot operate

303
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,440
until the case

304
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,820
is solved.

305
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,600
Yes.

306
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,640
Father.

307
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,280
How can they do it?

308
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,460
Father.

309
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,060
Hurry up.

310
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,200
Hurry up.

311
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,760
What's the secret behind the list of donors?

312
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,230
Why would they risk their lives to get it?

313
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,730
Mr. Xiao.

314
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,100
I've just come back.

315
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,300
I'll leave it to you.

316
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,730
Will you take the imperial examination?

317
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,880
What?

318
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,600
Will you try to be the Number One Scholar?

319
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,010
I'm not here to try to be the Number One Scholar.

320
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,290
You're right.

321
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,410
You never said you would.

322
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,080
I thought you would.

323
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,410
I'll get some water.

324
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,250
Greetings, Your Highness.

325
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,210
Mr. Song.

326
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,320
Have a seat.

327
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:24,770
Thank you, Your Highness.

328
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,680
Mr. Song, you must be very busy now.

329
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,280
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

330
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,160
Not at all, Your Highness.

331
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,410
What can I do for you, Your Highness?

332
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,070
What are your thoughts

333
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,290
about what happened in the academy?

334
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,090
Do you want me to be honest, Your Highness?

335
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,250
Of course.

336
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,250
I knew it would happen.

337
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,170
It was only a matter of time.

338
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,050
I didn't expect you to be so frank.

339
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,170
That's good.

340
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,690
Mr. Song.

341
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,420
I wanted to tell you about it

342
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,500
a long time ago.

343
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,000
But back then,

344
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,060
it was not the right time.

345
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,410
It's getting windy.

346
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,720
That's a sign of clouds gathering and chaos occurring.

347
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,100
Mr. Song.

348
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,970
Do you

349
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,010
trust me?

350
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,870
Xiao Yu doesn't know I'm here.

351
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,570
Duke Yue.

352
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,920
Li Shancai is dead.

353
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,130
The ledger is missing.

354
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,670
Song Xu got involved in it.

355
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,390
Don't worry.

356
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,010
I'll get the ledger back.

357
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,840
Forget it.

358
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,960
The situation is getting worse.

359
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,880
Let's

360
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,400
take the opportunity.

361
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,770
How?

362
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,490
Song Xun is so capable.

363
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,730
I think he must need

364
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,930
an ally now.

365
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,480
What's your plan?

366
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:08,960
What do you want me to do?

367
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,330
I heard that you

368
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,500
loved your daughter very much.

369
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,560
Don't get Qinruo involved.

370
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,510
Looks like you've made your choice.

371
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,320
Why did Father ask me to get Qinruo to borrow a boat from Song Zhu?

372
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,280
Lady Zhao.

373
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,810
Why do you look absent-minded?

374
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,760
I'm thinking about how to take away my luggage.

375
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,410
You can just find a boat to move them.

376
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,320
I don't have that much luggage.

377
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,880
You

378
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,520
have so much luggage.

379
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,200
You'll need at least ten carts

380
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,610
to get it back to your home.

381
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,200
Actually,

382
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,440
I planned to use carts

383
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,060
to get it back.

384
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,000
But

385
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,880
Zhou Ji

386
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,860
and Feiniang also have much luggage.

387
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,850
We three have too much luggage.

388
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,290
It's more convenient to use boats.

389
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,370
Zhou Ji?

390
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,600
He and I discussed it.

391
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,890
He and Feiniang

392
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,880
will go to my home with me.

393
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,280
When did you...

394
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,760
Did you...

395
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,560
Aren't your father against it?

396
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,720
My father would let me do everything.

397
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,890
Your father loves you so much.

398
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,170
He lets you do everything.

399
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,530
Unlike my father...

400
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,850
What's wrong, Lady Zhao?

401
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,520
Doesn't your father love you?

402
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,490
Let's pack up.

403
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,140
Will one boat be enough?

404
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,330
I have three boxes of shoes.

405
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,140
[Song Mansion]

406
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,740
Why are you sitting on the wall?

407
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,390
I thought it was inappropriate

408
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,930
to come to see you so late.

409
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,110
So I climbed over the walls of the academy to get here.

410
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,800
Do you have something to say?

411
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:48,840
Go ahead.

412
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,100
I'm listening.

413
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,670
Nothing. Go back now.

414
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,470
What a fool.

415
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,210
Who wants to see me?

416
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,470
I don't know.

417
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,190
But he looks like an elder family member of yours.

418
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,250
An elder family member?

419
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,300
Father.

420
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,580
Yuanzhen.

421
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,320
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

422
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,050
Hello.

423
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,370
Yuanzhen.

424
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,770
Introduce your classmate

425
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,400
to me.

426
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,330
Mr. Zhao.

427
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
My name is Yan Qinruo.

428
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,770
You can call me Qinruo.

429
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,909
Your surname is Yan.

430
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,290
Then you must be

431
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,080
Duke Yue's daughter.

432
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,100
Yuanzhen often mentioned you to me.

433
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:25,989
I've met Duke Yue several times.

434
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,280
Your brother is very handsome

435
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:32,969
and you're so graceful.

436
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,199
Duke Yue is so lucky to have you.

437
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,040
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

438
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,840
You and Lady Zhao have a good chat.

439
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,110
Excuse me.

440
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,500
Bye.

441
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,150
Father.

442
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,290
Why are you here all of a sudden?

443
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,130
Yuanzhen.

444
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,860
Have you done

445
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,530
the thing I asked you to do?

446
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,400
Soon.

447
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,220
She'll be back in a few days.

448
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,240
Okay.

449
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,750
I'll wait for your good news at the inn.

450
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,980
Pack your things these days.

451
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,090
I'll send someone to pick you up.

452
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:27,880
All right.

453
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,060
I'm leaving.

454
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,020
Take care.

455
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,260
I won't be hungry or old at home.

456
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,660
I'm worried about you.

457
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,220
You are here alone.

458
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,780
You should take care.

459
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,730
Enough. No more nagging.

460
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,110
It's not like I'll never see you again.

461
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,150
Xiao Yu.

462
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,300
If you

463
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,620
come back,

464
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,510
take Miss Song Zhu with you.

465
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,130
You...

466
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,820
Are you out of your mind?

467
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:04,890
I'm serious.

468
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,740
I know

469
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,530
she still doesn't know your identity.

470
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,140
Since you know she doesn't,

471
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,390
how can I do that?

472
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,390
Well.

473
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,860
Actually,

474
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,230
I think...

475
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,590
This is what I want to tell you.

476
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,370
Think about it.

477
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,520
Remember your identity.

478
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,410
What are you going to say to Prince Fu?

479
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,050
I've been thinking about how to tell her about it.

480
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,280
But her family and the academy are in trouble.

481
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,640
So I haven't got a chance to talk to her about it.

482
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,550
Just think it through.

483
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,790
No matter what happens,

484
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,400
I'll always be on your side.

485
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,150
Young Master.

486
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,190
We've finished packing.

487
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,540
Thank you, Uncle Hu.

488
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,530
I'm leaving then.

489
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,250
Take care.

490
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,780
Lady Jin, don't cry.

491
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,100
If you keep crying,

492
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,810
your makeup will be ruined.

493
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,310
That's right. You look ugly now.

494
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,610
Really?

495
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,470
Yes.

496
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,650
Don't cry.

497
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,460
Don't be so sad.

498
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,980
We can visit each other often in the future.

499
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,000
Lady Zhao, what's your plan

500
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,040
after you go home?

501
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,320
I haven't thought about it.

502
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,210
I'll listen to my parents.

503
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,010
Lady Zhao, I'll miss you.

504
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,600
Me too.

505
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,200
Remember to visit me.

506
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,520
Miss Yan.

507
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,220
I haven't been in the academy for long.

508
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,160
But I like it here

509
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,990
as much as you do.

510
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,950
Zhu is here.

511
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:12,680
Let's go.

512
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,420
Let's go.

513
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,420
Wait for me.

514
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,870
Yueniang.

515
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,380
Let's go together.

516
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,130
Okay.

517
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,460
Miss Song Zhu.

518
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,250
Hello.

519
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,550
I'm here to see if I can help.

520
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,050
I need to go back and pack.

521
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,800
Bye.

522
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,480
Miss Yan.

523
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,390
Zhu.

524
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,910
If you have anything to say to her,

525
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,920
go to her room.

526
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,460
No need.

527
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,230
You continue to pack.

528
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,560
Bye.

529
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,290
Miss Song Zhu.

530
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,430
You're doing it again.

531
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,540
I knew you'd be here.

532
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,730
I'm not in the mood to fool around with you.

533
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,070
Do you think

534
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,760
will the academy be permanently closed?

535
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,990
No.

536
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,870
Trust me.

537
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,850
I trust you but you can do nothing about it.

538
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,140
You are not a god.

539
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,470
Song Zhu.

540
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,440
Trust me.

541
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,640
You're so childish.

542
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,040
You're like a fool.

543
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,540
I'm a fool, but I'm a lucky fool.

544
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,440
Just like you.

545
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,310
You're smiling.

546
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,170
Look.

547
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,870
I'm glad you're smiling.

548
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,610
Life goes on.

549
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,260
There'll always be sunny days after a storm.

550
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,400
Right?

551
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,350
Do you think

552
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,210
I'm a person who can do nothing

553
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,630
but cause trouble?

554
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,880
Do you think I shouldn't have been so impulsive?

555
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,160
Do you think I shouldn't have offended Li Shancai?

556
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,140
Do you think I shouldn't

557
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,840
done that thing which caused a big trouble?

558
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,120
Don't be silly.

559
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,450
You did nothing wrong.

560
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,370
On the contrary,

561
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,990
you are the hero in people's eyes.

562
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,670
You are the pride of the Song family.

563
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,440
You did the thing many people didn't dare to do.

564
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,020
Don't think that you did something wrong.

565
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,030
You're praising me.

566
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,630
You're really praising me.

567
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,600
Come on, go on.

568
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,510
I mean it.

569
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,440
I...

570
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,580
I always think you are a good girl.

571
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,430
Why are you flushing?

572
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,720
