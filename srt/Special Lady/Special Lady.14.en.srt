[Special Lady]

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,700
[Episode 14]

4
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,440
I didn't expect that Dean Song likes to teach outside the classroom.

5
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,830
He's really poetic.

6
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,729
This place is not as comfortable as the classroom.

7
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,750
It's prickly.

8
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,479
Don't you think so?

9
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,100
You're so boring.

10
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,229
Dean is here.

11
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,740
Dean.

12
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,830
We are not in the classroom.

13
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,820
Don't be too formal.

14
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,979
Have a seat.

15
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,950
You've been here for a while.

16
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,630
Are you used to it?

17
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,870
Yes.

18
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,430
We eat well and live well here.

19
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,110
Everything is good.

20
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,050
Of course, this place is not as good as your homes.

21
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,210
But as classmates, you should understand each other.

22
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,120
Dean. I'm Li Wenshu.

23
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,950
I'm the men's dorm supervisor.

24
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,210
From now on,

25
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,550
if you need anything,

26
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,700
just let me know.

27
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,550
I'll help you solve every problem.

28
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,390
Great.

29
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,720
Dean.

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,950
This is the dorm supervisor of Men's Academy they recommended.

31
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,670
What do you think?

32
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,300
Not just the dorm supervisor,

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,670
classmates

34
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,820
should help each other and be responsible for each other.

35
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,730
Mr. Chen is right.

36
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,760
I'm just afraid that someone is domineering

37
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,850
because he has power.

38
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,820
Teaching Assistant Xiao. Why did you say that?

39
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,360
It would be degrading for someone to call the other man "teacher" if the other man's social rank is lower than his,

40
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,430
and it would be flattering if the other man's social rank is higher.

41
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,520
Sir. Dean.

42
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,610
What do you think?

43
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,170
Let's hear the students' thoughts.

44
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,579
I don't think it's right.

45
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,160
Who said there are many people

46
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,100
flattering those who have a higher social rank?

47
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:44,980
That's right.

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
Mr. Li is right.

49
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,829
That's right.

50
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:47,550
Who said that?

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,720
Why are you laughing?

52
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,670
Am I wrong?

53
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,329
Why are you laughing?

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,320
Zhou Ji,

55
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,640
what do you think?

56
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,030
Dean. I'm Zhou Ji.

57
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,860
I'm not very insightful.

58
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,790
I'll just express my ideas.

59
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,430
People today,

60
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,850
who are far inferior to sages,

61
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,420
regard learning from the teacher as a disgrace.

62
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,050
Thus, wise men become more wise,

63
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,110
and unlearned men become more foolish.

64
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,149
This explains what makes a wise man

65
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,920
and what makes a foolish man.

66
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,420
I think Teaching Assistant Xiao is reasonable.

67
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:27,890
Good.

68
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,720
Well said.

69
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,240
Well said.

70
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,030
Do you understand what he said?

71
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,170
You are clapping hands.

72
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,520
You definitely don't understand.

73
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,340
I don't care.

74
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,630
Anyway, I heard

75
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,140
Mr. Zhou said Mr. Xiao is right.

76
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,630
You think you're smart.

77
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,790
Dean. What do you think?

78
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,110
In your opinion, what are the similarities and differences

79
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,620
between students and sages?

80
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,600
Right.

81
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,430
What are the similarities and differences between sages and students?

82
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,840
What does Dean mean?

83
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,430
What Mr. Zhou and Mr. Xiao said is right.

84
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,180
Then I'll make it easier to understand.

85
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,860
What are the similarities and differences

86
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,030
between you and your teachers here?

87
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,170
I think

88
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,560
the teachers are more knowledgeable

89
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,510
and cultured.

90
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,880
And what are the similarities?

91
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,170
Sages,

92
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,560
teachers,

93
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,480
and disciples

94
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,190
are all born into this world

95
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:40,980
and will eventually return to dust.

96
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,040
They are all humans.

97
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,400
I understand.

98
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,280
We are all humans.

99
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,220
We are all humans.

100
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,910
My bad. My bad.

101
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,390
-My bad.
-You damaged my book.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
My bad, okay?

103
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,140
Zhou Ji is so solemn.

104
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,630
Guess what he is looking at.

105
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,440
He was so outstanding just now.

106
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,160
That's right.

107
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,550
I'm going to stand behind him to take a look.

108
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:18,990
Okay.

109
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,510
Go.

110
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,080
I went to the main house to see Dad.

111
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,690
But I was kicked out by First Madam.

112
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,130
Give it back to me.

113
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,070
So our genius Mr. Zhou

114
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,080
is a concubine's son.

115
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,990
Give it back to me.

116
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,510
Greetings. Brother.

117
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,280
What are you doing?

118
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,390
I can't let anyone bully classmates

119
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,900
in front of me.

120
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,150
You two. Apologize to Mr. Zhou.

121
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,350
Sorry, Mr. Zhou.

122
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,340
Stop laughing.

123
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,790
If anyone dares to laugh,

124
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,490
you're against me.

125
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,320
Zhou Ji.

126
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,720
Zhou…

127
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,240
Mr. Zhou, are you alright?

128
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,060
Mr. Zhou.

129
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,380
He just left like this?

130
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,460
Sorry.

131
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,840
Mr. Zhou, are you alright?

132
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,530
What happened?

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,710
Nothing.

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,070
Tell me if you're unhappy.

135
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,010
I said nothing.

136
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,750
I'm sorry

137
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,390
about my bad manners.

138
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,910
How is Mr. Zhou?

139
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,330
What happened?

140
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,390
Come on. I'll throw it to you.

141
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,010
Catch it.

142
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,450
Have you heard?

143
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,950
Zhou Ji is a concubine's son.

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,870
I heard about it too.

145
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,280
My goodness.

146
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,390
Sisters.

147
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,620
What are you talking about?

148
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,830
What happened to Mr. Zhou?

149
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,520
Just now in Men's Academy,

150
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,250
someone took Zhou Ji's letter and read it out.

151
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,960
It turns out he is a concubine's son.

152
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,390
I heard they almost fought.

153
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,770
Who read it?

154
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,559
It seems to be

155
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,309
Zhong Jiang and Tu Ding.

156
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,220
These two bastards.

157
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,140
Right.

158
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,309
Li Wenshu was also involved.

159
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,720
Yueniang, where are you going?

160
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,880
Oh no! What should we do?

161
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,830
This is bad.

162
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,350
Since I've been admitted to Yiyang Academy,

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,970
I should seize the opportunity

164
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,970
to change my fate.

165
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,450
If I become the top scholar someday,

166
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,710
who would care about my background?

167
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,470
I should do my best to change my fate.

168
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,400
Yueniang.

169
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,670
Wait for me.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,580
Yueniang.

171
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,980
Why aren't you going?

172
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,460
Qinruo.

173
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,750
Have you ever comforted anyone?

174
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,380
I comforted you. Does it count?

175
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,650
I comforted you too.

176
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,900
Then I guess we don't know how to comfort someone.

177
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,580
Then I have to think carefully before I go there.

178
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,130
Otherwise, it's gonna be too bad if I say anything wrong.

179
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,610
Tell me when you figure it out.

180
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,470
Why are you here?

181
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,180
You scared me.

182
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,760
You all know

183
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,560
in such a short time?

184
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,580
I will

185
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,560
let Li Wenshu pay the price.

186
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,570
-Lower your voice.
-Calm down.

187
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,570
Zhou Ji will hear us.

188
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,850
He can't.

189
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,780
Zhou… Zhou…

190
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,370
Mr. Zhou.

191
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,360

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,830
Mr. Chen is on duty today.

381
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,980
So what?

382
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,730
Mr. Chen is spirited.

383
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,480
He has sharp eyes

384
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,470
and ears.

385
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,520
We have to wait until he's asleep.

386
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,680
But I don't know how long we have to wait.

387
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,160
We don't have to wait for him to fall asleep.

388
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,780
Why?

389
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,760
What is this?

390
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,210
Sleeping smoke.

391
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,240
Sleeping smoke?

392
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,020
How can you use this dirty thing?

393
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,710
Will it hurt Mr. Chen?

394
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:21,780
No.

395
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,320
It'll only make him fall asleep.

396
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,520
Cheers.

397
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,490
Cheers. Cheers.

398
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,200
Cheers.

399
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,590
Uncle Hu.

400
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,650
Go this way to the second floor.

401
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,430
-Okay.
-Hurry.

402
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,460
This...

403
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,530
This is Dean's Room.

404
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,620
Miss Zhu almost saw me last time.

405
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,530
I didn't have time to check the things inside.

406
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,040
Young Master.

407
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,350
But this lock...

408
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,680
Can we unlock the door?

409
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,270
I don't know.

410
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,610
But picking a lock is not what a gentleman should do.

411
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,150
Besides, if it's broken,

412
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,160
things will get worse.

413
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,520
Young Master.

414
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,890
Our business is more important.

415
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,650
There is a ghost!

416
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,620
Xue Hanfu.

417
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,450
Ding Miao.

418
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,040
Open the door!

419
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,230
Open the door!

420
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,460
Open the door!

421
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,900
What's wrong, Mr. Li?

422
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,270
Hurry up.

423
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,800
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

424
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,840
-Mr. Li.
-I saw a ghost. A ghost.

425
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,560
A ghost.

426
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,360
A ghost.

427
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,750
Mr. Li.

428
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,060
What are you doing at this hour?

429
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,840
There is a ghost.

430
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,320
Don't touch me.

431
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:26,880
Come on.

432
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,460
A ghost.

433
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,290
Calm down.

434
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,690
I think you are the ghost.

435
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,660
I... I...

436
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,100
I was sleeping just now.

437
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,040
A female ghost suddenly...

438
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,710
She...

439
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,610
She was hanging on the beam.

440
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,480
Then she said I betrayed her.

441
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,400
-I… I don't know her at all.
-He's crazy.

442
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,640
More importantly, she...

443
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,800
Enough, Mr. Li.

444
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,860
She was crawling towards me.

445
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,400
What are you doing?

446
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,640
Mr. Li.

447
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,360
She's here. She's here.

448
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,820
-Go back to your room.
-She's there.

449
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,690
There!

450
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,310
Every injustice has its source.

451
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,920
Don't come after me.

452
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,470
Don't come after me.

453
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,260
Mr. Li.

454
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,120
Uncle Hu.

455
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:07,910
I saw Mr. Song's letters there

456
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,200
last time.

457
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,680
Maybe there's a secret letter inside.

458
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,770
Well.

459
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
And in the box over there,

460
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,650
there's a donation ledger.

461
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,990
Make a copy of it, so that we can take it.

462
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,780
Okay.

463
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,180
The Bureau of Military Affairs?

464
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,580
Sir, how have you been?

465
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,070
Last time, I discussed the reform with you.

466
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,810
I can't believe Wan Li is Song Xu's student.

467
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,460
There are indeed many controversies about the reform in the imperial court.

468
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,160
The crown prince also attaches great importance to it.

469
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,530
But it hasn't been decided yet.

470
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,280
Uncle Hu.

471
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,250
Take this letter and the ledger back

472
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,770
and report to the crown prince.

473
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,970
Tell him about our progress in Yiyang.

474
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,430
Got it.

475
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,300
I'll go back to report tomorrow.

476
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:25,930
Young Master.

477
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,240
Find the secret letter as soon as possible.

478
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,920
Go back!

479
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,520
Don't push me. Don't push me.

480
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,070
Go back.

481
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,430
No.

482
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,520
The oil lamp is on.

483
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,850
Shush.

484
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,720
Look. Look.

485
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,260
Don't push me.

486
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,940
Over there.

487
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,030
Has she left?

488
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,620
Could it be that ghosts need to go back

489
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,540
at dawn?

490
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,440
Really?

491
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,020
I don't know.

492
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,240
It's widely known in the older generation.

493
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,650
Mr. Li, go back now.

494
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,680
We want to sleep.

495
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,330
Sleep.

496
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,440
Xue... Xue Hanfu.

497
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,190
-Xue Hanfu. Xue Hanfu.
-Turn off the light.

498
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,580
-Ding Miao. Ding Miao.
-Hurry up.

499
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,600
Open the door!

500
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,000
Why is she still here?

501
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,000
Why is the ghost running?

502
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,830
You!

503
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,050
Stop!

504
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:42,770
Stop!

505
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,710
Shush.

506
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,410
Don't touch me!

507
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,250
Don't touch me!

508
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:50,760
Don't touch me!

509
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,190
Shush.

510
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,000
-Junior Zhou.
-Don't touch me.

511
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,600
It's me.

512
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,660
Miss Zhu.

513
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,920
Senior Song?

514
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,550
This...

515
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,480
Li Wenshu is going after me.

516
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,420
It's a dead end.

517
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,140
Go to our room and stay there for a while.

518
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,200
Run when the time is right.

519
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:03,840
Okay.

520
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,090
You fake ghost!

521
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:07,840
Stop running!

522
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,390
Mr. Li, why are you in such a hurry

523
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,810
in the middle of the night?

524
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,410
Get lost!

525
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,510
Where is she?

526
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:16,850
Where is the one pretending to be a ghost?

527
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,080
Mr. Li, why are you so rude?

528
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,430
Didn't you see a female ghost pass by?

529
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:27,890
What female ghost?

530
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,680
Never seen one.

531
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,500
It can't be.

532
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,120
This is the only way.

533
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,450
Why didn't you see her?

534
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,630
Mr. Li.

535
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,240
I see darkness in your ophryon.

536
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,450
You're having bad luck.

537
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,670
What bad luck?

538
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,940
Someone pretended to be a ghost.

539
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,890
I don't know.

540
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,730
Keep looking.

541
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,290
I'm going to bed.

542
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,020
Zhou Ji.

543
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,260
Wait.

544
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,630
Do you know something?

545
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

546
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,680
Wait.

547
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,530
As the dorm supervisor, I order you

548
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,670
to let me go in and take a look.

549
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,320
It's in the middle of the night.

550
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,760
Are you making trouble on purpose?

551
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,440
I just want to go in and take a look.

552
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,510
And you say I'm making trouble.

553
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,600
Are you afraid

554
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,770
or is someone in the room?

555
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,920
Let me take a look.

556
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,800
Mr. Li,

557
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,490
please behave yourself.

558
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,070
Let me have a look.

559
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,140
This is my room.

560
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,410
How dare you push me?

561
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,570
I will tell our teacher.

562
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,710
Why won't you let me take a look?

563
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,290
What do you want?

564
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,080
What's going on?

565
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,770
Senior Song pretended to be a ghost to scare Li Wenshu.

566
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,000
She's hiding in our room now.

567
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,440
You...

568
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,100
You two!

569
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,500
Get out of my way!

570
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,340
No.

571
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,800
No?

572
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,780
Why won't you let me go in and take a look?

573
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,480
Fine. We can just stay here.

574
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,090
Let's see who's gonna give in first.

575
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,120
Why should we let you go in?

576
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,710
You don't have the right to make trouble in our room.

577
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,150
I'm the dorm supervisor.

578
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,880
I can do whatever I want.

579
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,940
Don't do this.

580
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,850
Don't!

581
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,920
Help! Help! Murder!

582
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,570
Murder!

583
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,160
Mr. Xiao.

584
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,300
Mr. Xiao, hurry.

585
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,260
Won't you let us sleep?

586
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,950
What's going on?

587
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,300
Won't you let us sleep?

588
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
What should we do?

589
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,860
He asked for it.

590
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,830
You... You...

591
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,320
Blood.

592
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,620
What? This...

593
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,120
-This is...
-Mr. Li.

594
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:04,910
Mr. Li.

595
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,570
What happened?

596
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,080
Murder!

597
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,360
Murder!

598
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,750
Murder!

599
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,480
Murder!

600
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:12,920
You...

601
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,560
Murder!

602
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,500
Did you two do it?

603
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,390
He's not dead.

604
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:18,740
Carry him to the infirmary.

605
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,800
He's still alive?

606
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:20,800
This...

607
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,010
Come on.

608
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,760
Hang in there.

609
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,660
-Come on.
-Get out of the way.

610
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,230
One, two, three. Go.

611
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,490
-Go.
-Carry him.

612
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,240
Let's go.

613
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,960
Slowly.

614
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,120
Slowly.

615
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,810
Be careful.

616
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,690
Be careful.

617
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,380
Stop looking. Go back.

618
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,180
Where's my son?

619
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,580
Son?

620
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,650
Son.

621
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,180
Son, what happened to you?

622
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:02,890
Son.

623
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,190
Son.

624
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,130
I'm late. Son.

625
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,030
Young Master.

626
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,690
-Son.
-Young Master.

627
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,810
Open your eyes and look at me.

628
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,710
Open your eyes and look at me.

629
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,010
Young Master.

630
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,420
Father?

631
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,340
Why are you down here too?

632
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:25,640
I...

633
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,470
I...

634
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,050
Down where?

635
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,890
I thought I died.

636
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,300
What are you talking about?

637
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,210
It hurts.

638
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,700
Son, tell me

639
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,070
what happened.

640
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:47,960
Father.

641
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,760
Xiao Yu.

642
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,690
Xiao Yu.

643
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,970
Xiao Yu.

644
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:53,490
Xiao...

645
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,560
Kill him.

646
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,150
Okay.

647
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,070
Kill him.

648
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,740
Xiao Yu is a villain in the academy.

649
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,250
Okay.

650
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,080
Lie down.

651
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,450
Come on.

652
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,580
Come on.

653
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,030
The coming of age ceremony

654
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,930
is held at the temple gate.

655
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,970
The master wears a black cap,

656
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,330
court dress,

657
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,570
and belt,

658
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,740
with white Bixi,

659
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,070
sitting on the eastern side of the gate

660
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,360
and facing the west.

661
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,820
The subordinates wear the same dress as the master,

662
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,570
sitting in the western side of the gate.

663
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,170
A mat is placed to the west of the wood,

664
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,500
facing the west.

665
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,680
The diviner holds the alpine yarrow

666
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,260
and removes the tube lid,

667
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,660
holding the lid and the lower part of the tube

668
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,110
-and going forward to accept the master's order.
-Yueniang.

669
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,240
The officer is on the right side rear the master,

670
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,450
helping the master announce what the divination is about.

671
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,900
The diviner responds

672
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,010
and goes back to the mat from the right side.

673
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,630
Yueniang,

674
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,040
do you know what happened in the men's dorm last night?

675
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,720
No.

676
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,790
There was a ghost in the men's dorm last night.

677
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,380
I heard that Li Wenshu

678
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,730
was haunted by a female ghost.

679
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,410
Men's Academy was a mess.

680
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,150
But somehow,

681
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,810
he was beaten up by Mr. Xiao.

682
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,370
Yueniang, as you know,

683
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,400
Li Wenshu is arrogant and always bullies others

684
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,930
because of his father's power.

685
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,280
He got hurt because of Mr. Xiao.

686
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,540
If something happens to him,

687
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,620
do you think

688
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,770
he'll make it difficult for Mr. Xiao?

689
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,750
Sir. Father.

690
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:37,940
It was them.

691
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,450
Them.

692
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,420
Look.

693
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,960
Alright, sit down.

694
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,610
Xiao Yu.

695
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,570
Did you hurt Li Wenshu last night?

696
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,180
Yes.

697
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,810
And you are quite confident now.

698
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,100
Sir.

699
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,980
I did it for justice.

700
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,190
Last night, Li Wenshu was in our room and wouldn't leave.

701
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,200
He attacked Zhou Ji first.

702
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:09,530
I just...

703
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,090
Is that true?

704
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,690
Mr. Zhang,

705
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,430
it's true.

706
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,410
Last night...

707
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,110
Do you know what happened?

708
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,450
Mr. Li said there was a female ghost in our room.

709
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,380
Mr. Li was beaten by Mr. Xiao.

710
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,980
So he wanted to go in and take a look.

711
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,170
I stopped him.

712
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,990
What happened?

713
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:25,730
So he pushed me.

714
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,380
He can't take a look?

715
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,310
Yes.

716
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,020
He...

717
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,760
He can't take a look.

718
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,410
It's a private place.

719
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,370
He can't take a look even if he wants to.

720
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,460
I'm the dorm supervisor. I can't take a look?

721
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,770
If you're innocent,

722
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,790
why can't I take a look?

723
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:38,930
Sir.

724
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,430
Last night, I saw the guy who pretended to be a ghost

725
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,680
running out from their room.

726
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,120
Then they caught me.

727
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,720
That's why the guy escaped.

728
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,850
What are you talking about?

729
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,850
I think Mr. Li is up to something.

730
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,670
Nonsense!

731
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,020
Sit.

732
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,100
Zhou Ji.

733
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,330
I always think highly of you for your moral character

734
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,400
and your knowledge.

735
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,430
Tell me the truth.

736
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,250
I won't punish you severely.

737
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,200
Mr. Zhang.

738
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,000
I didn't see anyone

739
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,370
going out from our room.

740
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,210
You...

741
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,410
Mr. Zhang.

742
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,740
They can't deny

743
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,780
my son's wounds, right?

744
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,800
How can parents be relieved

745
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,530
if there are these kind of students in the academy?

746
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,950
Mr. Zhang. Please discipline them strictly.

747
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,350
He who first offends first complains.

748
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,370
Father! Sir!

749
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,440
Look at him, Mr. Zhang.

750
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:34,800
Look at him.

751
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,410
I think with students like your son in the academy,

752
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,000
the parents of other students

753
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,940
won't be relieved.

754
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:39,850
How dare you!

755
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,630
You hurt someone.

756
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,440
I can fire you.

757
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:44,810
Fire...

758
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,330
I just beat a villain.

759
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,030
You are going to punish me

760
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:49,850
instead of punishing him?

761
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,530
You still don't repent?

762
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,320
Sir.

763
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,400
They... They are

764
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,380
protecting the guy who pretended to be a ghost.

765
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,470
Xiao Yu.

766
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,720
I'm giving you one more chance.

767
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,350
Let me ask you.

768
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,870
Who is the person who disguised as a ghost?

769
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,350
I've never seen anyone disguising as a female ghost.

770
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:20,460
Sir.

771
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,070
They are definitely the accomplices of the female ghost.

772
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,239
When I'm talking,

773
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,370
my head hurts.

774
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,480
Sit down. Son.

775
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,679
Sit. Sit.

776
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:30,940
We'll investigate

777
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,989
the female ghost thing later.

778
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,699
Xiao Yu.

779
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,650
You hurt someone.

780
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,900
And you're smooth-tongued.

781
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,610
If I don't punish you,

782
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,250
how can I make them convinced?

783
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:47,210
I hired Xiao Yu.

784
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,989
Even if he should be fired,

785
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,770
Men's Academy doesn't have the right to do it.

786
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,830
Li Wenshu is a student in Men's Academy.

787
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,500
Why can't I punish him?

788
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,010
Since we can't reach an agreement,

789
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,850
let's wait for Dean to come back.

790
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,570
Instead of waiting for Dean to come back,

791
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,830
the government office should take care of this.

792
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,940
Xiao Yu.

793
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,670
You hurt my son.

794
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,690
Arrest him first.

795
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,370
Interrogate him after Dean comes back.

796
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,260
And

797
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,720
ask your parents to come here.

798
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,630
I'd like to see

799
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,430
which family you are from and what makes you so arrogant.

800
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,560
No need.

801
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,850
I'll take the responsibility.

802
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,440
I'll leave.

803
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,880
Teaching Assistant Xiao.

804
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,100
Mr. Chen. I'll never forget

805
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,070
your kindness to me.

806
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,510
Get lost.

807
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,770
Mr. Xiao.

808
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,570
Are you really leaving like this?

809
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,670
Why don't we wait for Dean to come back and...

810
00:35:59,370 --> 00:35:59,810
and...

811
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,090
Senior Song.

812
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,170
Why...

813
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,890
Why are you doing this?

814
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,190
Mr. Xiao.

815
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,660
Lady Yan, you came too.

816
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,340
Mr. Xiao.

817
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,390
Li Shancai is just a county magistrate.

818
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,350
Who does he think he is?

819
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,780
I'll ask my father to come here.

820
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,840
Let's see who dares to touch you.

821
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,670
Don't be angry, Lady Yan.

822
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,730
People should be punished if they make mistakes.

823
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:32,920
That's reasonable.

824
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,210
He just lost some blood.

825
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,600
Is it necessary to punish you so severely?

826
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,690
Mr. Xiao,

827
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,930
can you stay?

828
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,720
We had a deal

829
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,080
to enjoy the moon together in the mountain tonight.

830
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,020
That's right.

831
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,870
Right.

832
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,100
We planned

833
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,680
to enjoy the moon together tonight.

834
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,270
It seems I can't go.

835
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,660
Mr. Xiao.

836
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,790
Enough.

837
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,410
It's not like I'm going to die.

838
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
We can make an appointment later.

839
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:15,750
Goodbye.

840
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,670
Mr. Xiao.

841
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,560
Xiao Yu.

842
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,160
Why didn't you tell them it was me?

843
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,090
Miss Zhu pretended to be a ghost to scare people.

844
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,670
Do you want me to tell them

845
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,880
and make the Song family a joke in the academy?

846
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,480
Besides,

847
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,040
telling on you is not what a gentleman should do.

848
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,290
Betraying friends is not my thing.

849
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,450
Friends?

850
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:56,940
Aren't we

851
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,790
friends?

852
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,790
We...

853
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,170
Forget it then.

854
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,380
I

855
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,130
am going to leave Yiyang Academy.

856
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,090
Isn't this what you wanted from the beginning?
