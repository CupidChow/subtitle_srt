[Episode 4]

4
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,190
Are you looking for this?

5
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,110
Mr. Xiao,

6
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,350
this is the spice for you.

7
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,700
Can you give it back to me?

8
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,270
I didn't expect you to be so dishonest.

9
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,229
If you had given it to me earlier,

10
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,240
I wouldn't have come back.

11
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,110
You think you are reasonable?

12
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,270
I've already let you go.

13
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,030
Give it back to me.

14
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,070
Give it back!

15
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,380
Senior Song.

16
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,770
It's getting late.

17
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,080
Go back early.

18
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,820
It's not safe for a woman to be outside.

19
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,310
Thank you, Senior Song.

20
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,570
Then I'll leave you alone, Mr. Xiao.

21
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,310
Let's wait and see.

22
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,310
Today, you are going to participate in

23
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,970
the most difficult archery competition in the history of the academy.

24
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,270
Dean knows you noblemen

25
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,390
only play

26
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,360
with fancy bows every day.

27
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,790
So today,

28
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,380
he replaced the bows with black bows.

29
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,070
Black bows?

30
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,310
Yiyang Academy

31
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,870
will never take in

32
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,640
weak students without any strength.

33
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,630
If you can't draw the bow,

34
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,270
get lost as soon as possible.

35
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:53,870
Bro,

36
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,860
have you used this kind of bow before?

37
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:57,980
No.

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,160
Only the Imperial Guards have black bows.

39
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,510
Ordinary people haven't even seen it before.

40
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,230
Who will be the first?

41
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,360
How about you?

42
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,100
Me.

43
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:19,720
Okay.

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,710
I'm Li Wenshu. I'm willing to give it a try.

45
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,110
Okay.

46
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,670
Show me what you've got.

47
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,780
If your arrow can't hit the target,

48
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,910
you can't be admitted to Yiyang Academy

49
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,010
even if you are the No. 1 in the liberal arts exam.

50
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,860
Applaud!

51
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,550
Bravo! Bravo!

52
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:51,760
Great!

53
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,750
Great!

54
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,720
Amazing!

55
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,710
Good.

56
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,690
I'm not looking at the target

57
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,380
when I release the arrow.

58
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,480
Great. Applaud.

59
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,760
Li Wenshu. Impressive.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,510
If you are admitted to Yiyang Academy,

61
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,310
I will take you as my last disciple.

62
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,589
It's my honor.

63
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,150
You may leave.

64
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,830
Nice archery skills.

65
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,500
Next one.

66
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm Zhou Ji.

67
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,400
Instructor Shen. Please enlighten me.

68
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:40,800
Come on.

69
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,950
Yes.

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,060
Not bad.

71
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,200
It's not bad.

72
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,210
He was lucky.

73
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,950
These young masters are so handsome.

74
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,790
Yes.

75
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,070
Zhou Ji is the most handsome man in Yiyang.

76
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,150
Look at Zhou Ji.

77
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,470
He's conspicuous in the crowd.

78
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,670
You may leave.

79
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,390
Great.

80
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,670
The exam begins.

81
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
Practice hard.

82
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,510
The bow is so tough.

83
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,750
I've never drawn it before.

84
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,510
Mr. Xiao, look.

85
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,990
All of my three arrows hit the target.

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,120
Next one.

87
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,180
Young man.

88
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,320
I have a suggestion for you.

89
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,260
Don't close your eyes.

90
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,470
Let me help you get knocked out.

91
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,900
-Who did this?
-I...

92
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,860
Instructor.

93
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,320
Listen... Listen to me.

94
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,050
Let me explain.

95
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,830
I didn't mean it.

96
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,600
I didn't...

97
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,460
You made a good shot!

98
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,240
I've been practicing martial arts for decades.

99
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,500
I've never seen

100
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,260
such a bold archer like you.

101
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,910
What's your name?

102
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,560
I'll make you my last disciple.

103
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,100
I'm... Xiao Yu.

104
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,200
That's a good name.

105
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,830
Xiao Yu.

106
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,520
Nice.

107
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,950
Nice.

108
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,780
That's a good name.

109
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,790
Nice.

110
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,480
I...

111
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,160
I...

112
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,110
Ouch.

113
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,560
They all are good archers.

114
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,010
Hurry up.

115
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,670
We are going to be late for Mr. Chen's class.

116
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,280
Mr. Zhou is so handsome.

117
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,309
We're going to be late.

118
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,240
Why are you still chatting?

119
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,679
Let's go.

120
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,800
How is the scenery up there?

121
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,340
What are you doing here?

122
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,680
In terms of the Six Arts,

123
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,600
I'm bad at equestrianism and archery.

124
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
Without your help,

125
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,230
I would have missed the target.

126
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,120
Thanks to you,

127
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,400
I've been admitted to the academy.

128
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,620
I...

129
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,220
I...

130
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,170
I'm in a good mood.

131
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,880
I'll think about it.

132
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,820
I won't tell Uncle Song about this.

133
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,440
Wait.

134
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,760
I suddenly remembered

135
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,390
you kept causing me trouble.

136
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,250
You say one thing but do another.

137
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,370
I really want to tell Uncle Song

138
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,120
about what you did.

139
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,630
Don't you dare tell him.

140
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,320
I dare.

141
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,010
What?

142
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:51,960
Are you scared?

143
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,240
You should have realized this earlier.

144
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,440
If you gave me the letter earlier,

145
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
nothing would happen, right?

146
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,080
Come down.

147
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,310
Let's talk.

148
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,680
No.

149
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,240
We have nothing to talk about.

150
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,090
Are you stuck there?

151
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,920
Who said that?

152
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,710
I'm enjoying the moon up here.

153
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:22,560
No.

154
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,840
I'm enjoying the sun.

155
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,320
The scenery is great.

156
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,840
You really don't need my help?

157
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,640
Listen.

158
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,780
It's easy for me to climb down if I want to.

159
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,930
Look at my...

160
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,040
Mr. Xiao.

161
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,910
What are you doing?

162
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,510
Yueniang.

163
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,100
What are you two doing here?

164
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,840
-I just came out from the shooting range.
-Mr. Xiao was lost.

165
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,590
-Instructor Shen said he wanted to see me.
-I met him.

166
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,160
-I was showing him the way.
-She came to tell me.

167
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,210
What are you talking about?

168
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,280
-Instructor Shen wants to see Mr. Xiao.
-I got lost after coming out from the shooting range.

169
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,480
-Then she told me
-Then I told him

170
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,740
-and showed me the way.
-and showed him the way.

171
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,440
Why does it sound so strange?

172
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,040
Qinruo.

173
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,640
I'll explain to you later.

174
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,200
Well...

175
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,480
We're going to be late.

176
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,760
Let's go to class first.

177
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,480
Hurry up. Let's go.

178
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,450
We're going to be late.

179
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:50,920
Let's go.

180
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,760
We're going to be late.

181
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,270
What about Mr. Xiao?

182
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,480
Don't worry.

183
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,640
He doesn't need to go to class.

184
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,990
I have climbed every tree in this academy.

185
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,300
Where is my letter?

186
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,850
[Jixian Inn]

187
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,960
I was careless again.

188
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,840
Why are you screaming, Mr. Xiao?

189
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,120
Nothing.

190
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,160
I left something important at home.

191
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,710
I can't find it.

192
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,530
Is there anything I can help you with?

193
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,350
Miss Zhu is so cunning.

194
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,040
What?

195
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,190
I said nothing.

196
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,330
Mr. Zhou, don't worry.

197
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,550
By the way, Mr. Zhou,

198
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,190
are you familiar with Miss Zhu?

199
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,800
Mr. Xiao, you know this.

200
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,320
My relationship with her

201
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,630
is everything that you didn't allow me to say that day.

202
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,820
Then there is nothing else.

203
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,390
Why did you ask that?

204
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,030
I also want to ask you

205
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,340
why this person is so special.

206
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,860
Special?

207
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,700
What's so special about her?

208
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,520
She's

209
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,410
very annoying.

210
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,920
Considering Mr. Zhang's pace,

211
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,270
it will take at least about 10 minutes to make a round trip.

212
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,650
There's plenty of time.

213
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,810
Mr. Zhang hasn't marked it yet.

214
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,920
Xiao Yu.

215
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,010
God is not on your side.

216
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:07,860
Don't blame me.

217
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,180
I didn't know Xiao Yu's handwriting is pretty good.

218
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,240
It's said that a man's handwriting reflects his character.

219
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,830
It seems that is not true.

220
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,020
Although he's annoying,

221
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,200
if I change it,

222
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,720
I will destroy his future.

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,000
But he's really annoying.

224
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,060
He even threatened me.

225
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:47,980
But...

226
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,980
Forget it.

227
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,630
This is not something a decent person should do.

228
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,180
If I do that,

229
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,240
I don't deserve to be a daughter of the Song family.

230
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,370
Oh no!

231
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,720
This...

232
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,520
Good morning, Mr. Zhang.

233
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm sorry, Xiao Yu.

234
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,710
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

235
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,680
I'm sorry. Sorry.

236
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,140
Sorry. Sorry.

237
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,350
-You are?
-Sir.

238
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,110
Is my young master here?

239
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,600
Uncle Hu?

240
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,200
Young Master.

241
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,980
You finally...

242
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,000
I finally found you, Young Master.

243
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,600
You finally came back.

244
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,820
Sir. Thank you for taking care of my young master these days.

245
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,730
I've helped extend your stay

246
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,010
to express my gratitude.

247
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I'm flattered.

248
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,050
It's just a piece of cake.

249
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,500
Mr. Zhou,

250
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,720
don't stand on ceremony.

251
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,320
Uncle Hu.

252
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,270
Come with me.

253
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,760
Uncle Hu.

254
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,339
Do you know that you forgot to give me money?

255
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,329
I left in a hurry.

256
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,160
I really left in a hurry.

257
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:23,800
I...

258
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,600
Right.

259
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,250
How did you know I'm here?

260
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,880
He told me.

261
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,690
Young Master.

262
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,170
I booked a room for you next door.

263
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,580
Let me take your luggage there.

264
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,090
Okay.

265
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,320
Mr. Zhou,

266
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,610
let's have a drink together

267
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,930
after the room is ready.

268
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,800
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

269
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,160
I can't handle alcohol.

270
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,080
A talented man like you can't handle alcohol?

271
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,280
Throughout history, talented individuals often have a romantic disposition.

272
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,160
You're too sober.

273
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,290
I'm not good at drinking.

274
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,450
I'm afraid

275
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,250
I can't have fun with you.

276
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,570
Okay.

277
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,520
I won't force you then.

278
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,790
Mr. Zhou. Rest early.

279
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,550
See you tomorrow.

280
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,490
Mr. Xiao.

281
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,700
If you invite me to drink tea,

282
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,600
I can accompany you.

283
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,350
Sure.

284
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,360
Tomorrow.

285
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,950
Uncle Hu.

286
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,260
The wine you brought back tastes great.

287
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,050
Hurry.

288
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,710
Come and try it.

289
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,450
Young Master.

290
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,450
I'm sorry for making it inconvenient for you these days.

291
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,290
Forget it.

292
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,230
Don't do it again.

293
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,040
By the way,

294
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,300
did you find anything this time?

295
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,330
The engagement

296
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,990
was decided when Song Zhu was very young.

297
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,230
But after Song Xu established the academy,

298
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,790
the two families became not very close.

299
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,710
It seems that Song Xu

300
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,210
has deliberately kept a distance from our family.

301
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,100
After all, the Xiao family has someone in the imperial court.

302
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,290
About the engagement,

303
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,260
the two families have reached a consensus in recent years.

304
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,830
They never mentioned it again.

305
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,250
So it's an arranged child betrothal.

306
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,610
I can't ruin their happiness.

307
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,800
But if I don't ruin it,

308
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,730
is it good

309
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,660
or bad for her?

310
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,070
The engagement is just a verbal promise.

311
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,530
There is no formal letter.

312
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,520
Considering the current situation,

313
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,680
even if Xiao Chuanzhong wants to write a formal letter,

314
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,540
I'm afraid it will be too late.

315
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,460
I'm just worried that if Song Xu sees you,

316
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,940
he will mention the engagement again.

317
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,300
Then I should get what I want

318
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,650
before he writes a formal letter.

319
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,370
The list will be released tomorrow.

320
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,570
If you are admitted,

321
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,050
it will be easier for us to take actions in the future.

322
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,210
Young Master, a toast to you.

323
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,710
It's easy.

324
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:43,840
Let's go.

325
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,170
Let's go take a look at the list together.

326
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,740
Lady Yan has left.

327
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,850
Hurry up.

328
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,350
Xiaoyue.

329
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,360
Hurry up. Let's go.

330
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,410
What's the hurry?

331
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,930
Let's go.

332
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:56,800
Lady Zhao.

333
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,600
They all have left.

334
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,720
Lady Zhao.

335
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,610
Are you going to take a look at the list too?

336
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,740
Everyone else is interested.

337
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,890
I think I should join them.

338
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,780
What about you, Miss Zhu?

339
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,970
I'm going too.

340
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,910
I think

341
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,040
the No. 1 must be Mr. Zhou.

342
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,830
I made it!

343
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,470
Me too.

344
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,600
Me too.

345
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:23,810
Mr. Zhou.

346
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,930
It's still early in the morning. Aren't you sleepy?

347
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,110
Actually,

348
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,450
I didn't sleep last night.

349
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,130
So I might as well come to take a look at the list early.

350
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,410
Mr. Zhou.

351
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,530
It's quite easy for you

352
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,520
to be admitted to Yiyang Academy.

353
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:38,440
Mr. Xiao,

354
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,650
let's go take a look at the list first.

355
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:44,570
Mr. Xiao.

356
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,450
Let's go.

357
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,070
Uncle Hu.

358
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,200
You go take a look for me.

359
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,390
Mr. Xiao,

360
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,730
why won't you go take a look personally?

361
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:52,970
I...

362
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,140
There are too many people.

363
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,270
It's... a bit crowded.

364
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,130
Crowded?

365
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,760
Mr. Xiao,

366
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,760
you have to take a look at the list personally

367
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,450
to be sure.

368
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,170
No, no, no.

369
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,170
-Well.
-Come on.

370
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:13,820
Well.

371
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,650
Let me help you find your name.

372
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,580
Mr. Zhou. Well.

373
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,280
I...

374
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,860
Actually...

375
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,960
Excuse me.

376
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,210
Thank you.

377
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:20,860
It's hard to find my name too.

378
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,590
Excuse me.

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,320
One person.

381
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,430
Two people.

382
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,570
I didn't make it?

383
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,530
Mr. Xiao, calm down.

384
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,410
Let's keep looking.

385
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,330
I didn't...

386
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,330
Get out of the way!

387
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,000
Move!

388
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,730
Move!

389
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,170
Get out of the way!

390
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,490
Who are you?

391
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,330
Who is this?

392
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:40,800
Get out of the way!

393
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,510
Shut up!

394
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,330
Why are you so mean?

395
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,210
It's just a list.

396
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:45,940
Is it necessary to make a big scene?

397
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,110
Such a big scene.

398
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,930
If he is not making such a big scene,

399
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,450
how can he show that he's the son of the county magistrate?

400
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
It's not that difficult

401
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,970
to be admitted to legendary Yiyang Academy.

402
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,310
So arrogant.

403
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,340
Are you done?

404
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,170
What can I do for you?

405
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,530
You're blocking my view.

406
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,780
Who are you?

407
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,960
How dare you talk to our young master like that?

408
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,580
Attitude. Attitude.

409
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,400
Go ahead.

410
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:17,740
Oh, right.

411
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,570
If you still can't see next time,

412
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,500
jump up.

413
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,750
Eat more when you have nothing to do.

414
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,450
It can help you grow taller.

415
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:23,530
Let's go.

416
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,840
Let's go.

417
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,450
Young Master.

418
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,160
-Mr. Xiao. Mr. Xiao.
-Young Master.

419
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,250
Mr. Xiao.

420
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,170
Maybe something went wrong.

421
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:32,720
Mr. Zhou,

422
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:33,990
go back first.

423
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,660
I suddenly remember something.

424
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,540
Young Master.

425
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,320
Where are you going?

426
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,020
Wait for me here.

427
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,360
Mr. Xiao.

428
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,530
Are you Senior Qinruo?

429
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,930
Mr. Xiao, you remember my name?

430
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,660
Are you here for me?

431
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,030
No.

432
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,710
I...

433
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,090
I want to ask

434
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,610
where the teacher who marked the exam papers is.

435
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,170
Over there.

436
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:06,730
Thank you.

437
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,890
Why did he leave?

438
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:14,570
Lady Yan.

439
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,570
Is that Mr. Xiao?

440
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,740
Where is he going?

441
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,050
Why was he with Lady Yan?

442
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,110
-I don't know.
-What did you tell him?

443
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,720
Nothing.

444
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,850
Nothing.

445
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,450
Aren't we going to take a look at the list?

446
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,130
Let's go.

447
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,380
Right.

448
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,270
Yes. Take a look at the list.

449
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,370
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

450
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,200
Hurry up.

451
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,430
Let's go. Stop looking.

452
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,350
Zhou Ji is the No. 1.

453
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,560
I was right about him.

454
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:48,850
Qinruo.

455
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:49,740
Whose name are you looking for?

456
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,690
Let me help you.

457
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,380
No wonder he was so cold.

458
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:00,890
Yueniang.

459
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,250
Come.

460
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,410
Isn't Yiyang Academy founded by your family?

461
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,710
Help me find out

462
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,820
why Mr. Xiao didn't make it.

463
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,100
It's inappropriate.

464
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,210
Why?

465
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,110
Only you.

466
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,160
No one else is more suitable than you.

467
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,290
It's appropriate.

468
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,650
It must be you.

469
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,360
Please help me.

470
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,310
You know my family has rules.

471
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,580
My father is strict.

472
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,990
I can't help you.

473
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:28,680
How about this?

474
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,050
I'll give you money.

475
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,670
Or I'll buy you whatever you want,

476
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,080
okay?

477
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,910
Yueniang.

478
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,790
Move.

479
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,670
Hurry!

480
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,080
Sir.

481
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,870
How dare you!

482
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,670
Sir, listen to me.

483
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,260
Move.

484
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,240
You are so rude.

485
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,210
Let me tell you.

486
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,090
Even if you get the first place,

487
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:48,960
Miss Zhu, what's going on?

488
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,480
-you won't be admitted to this academy.
-I don't know.

489
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,080
I just want you

490
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,150
to check the test paper again.

491
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,090
I didn't mean to offend you.

492
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,890
Respect your teachers and rules. Do you understand?

493
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,590
You are asking me to check the paper again.

494
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,290
That means you doubt my ability of marking papers.

495
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,640
No, that's not what I meant.

496
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,890
I don't care what you meant.

497
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,610
Do you think you can check the papers in the academy

498
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,340
just because you want to?

499
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,160
Go back. Go back.

500
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,010
Let's go.

501
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,130
Sir.

502
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,730
Close the door.

503
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,130
You two go back early too.

504
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,540
Leave now, Miss Zhu.

505
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,350
I made a big mistake.

506
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,960
[Yiyang Academy]

507
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,890
Since I can't go in decently,

508
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,830
don't blame me for doing this.

509
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:00,830
Who are you?

510
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,660
-Who are you?
-Young Master.

511
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,330
Uncle Hu?

512
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,740
Why are you here?

513
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,970
Young Master, I'm worried about you.

514
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,890
Considering the situation, I have no choice but to break in at night.

515
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,090
I'll come out as soon as I get it.

516
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,870
That's what I'm worried about.

517
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,270
Please think twice, Young Master.

518
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,970
Let's not rush it

519
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,180
and give it a further thought, okay?

520
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,410
I don't have time to wait any longer.

521
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,300
Do you want me to wait for the next year's exam?

522
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,910
You want to stop me?

523
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,020
I dare not.

524
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,320
Then why are you standing in my way?

525
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,820
Do you know the academy's layout?

526
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,090
No.

527
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,940
Do you know where it is hidden?

528
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:34,910
No.

529
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,470
So please think twice.

530
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,650
What if I insist?

531
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,950
Please think about the people behind you.

532
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,000
From today on,

533
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,580
you are Xiao Yu.

534
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,560
Young Master.

535
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,680
Let's go back.

536
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,460
Mr. Zhou, you are early.

537
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,340
Mr. Xiao.

538
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,550
I'm moving to Yiyang Academy.

539
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,510
This painting is for you

540
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,260
as a souvenir.

541
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,820
I hope you accept it.

542
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,490
I wish you can be admitted to Yiyang Academy next year.

543
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,110
Mr. Zhou.

544
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:09,830
Wait a minute.

545
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,120
You need it more than me.

546
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,510
Study hard in the academy.

547
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,150
We agreed to drink tea together.

548
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,060
But we didn't make it happen.

549
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,290
Let's meet again when there is a chance.

550
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,120
Mr. Xiao,

551
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,710
you don't want to take the exam again?

552
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,290
Let's go.

553
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,100
Let me walk you out.

554
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,680
Let's go.

555
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,780
Junior Zhou.

556
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,290
Senior Song.

557
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,330
Miss Zhu.

558
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,390
What brings you here?

559
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,230
Mr. Xiao is still here?

560
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,390
Greetings, Senior Song.

561
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,130
Greetings, Junior Zhou.

562
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,320
Congratulations, Junior Zhou. You got the first place.

563
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,540
Today, I specially came here

564
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,540
to congratulate you.

565
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,120
I've prepared a carriage

566
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,450
to help you carry your luggage to the academy.

567
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,690
Does Yiyang Academy value etiquette so much?

568
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,220
You even prepared a carriage for the No. 1 student?

569
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,640
Why haven't I heard of it?

570
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,420
Mr. Xiao didn't make it.

571
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,000
I feel very sorry.

572
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,090
If you study harder in the future,

573
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,430
you can get the first place too.

574
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,450
And I can hire another carriage to pick you up.

575
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,700
I'll pass.

576
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,820
The exam of Yiyang Academy is too difficult.

577
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,140
Junior Zhou.

578
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,520
Have you packed all things?

579
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,780
Let's go.

580
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,140
Senior.

581
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,060
I can go by myself.

582
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,190
Don't bother.

583
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,130
Not at all.

584
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,550
It's the carriage that will carry you,

585
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,770
not me.

586
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,670
I've already hired a carriage.

587
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,750
If we don't use it,

588
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,410
it would be a waste.

589
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,510
Well.

590
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,760
Thank you.

591
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,590
This belongs to Junior Zhou, right?

592
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,290
Let me carry it.

593
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,060
-Mr. Xiao.
-Let's go.

594
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,690
Goodbye.

595
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,710
Mr. Zhou, take care.

596
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,860
Goodbye, Mr. Xiao.

597
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,880
According to their reaction,

598
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,120
they are hiding something.

599
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,380
Mr. Zhou, let me see you off.

600
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,570
What's the matter, Mr. Xiao?

601
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,940
I have something to discuss with Miss Zhu.

602
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,650
I'm not free today. Let's talk another day.

603
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,600
Then take it as doing me a favor today, okay?

604
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,550
Another day.

605
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,150
Today.

606
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,100
Another day.

607
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,620
Today.

608
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,410
-Another day.
-Today.

609
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,330
-Another day.
-Today.

610
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,480
-Another day.
-Today.

611
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,180
Senior.

612
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,850
How about letting me go alone?

613
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:22,900
Okay.

614
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,740
Mr. Zhou, take care.

615
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,760
Junior Zhou.

616
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,210
Senior.

617
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,310
Junior Zhou.

618
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,300
Senior.

619
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,450
Junior Zhou.

620
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,470
Xiao Yu.

621
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,620
What do you mean?

622
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,980
You ruined my plan several times.

623
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,830
What do you want?

624
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,830
I know you want to ride with Zhou Ji.

625
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,250
What are you going to do if it's true?

626
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,320
And what are you going to do if it's not true?

627
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,410
But don't forget

628
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,740
you are engaged.

629
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,980
You've mentioned the engagement several times.

630
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,620
It will make me think that you really want to marry me.

631
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,960
In terms of daydreaming,

632
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,030
Miss Zhu is good at it.

633
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,550
Miss Zhu, can we talk?

634
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,300
Sir. Miss.

635
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,490
These are our signature dishes.

636
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,700
Please taste them while they're hot.

637
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,050
You can try them.

638
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,750
It seems

639
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,120
you are still afraid of me.

640
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,490
Of course.

641
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,580
I'm proposing a toast to you

642
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,850
to show my sincerity.

643
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,370
Just get to the point.

644
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,100
I'll go back if there's nothing else.

645
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,200
Does my failure in the exam

646
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,280
have something to do with you?

647
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,300
No.

648
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,739
Mr. Xiao, if you have evidence,

649
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,699
you can just show me.

650
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,469
Then why did you repeatedly try to stop me

651
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,400
since we made a deal?

652
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,780
Why did you do that?

653
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,380
When did we make a deal?

654
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,130
As expected,

655
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,139
you're really a person who doesn't keep your promises.

656
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:27,820
In that case,

657
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,120
you won't return the letter to me, right?

658
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:32,760
He failed.

659
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,830
Why should I be afraid of him?

660
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:37,969
What letter?

661
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,719
I've never seen any letter.

662
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,250
Miss Zhu.

663
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,540
If this is your attitude,

664
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,860
there is nothing to talk about.

665
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,590
Goodbye.

666
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,929
You asked me to send a letter to my father.

667
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,520
I didn't know what to write.

668
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,670
But now I have some ideas.

669
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,930
You've figured it out?

670
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,900
You should have realized it earlier.

671
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,390
And there wouldn't have been so much trouble.

672
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,970
I plan to tell my father

673
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,200
that you are the gentlest, most virtuous,

674
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,210
well-educated, polite,

675
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,520
and honest person I've ever seen.

676
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,100
I like you very much.

677
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,730
I hope our wedding can be arranged soon.

678
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:20,640
You...

679
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,450
What's wrong with you?

680
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,640
What do you want?

681
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,200
I want to know why you wouldn't let me get admitted.

682
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:28,940
Fine.

683
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,320
You want to know the truth?

684
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,550
Let me tell you.

685
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,290
I just don't want to marry you.

686
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,780
You don't want to marry me.

687
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,240
What does it have to do with my admission?

688
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,890
The Song family has a rule.

689
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,900
The daughters of the Song family

690
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,330
must marry the students of Song's Academy.

691
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,200
If you fail now,

692
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,110
the engagement can be suspended temporarily.

693
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,050
Understand?

694
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,700
You have this kind of family rule?

695
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,240
So

696
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,850
since the list has been released,

697
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,740
there is nothing you can do.

698
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,850
You should cancel the engagement as soon as possible.

699
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,910
At least you can be dignified.

700
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,700
Let me ask you.

701
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,980
Why do you want to cancel the engagement so much?

702
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,850
I told you.

703
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,840
I hate you. I hate you very much.

704
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,610
And what does it have to do with this engagement?

705
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,260
What's wrong with you?

706
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,580
Let me sort it out

707
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,050
and analyze it for you.

708
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,700
Even if I failed this year,

709
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,090
I can take the exam next year.

710
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,040
I can take the exam the year after next.

711
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,970
I can keep taking the exam

712
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,180
until I get admitted.

713
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,820
You are trying to provoke me, right?

714
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,580
No.

715
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,950
I just want to tell you

716
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,670
I just want to see Mr. Song.

717
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,320
Give the letter back to me.

718
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,670
And the engagement won't be a problem.

719
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:38,850
Listen.

720
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:39,810
No way.

721
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,560
I've burned the letter.

722
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,420
Don't even think about seeing my father.

723
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,310
What?

724
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,690
You heard it right.

725
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,850
I've burned the letter.

726
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,020
Don't even think about seeing my father.

727
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,100
Song Zhu, are you a human?

728
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,680
Ask yourself, are you a human?

729
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,520
I've never seen a woman like you.

730
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,930
Listen.

731
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,760
If you don't cancel the engagement,

732
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,240
you will marry someone like me.

733
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:09,860
Young Master,

734
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,100
you can't drink anymore.

735
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,310
You've had enough today.

736
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:12,910
Young Master.

737
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,420
Mad woman.

738
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,270
Young Master.

739
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,000
Mad woman!

740
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,470
She is a mad woman.

741
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,340
Listen.

742
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,040
I don't care if the engagement is canceled.

743
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,260
Young Master.

744
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,920
It's useless to scold her now.

745
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,410
What is done cannot be undone.

746
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,830
Let's think of another way, okay?

747
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,340
Uncle Hu.

748
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,460
You didn't do a good job.

749
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,810
Song Zhu

750
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,570
is such a mad woman.

751
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,380
How could you miss that information?

752
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,950
Young Master.

753
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,440
I asked about every one of the Song family.

754
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,100
Song Li, the eldest son of the Song family, has been a talented man since childhood.

755
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,160
He was given the Jinshi degree when he was under 20.

756
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,740
Song Ling, the eldest daughter of the Song family, is very smart.

757
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,770
Stop. Stop.

758
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,210
Song Zhu.

759
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,470
Song Zhu...

760
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,030
I also asked about

761
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,660
Song Zhu.

762
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,630
What did you find out?

763
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,020
She's from Yiyang.

764
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,260
That's all?

765
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,230
That's all.

766
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,060
That's everything

767
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,280
the person who sent me the message told me.

768
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:21,990
I...

769
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,790
I don't need you to ask about that.

770
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,000
Come on.

771
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:26,820
Young Master.

772
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,030
Young Master, stop drinking.

773
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:28,850
Young Master.

774
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,460
Gosh!

775
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,230
I'm telling you.

776
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,640
I met the only weird person

777
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,230
in the Song family.

778
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,630
I'm telling you.

779
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,360
Whoever will marry Song Zhu

780
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,380
will be in big trouble.

781
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,490
I wonder how many bad things

782
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,910
Xiao Yu did in his previous life

783
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,440
so that he will be punished like this in this life.

784
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,580
Young Master.

785
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,190
This is not our business.

786
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Poor thing.

787
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,570
Don't worry about others, okay?

788
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,330
I'm worried about myself.

789
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,390
By the way,

790
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,070
Uncle Hu,

791
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,480
Mr. Song

792
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,680
will come out soon, right?

793
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,100
Help me prepare some gifts.

794
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,050
Young Master, you plan to

795
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,440
visit Mr. Song?

796
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,770
We don't have the letter.

797
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,830
And you failed to be admitted to the academy.

798
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,700
That's why I can't just sit and do nothing.

799
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:46,230
Song Zhu blocked my way.

800
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:47,960
I have to try something else.

801
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,580
Song Zhu.

802
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,550
Let's wait and see.

803
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,790
Dean.

804
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,160
Come in.

805
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,370
Dean.

806
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,230
You came out?

807
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:24,880
Yes.

808
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,580
Come on. Have a seat.

809
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,110
Songzhi,

810
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,370
during my meditation,

811
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,450
thank you for handling the exam thing.

812
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,870
Not at all. Dean.

813
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,580
Every year at this time, I look forward to

814
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,300
discussing good essays

815
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,510
and talking about the past and present

816
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,250
and the world with you.

817
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,680
This is my honor.

818
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,970
Why would I feel tired?

819
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,740
Is there anyone who impressed you this year?

820
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,680
There are

821
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,490
more than 10 students who wrote good essays.

822
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,660
Although most of them are ambitious,

823
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,710
they are a little unrealistic.

824
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,020
This is...

825
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,260
This essay is indeed well-written.

826
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,830
But I don't know why the ink was spilt on it.

827
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:32,330
[Student: Xiao Yu]

828
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,080
Xiao Yu.
