1
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,770
Your Majesty, did you drink wine again today?

2
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,570
Oh, my Chief Imperial Consort.

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,040
I'm not in the mood for your nagging.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,150
Your Majesty.

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,180
But seeing my Chief Imperial Consort

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,480
makes my heart feel lighter.

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,020
Have you come, Your Majesty?

8
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,810
So it was him?

9
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,130
He may have lost, but he fought a force with 20,000 with only 3,000 men.

10
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,800
But he lost.

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,020
He is a brave warrior. It's my fault for not sending him reinforcements.

12
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,460
But this man...

13
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,420
made a huge mistake.

14
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,910
A mistake?

15
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,510
This guy...

16
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,060
This guy... made my wine taste bad.

17
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,600
How dare you ruin the emperor's mood?

18
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,200
Of course you deserve to die, don't you?

19
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,240
Isn't that true, Chief Imperial Consort?

20
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,380
Your Majesty!

21
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,800
Please... Please...

22
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,140
Please let me live.

23
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,780
El Temür's puppet.

24
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,670
Only a figurehead emperor.

25
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,530
Idiot moron.

26
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,720
How dare you mock your emperor?

27
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,300
Your Majesty?

28
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,750
You called me El Temür's puppet?

29
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,710
Your Majesty.

30
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,220
I will kill you all! I will kill you all and

31
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,060
and shut your disloyal mouths!

32
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,290
Your Majesty! You must not!

33
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,160
Out of my way.

34
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,770
Didn't you hear them mocking me?

35
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,250
Didn't they just mock me and call me El Temür's puppet?

36
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,350
They have disrespected me!

37
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,040
Your Majesty! Please come to your senses.

38
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,490
I told you to get out of my way.

39
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,590
Your Majesty!!

40
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,800
Prime Minister, even you...

41
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,130
Do you find me ridiculous, too?

42
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,180
You don't care about my imperial commands?

43
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,850
Do you think I can't kill you?

44
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,400
- Uncle.
- Don't interfere.

45
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,910
Your Majesty, if you will come to your senses by beheading me,

46
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,900
I am happy to give my life to you.

47
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,160
Out of my way.

48
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,460
And if I don't?

49
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,980
Out of my way, Bayan!

50
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,320
It's Yang.

51
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,390
Yang?

52
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,970
Yes, Your Majesty. It's Yang.

53
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,770
Yang...

54
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,320
Yang.

55
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,220
Are you hearing voices again?

56
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,030
Yang...

57
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,420
No.

58
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,160
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

59
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,760
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

60
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,480
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

61
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,810
Your Majesty!

62
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,970
What is wrong with me

63
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,220
these days?

64
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,180
Please order the soldiers at war to return home.

65
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:58,430
But if I stop now, I will be branded a failure for the rest of my life.

66
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:04,880
No one will think of you that way.

67
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,370
I no longer want to become a subject of mockery.

68
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,460
For no one.

69
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:18,910
Then please promise me one thing.

70
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,740
You must not drink anymore.

71
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,210
All right, I will do that.

72
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:31,340
I will never drink wine again.

73
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,660
Your Majesty,

74
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,820
are you unhappy with me for some reason?

75
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:51,250
Your gaze, as you look at me, is not the same as it was before.

76
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:59,350
If you are unsatisfied with something about me, please tell me.

77
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,850
I am asking, just in case...

78
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,290
are you hiding something from me...

79
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,520
Why did you stop speaking?

80
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,920
No, nothing at all.

81
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,330
Your Majesty.

82
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:27,600
You are the only one in the world who can support me.

83
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,210
Only you, Yang.

84
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,020
Only you.

85
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,830
My Yang.

86
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,330
After working on driving them apart for five years,

87
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,950
shouldn't the emperor have cast out the Chief Imperial Consort by now?

88
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,690
But how can we hear nothing about it?

89
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,340
And what is that, that you look so serious?

90
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,420
It's a report from our spies in Ilkhanate.

91
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,800
Goryeo is selling sulfur and saltpeter to Ilkhanate?

92
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,040
Wang Yoo is more than capable of such treachery.

93
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,750
When will you meet with Court Lady Yeon?

94
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,960
Tomorrow is the day she runs errands at the empress's private home.

95
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,960
When you see her tomorrow, tell her to also bring Court Lady Seo out, too.

96
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,400
Are you going to meet with Prince Maha, finally?

97
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,430
I will give this spy report to Empress Dowager.

98
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,340
Why to Empress Dowager instead of the emperor?

99
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,110
Empress Dowager is raising Maha, so shouldn't we lend her strength?

100
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,000
But will Empress Dowager step up for us?

101
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,020
I know that woman's ambition very well.

102
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,660
There is no way she will only remain in the background.

103
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,290
But shouldn't we notify the leader?

104
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,370
Send him a message.

105
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,500
I understand.

106
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,490
Il-il-bool-nyeom-seon.

107
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,530
Je-ak-gae-ja-gi.

108
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,320
What does that mean?

109
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,080
"If you go even one day without thinking of good,

110
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,710
all evil will happen naturally."

111
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,320
That is what Zhuangzi wrote.

112
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,960
Try reading some more, Imperial Prince.

113
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,390
Jong-shin-haeng-seon, Seon-yoo-bu-jok,

114
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,620
Il-il-haeng-ak, Ak-ja-yu-yeo.

115
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,830
"Even if you do good all your life, it is not enough good."

116
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,430
"And even if you do evil just one day, it is too much evil."

117
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,400
You are progressing so well in your studies.

118
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,700
When you are taught one thing, you learn ten.

119
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,490
Empress Dowager, I want to learn martial arts as well.

120
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,650
Imperial Prince, you can't do that.

121
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,280
Even if I become the emperor someday,

122
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,030
I will relieve my mother's grudge myself.

123
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,700
How can your words

124
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,540
sound so refreshing?

125
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,160
If he even just finds out that you are studying your letters,

126
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,650
His Majesty will be furious.

127
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,980
Please wait just a little longer.

128
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,270
Not every day will be cloudy.

129
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,740
Hurry and recite after me.

130
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,230
- "The colors of the sky and the earth."
- "The colors of the sky and the earth."

131
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,470
- "The distance between sky and earth is long."
- "The distance between sky and earth is long."

132
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,080
- "The sun sets in the west and the moon grows full, this is the order of things."
- "The sun sets ...

133
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
Are you sleepy already?

134
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,570
Yes.

135
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,600
Why do you doze off every time you read a book?

136
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,270
Mother, studying my letters is fun,

137
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,340
but I am sleepy.

138
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,100
How can you resemble your father so much?

139
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:29,290
Your Highness, it is time for the prince to visit with His Majesty.

140
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,620
I will return, Mother.

141
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,470
Looks like Prince Ayu is monopolizing His Majesty's love.

142
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,410
Ayu is happier to see Prince Maha, more than His Majesty.

143
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,980
I think he should keep his distance from Prince Maha now.

144
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,930
How are you, Imperial Father?

145
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,020
How are you, Imperial Father?

146
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,800
Come close to me, Prince Ayu.

147
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,270
Yes.

148
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,400
I heard you are learning the Thousand Character Classic recently. Try reciting them.

149
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,430
"Cheon" for sky, "Ji" for earth,

150
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,230
"Hyeon" for dark, "Hwang" for yellow,

151
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,900
"Jip" for roof, "Jip" for house,

152
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,670
and the next one...

153
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,230
Next one is... ?

154
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,330
This boy. Is that all you know so far?

155
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,850
Elder Brother is better than me at letters.

156
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,590
Maha is learning his letters?

157
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,520
Well... about that...

158
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,220
Emperor!

159
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,870
I taught him.

160
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,280
I told Prince Maha to learn his letters.

161
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,040
I told you to not learn your letters or martial arts.

162
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,190
- Did you forget what I told you?
- Emperor.

163
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,380
Why won't you answer me?

164
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,760
Why can't I?

165
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,590
I also commanded you to not ask the reason.

166
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:27,880
I want to know why I can't do what Ayu can do.

167
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,190
How insolent you are.

168
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,000
I won't receive visits from Maha for the time being.

169
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,020
So know that and leave now.

170
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

171
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,560
Your Highness, please come now.

172
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,970
Brother.

173
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,740
Please take Prince Ayu away as well.

174
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,630
Yes, Your Highness.

175
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,520
Emperor! How can you be so cold-hearted?

176
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,190
Do you really not know

177
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,040
why I am doing this?

178
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,600
Yes, El Temür did this to you, too.

179
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,910
He forbid you from learning your letters or martial arts.

180
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,430
So you are now doing exactly what El Temür did.

181
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,290
What El Temür did?

182
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,720
You're the one actually acting like him.

183
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,240
What nonsense are you saying?

184
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,450
Do you think I don't know why you have Maha in your clutches?

185
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,830
To make him the emperor

186
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,180
and rule this kingdom yourself, of course.

187
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,000
Just like how El Temür used me as his puppet.

188
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,200
Your words are excessive.

189
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,960
You participated in Danashiri's death as well.

190
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,220
So, what else could be the reason you are coddling Maha now?

191
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,100
He is your blood and the eldest son of this imperial family.

192
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,140
What other reason do I need?

193
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,990
- I no longer want to hear you, so please stop.
- Emperor!

194
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,320
Yes, that damned, 'Emperor! Emperor! Emperor!'

195
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,600
I am so sick of hearing it now, I have bile in my throat.

196
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,330
Tell Maha to become the world's biggest idiot, please.

197
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,710
You must make him that way.

198
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,230
That is how Maha can avoid death.

199
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,860
Imperial Prince? Did you cry?

200
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:06,260
I think I now understand what sorrow my mother suffered.

201
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,480
Has something happened inside?

202
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,400
I find you despicable and disgusting.

203
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,060
Your words are excessive.

204
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,860
You are now at an age where you can determine reason.

205
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't know what you heard from Empress Dowager, but do not speak carelessly.

206
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,780
He is still young, but his gaze seems dangerous.

207
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,380
I think you should reveal his true origins now.

208
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,950
Look at that. I said I would separate those two, didn't I?

209
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,910
Their fighting will become ever more vicious.

210
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:10,430
Until one of the two dies.

211
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,370
Here.

212
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,540
- General Tanqishi?
- He's waiting inside. Go on in.

213
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,140
Yeon Hwa.

214
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,880
What are you doing? What if Court Lady Seo sees?

215
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,420
Did you like the gold ornament

216
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,180
I gave you last time?

217
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,360
Is there any woman who doesn't like gold?

218
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, you're so adorable. Oh my goodness.

219
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,900
Sir,

220
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,530
to see you alive like this...

221
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,700
How is the imperial prince?

222
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,690
He is full of sorrow. I pity him so much.

223
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,870
I cannot stand to see it with my eyes open.

224
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,870
Time has finally come.

225
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,540
Tell Maha that his uncle is alive.

226
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,730
Yes. Yes, Sir, I will.

227
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,780
And give this to Empress Dowager.

228
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,280
If she asks where you got it,

229
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,060
tell her that you got it from a merchant association leader coming from the west.

230
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,000
I understand. I will do that, Sir.

231
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,170
What do you think is the reason for our loss at battle?

232
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,060
There are many reasons, but gunpowder is the most important.

233
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,200
We never expected that Ilkhanate would have such a large amount of gunpowder...

234
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:44,070
Someone sold them the sulfur and saltpeter required and reaped enormous profits.

235
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,680
Is that the truth?

236
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,590
Who did that?

237
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,620
Give that to him.

238
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,980
Please read that.

239
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,590
Wang Yoo?

240
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,030
Yuan has been blocking Goryeo's overseas trade.

241
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:08,410
During that time, Wang Yoo has been selling sulfur and saltpeter.

242
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:15,460
The latest defeat by our forces has caused the people's resentment to rise to the sky.

243
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,570
So we will need someone who will take that resentment for us.

244
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,400
Dethrone Wang Yoo.

245
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,480
I need more concrete evidence.

246
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,660
I heard there is someone in Goryeo who can collaborate with us.

247
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,690
Minister of Political Affairs Kim Soon Jo can be trusted.

248
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,410
Send him a secret letter

249
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,780
and tell him to create a ledger documenting Wang Yoo's transactions with Ilkhanate.

250
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,610
You mean, a fake ledger?

251
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,720
But Wang Yoo definitely did this.

252
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,070
Since we have no evidence, we have no choice but to create it.

253
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,290
If we provide that ledger with our petition to have Wang Yoo dethroned,

254
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,780
it should be enough evidence.

255
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:01,630
I think His Majesty should find out about this through a petition.

256
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,840
Yes, Prime Minister.

257
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,010
Why didn't you tell him that Wang Yoo probably colluded with Chief Imperial Consort Ki?

258
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:19,070
Because that's not something I should only say. We need to catch them in the act.

259
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,800
Do you have a plan?

260
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,120
I, Kim Soon Jo, Minister of Political Affairs of Goryeo,

261
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,720
am writing to inform the Emperor of the Great Kingdom of Yuan.

262
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,190
Wang Yoo, King of Goryeo has been selling military supplies

263
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:54,510
such as sulfur, saltpeter, steel and tin to an enemy state of Yuan and reaped enormous profits.

264
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,350
Not only that, he used that money to build up his military

265
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,950
and plans to take Liaodong Peninsula currently under Yuan rule.

266
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:08,510
This is treason by which he betrayed the trust of a great kingdom.

267
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,540
So faithful Goryeo vassals are requesting his dethronement.

268
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,590
We ask His Imperial Majesty the Emperor to hear us.

269
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,380
Chief Imperial Consort, have you heard the news?

270
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,850
The Goryeo king committed treason against Yuan.

271
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,860
Tonight, a petition will be submitted to the emperor by vassals of Goryeo.

272
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,600
But how do you know about this?

273
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,410
He is someone who caused my mother to die.

274
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,390
So, of course, I am interested in him.

275
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,080
Prince, you can stop. Come along, now.

276
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,380
You did very well, Prince.

277
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,490
Will Chief Imperial Consort really try to intercept this petition?

278
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,990
If she colluded with Wang Yoo, she won't just stand by and watch.

279
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,630
She will do whatever she can to try and stop this.

280
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:22,860
Then can Chief Imperial Consort also be punished for treason?

281
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,000
We must make it so.

282
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,370
Yes, that will happen.

283
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,250
Is that the truth?

284
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:54,920
Yes, Prime Minister. The chief gatekeeper gave the petition to Eunuch Park Bul Hwa.

285
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,320
More than half of the Imperial Guards are on the Chief Imperial Consort's side.

286
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,350
It shouldn't be hard for them to intercept a document.

287
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:06,490
And Chief Imperial Consort intercepted the petition in order to inform Wang Yoo about it.

288
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,020
Begin monitoring her immediately. She will make her move tonight.

289
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,980
You be in charge. If Chief Imperial Consort meets with any of Wang Yoo's people,

290
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,140
you must capture all of them at once.

291
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,080
Yes, Uncle.

292
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,560
Jadan and Mujin,

293
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,530
follow me.

294
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,270
Yes, Sir.

295
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:44,260
As I expected, it is certain that Chief Imperial Consort helped Wang Yoo to commit treason.

296
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,760
If this is true, there is no way she can escape execution by beheading.

297
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,450
Execution by beheading won't be enough.

298
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:57,960
We should use this chance to find all the Goryeo people in this palace who were planted by Chief Imperial Consort

299
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,810
and slaughter them all.

300
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,990
This isn't the time to just sit idle.

301
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,690
We must let the emperor know what is going on.

302
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,150
Yes, Empress Dowager.

303
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,870
What is written on there?

304
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,740
Didn't he agree to sell sulfur and saltpeter to Yuan?

305
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,670
But this says that he sold them to the enemy state.

306
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,290
What was the King of Goryeo thinking?

307
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:38,800
This is different from the list I gave to Eunuch Bang.

308
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,360
So it's a fake ledger?

309
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,480
I think they are plotting something against us.

310
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,580
In any case, if the King of Goryeo is captured, you will be in danger as well.

311
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,790
Have you let Eunuch Bang know?

312
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,790
Yes, Your Highness. They are probably waiting for us now.

313
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,030
Prepare for us to travel incognito.

314
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,630
Yes, Your Highness.

315
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,580
Your Highness.

316
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,440
It looks like she will really leave the palace.

317
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,020
You must follow them without getting discovered.

318
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,280
What? Chief Imperial Consort betrayed us?

319
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,680
That cannot be true.

320
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,840
You two must be mistaken.

321
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,510
Chief Imperial Consort took the petition and ledger we received from Goryeo.

322
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:51,720
And she will get rid of those and send a secret letter to Wang Yoo.

323
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,160
If that is not evidence of her betrayal, what is it?

324
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:02,160
Another of Wang Yoo's secret letters sent to Chief Imperial Consort.

325
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,230
This isn't something you should just pretend not to know about.

326
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,540
How about asking Chief Imperial Consort about it and find out the whole story—

327
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,490
Burn it up.

328
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,070
You won't even read them now?

329
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,780
I told you to burn it and make it disappear.

330
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,730
Your Majesty.

331
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,000
I know it's a trick by those trying to drive me apart from Chief Imperial Consort.

332
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,930
Please wake up already.

333
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:29,160
How long will you let Chief Imperial Consort play her tricks on you?

334
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,230
Your Majesty, if Chief Imperial Consort really colluded with Wang Yoo,

335
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:38,590
even if it hurts like cutting your heart out, you will have to behead her.

336
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,000
Please stop.

337
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,760
Stop.

338
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,960
It's for our kingdom's sake. Be strong, please.

339
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,970
I asked you to stop.

340
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,560
Your Majesty, Chief Imperial Consort has arrived.

341
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,690
Chief Imperial Consort? What brings you here so late at night?

342
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:17,960
This came from Goryeo.

343
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:29,000
The content was very urgent, so I brought them to you myself.

344
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,770
Head Eunuch.

345
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,990
Thanks to you, we avoided a crisis.

346
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,640
Don't be mistaken.

347
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,890
I was not helping Chief Imperial Consort.

348
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,160
I am only trying to save the Goryeo people in this palace.

349
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,030
What's wrong, Head Eunuch?

350
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,630
You should know better why I'm doing this.

351
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:17,520
If Chief Imperial Consort was doing something so dangerous, you should have stopped her.

352
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,260
What she is doing now is for the sake of the Goryeo people in Yuan.

353
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,400
Do you think you can fight and win against them, in this palace?

354
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,190
That is a mistake. You have no chance of winning.

355
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,820
I think Her Highness's actions are correct.

356
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,060
Shut up. I helped you this time,

357
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,980
but if something like this happens again,

358
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,470
then I will report it myself.

359
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,510
Head Eunuch, aren't you from Goryeo as well?

360
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:56,780
Not at all. When Goryeo abandoned me, I abandoned Goryeo.

361
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:01,020
Then, are you a Yuan person?

362
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:08,720
You're not a Goryeo person, and you are not a Yuan person. Then what are you?

363
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,040
I am nothing.

364
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:17,080
I don't belong here nor there. Someone without a county.

365
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,620
That is why my life is even more important to me.

366
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,160
A life that is not protected by any nation,

367
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,750
it is a pitiful life.

368
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:40,110
After you've spent half your life here like I did, you will see what I mean.

369
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,420
[Emperor of Yuan Dynasty]

370
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,700
Hurry and capture Wang Yoo right now.

371
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,370
If Wang Yoo refuses his dethronement, things can get complicated.

372
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:10,560
I think it will be better to send an envoy and request his return to Yuan.

373
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,070
I've just put the imperial seal on the order to dethrone Wang Yoo.

374
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,490
Someone like Wang Yoo dares to disobey my imperial command?

375
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,200
I know his nature well.

376
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,930
If I had my way, I would set all of Goryeo ablaze. But now isn't a good time.

377
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,920
Send Lord Jang.

378
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,180
Yes, Your Majesty, I will do that.

379
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,930
Are you monitoring Chief Imperial Consort well?

380
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,360
Not only Heungdoek Palace,

381
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,390
but also the merchant association supplying the palace, I've forbidden them all from entering.

382
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:22,210
Chief Imperial Consort has more people on her side than I thought.

383
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,810
She must not be allowed to contact them.

384
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,120
I understand.

385
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:36,220
I saw the petition and the ledger sent from Goryeo.

386
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:43,150
It could have been fabricated by vassals who are hostile to Wang Yoo.

387
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,600
We can find out the truth when Wang Yoo is dragged here.

388
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,390
You are doing things out of order.

389
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:56,910
How can you dethrone a nation's ruler without even verifying the truth?

390
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:03,310
It's possible that more people are involved with Wang Yoo's treason than we know.

391
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:09,360
Whether that's just a few, or if I have to kill every vassal in the Imperial Court,

392
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:15,090
I must root out those who betrayed me and this Great Kingdom.

393
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:19,250
I really hope that you are not suspected needlessly, Yang.

394
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,110
So please just stand by and watch.

395
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,230
Please find a way to let Eunuch Bang and Yeon Bisoo know what is going on.

396
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,580
It's dangerous right now.

397
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:35,450
If the King of Goryeo is dragged here, it won't end with his dethronement.

398
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,920
We have to prevent disaster, don't we?

399
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:43,110
Your Highness, you are in danger as well. You must be careful.

400
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,480
Imperial Prince, you will go to Goryeo?

401
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,340
I want to bring the one who caused my mother's death to Yuan myself.

402
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,120
That is very far away. How can you think of—

403
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,770
Please grant him permission, Your Highness.

404
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,410
We have to lure Wang Yoo here, somehow.

405
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:08,990
If Imperial Prince accompanies us, we may avoid suspicion.

406
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,130
Please grant me permission, Empress Dowager.

407
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,230
I am no longer a child.

408
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,040
If that's what you really want, you may go.

409
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,890
I will try speaking to His Majesty for you.

410
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

411
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,020
Once you bring Wang Yoo and cross our nation's border,

412
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,290
your maternal uncle will be there to greet you.

413
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,910
My maternal uncle?

414
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,690
Yes.

415
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,000
General Tanqishi is still alive.

416
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,410
That boy is Star, who Seung Nyang gave birth to?

417
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,300
No, no, I mean, that boy is Maha?

418
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,310
He looks so mature. How he has grown.

419
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:42,890
Even seeing him from away, he looks just like His Majesty.

420
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,660
I better go to Goryeo after all.

421
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,920
Things are so busy here. Why go to Goryeo?

422
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,670
Since Maha intends to meet His Majesty, I am too worried.

423
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,180
You two, please take care of things here.

424
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,630
If anything happens, contact me right away.

425
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,150
All right, then go on.

426
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,180
I have something to report to you.

427
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,300
The King of Goryeo—

428
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,870
He said he already knows.

429
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,240
That Leader of Hawk House.

430
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,820
I think he does really hold a high office in the palace.

431
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,360
It was the hand of a woman.

432
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,570
A woman with a high rank in the palace...

433
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,710
Isn't it Empress Dowager or the empress?

434
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:58,100
We have to first find out why they are helping us.

435
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,610
Only then can we make use of them towards my revenge.

436
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:08,370
In any case, if things go too well, Wang Yoo and that Ki bitch,

437
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:13,320
we may get rid of both at once.

438
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,730
Where are you going?

439
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:36,250
I was going to meet with you, Teacher.

440
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,300
Teacher, you said you would keep watch over

441
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,750
how the secret fund was used.

442
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:49,820
Last year and the year before, you spent it to feed the people starving from famine.

443
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:57,670
Not to mention, you also used it to bring a few government and military officials to your side.

444
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,590
So you did know about all of it.

445
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:08,880
Now my life depends on you, Teacher.

446
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:15,980
Did you do something I don't know about which benefits the enemy?

447
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,930
I absolutely did not.

448
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:25,360
The famine is bad this year. Please provide more grain for the people.

449
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:31,560
I hope you won't stand by and watch anymore.

450
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:40,430
So that I can do something properly for this kingdom, please help me, Teacher.

451
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,640
If it involves sparing Goryeo, I must refuse.

452
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,940
The money that is saving the people of Yuan is coming out of Goryeo.

453
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:59,080
El Temür's secret fund is already depleted.

454
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,930
Please help me, Teacher.

455
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,210
Did you enjoy the mountains and streams of Goryeo on your way here?

456
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:23,360
I never want to return here to my enemy's land.

457
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:32,770
Prince Maha? That young boy is on his way here?

458
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:37,300
Yes, Your Majesty. He is coming along with the envoys.

459
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,070
There is no reason for that boy to come here.

460
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:46,570
I am curious about that, too.

461
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:05,530
I, Kim Soon Jo, Minister of Political Affairs, greet Your Highness.

462
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:09,580
We greet Your Highness the Imperial Prince.

463
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,550
Why won't the King of Goryeo come to greet the Imperial Prince himself?

464
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:28,810
He is waiting inside the Great Hall, please come in.

465
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:33,290
Please put a chair here.

466
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,800
Your Highness the Imperial Prince, why a chair?

467
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:49,690
If the King of Goryeo won't come out, I will not move a step from here.

468
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,420
What?

469
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,810
He wants me to go and greet him?

470
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,300
He seems like he won't budge.

471
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,690
Then I better test his stubbornness.

472
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,940
Is he disrespecting the Imperial Prince because he is young?

473
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,800
How can he be so impudent?

474
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:43,360
Your Majesty, his stubbornness is extraordinary.

475
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,090
It will get dark soon.

476
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:49,360
Please go greet him.

477
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,810
He's become quite bold.

478
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,940
You've come a very long way.

479
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,230
Please come in.

480
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,730
"Hear this, King of Goryeo.

481
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,790
Although you've received the favor of the emperor and were restored to your throne,

482
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:36,810
you've ejected your loyal subjects who've maintained a good relationship with the Great Kingdom of Yuan.

483
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:42,800
And it wasn't enough to stop sending tributes of concubines, eunuchs, and goods,

484
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,400
you've made this your official policy.

485
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,260
It would be fitting for me to send my military to punish Goryeo.

486
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,990
But thinking about our past friendship, I am giving you a chance to respond to a royal summons.

487
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,180
So the King of Goryeo will come to see me

488
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:01,390
and apologize for your disloyalty and bow your head."

489
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,340
So you're telling me to go to Yeongyeong?

490
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:18,060
That is His Majesty's Imperial Command.

491
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:23,900
Your Majesty, how about visiting Yeongyeong before the hostility grows deeper?

492
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,180
I am an imperial prince of a great kingdom.

493
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,110
How can you look at me with such an impertinent gaze?

494
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,580
When you were young,

495
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,480
I held you in my arms often.

496
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,770
Do you remember that?

497
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:56,250
Why did he come here with the envoys?

498
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,860
His Highness—

499
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,420
I came to see my mother's mortal enemy's face.

500
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:16,380
Your mother's death is regrettable, but without even finding out the reason

501
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,590
and passing judgment. That is not a proper attitude.

502
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,480
Don't think about lecturing me.

503
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:33,300
I will go to Yuan tomorrow, so have him rest comfortably tonight.

504
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,860
You should fear the day I become the emperor.

505
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:51,270
I won't leave Goryeo alone, the land of my enemy.

506
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:58,870
Someone who cannot control his heart does not have the right to vengeance.

507
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,420
You have much to learn.

508
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:19,030
What he just said, what does it mean?

509
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,540
What does he mean, I should look near me?

510
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,190
Don't pay any attention, Your Highness.

511
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:32,990
He's still young. He cannot be reasonable.

512
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,300
Don't pay any attention, Your Majesty.

513
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,600
That boy's twisted character

514
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,020
feels regrettable to me, somehow.

515
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,590
Wang Yoo...

516
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,930
Wang Yoo...

517
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,940
Wang Yoo!

518
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:05,030
Chief Yeon, are you sleeping? Yeon Bisoo?

519
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,900
Come in.

520
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,980
I heard news from the palace.

521
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,760
The emperor dethroned Our Majesty the King.

522
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,100
What does that mean?

523
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,120
The emperor already wrote the order of dethronement

524
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,130
and he is tricking Our Majesty the King to come here.

525
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,180
We must let His Majesty know.

526
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:27,350
He probably already crossed the border into Yuan.

527
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,220
What do we do?

528
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,940
Starting here, it's Yuan land.

529
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:01,190
We should stay here tonight.

530
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:03,210
That sounds good.

531
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,930
Seeing how he ordered you to come all the way to Yeongyeong,

532
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:30,620
the emperor's interrogation will be tough.

533
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:37,640
I've already prepared for that, so don't worry.

534
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,920
It's very late, you should sleep.

535
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,970
Is Maha already sleeping?

536
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:47,880
He's still very young, so he's probably tired from the trip.

537
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,720
He is a very bold child.

538
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,710
Why are you so concerned about him?

539
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:59,800
The more I look at him, the more I feel sad and sorry for him.

540
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,630
He has a grudge against you.

541
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,830
Don't give him too much affection, please.

542
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,430
It's been a while, Lord Jang.

543
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:29,060
Since Imperial Prince desires this so much, I will allow it, this one time.

544
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:33,430
I will go with him only as far as the capital, so don't worry.

545
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,520
Hurry and go on in.

546
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,610
Your Highness the Imperial Prince.

547
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:04,850
My uncle.

548
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:10,570
Yes, I am your maternal uncle.

549
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:14,670
Your mother...

550
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,150
was my sister.

551
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:23,410
Where have you been all this time?

552
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,710
I'm sorry.

553
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,820
It's because I failed her.

554
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:54,120
That is why I couldn't protect your mother.

555
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,270
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

556
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,770
Uncle.

557
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,410
Maha...

558
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:21,150
Maha.

559
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,640
Wang Yoo has gone to sleep.

560
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,890
Your Highness the Imperial Prince, watch me.

561
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:54,480
See how your uncle takes revenge on Wang Yoo.

562
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:59,560
What is your business?

563
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,240
Tanqishi.

564
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,580
Put down your swords.

565
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,540
Your Majesty.

566
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:26,270
Imperial Prince, what do you think you are doing?

567
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:29,560
Read the edict for dethronement.

568
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:35,520
- Dethronement?
- Why is His Majesty being dethroned?

569
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,400
Wang Yoo, the King of Goryeo, sold military goods to Ilkhanate who was at war with Yuan

570
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,560
and caused Yuan's defeat, which is high treason.

571
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:53,200
He used that money to aim a sword at Yuan and planned an insurrection.

572
00:53:53,200 --> 00:54:00,560
So for his crimes of aiding the enemy and for insurrection, I order his dethronement.

573
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,520
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty...

574
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:10,410
- These are not the truth.
- Shut your mouth!

575
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:17,170
From this moment, Wang Yoo is a traitor, so no manners will be observed.

576
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:21,400
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

577
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:35,100
Walk faster! Walk faster!

578
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,760
- Walk faster!
- Your Majesty!

579
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,640
- Walk faster.
- Your Majesty...

580
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,480
Faster...

581
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:54,330
Wang Yoo, the road to Yeongyeong

582
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:58,940
will be worse for you than the road to hell.

583
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:06,340
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty! Please stop! Please stop!

584
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:11,590
- Your Majesty.
- Please stop!

585
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:18,160
You killed my father and my sister and brother.

586
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:23,090
I will kill you with my own hands. You and Lady Ki! Both of you!

587
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:25,590
Your Majesty!

588
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:31,470
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty...

589
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:35,460
Stop! Stop!

590
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:41,840
- Please come to your senses!
- Ugh! Wang Yoo!

591
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,120
Your Highness the Imperial Prince.

592
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:52,870
Please tell them to stop. You cannot do this.

593
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:58,450
You cannot do this to His Majesty, you will receive divine punishment.

594
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:03,410
Your Highness the Imperial Prince. Your Highness!

595
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:14,690
Your Highness the Imperial Prince!

596
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,360
They conspired against our kingdom!

597
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,950
Wang Yoo is the reason we lost the war!

598
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:30,710
Kill him!

599
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:34,000
Kill Wang Yoo's spy Chief Imperial Consort Ki, too!

600
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,020
They're all on the same team!

601
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,630
Kill Chief Imperial Consort Ki!

602
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,930
Kill them!

603
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,680
You must come to your senses.

604
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,950
Just endure it for a little while longer, Your Majesty.

605
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:09,970
Those bastards. How can they do that to His Majesty?

606
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:16,880
What must we do? What must we do? Shouldn't we try to rescue them?

607
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:34,780
♫ To the day I said I loved you with tears welling up ♫

608
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:37,910
♫ To the day we were happy ♫

609
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:42,540
♫ I can't return ♫

610
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:48,090
♫ Even if I'm ache and it were my last second ♫
