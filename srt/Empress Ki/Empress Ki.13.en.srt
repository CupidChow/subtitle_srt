1
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,960
I want to die,

2
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,180
Seung Nyang.

3
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,130
I wish I had died on Daecheong Island instead.

4
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,880
Why are you here?

5
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,190
- I have something important to tell you.
- Did you come to laugh at me?

6
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,400
That this is all I got for betraying you?

7
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,150
Did you want to ask if I betrayed you for this pathetic and shabby position?

8
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,420
Is that it?

9
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,030
Why don't you go ahead and laugh at me freely?

10
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,420
Like in Goryeo, tell me what a fool and an idiot I am,

11
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,600
and then tether me to a post!

12
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,450
Don't expect... anything from me.

13
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,550
I will not do anything,

14
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,910
if it's for you, whatever that may be.

15
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,500
Your Majesty!

16
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,930
Your Majesty, you need to get to the inquisitor's office.

17
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,700
The re-examination is being carried out there.

18
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,200
Bring her out.

19
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,490
What is this about?

20
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,310
Let me go!

21
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,330
Your Highness!

22
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,680
You don't look well.

23
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,220
What happened to your lovely appearance?

24
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,950
Thank you, Your Majesty,

25
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,490
for worrying about me.

26
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,630
She's not someone who would ever bow down.

27
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,740
Watch and see. Once the re-examination is over,

28
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll shave her head and send her to jail.

29
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,800
His Imperial Majesty!

30
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,640
Why are we doing the re-examination here?

31
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,890
If the pregnancy is a lie, it's not something she could have come up with alone.

32
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,850
Even if we have to cut away all flesh at this moment, we need to find out who is responsible!

33
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,590
Physician, begin the diagnosis!

34
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,560
Tell me.

35
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,000
Is she pregnant?

36
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,270
Th-That is...

37
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,780
Why can't you speak?!

38
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,050
Other physicians, your diagnosis!

39
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,920
She's pregnant!

40
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,120
Her pulse is indeed showing she's pregnant!

41
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,210
What happened?

42
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,250
Th-There's no way.

43
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,280
I made sure she took both the powder and the tonic.

44
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,610
What do you mean?

45
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,740
Make sure the tonic doesn't contain licorice?

46
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,450
It's suspicious that Lady Park keeps needing the washroom.

47
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,020
I wonder if she ate anything containing gourd flowers.

48
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,100
Gourd flowers?

49
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,700
Then... the reason the empress is trying to make her drink the tonic is...

50
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,180
She's trying to cause a miscarriage.

51
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,080
Your Highness!

52
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,070
What happened?

53
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,120
The baby is fine.

54
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,830
Thankfully, the number of gourd flowers Yeon Hwa gave her was a small amount.

55
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,060
Go to the empress and tell her we want her re-examined.

56
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,030
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

57
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,390
It's a great opportunity to make the empress fall into her own trap.

58
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,100
- Yang, you...
- Before someone takes the fall,

59
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,020
it's not a fight that will end.

60
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,930
We need to end this here.

61
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,790
You cannot.

62
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,940
- What do you mean?
- She was breaking out in a cold sweat, so she is unclothed.

63
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,370
Then I'll just put my hand in for diagnosis.

64
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,630
- Do that then.
- Yes, Your Highness.

65
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,600
Hmm...

66
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,690
What's the matter?

67
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,390
I can't sense a pulse showing that she's pregnant.

68
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,890
Your Highness.

69
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,080
She is indeed pregnant, so congratulations, Your Majesty.

70
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,030
This isn't over with a congratulatory remark!

71
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,430
Your Majesty, the imperial authority has been ridiculed by the whole world over this.

72
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,650
To the empress who requested a re-examination by believing a ridiculous rumor,

73
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,140
punishment should be given.

74
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,460
Before that, I would like to ask the empress one thing.

75
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,660
For what reason were you certain of a false pregnancy?

76
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,910
Th-That is...

77
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,010
The empress's sin is obvious.

78
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,680
She was too easily swayed by rumors and caused the imperial authority to be ridiculed.

79
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,690
Therefore, it's only right that she pays for her sin.

80
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,640
How will she pay for it?

81
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,590
Will prostrating herself and awaiting punishment do?

82
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,140
Father.

83
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,600
It's not the kind of sin that can be forgiven by prostrating oneself.

84
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,040
We need to find the person who started the rumor

85
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,570
- and make an example out of them!
- Your Highness!

86
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,270
Prostrating is the last line that can be drawn by the gods.

87
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,160
Are you determined to chase her out of the palace?!

88
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,250
Is that what you dearly want?

89
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,770
Please stop!

90
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,250
What do you think you're doing?

91
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,120
You can fool everyone else but not me.

92
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,250
You wench ruined our perfect plan!

93
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,880
I will take you and—

94
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,690
This... do you know what this is?

95
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,630
What is that?

96
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,240
This is the promise that I'll let you out of the palace.

97
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,910
I would like your seal placed on it.

98
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,020
This wench... You should take what's given.

99
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,320
How dare you?

100
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,500
It's fine. Lady Park is going to lose her head.

101
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,780
There's no reason I can't put my seal on it.

102
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,860
You! Seung Nyang, you!

103
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,930
You're going to kill me?

104
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,470
Let's see who dies first, shall we?

105
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,900
I'm going to scream.

106
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,560
I'm sure you don't want me to expose the empress's conspiracy.

107
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,570
You're a fool.

108
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:43,090
Just to get revenge for a deposed king, you made us your enemy.

109
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,950
It's not revenge for His Majesty.

110
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,250
If not, then...

111
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,160
You... killed my mother.

112
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,500
She died by the arrow you shot!

113
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:04,250
If you don't want to get involved with me any further, just leave me alone to leave the palace.

114
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,420
I also find it insufferable to keep seeing you.

115
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:26,970
No way... Did I really have feelings for her?

116
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,110
Your Majesty, it's time for you to go to the Imperial Court.

117
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,730
Your Imperial Majesty!

118
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,290
Stop crying.

119
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,090
Your Majesty.

120
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,790
I'm... the empress of this country.

121
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,010
I can withstand having a finger pointed at me from behind,

122
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:32,110
but pitying me to my face, I cannot allow.

123
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,270
Your Majesty.

124
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,590
Lead the way.

125
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,430
I'll go to His Majesty.

126
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,560
Your Majesty, the empress is here.

127
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:27,220
Your Majesty, everything that happened is my fault.

128
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,150
Please... grant me your forgiveness.

129
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,840
Your Majesty!

130
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,580
Your Majesty, please grant me your forgiveness.

131
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,920
This will never happen again.

132
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,810
I ask for your mercy, Your Majesty.

133
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,230
I can't just watch anymore.

134
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,140
- I'll go get her!
- Leave it be!

135
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,760
- Father!
- Didn't you hear me?

136
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,510
If the war is unfavorable, you must lose your shoulders to protect your head.

137
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,500
It's in return for not being dethroned.

138
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,020
She has to deal with it.

139
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,520
Tell her to stop.

140
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,670
- You can't, Your Majesty!
- It's raining hard now.

141
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:02,910
- What if she gets sick?
- Rather than that, make Lady Park an imperial consort.

142
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:09,440
- Empress Dowager, if you keep pushing Prime Minister—
- Power also gets old,

143
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,720
not just people.

144
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,880
Power also forms cracks with time.

145
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,080
If Lady Park becomes an imperial consort and gives birth to a crown prince,

146
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,000
all the ministers will line up behind her.

147
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,230
That's how power moves.

148
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,450
From old power to young power.

149
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,600
That's how you gather influence, Your Majesty!

150
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,490
Don't expect tears from me, Your Majesty.

151
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:58,280
Until I can pay back those wenches who caused me this humiliation with pain a thousandfold,

152
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,750
I will not cry...

153
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,170
I must not... I must not...

154
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,170
Your Majesty!

155
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,270
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

156
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,300
Your Majesty, please wake up! Your Majesty!

157
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,420
Your Majesty!

158
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,170
What are you doing? Put her on my back! Hurry!

159
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,770
Lady Park, receive His Imperial Majesty's honor.

160
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,780
"Lady Park is honorable and kind,

161
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,740
and has become an example of the Inner Court.

162
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,660
- Your Majesty!
- She has also received His Majesty's favor

163
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,480
and she bears the emperor's child.

164
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,050
This is the mandate of Heaven.

165
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,320
I, the emperor, make her an imperial consort of the fifth rank."

166
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,760
Lady Park, receive this honor.

167
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,910
Empress!

168
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,400
Your imperial benevolence is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

169
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,660
- How is she?
- She fainted.

170
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:41,140
Lady Park... has become an imperial consort.

171
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,270
I'm sorry, Father.

172
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,730
This is all... my fault.

173
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,210
You!

174
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,520
How dare you show weakness?

175
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,100
Have you forgotten that you are the firstborn who will lead our family?!

176
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,530
Never show weakness.

177
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,570
Even if it's in front of me!

178
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,980
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

179
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,300
Why are you here?

180
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,160
General Talahai sent him.

181
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,960
Tell me what happened.

182
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,090
That is... I beg your pardon, but...
- It was an annihilation.

183
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,380
What?

184
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,110
Annihilation?

185
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,620
General Talahai is the only one alive. General Bayan and the deposed king were killed in battle.

186
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,560
Why is it so quiet?

187
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,870
I think the raiding plan failed.

188
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,130
If not, why would General Talahai neglect us?

189
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:12,690
It's possible that the one who carried out the raid last night wasn't General Talahai.

190
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,720
- What do you mean?
- Then who raided this place?

191
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,580
Lookie here. You sure are suffering a lot.

192
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,230
Hey, Yeom Byeong... Soo.

193
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,550
It's been a while. How is it?

194
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,630
Do you like my hair cut?

195
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,440
They're the deposed king's henchmen who were supposed to have died.

196
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,030
What did I say? I told you not to trust them.

197
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,750
Where's the deposed king?

198
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,680
Why? Does our baby miss him now that he's sitting in there?

199
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,130
Open the prison door right now.

200
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,190
- "Open the door right now."
- That little...

201
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,810
Of course, I will open it for you. Begin!

202
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,210
It seems like... these bastards are going to kill us.

203
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,760
General...

204
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,690
Where are you dragging us? I need to know where I'm going to die, so...

205
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,740
What are you trying to do?

206
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,050
My soldiers want your deaths.

207
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,910
It would mean that rather than the enemy they're fighting,

208
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:01,630
those gathered under the same flag have caused them more suffering.

209
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,970
What Baghatur was after wasn't the soldiers but the horses.

210
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,120
You must have surely seen through their strategy.

211
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,440
Is this what you were after all along?

212
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,790
You used us as bait in this battle.

213
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,370
I just changed our strategy and used you as bait.

214
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,090
This is mutiny and treason.

215
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:32,520
Have you already forgotten who taught me the means?

216
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,370
What?

217
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,130
You want to leave?

218
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,750
You're dreaming.

219
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,190
Even if only in dreams, kill all the Turks and get rid of them.

220
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,050
The only way for us to leave here is to

221
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,960
bring victory.

222
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:58,870
Our true enemy wasn't Baghatur but him.

223
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:03,020
Stop looking down on me and just kill me.

224
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,630
General!

225
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,250
Give them horses.

226
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,910
We're going to Yeongyeong.

227
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,450
There's no reason to keep us alive!

228
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,460
Why are you letting me live?

229
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,720
If our position was switched,

230
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,440
you would have killed us.

231
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,550
But just like Yuan and Goryeo are different, I'm not you.

232
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,840
Does that answer satisfy you?

233
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,440
What happened to Baghatur?

234
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,240
Bring his body.

235
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,920
What's your reason for letting me live?

236
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,590
The reason we fought is because of Yuan.

237
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:05,530
You know the saying, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

238
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,090
Did you just... call me your friend?

239
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,980
Yes, friend.

240
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:17,820
What's important isn't the present but the future ahead of us.

241
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,390
To us, there's no such thing as a future.

242
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,290
It's the same for Goryeo. Since we have no future,

243
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,080
shouldn't we make it together?

244
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,730
Yuan already dominates the sea route.

245
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,360
The only thing they can't control is this Silk Road.

246
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,520
I assure you that this Silk Road will allow either Goryeo or Turks,

247
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,220
who are in the same position, to breathe.

248
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:51,700
I'm only relaying to you how I feel. I'm not trying to get an answer from you.

249
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,840
I'm Yeon Bi Su.

250
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,820
I'm Wang Yoo.

251
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,710
Wang Yoo, we'll meet again.

252
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:15,200
Choon Sim and Eon Nyeon. The royal kitchen has not been cleaned well at all!

253
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,150
If I have to point it out one more time, you will receive a cut in your pay.

254
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,500
Hong Dan, you're doing well these days.

255
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,410
Is your monthly all year long now?

256
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,070
Pardon?

257
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,220
Why do you go around with a frown all the time?

258
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,740
It's also an important decorum to give a good impression to your superiors.

259
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,750
Yang, get out of that servant attire

260
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,030
- and change into these.
- These are...

261
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,070
From today on, you're a court lady.

262
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,420
Yang! Congratulations!

263
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,830
That's so good! I'm so jealous!

264
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,810
How nice!

265
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,360
Congratulations!

266
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,520
This is where you'll live from now on.

267
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,340
Since you're a court lady now,

268
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,840
you need to carefully conduct your actions and words even more.

269
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,480
What should we do with Seung Nyang?

270
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,760
General, please command me.

271
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,220
You must never show weakness.

272
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:41,180
Even if it's in front of me! Understand?

273
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,930
Kill her.

274
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,770
Yes, Sir.

275
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,080
For the sake of my father and family,

276
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,340
I will never regret killing you.

277
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,450
(Permission Letter from Empress to Leave Palace)

278
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:04,760
Your Majesty, I can leave the palace now.

279
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:10,860
Wherever you are, I'll come and find you.

280
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,090
Yang!

281
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,200
Yang!

282
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,410
You're still not asleep?

283
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,600
What brings you here so late?

284
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,020
Head Eunuch wants to see you.

285
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,450
What does he want?

286
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,370
How would I know?

287
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,520
He wants you to come quickly, so hurry up.

288
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,270
Yang!

289
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,060
Chief Eunuch Golta.

290
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,950
Follow me.

291
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,860
Head Eunuch Dok Man is asking for me.

292
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,950
The emperor is looking for you.

293
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,290
Did you find the promise letter that the empress wrote to her?

294
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,250
It wasn't in her room.

295
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,030
Search her then.

296
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,540
Please give it back.

297
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,080
You cannot take it!

298
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,790
Your Majesty! You cannot!

299
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,330
Your Majesty! You can't!

300
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,530
Your Majesty!

301
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,340
Your Majesty!

302
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,580
What? The emperor took Seung Nyang?

303
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,610
I apologize, General.

304
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,700
Then, what happened to the man who was going to kill her?

305
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,410
About that... You needn't worry.

306
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,550
Wake him up.

307
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,160
You!

308
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,800
Your Majesty, he killed himself by biting off his tongue.

309
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,100
What? Killed him--

310
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,710
Get rid of him!

311
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,290
This won't do. It's making me uneasy.

312
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,230
From tomorrow on, make Seung Nyang work at the Imperial Court.

313
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,330
I understand, Your Majesty.

314
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,930
I can no longer ignore the empress's bad conduct.

315
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,590
I'm going to the empress's quarters!

316
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,160
Your Majesty.

317
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:40,480
Your Majesty, the emperor is on his way.

318
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,100
Please lie down.

319
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,230
You still have a temperature.

320
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,600
Bring me the mirror.

321
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,220
Mirror?

322
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,400
According to the physician, you need to rest until you're better.

323
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,300
I can't face the emperor looking like this.

324
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,040
Bring me the blush and clothes to change into.

325
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,890
Hurry.

326
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,100
Your Imperial Majesty.

327
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,670
Where is the empress? How is she?

328
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,320
She's waiting for you.

329
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,340
Welcome, Your Majesty.

330
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,590
Please sit.

331
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,190
Why did you come up with such a scheme?

332
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:44,390
You did something that an empress should never do!

333
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,170
Why did you do that?

334
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,710
Are you... really asking because you don't know?

335
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,550
I'm asking you right now!

336
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:58,810
No... I'll ask you first.

337
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,680
Why do you neglect me so much?

338
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,430
What do you mean "neglect?"

339
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,630
I am always alone.

340
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:15,130
After coming here, I've never once

341
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,430
not been lonely.

342
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:24,980
The one who made me this pitiful is you.

343
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,330
Do you know that?

344
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,360
You still...

345
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,150
don't repent for what you've done wrong.

346
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,470
Repent?

347
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,780
Look.

348
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:53,700
You came to see me in such a hurry.

349
00:34:53,700 --> 00:35:01,620
You came and... you're speaking to me while looking into my eyes.

350
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:05,080
You don't know how long I've waited for this day.

351
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,320
Why would I repent?

352
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,980
Look here, Empress!

353
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:16,150
But... what I want isn't this expression on your face.

354
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,400
If I can't have you look at me with affection,

355
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,460
at least once with warmth...

356
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,450
I just want to hear you say something kind.

357
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,890
I resent... my father who sent me here.

358
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:51,650
I resent... you so much.

359
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,880
Your job now is to serve the emperor in close proximity.

360
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,860
You must heed his command

361
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:59,600
and never stay more than three steps away from His Majesty. Understand?

362
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,940
Why aren't you answering me?

363
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,310
I understand.

364
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,750
Your Majesty, Yang is here.

365
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,130
Come in.

366
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,040
Come closer to me.

367
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,520
More.

368
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,580
More.

369
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,550
Stop.

370
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,580
Now I'm going to draw you.

371
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,820
While I'm drawing you, you can't blink or move your nose.

372
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,590
You can't move your mouth either.

373
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,770
- Your Majesty...
- I said, don't move!

374
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:22,630
After being brought here as a tribute girl, why didn't you come to see me?

375
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,490
Why did you hide the fact that you were a woman?

376
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,120
Did you hate me that much?

377
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:39,600
Did you think I would take you in my arms if I knew you were a woman?

378
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,440
Do you think you're a woman to me?

379
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,400
Please... let me out of the palace.

380
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,410
- Your Majesty.
- Be quiet!

381
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:13,140
"The moon over the waters, even with daylight coming,

382
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,250
in order to speed the wanderer on his way.

383
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:22,570
The sails on the boat that is about to leave, are spread out by the wind.

384
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:26,820
While looking at each other, they cannot bear to part.

385
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,310
So once again,

386
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:33,480
a last glass of wine is offered by hand."

387
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,990
What a sad poem.

388
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:43,160
But then again, what parting isn't sad?

389
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,850
Please... let me leave the palace.

390
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,590
Again? This again?

391
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:04,230
I granted every one of your requests on Daecheong Island.

392
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,420
You also should grant me my request.

393
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,240
What's the reason you keep trying to leave here?

394
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,920
I'm going to find His Majesty.

395
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,620
Still...

396
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,370
You still think of that deposed king as your master?

397
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:35,970
Listen carefully. You're with me right now in my palace!

398
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,670
Your master isn't him but me!

399
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:45,000
My body is here, but I have only one master.

400
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,810
There's nothing in this world that doesn't change.

401
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,290
It's the world's logic that if your status and circumstances change, your master also changes!

402
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,460
A chick that breaks out of the shell and is born

403
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,750
considers the first thing it sees as its mother.

404
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:03,480
To a chick, its mother can't change.

405
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:12,260
I also served the King of Goryeo as my master since the beginning, so—

406
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,110
Stop! Stop that!

407
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,990
I don't want to listen to it anymore.

408
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,320
- Your Majesty!
- You may return to your quarters.

409
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,130
As long as Prime Minister El Temur is after you,

410
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:51,470
leaving my side will only bring you death.

411
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:55,210
Next to me is where you're the safest, idiot.

412
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,830
Did you say that your master isn't His Majesty but the King of Goryeo?

413
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:11,460
That man has already died.

414
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,090
What do you mean?

415
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:19,420
The deposed king whom you consider your master has died.

416
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,800
There's no way.

417
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,420
He's... not someone who would die like that.

418
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,650
Inquire with the civil servants of Goryeo.

419
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:32,580
He died during a battle after being taken to the border.

420
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,870
If you disrespect His Majesty one more time,

421
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:38,070
I will not forgive you.

422
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,190
Your Majesty!

423
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,070
What do you mean the deposed king has died?

424
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:58,350
Not only him, but General Bayan and Toqto'a have also believed to have died during that battle.

425
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,060
How did they die?

426
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,130
It seems the civil servants don't know either.

427
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:12,480
Does Seung Nyang know about this?

428
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,190
Yes.

429
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,120
She must be very upset...

430
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:38,530
♫  Can't you look at me? ♫

431
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:44,900
♫  Can't you love me?  ♫

432
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,690
I will also stay alive and come back for your sake.

433
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:54,200
You also... must stay alive for me.

434
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,430
It's a promise, Seung Nyang! Understand?

435
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,350
Your Majesty!

436
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:06,200
♫  You always look far away  ♫

437
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:13,410
♫ You always pretend you don't know how I feel  ♫

438
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,600
♫ Even if you are a small step behind me ♫

439
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,980
Your Majesty...

440
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,440
♫  I keep being afraid you will  ♫

441
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,900
You were my only hope.

442
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,830
♫  become even farther away ♫

443
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,690
How am I supposed to go on?

444
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,820
♫  Love is such a sad word to me that it's maddening  ♫

445
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,060
For what am I supposed to live?

446
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,090
♫  Even if my heart aches some words must be endured  ♫

447
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:41,020
Your Majesty...

448
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:44,490
♫  I can't last even a day without you  ♫

449
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,180
♫  I can't last even a day without you  ♫

450
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,860
♫  You are my last person  ♫

451
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:04,520
♫  You are my last person  ♫

452
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,330
She's become gaunt in just a few days.

453
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,770
Can she not even eat since his death?

454
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,760
Please test His Majesty's food.

455
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,970
Hold it. From now on,

456
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,160
you do it, Yang.

457
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,310
Your Majesty, the Imperial Family's custom is that—

458
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,040
Custom or whatever.

459
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,940
Just do as I say and, everyone, leave.

460
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,670
I'm hungry...

461
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,830
Hurry up and test the food.

462
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,470
What are you doing? Hurry!

463
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,890
Come on, try a bigger mouthful.

464
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:28,620
How can you tell if there's poison if you taste so little?

465
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,270
Now this one.

466
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:43,780
Try these, too.

467
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,060
I said, try more.

468
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,240
How is it?

469
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,050
It's fine.

470
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,190
Please have your meal.

471
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,240
Here you go, this is what I like.

472
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,990
Try this and let me know if it's all right.

473
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:27,160
Hurry!

474
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,160
I'm a very suspicious person.

475
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,620
Tell me if there's poison or not after eating all of it.

476
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:47,130
Seriously, enjoy it more!

477
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,160
If you're trying to follow your master in death, then keep dreaming.

478
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,600
Don't worry about me.

479
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,700
You're a court lady.

480
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,140
You need my permission even to die.

481
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,670
Don't stay more than three steps away.

482
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:41,710
Have you forgotten?

483
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,420
Se-Seung Nyang!

484
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,350
Y-Yang!

485
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:45,900
Yan--

486
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,800
Oh... that scared me.

487
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:57,810
You're... smiling now.

488
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,780
The night air is cold. Let's go in.

489
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:34,490
Once we get over that mountain, you'll see Daedo where the Imperial Palace is.

490
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:41,090
The day is nearly over, so it might be good to camp for the night.

491
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:45,370
That would be good. The horses need rest, too.

492
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:50,200
You stay here and camp for the night. We'll keep going.

493
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,240
We've been riding for two days.

494
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,840
We're not being chased by the Turks.

495
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:04,330
Does he have hidden treasure in Daedo? Why is he in such a hurry?

496
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:06,720
It's because of Seung Nyang.

497
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,060
Seung Nyang? Was he brought to Yuan?

498
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:15,830
Not he but she. She's a girl.

499
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,470
What do you mean a girl?

500
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:37,510
It's late, so I don't think we'll make it inside the palace until tomorrow.

501
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:43,010
Please wait. Jeom Bak will find a place for us to stay the night.

502
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,820
He's coming.

503
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,610
- Your Majesty.
- Have you found anything?

504
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:53,200
There's a good courtesan house, but—

505
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,400
But is there a problem?

506
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,800
King Simyang is there right now.

507
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,630
King Simyang?

508
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,010
How dare you look down on me!

509
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:15,950
Your Highness, please compose yourself.

510
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:20,120
These wenches refused to bed me!

511
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:27,160
Even courtesans look down on me!

512
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,030
You drank a lot, Your Highness.

513
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:32,450
Silence! I don't need anyone.

514
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:36,320
All of you get out of my way!

515
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,220
Your Highness.

516
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:56,840
They are even keeping an eye on me now.

517
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,110
Follow them.

518
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,480
Your Highness.

519
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,960
Y-Your Highness.

520
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,860
It's the deposed king. He's alive.

521
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,170
If you're a ghost, go away.

522
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:33,340
If you are the person I know, come and have a drink.

523
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,150
If you're a drunkard, go away.

524
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:42,290
If you're the King Simyang I know, come and have a drink.

525
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,590
What did I tell you?

526
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:54,420
I told you he wouldn't die so easily, didn't I?

527
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,430
While even stealing salt,

528
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:16,030
you gave your loyalty to Prime Minister El Temur.

529
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,900
This is all you've become?

530
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,830
Listen, Nephew.

531
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:24,240
Are you in any position to be making fun of me?

532
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,900
The Imperial Palace is scarier than war.

533
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,290
It's easy to lose your head.

534
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,680
Don't be careless just because you came back alive.

535
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,360
If I was going to live being servile like you,

536
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,870
I wouldn't have come back.

537
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,410
I am sure.

538
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,880
Yang!

539
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:03,640
- Where is Yang?
- Yang is very sick.

540
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,930
Yang!

541
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:13,470
Yang! Yang!

542
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,760
She's burning up. Call the physician right now.

543
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,810
Your Majesty, you can't call the physician for a court lady.

544
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:23,160
Hurry up and call him!

545
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

546
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:26,890
Yang!

547
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,580
Seung Nyang...

548
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:26,840
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

549
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,070
Your Majesty!

550
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,540
Your Majesty!

551
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,440
Your Majesty...

552
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:42,860
Your Majesty!

553
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,350
S-Seung Nyang!

554
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:57,840
Seung Nyang! That's right, it's me. Seung Nyang!

555
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,120
Your Majesty!

556
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,700
I didn't realize you were here and looked for you everywhere!

557
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,500
What is it about that you're making so much fuss?

558
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,480
General Bayan came back alive.

559
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,440
What do you mean? I heard he died in battle.

560
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,110
No, Your Majesty.

561
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:25,330
He arrived in Yeongyeong with news of victory.

562
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:29,870
Then... what about the deposed king?

563
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,300
What happened to him?

564
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,200
He also came back.

565
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:48,290
He... came back alive?

566
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:51,460
Your Majesty!

567
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,870
Your Majesty!

568
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,570
Your Majesty!

569
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:23,600
♫  Even if my heart aches some words must be endured ♫
