1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,360
Damn, just tell us to dig for gold instead.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,690
How do they expect us to find gold that doesn't exist? Do they want us to make it?

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,610
It's been four days already.

4
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:28,920
We dug every corner of that mine, but never mind lumps of gold, we didn't even find a single flake of gold.

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,100
There is no way it doesn't exist.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,830
I'm sure it's somewhere.

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,240
Did you look into it?

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,640
Yes, General.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,910
What happened to Father?

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,980
General...

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,630
Tell me. What happened to the prime minister?

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,570
He was executed.

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,240
In order to set an example for the people,

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:10,340
the emperor is circling Daedo displaying the bodies of the prime minister and Talahai.

15
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,850
No... my father...

16
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,150
to leave us, like that... ?

17
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,530
Please forgive your unfilial child.

18
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,990
Father...

19
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,050
Father!

20
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,270
Father...

21
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,090
Father!

22
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,480
- Bad guy!
- We're glad you are dead!

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,450
I'm glad he's dead.

24
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,550
He was so terrible.

25
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,500
Think about how many people he has killed.

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,990
He received divine punishment.

27
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,550
Hopefully the world will change now.

28
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,290
He should have died earlier.

29
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,290
Father, are you watching this?

30
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:28,750
Our mortal enemy who made you die such a pitiful death has become a cold corpse.

31
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,610
I relieved your grudge, Father.

32
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,200
Please be at rest now, Father.

33
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,890
What's wrong?

34
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,820
It's nothing.

35
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,820
Who is that beautiful lady?

36
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,030
Is she Imperial Consort Ki who made a great contribution?

37
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,590
Yes.

38
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,750
Long live His Majesty the Emperor!

39
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,010
Long live Her Highness the Imperial Consort!

40
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,370
Long live His Majesty the Emperor!

41
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,820
Long live Her Highness the Imperial Consort!

42
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,140
Long live His Majesty the Emperor!

43
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,740
Long live Her Highness the Imperial Consort!

44
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,160
Long live His Majesty the Emperor!

45
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,730
Long live Her Highness the Imperial Consort!

46
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,160
Long live His Majesty the Emperor!

47
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,630
Long live Her Highness the Imperial Consort!

48
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,110
Long live His Majesty the Emperor!

49
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,620
Long live Her Highness the Imperial Consort!

50
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,990
Long live His Majesty the Emperor!

51
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,170
At the official recognition of distinguished services, it looks like the empress's seat is as good as hers.

52
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,160
That's good. His Majesty will regain his throne and Imperial Consort will become the empress.

53
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,850
Hurray!

54
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,010
Long live His Majesty the Emperor!

55
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,700
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

56
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,560
How can I calm down? When my father was killed so wretchedly?

57
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,790
Not only that, but he was also insulted in front of the people.

58
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,360
I must see His Majesty.

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,700
Tell him to come! Tell him to come to the Cold Palace!

60
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,500
Your Majesty, please...

61
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,850
- Your Majesty...
- His Majesty the Emperor enters.

62
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,800
Are you happy now? How admirable are your deeds?

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,420
A criminal who's committed hundreds of crimes,

64
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,400
to allow him to live because he was your father-in-law would have been cowardly.

65
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:46,070
To kill him mercilessly would make your sovereign power rise to the sky.

66
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,010
You still haven't changed at all, have you?

67
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,450
I have changed.

68
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,890
My resentment towards you has turned into rage

69
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:03,790
and my regret has changed into curses.

70
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,410
I curse you, Your Majesty.

71
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,650
I will pray that you will go to hell

72
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,110
and that everything precious to you will be destroyed.

73
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,210
Your Majesty...

74
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,430
Keep going.

75
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:26,310
I have nothing left now.

76
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,860
I have no father, no husband,

77
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,590
my brothers who always took my side, they're gone.

78
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,380
All I have left now is an eternal grudge.

79
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,580
And that is why I can now dare to

80
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,160
curse this kingdom's emperor.

81
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,060
Because I have nothing left to lose.

82
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,480
Thank you

83
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,830
for giving me this courage.

84
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,790
Your benevolence is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

85
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,710
You will be given poisoned tonic, soon.

86
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,770
Poisoned tonic, huh?

87
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,820
Please kill me.

88
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,440
Please try and kill me.

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,700
Please just tear me into pieces! Try it!

90
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,670
Your Majesty...

91
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:47,610
Before you die, please beg forgiveness from those you've killed even just once

92
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,820
and repent your sins.

93
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,190
That is the duty of a human.

94
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,910
- Your Majesty...
- Your Majesty...

95
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,580
Maha will avenge me.

96
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,650
When he finds out how miserably his mother died,

97
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:27,950
my son will avenge me, ten thousand times over.

98
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,500
Just wait and see. It's not over yet.

99
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,620
The circle of revenge never stops.

100
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,490
Your Majesty...

101
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,970
Please tell my son clearly in the future.

102
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,410
What horrors his mother endured, how miserably she died.

103
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,400
Your Majesty...

104
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,280
So my son can hone his sword of revenge,

105
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,840
you have to tell him clearly.

106
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,080
[Wiyang Palace]

107
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,760
What is all this?

108
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,070
She asked you what all this is.

109
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,490
They are gifts sent from each province.

110
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,610
Gifts?

111
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,020
Yes, Your Highness.

112
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,540
Who are these gifts for?

113
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,890
Well...

114
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,860
They are for Imperial Consort Ki?

115
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,630
Yes, they are, Your Highness.

116
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,640
Go on in.

117
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,030
This is from Lingbei Province.

118
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,920
This is from Shaanxi Province.

119
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,620
This is from Yunnan Province.

120
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,560
I will submit all these gifts to the finance office, so please put them away.

121
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,580
What? All these precious things?

122
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:25,120
Your Highness, look at this, please. This is from the Imperial Family in Goryeo.

123
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,470
From Goryeo?

124
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,170
Wow, such rare ginseng.

125
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,510
Your Highness, there is a letter in here.

126
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,510
Your Highness, it is a secret letter from the king of Goryeo.

127
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,460
Secret letter?

128
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,560
Father sent a secret letter?

129
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,770
Here it is.

131
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,630
To my son Wang Yoo.

132
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:08,580
I heard that Imperial Consort Ki from Goryeo's may be installed as Empress of Yuan.

133
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,470
If a Goryeo person becomes the official empress of Yuan,

134
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,070
it seems that will be a very happy occasion for Goryeo.

135
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,690
You should help Imperial Consort Ki and make sure she becomes the empress.

136
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,220
If the Empress of Yuan can help Goryeo in the future,

137
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,310
it will be a splendid achievement that couldn't be bought with tens of thousands of 'geun' of gold.

138
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,650
So listen well, my son.

139
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,380
How shameless.

140
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,590
He did nothing when you were dragged here as a tribute, but now he sends you a secret letter?

141
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,410
Why won't you open it?

142
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,990
Can't you see?

143
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,140
When we were dragged here, he didn't care whether we lived or died.

144
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,520
My friend who returned to Goryeo after being brought here as a tribute committed suicide because she was shunned for being impure.

145
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,080
While all that happened, what has the Imperial Court of Goryeo ever done for us?

146
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,780
Stop.

147
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,710
Everyone calm down.

148
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,650
Your Highness.

149
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,880
I don't want to see this right now.

150
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:27,030
Your Majesty, you have already done all you could.

151
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,570
How can you help her more?

152
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,550
I agree.

153
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,660
I no longer want to see you involved with Imperial Consort Ki.

154
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,360
Your Majesty!

155
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,950
Your Majesty, Toqto'a is thoroughly searching

156
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,380
El Temür's home and offices.

157
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,540
He is definitely searching for the secret fund.

158
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,020
We absolutely must be the ones to find that.

159
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,790
I will go meet with Bayan.

160
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,810
Search everything

161
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,120
and find all the money

162
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,980
that El Temür hid, every last penny.

163
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,330
Yes, Sir.

164
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,960
There is no way this is all the money El Temür had.

165
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,390
Do you know anything about El Temür's secret fund?

166
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,260
All I have are guesses, I do not have any information.

167
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,760
Have you found out where Tanqishi is?

168
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,410
He has hid his whereabouts effectively.

169
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,290
We screwed up.

170
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,910
We shouldn't have left it to the stupid magistrates to find him.

171
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,120
But El Temür's office,

172
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,230
why are you using it?

173
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,950
Restoring our kingdom is an urgent task.

174
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:08,130
At the official recognition of distinguished services, I will become the Prime Minister. So why bother with procedure?

175
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,990
Your restoration to the throne will be decided soon as well.

176
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,430
Once you become the king of Goryeo, you and I will need to closely cooperate.

177
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,690
Cooperate?

178
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,160
Don't act like you don't know.

179
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,180
As a subject nation of Yuan, there are manners and duties that must be observed.

180
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,780
Even El Temür didn't dare to call Goryeo a "subject nation" in front of you.

181
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,930
Seeing how he's already acting, he will be quite something once he becomes Prime Minister.

182
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,300
Don't trust Bayan.

183
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,140
He proudly speaks of himself as a descendant of the Blue Wolves.

184
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,170
That is how important Mongol blood is to him.

185
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:16,100
The fact that you are from Goryeo

186
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,640
will surely be a problem for Bayan.

187
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,270
I will heed your words.

188
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:34,770
One more thing. If possible, please avoid attending official events.

189
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:42,170
The more admirers you have, the more enemies you will have.

190
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,710
And even a small mistake can cause those many admirers

191
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,480
to turn into enemies.

192
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:56,750
You are wise, but you do not yet know the true nature of power.

193
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,070
And so I dare to offer you advice.

194
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,770
I don't think his words should be ignored.

195
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,400
It isn't right to hastily mistrust Bayan.

196
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,880
He enabled me to be in this position, after all.

197
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,140
Imperial Consort Ki is Bayan's adopted daughter. Would she listen to our request?

198
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,910
Power can make someone even betray his own true parents.

199
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,370
And she is an adopted daughter who doesn't share a drop of blood with him.

200
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,410
Imperial Consort enters.

201
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,740
Did you like the gifts we sent you?

202
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:07,000
I will decide if I like them or not after hearing your reason for summoning me.

203
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,830
At the official recognition of distinguished services,

204
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,120
please take our side.

205
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,540
What do you mean by that?

206
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,730
Even among us magistrates, there is hierarchy.

207
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,260
Bayan is at the very bottom.

208
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,430
So, Magistrate Oh Gwang is considering becoming the prime minister.

209
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,870
And it is something all the magistrates want.

210
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,200
I don't think this is something that involves me.

211
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,160
You should appeal to His Majesty directly—

212
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,410
But if Bayan becomes the prime minister,

213
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,400
all the magistrates here will no longer be on His Majesty's side.

214
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,390
Not to mention, Your Highness,

215
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,410
you are being considered to become the empress, are you not?

216
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,660
If you help us restore our reputations—

217
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,200
This is not the time for division.

218
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,330
Reputation, you say?

219
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,930
I will restore it for you.

220
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:16,960
But you must never betray His Majesty.

221
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,690
Where have you been all this time?

222
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,760
Have you decided on the official recognition of distinguished services?

223
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,160
Having to do this for the first time in my life, my head hurts like it's breaking.

224
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,490
[Bayan: Prime Minister, Oh Gwang: Head Secretary, Seol Do Gwan: Ministry of Personnel, Bu Sa Gwi: Ministry of Revenue, Shim Woo Sung: Ministry of Rites]

225
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,370
What do you think?

226
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,420
Is something wrong?

227
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:16,620
Oh Gwang and Bu Sa Gwi are at the highest level among the magistrates.

228
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,990
There is no doubt they will be dissatisfied.

229
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,400
I am worried about that, too.

230
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,730
But it's not as if they can share the prime minister position with Bayan.

231
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,920
How about if you do this?

232
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,810
Wow, this is...

233
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,780
We can't divide power, so we divided the honor bestowed to them.

234
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,540
This is an excellent idea.

235
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,860
Once the official recognition of distinguished services is finished well,

236
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,330
Your Majesty, you will become the true ruler of this kingdom.

237
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,320
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

238
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,170
No,

239
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:20,640
the most important person has been left out of this official recognition of distinguished services.

240
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,660
The one who really drove El Temur out and gave me my sovereign power

241
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,740
is not Bayan nor the magistrates, but you, Yang.

242
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,180
I will give you a big gift as well, so look forward to it.

243
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

244
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,610
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager enters!

245
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,620
Ask her in.

246
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,350
Have you arrived, Your Highness?

247
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,920
I had some things to talk over with you...

248
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,780
What is this?

249
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,000
It's regarding the official recognition of distinguished services.

250
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,600
Please take a look as well.

251
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,710
This was wonderfully done! Was it your doing?

252
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,710
Imperial Consort Ki came up with the idea.

253
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:54,040
I'm sorry. His Majesty asked my opinion, so...

254
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,420
What a relief that you are by the emperor's side.

255
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:07,120
I'm at ease, thanks to Imperial Consort Ki and her wisdom.

256
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,430
We were one step too late.

257
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,420
Imagine that a mere imperial consort would have control over the official recognition of distinguished services.

258
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,540
If this isn't ruling as a regent, what is?

259
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,080
Your Highness.

260
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,490
Playing tricks and actual politics are two very different things.

261
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:42,610
Hasty scheming can lead to your downfall. That is politics.

262
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,650
What exactly was written there?

263
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,680
You will find out soon enough.

264
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,520
I'm looking forward to seeing Bayan's expression. Due to this official recognition of distinguished services,

265
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,630
the power dynamics will be newly reshuffled.

266
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,250
His Majesty enters!

267
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:32,260
El Temur's misdeeds have caused our people misery.

268
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,190
But thanks to your loyalty, we've removed this toxic element.

269
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:44,480
So now I plan to praise your great deeds and reward them.

270
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,430
Lord Jang, read us the doctrine.

271
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,670
"Bayan, Magistrate of Liaoyang, is appointed as Prime Minister."

272
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,420
I, Bayan, will accept His Majesty's imperial command.

273
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:13,360
"Oh Gwang, Magistrate of Yunnan Province is appointed as a minister of the highest rank, with the title of Taesa."

274
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,370
I, Oh Gwang, will accept His Majesty's imperial command.

275
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:35,260
"Bu Sa Gwi, Magistrate of Lingbei Province, is appointed as a minister of the highest rank, with the title of Taebu."

276
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,740
I, Bu Sa Gwi, will accept His Majesty's imperial command.

277
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:45,400
"Seol Do Gwan, Magistrate of Sichuan Province, is appointed as a minister of the highest rank, with the title of Taebo."

278
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,410
I, Seol Do Gwan, will accept His Majesty's imperial command.

279
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,300
The deposed king of Goryeo, Wang Yoo, is permitted to retake his throne.

280
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,760
You can return to Goryeo at any time as you like.

281
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,260
Your Majesty, the positions of Taesa, Taebu, Taebo have disappeared, have they not?

282
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,190
In order for a fair official recognition of distinguished services, I resurrected the "Three Excellencies."

283
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,770
So, please step up and take good care of the affairs of this kingdom.

284
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,780
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

285
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,900
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty!

286
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,610
My vassals, hear me well.

287
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:39,110
And now, I plan to select a new empress.

288
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:44,200
As all of you know, towards the success of our rebellion against El Temur,

289
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,500
Imperial Consort Ki played a very large role.

290
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,770
Therefore...

291
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:55,700
Your Majesty, you have not yet decided what to do with Danashiri.

292
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,160
I think we should discuss this after we decide how to punish the deposed empress first.

293
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,890
I will order Danashiri to be executed once this official recognition of distinguished services is finished.

294
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,470
- So...
- Then announce it after Danashiri is executed.

295
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,070
It won't be too late.

296
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,710
Still, Empress Dowager—

297
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,530
Let us do so, Your Imperial Majesty.

298
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,020
Empress Dowager is correct.

299
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,080
He resurrected the positions that are of an equal level as the prime minister?

300
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,240
His Majesty is trying to keep me in check.

301
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,010
Wouldn't it be better to speak of this directly with the emperor?

302
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,270
The emperor was not the one to make the decision.

303
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,370
Your Majesty...

304
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:14,340
Having brought back the "Three Excellencies" was Imperial Consort Ki's idea.

305
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:20,860
Taesa, Taebu, Taebo are the highest positions, but in reality, they are powerful in name only.

306
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:27,590
Bayan received the power and authority of Prime Minister. The others were given prestige, that is all.

307
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,990
My uncle will not see it that way.

308
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:37,020
Prestige, depending on who uses it, can become a blade or a shield.

309
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,350
This decision was not made lightly.

310
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:47,220
We couldn't let the magistrates become His Majesty's enemies, could we?

311
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:55,980
If His Majesty turns his back on my uncle now, His Majesty will lose everything.

312
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:02,650
I do not believe Bayan is one to betray the emperor over something like this.

313
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:11,750
If these official recognitions have caused misunderstandings, please explain to your uncle.

314
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,380
Imperial Consort Ki would never betray me like this.

315
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:21,200
The magistrates have agreed to support Imperial Consort Ki being installed as the empress. How can you explain that?

316
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,670
Are you speaking the truth?

317
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,950
You will know immediately if you check.

318
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,890
Imperial Consort Ki is of Goryeo descent.

319
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,580
If a woman of Goryeo descent becomes empress, her child, Ayu, will become Crown Prince.

320
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,880
Then we will have an emperor who has Goryeo blood.

321
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,400
Only you can protect this nation.

322
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,350
You must do whatever it takes to prevent Imperial Consort Ki from becoming the empress.

323
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:03,280
Your king regained his throne. So congratulations are in order for you, too.

324
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,520
Thank you.

325
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,170
By the way, what is to be of Prince Maha?

326
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:17,030
It is unclear. If Imperial Consort Ki becomes empress,

327
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,300
there will be no one to take care of him.

328
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,220
Could I meet Prince Maha?

329
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,670
Why would you want to meet him?

330
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:32,130
Didn't His Majesty annihilate El Temur's entire clan?

331
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:38,190
His Majesty feels bad for having orphaned the little prince.

332
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,420
How could you look so like him?

333
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,820
Your nose, your lips...

334
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,080
Once Danashiri dies,

335
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,220
no one will protect you.

336
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,300
What are you to do, Your Highness?

337
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,810
Your Highness...

338
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,440
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager has arrived.

339
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,990
Why did you ask to meet me?

340
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:12,850
Please let my poor Maha live.

341
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:18,190
In this palace, the only one who can protect him

342
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,130
is you. There is no one but you.

343
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,950
Empress...

344
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:29,880
Maha has done nothing wrong.

345
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,160
As long as Maha is protected, I will not regret dying.

346
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,460
Court Lady Seo and Court Lady Yeon,

347
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,570
all they did was to take care of me.

348
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,340
Please let them live

349
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,970
so they can take care of my Maha.

350
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,470
You should get up now.

351
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,910
I am begging you desperately.

352
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,980
Please save my Maha, Your Highness.

353
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,020
Your Highness, Empress Dowager.

354
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,390
Please!

355
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,850
Your Highness, Empress Dowager!

356
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,910
Imperial Consort Ki is extraordinary.

357
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:31,440
With the emperor wrapped in her skirts, she is manipulating the magistrates like she is kneading dough.

358
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,820
She resurrected the "Three Excellencies" and shredded the power of the Prime Minister position.

359
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,140
How can you rule this kingdom with sincerity and loyalty alone?

360
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:48,380
So how about using this opportunity to become in-laws with the imperial family?

361
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,630
In-laws?

362
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:54,230
I heard that you have a kind and pretty niece.

363
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,680
If you can have her marry the emperor,

364
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,340
you can regain the power you lost to the "Three Excellencies."

365
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,960
Did you summon me? Why are you up so late at night?

366
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:26,680
Have my niece Bayan Khutugh begin receiving empress training.

367
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,070
I'm not happy with the way this kingdom is being run.

368
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,670
So I will have to grab power.

369
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,170
But Imperial Consort Ki will become empress—

370
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,210
What is the big deal about that Goryeo girl?

371
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,130
- Uncle.
- My mission is only

372
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,200
to make a powerful and prosperous kingdom.

373
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,770
I will not forgive anyone in my way. Imperial Consort Ki or anyone!

374
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,550
Why have you all come here?

375
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,530
Drag the sinner out.

376
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,190
Yes, Sir.

377
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:24,510
What are you doing? Won't you let go of me?

378
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,180
Your Majesty!

379
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,000
Your Majesty!

380
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,790
Your Majesty!!

381
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,880
How dare you?

382
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,350
I will not go! I will not go like this!

383
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,400
Your Majesty!

384
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,290
Let go. Let go of me!

385
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,560
What are you all looking at?

386
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,480
Do I make you laugh?

387
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,630
Do I look pitiful?

388
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:04,970
Get lost, you bitches! You deserve to be stoned to death!

389
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,510
Sinner Danashiri, accept the poison tonic.

390
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,050
Bring His Majesty! Right now!

391
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,340
Your Majesty? Where are you?

392
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,740
Please come out now.

393
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:53,380
Please come out and show your splendid face!

394
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,460
Your Majesty!

395
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:52,650
If you will not drink it, your mouth will be forced open and the tonic will be poured into it.

396
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,290
Your Majesty!

397
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,410
Your Majesty.

398
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,310
Your Majesty, you already killed my father and brother,

399
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,310
and avenged, your father, the late emperor's grudge.

400
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,230
So why are you trying to kill me?

401
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,260
Why am I killing you?

402
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:32,230
Listen well. You mercilessly killed pregnant Lady Park and many palace maids.

403
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,700
Is that all?

404
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:40,560
I cannot bring myself to speak of your many wicked deeds lest my mouth gets dirty!

405
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,190
And who made me like this?

406
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,150
Do you still not know?

407
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,510
You ignored me from the beginning and didn't even look at me.

408
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:04,360
You are the one who made me so vicious!

409
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,460
Oh, goodness.

410
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,960
So why am I the only sinner?

411
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,610
What did I do that was so wrong?

412
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,050
Why do I have to be the only one to die?

413
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,970
So you cannot repent your sins, even until the very end.

414
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,660
Later,

415
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:32,590
when Maha comes of age, what will you say?

416
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:40,390
Will you kill my son, too, for having evil blood in him?

417
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,080
Please repent your sins as well.

418
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,040
You are a sinner, too.

419
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,240
I cannot die like this, it is too unfair. So you drink the poison tonic!

420
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,450
Shut your mouth.

421
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,360
I'm so glad you came.

422
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,510
It's all your fault, you bitch.

423
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:17,590
You bewitched His Majesty to make your son the crown prince.

424
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:21,140
And that is why you made me like this.

425
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:26,600
Your Majesty, poison tonic is too good for Danashiri.

426
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,900
What did you say?

427
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,790
Immediately drag her out to the street and execute her by hanging.

428
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,670
Hanging?

429
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,490
So you intend to kill me twice, you bitch?

430
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,140
Execute Danashiri by hanging.

431
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,550
Your Majesty.

432
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,330
Your Majesty...

433
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,790
Your Majesty!

434
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,270
Please let me see my son, Maha.

435
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,580
It's my last wish.

436
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,620
Please let me see Maha. Please, I request you.

437
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,410
Where is your son?

438
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,880
Where do you mean? In the palace—

439
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,340
Your fake son would be there.

440
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:40,920
You murdered female monks to steal him, and he does not share a drop of blood with you.

441
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,680
That fake son.

442
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,140
See this clearly from the afterworld.

443
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:54,540
I will make sure to reveal that he is a fake imperial prince

444
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,450
and make sure to dry up and kill your clan.

Wang Yoo,

448
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,980
I resent you.

449
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,200
I...

450
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,080

I will not forgive you.

457
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:32,570
You and that Ki bitch,

458
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:39,140
I will curse you both forever.

459
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,430
Please blame me

If your footsteps

462
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,330
will become even a little lighter,

463
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,370
I will take all your curses.

464
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:07,510
Please don't come to my execution.

465

Danashiri...

477
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:46,130
If you lose your senses, we will all die, too.

478
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,250
Let go! Let go of me!

479
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,820
Let go! You bastards!

480
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,290
I am this kingdom's empress.

481
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,810
How can you be so disrespectful? Let go of me!

482
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:59,240
Take off the hood.

483
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,330
Kill El Temur's daughter!

484
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,780
Kill her! Kill her!

485
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,550
Danashiri!

486
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:14,150
Kill her!

487
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,960
Kill her!

488
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,180
Kill her!

489
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,550
Kill her!

490
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,150
Kill her!

491
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,300
Kill her!

492
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,740
Kill her! Kill her!

493
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:43,690
Sister, please forgive your brother for failing you.

494
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,100
I'm sorry.

495
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,620
I'm sorry, my sister, Danashiri.

496
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,280
Father...

497
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,400
Brother...

498
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,870
Where are you?

499
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,940
I am scared.

500
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:15,230
Lady Park, are you watching?

501
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:22,210
My poor friends... My poor son, Star...

502
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:26,380
Please rest in peace now.

503
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,900
Please stop your lament.

504
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,970
Brother...

505
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:39,180
Congratulations, Your Majesty the Empress.

506
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,580
I am not the empress.

507
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:46,270
You will be the empress after today. Why be surprised?

508
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:52,110
All in the inner court are excited to greet you as the new empress.

509
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:56,870
I intend to request His Majesty to promote all of you.

510
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,150
Really?

511
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,760
Thank you.

512
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:06,190
Then Prince Ayu will become the crown prince soon.

513
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,520
Baby, I will make sure to protect you.

514
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,010
Don't worry about anything.

515
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:24,180
I won't lose you because I didn't have power, like Star.

516
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:39,550
Maha,

517
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:46,590
you are the eldest son of this palace, an imperial descendant.

518
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:53,510
You will never lose the crown prince position to Ayu who has Goryeo blood.

519
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:58,170
Don't you have any doubt that Prince Maha is Danashiri's son?

520
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:01,320
You can't mistake maternal love, though.

521
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:10,560
In Danashiri's eyes, as she faced death, I saw desperate maternal love.

522
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,600
Your Highness!

523
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:20,670
The vassals have gathered in the Imperial Palace to discuss the investiture of the empress.

524
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,410
We'll be there soon.

525
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,470
Who will oppose Imperial Consort Ki's investiture as the empress?

526
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,570
Not only us, the Three Excellencies, but the other magistrates as well,

527
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,490
we will honor your decision, Your Majesty.

528
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:43,820
Please issue the edict right away, Your Majesty.

529
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:49,320
I feel confident thanks to all of you. I thank you all.

530
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,190
Your Majesty!

531
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:02,780
Her Highness the Empress Dowager is petitioning the emperor right now.

532
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,430
Petition?

533
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:11,230
Your Majesty, Imperial Consort Ki's investiture must not happen!

534
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:16,110
It is utterly unreasonable. Please hear my plea.

535
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:29,390
Empress Dowager, please get up.

536
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:34,130
Your Majesty, Imperial Consort Ki's investiture as the empress must not happen.

537
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,190
Why are you suddenly doing this?

538
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,940
You know what Imperial Consort Ki did for me...

539
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,470
I know it well.

540
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:42,670
She supported you and taught you how to read and write.

541
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:46,200
And she contributed more than anyone to pushing El Temur out.

542
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,680
So, why are you opposed to this?

543
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:56,000
How can you make an uncivilized Goryeo woman your lawful wife?

544
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,440
This is an affront to our late emperor.

545
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,990
As a protector of this Imperial Palace,

546
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:05,620
I cannot permit this, even if you plunged a dagger into my throat.

547
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,230
What are you all doing?

548
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:10,280
Escort Empress Dowager away.

549
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,320
If anyone touches me, I will not forgive you.

550
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,210
Empress Dowager!

551
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:18,040
Until you hear my plea,

552
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,680
I will not move a single step from here.

553
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:30,610
How can she oppose you of all people?

554
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,890
Don't worry.

555
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:44,810
Even if the sky splits in two, I will make sure you are seated on the empress's throne.

556
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:54,560
Welcome, Prime Minister.

557
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:00,230
I think you will have to help change Empress Dowager's mind.

558
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,810
What is this?

559
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:17,530
Is it a list of vassals who are opposed to Imperial Consort Ki's investiture as the empress.

560
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,470
All the magistrates including the "Three Excellencies" have agreed to it.

561
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,760
So who opposes it?

562
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,860
Please look at the list.

563
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,310
Prime Minister?

564
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:41,570
Aside from me, the lords of six states and members of the privy council are listed there.

565
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:49,360
If you insist on Imperial Consort Ki's investiture as the empress, you will have to kill everyone on that list.

566
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,860
Imperial Consort Ki is your adopted daughter, so how can you—

567
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,530
The empress must hail from the Khongirad tribe

568
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,730
in order to have legitimacy.

569
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:03,160
How can you ruin the kingdom due to mere affection?

570
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:09,380
Until the investiture of the empress, all marriages will be barred throughout the kingdom.

571
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:14,820
Is this because I am from Goryeo?

572
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:19,640
If not, did you always intend to devour me once the hunt was over?

573
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:25,110
Your Highness, you came to the palace to take revenge on El Temur.

574
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:30,600
And you've achieved everything you wanted.

575
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,490
So this is now just greed.

576
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,790
Your Highness, you will become Chief Imperial Consort.

577
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,340
Look here, Prime Minister.

578
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:44,380
That is the best I can do for you, Your Highness.

579
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,910
Yes, Prime Minister.

580
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:52,540
I understand your intentions.

581
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,820
Don't trust Bayan.

582
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:18,030
The fact that you are from Goryeo

583
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,610
will surely be a problem for Bayan.

584
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:44,300
Your Highness, candidates for the empress selection has begun.

585
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,300
Our clan's fate depends on this three-tier selection of the empress.

586
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:58,730
Make sure to become the empress and capture the emperor's heart.

587
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:02,150
I understand well, Uncle.

588
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,900
She is Prime Minister's niece.

589
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,570
She is said to be very beautiful, intelligent, and mild-tempered.

590
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:14,360
Rumors about her are rife.

591
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,980
His Majesty has come.

592
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:31,600
Please come out and greet him.

593
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,150
I am Bayan Khutugh.

594
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:06,230
As rumored, she is very beautiful, Your Majesty.

595
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,010
I am honored to meet you, Your Majesty.

596
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,850
Bayan, you said?

597
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

598
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:17,860
You will never be selected as the empress.

599
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,760
So you can return now.

600
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:30,520
Your Majesty, you will choose me.

601
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:36,650
Your Majesty, it's a relief that I like you.

602
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:50,470
Bayan sent an order to Goryeo and on the day of the marriage

603
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:53,290
Goryeo must send 300 tribute maids.

604
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,360
- Is that true?
- Yes, Your Highness.

605
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:06,630
Please send a message to Wang Yoo requesting a meeting.

606
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:45,140
The former king of Goryeo sent me a secret letter.

607
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:50,380
He requested that I join hands with you

608
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:54,160
and prevent Goryeo from being incorporated into Yuan.

609
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,790
You don't have to be concerned with that.

610
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:00,150
I will speak to Father.

611
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:04,580
Will you join hands with me?

612
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:13,720
For a while, I had forgotten their true origins.

613
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:19,000
I had been fighting to avenge my father.

614
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,840
But from now on, for the sake of the Goryeo people who are here

615
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:29,550
and for myself, I will fight.

616
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,430
Please make me the empress.

617
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:43,430
And please make my son the crown prince. I must climb to the highest ranks here.

618
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:52,390
Will you join hands with me?

619
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:06,960
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

620
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:14,560
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

621
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:19,880
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫
