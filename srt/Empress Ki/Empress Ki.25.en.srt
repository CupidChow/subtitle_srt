[Goryeo Ki Family Seung Nyang's Ancestral Tablet]

2
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,620
The Yuan merchants have also suffered greatly due to the counterfeit banknotes.

3
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,120
I am getting all the same reports.

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,220
El Temur is using Hawk House to control the purse strings of

5
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,050
not only Goryeo but other lands, too.

6
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,380
If it's revealed, it'll greatly help us bring the Provincial Magistrates to our side.

7
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,740
Hongga who sells the counterfeit banknotes is the first task we must tackle.

8
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,050
Have you heard from the men we sent to Liaoyang Province?

9
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,770
Maybe that Hongga bastard sensed something,

10
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,080
but he hasn't shown up in any of the taverns.

11
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,960
General Tanqishi is leaving for Yeongyeong.

12
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,410
For a while, I think I need to stay here.

13
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,560
Of course, you're a newlywed.

14
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,090
I will get my father, so take your time coming.

15
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,090
We are leaving for Liaoyang Province now.

16
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,940
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,920
Do you see any signs of him speaking again?

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,630
I apologize, Your Highness.

20
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,950
Your Majesty, just bear with it for a moment even if it's difficult.

21
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,070
Selecting the Imperial Concubine is important for the future.

22
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,390
Only give a flower to the one I signal and hand the rest money pouches.

23
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,970
The chosen ones receive the flowers and the eliminated get the money pouch.

24
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,550
Understand, Your Majesty?

25
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,730
Your Majesty, here are the preliminary royal concubines.

26
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,950
Yang.

27
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,790
Yang...

28
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,270
Are you able to... speak again?

29
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,520
Her Majesty the Empress!

30
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,870
It's all right, Your Majesty. Don't try so hard.

31
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,200
What brings you here?

32
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,570
I would like to take part as a judge in the imperial concubine selection.

33
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,720
It's the law of the inner court that you cannot participate in the—

34
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,830
I am well aware of it.

35
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,730
But it's my father's opinion that this time around,

36
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,200
the imperial concubine selection needs to be fair.

37
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,820
If you're unhappy with my participation, take it up with my father.

38
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,680
Why would I oppose fairness?

39
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,570
Listen, imperial concubine candidates.

40
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,160
There will be strict tests held throughout the selection process.

41
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,440
You will be chosen according to the method of competition.

42
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,780
The method of tests will be decided on after I discuss it with the empress.

43
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,810
Just know that.

44
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,450
Head Eunuch Dok Man, take the candidates to their rooms.

45
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,700
Yes, Your Highness.

46
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,020
Everyone, please follow me.

47
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,160
What were you thinking, returning to this dangerous place?!

48
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,130
My friends who set out to help me... died before my eyes screaming.

49
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,910
So? Are you saying you're seeking revenge for their deaths?

50
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,880
If I can, I should.

51
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,980
It'll be impossible on your own!

52
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,690
Why don't you know that an act of hasty revenge can bring about a greater misfortune?

53
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,880
Give up on becoming a imperial concubine.

54
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,700
My friends who died asked me to bring these letters to Goryeo on their behalf.

55
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:57,720
I am also fearful. Because of that fear, I wasn't going to come back here.

56
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:06,260
But... after seeing these letters, I couldn't go back there by myself in order to just save my own life.

57
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,160
As long as tribute girls are being taken, wrongful deaths will repeat themselves.

58
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,360
Even for the sake of stopping that from happening, someone from Goryeo from within the palace

59
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,640
needs to build up strength and gain power and fight against them!

60
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:35,280
Isn't that why... you also recommended Lady Park from Goryeo who was a court lady?

61
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,770
I... only did my duty as Head Eunuch of Yuan.

62
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:47,160
I know that you are hurt by the suffering of the people of Goryeo more than anyone else.

63
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,930
Why do you try to hide the blood that's thicker than water?

64
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,680
I won't ask you to help me.

65
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:04,820
Please know that I didn't come here to fulfill my own vain greed.

66
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,780
Mother, it's Gi Ok, the youngest.

67
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,080
I miss you, Mother.

68
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,300
I miss you so much.

69
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:48,190
Find out where Yang is.

70
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,380
Your Majesty, you can now—

71
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:09,360
That I can speak again, keep it a secret for now.

72
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,590
I understand.

73
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,320
I need to see Yang right away.

74
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,840
- Bring her to me.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,720
You must keep it a secret that His Majesty is able to speak again.

76
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,320
You were alive...

77
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,190
You were alive...

78
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,080
Do you know how I've been feeling all this time?

79
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,270
Though I was breathing, I wasn't alive.

80
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:34,130
Even though I slept, I didn't get rest; and even though I ate, I wasn't filled up.

81
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,690
Please let go.

82
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:42,020
I don't want to. I will never let you go again.

83
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,670
Never.

84
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:49,880
I didn't come back to the palace in order to be in your arms.

85
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,940
Then, why did you participate in the imperial concubine selection?

86
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,690
I want to take power away from El Temur's family.

87
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,790
Are you trying to use me for your revenge?

88
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,890
My revenge is also your revenge.

89
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:24,340
If you will help me, I will also do my utmost in serving you.

90
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,290
You once said you wanted my forgiveness.

91
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,760
I'm giving you that opportunity right now.

92
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,170
You've changed.

93
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:48,550
Anyone who has gone through what I've been through,

94
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,670
would also change.

95
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,110
I am sick and tired of trying to get revenge.

96
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,350
But you still must do it.

97
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,130
Enough.

98
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,940
That's enough.

99
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,560
Why do you hesitate so much?

100
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,260
Your Majesty, it's time for her to go back to her quarters.

101
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,870
Just worry about the selection.

102
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,380
If there are any difficulties, tell Golta.

103
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,560
He will help you.

104

[Notice to Recruit Guards]

105
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,860
Those merchants, not only dealing with slaves and murder-for-hire,

106
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,630
but they're known to be the most wicked people who are the best at doing things for money.

107
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,630
What is the notice about?

108
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,840
The Hawk House is recruiting guards.

109
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,730
- Guards?
- Yes.

110
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,820
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

111
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,100
Hongga that bastard has surfaced.

112
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,560
Where is he?

113
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,140
Boss, it's Hongga.

114
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,840
I told you to lay low.

115
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,090
My men are about to die from starvation. Give me some counterfeit money!

116
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,220
I told you that your identity has been exposed.

117
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,320
If it had, I would have been arrested already.

118
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,940
- What?
- If you won't give it to me, I will go to Heuksoo.

119
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,050
It's a place where all those in the know come.

120
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,440
I got word that Hongga has been coming by here and selling counterfeit money.

121
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:08,360
Your Majesty, that Hongga just left here.

122
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,740
Let's follow him.

[Wine]

124

Sell us some of your wine.

125
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,890
I'm a little thirsty.

126
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,690
Go to the tavern if you want a drink.

127
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Making such a big deal out of it...

128
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,960
Just sell us one, rascal.

129
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,610
This bastard.

130
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,620
Are you Hongga?

131
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,590
I'm a member of Hawk House.

132
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,950
Do you think you will live if you dare to touch a member?

133
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,890
I asked if you're Hongga.

134
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,440
Yes. Why?

135
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,090
Where is the counterfeit money made?

136
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,390
You're counterfeit hunters?

137
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,360
How dare you smirk?

138
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,150
Do you think...

139
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,160
I would ever open my mouth?

140
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,270
Oh...

141
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,420
Find the counterfeit money.

142
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,540
They're in here.

143
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,340
Counterfeit banknotes.

144
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,470
But why did you kill Hongga?

145
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,350
We need to get rid of the small players

146
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,550
and deal with Hawk House in person.

147
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,010
When are they recruiting the guards?

148
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,540
In two days.

149
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:38,390
That day... I will take their bodies

150
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,450
and send them to the head of Hawk House.

151
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,780
How do you plan on carrying out the Imperial Concubine selection this time?

152
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,500
The first round should be based on their facial features.

153
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,160
Then the second round should be—

154
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,890
I will set the question.

155
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,410
Do that then, Your Majesty.

156
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:07,170
You seem to treat me very calmly these days.

157
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,590
I have given up a lot while at Gameop Temple.

158
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:21,890
An innocent person would be fooled by your benevolent smile.

159
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,320
Your Majesty, I'm being sincere as I say this, so don't take this the wrong way.

160
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:35,330
If you look at the world in such a twisted way, there's no one who will take your side.

161
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:45,170
How about having the Imperial Academy pose the question for the third round?

162
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,510
Do what you like.

163
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,050
Then I will take my leave.

164
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,630
Return safely, Your Highness.

165
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,160
She offends me as much as ever.

166
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,270
But how many imperial concubines are you thinking about selecting?

167
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,180
Not even one wench will be selected.

168
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,320
Just watch and see. This selection...

169
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,890
will be as hard as a camel going through the eye of a needle.

170
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,070
Did you hear about where she rolled in from?

171
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,000
Is it true?

172
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,720
I also heard about her. It's ridiculous.

173
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,330
I heard you were a tribute.

174
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,060
Wow, I guess it's true.

175
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,990
What is this? You're making us look classless.

176
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,470
You should drop out while we're being nice.

177
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,110
Worry about yourselves, first.

178
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,610
What? Yourselves?

179
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,470
Did you just say "yourselves" to us?

180
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,530
Stop it.

181
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,000
No matter what our origins are, we're all in the same situation right now.

182
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,200
What are you talking about?

183
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,150
She's from Goryeo and was dragged here as a tribute girl!

184
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,330
Competing against the likes of her,

185
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,930
doesn't it hurt your pride?

186
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,170
The empress is here.

187
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,570
You are all very pretty.

188
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:55,250
Your attractiveness will become your poison.

189
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,900
What are you doing here?

190
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,460
Are you deaf? I asked what you're doing here.

191
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,930
Commander Bayan sent her.

192
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,820
Then the representative of Liaoyang Province is her?

193
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,350
I was surprised, too,

194
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,130
but it's only up to the Magistrate himself.

195
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,370
So what can we do?

196
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,890
All of you will compete to become imperial concubines through three stages of tests.

197
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,780
Lucky imperial concubines will bring about harmony in the palace,

198
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,670
but those with unfavorable facial features will bring about unhappiness.

199
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:04,000
Therefore, the first round will be based on your physiognomy.

200
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,010
But where are the administrators from the Justice Office?

201
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,760
They won't be coming.

202
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,130
Instead of them, I asked for artists to come.

203
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,370
What do you mean artists?

204
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,370
You yourself oversee the Justice Office.

205
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:34,050
I want to remove any suspicion that you were influencing them.

206
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,580
I didn't manage to think that far.

207
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,480
The artists will draw your portraits.

208
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,240
The physiognomists, without any prior knowledge,

209
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,320
will judge you solely based on your portraits.

210
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,050
That's how it will be done.

211
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,540
Did you see how taken aback Empress Dowager was?

212
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,910
I saw, Your Majesty.

213
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,210
I'm certain she colluded with the magistrates.

214
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:12,420
She's the very best at scheming.

215
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,630
You told the physiognomists to only select the unattractive ones?

216
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:22,260
They will be selected in the order of ugliness.

217
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,940
It's not because I'm jealous of their looks.

218
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,270
There's no one in the world whose looks you would ever be jealous of.

219
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,900
That's true. I am pretty attractive.

220
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,230
Maha. Sleep, sleep.

221
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,340
Only by looking at the portraits...

222
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,890
How will they know whose daughters they are?

223
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,990
It's become useless that Emperor Dowager set it up beforehand.

224
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,200
Don't worry too much.

225
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,230
Seung Nyang's physiognomy is very good, even by my eyes.

226
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,280
Your Majesty, the results are out.

227
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,530
Announce it.

228
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:35,660
Those who passed the first round are a total of seven.

229
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,500
Lady Seolhwa from Yunnan Province.

230
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,830
What happened?

231
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:52,450
She's not that pretty, please don't worry.

232
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,630
Lady Wuiso from Linbei Province.

233
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,820
Lady Moran from Sichuan Province.

234
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:07,850
Lady Mirang from Shaanxi Province. Lady Giae from Gansu Province.

235
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,040
Lady Jiran from Jiangxi Province.

236
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,060
And the last one...

237
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,580
is Ki Yang from Liaoyang Province.

238
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,930
Even that wench?

239
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,590
What happened? Didn't we tell them to pick only the ugly ones?

240
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:49,180
To me, they are all quite ugly.

241
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:58,350
The administrators will study everyone's physiognomy and grade each person.

242
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,790
The empress has become a judge for this round of the competition.

243
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:07,300
That was bothering me, too.

244
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,110
I thought it would be good to create a sign.

245
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,220
A sign?

246
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,740
Speak to Empress Dowager and to the concubines she wishes to be selected

247
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,610
to have them provide hair ornaments.

248
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,780
Even if something unexpected happens

249
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,370
that will be enough preparation.

250
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,490
I will speak to Empress Dowager.

251
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,260
Your Majesty.

252
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,450
Be happy. The results of the first round are very good.

253
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,980
What happened to the lady that Commander Bayan nominated?

254
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,440
Of course, she passed.

255
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:04,380
Commander Bayan said that she saved your life in Goryeo.

256
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,350
Is that true?

257
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,370
She's a remarkable girl.

258
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,310
Without her wisdom,

259
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,770
we would not have gotten the results we wanted for this first round.

260
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:26,240
Your Majesty, this selection is not merely about imperial concubines,

261
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,350
it will become a gem that will strengthen your Imperial power.

262
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,190
So know that and be at ease.

263
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,720
He has passed out from drinking too much.

264
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,140
When will he begin to speak?

265
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,460
His Majesty has no desire to speak at all.

266
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,460
You can go now.

267
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,180
He has become practically an invalid.

268
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,010
It's a good thing.

269
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:17,150
I was planning to announce his abdication on the crown prince's first birthday, anyway.

270
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,770
Isn't that too early?

271
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,630
Do you think I'll live a thousand years?

272
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:29,270
The imperial concubine selection is for holding the daughters of magistrates as hostages in preparation for abdication.

273
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,120
So you persuade Empress Dowager.

274
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,200
I understand.

275
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,280
But why are you even deceiving Empress Dowager

276
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,720
and pretending to still have aphasia?

277
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,260
I will tell you later.

278
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,130
I'm looking forward to seeing what you planned for the second round of the competition.

279
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:21,250
I will ask them to answer a question that befits this position. Don't worry.

280
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,840
Have you heard the news about Hwanggak Temple?

281
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,830
What news would that be?

282
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,130
There was a fire in the hermitage you stayed at

283
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,430
and all the nuns there died.

284
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,330
You didn't know?

285
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,250
Who would do such a horrible thing?

286
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,480
No one found out who did it,

287
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,200
but I expect the heavens will punish that person severely.

288
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,120
Save us, merciful Buddha.

289
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:10,430
Is that old lady trying to find me out?

290
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,530
Be calm, Your Majesty.

291
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:18,170
Empress Dowager will never find out about Hwanggak Temple.

292
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,900
The empress received fertility treatments, you say?

293
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,030
Yes. I heard it from the imperial doctor himself.

294
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,560
Are you still suspicious?

295
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,710
Discreetly find out about the fire at Hwanggak Temple.

296
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,110
Seeing the empress's behavior,

297
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,120
she is deeply involved with that incident.

298
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,380
Yes, I understand.

299
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,530
Your Majesty.

300
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,030
I will enter Hawk House.

301
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,050
Can you do it alone?

302
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:13,880
I doubt I will lose to those brutes in sword-fighting.

303
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,110
You must never underestimate them.

304
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,620
You could lose your life with one mistake.

305
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:28,260
My life... I will leave with you, Your Majesty.

306
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,460
Anyone else! Come fight me!

307
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,830
He's very skilled.

308
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,380
Is there anyone else who will face him?

309
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,730
Let me have a fight with you.

310
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,630
Where are you from?

311
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:17,440
Someone who followed the smell of blood and got some food instead.

312
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,030
Fine. Why don't you give it a try?

313
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,820
I think we found our man.

314
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,230
What's your name?

315
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,070
I'm Choi from Goryeo.

316
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,850
Come here. I like you.

317
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,210
I'll give you a drink.

318
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,830
That was easy.

319
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:25,420
He sure is talented like no other.

320
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,250
Is that Heuksoo?

321
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,750
Yes. He even looks dismal.

322
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,310
Who's that next to him?

323
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,020
I don't think he's from Liaoyang.

324
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,030
Your Majesty, they're here.

325
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,310
Sir.

326
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,520
Hongga was attacked.

327
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,050
Was it bandits?

328
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:36,810
Among the bandits around here, there isn't anyone who would do this.

329
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,270
The counterfeit banknotes they stole have our special mark only we know about.

330
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,810
They will surely use them,

331
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,140
so watch the banknotes being spent in the marketplace.

332
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,110
Yes, Sir!

333
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:54,790
How dare they without any fear...

334
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,400
The second round is a test

335
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,000
to see your character.

336
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,990
Make and bring the most valuable food within the palace.

337
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,010
I will give you 2 shijin. (4 hours)

338
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,070
Head Eunuch, please observe the time.

339
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

340
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:41,680
It's 2 shijin. If you go over that, you'll be disqualified.

341
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,820
Please begin.

342
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,690
Where's the kitchen?

343
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:12,070
These ladies will take you to your assigned kitchens and assist you.

344
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,980
Hurry up and guide them.

345
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,070
Please come this way.

346
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:33,940
Where are you going?

347
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,670
I'm taking her to the kitchen, My Lady.

348
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,480
The kitchen assignment is over.

349
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,690
There isn't a kitchen for you.

350
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,160
My Lady, we're in the middle of a competition.

351
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,920
Close your mouth and remain quiet.

352
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,660
Why? Are you sour?

353
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,080
Not only is it sour, but it's bitter for me to see your face.

354
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:59,170
Let me in the kitchen right away.

355
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,750
You're going to strike me at this rate.

356
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,420
I'm not just a court lady but an Upper Court Lady now.

357
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,700
I'm addressed as "My Lady."

358
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,570
Assign me to the kitchen I said.

359
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,800
Here. If you feel wronged, strike me back.

360
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,260
I don't have any worries since the empress cares for me,

361
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,040
but you'll probably get thrown out right away.

362
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,320
Imperial concubine? How dare you dream of such things?

363
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,200
If you become an imperial concubine, I will burn all my fingers.

364
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,420
I'll be sure to remember what you said.

365
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,400
Before that, find the kitchen for yourself.

366
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,020
You've probably never set foot in it.

367
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,680
What are you going to do without a kitchen?

368
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,950
Hong Dan, hurry up.

369
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,670
We have no ingredients, and it's nearly time!

370
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,920
What are we going to do?

371
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,060
It's time.

372
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,570
Disqualify the girl who's not here yet. You may begin.

373
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,890
I said start!

374
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

375
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,040
- Today's competi—
 - Wait!

376
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,360
I apologize for being late.

377
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,290
Hurry up and take your place.

378
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:26,060
Today's round will be scored by Empress Dowager and the empress.

379
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,790
His Majesty wishes to also take part.

380
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,670
I understand.

381
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,340
Everyone, please reveal your dish

382
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,480
and please explain the reason behind it.

383
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,400
Please start there.

384
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:52,390
It's sweet rice cake made with ginseng, Chinese pearl barley, and hyacinth beans.

385
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:56,270
Everything goes well if your stomach is comfortable.

386
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:03,700
It strengthens the stomach and protects your energy, I think sweet rice cake is the best food.

387
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,420
[Three]

388
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,120
[One]

389
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,170
Next, Lady Moran.

390
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,270
The duck is known to strengthen the energy and help to release the poisons.

391
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:27,570
Since I added ginseng, there's no better health food.

392
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:32,000
It's beef and pine mushrooms.

393
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,510
[Two]

394
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,070
It's made with shark's fin.

395
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,350
Lady Seolhwa.

396
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,920
It's a soup made by boiling about 30 different types of delicacies with wine.

397
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,970
Even though Yuan is divided into 10 different provinces and each has its own customs,

398
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:57,560
just as several ingredients are brought together and make up one taste,

399
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,480
it's my wish that we be united and harmonious.

400
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,390
[Four]

401
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,500
[Four]

402
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,610
[One]

403
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:19,060
Last, Lady Ki Yang.

404
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,130
What's that?

405
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,220
It's salt.

406
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,150
Salt?

407
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,400
All the dishes presented here contain salt.

408
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,440
Like salt which melts itself to bring out others' taste,

409
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,650
the people of this country long for the Imperial Emperor's upright ruling

410
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:10,050
and his warm interest.

411
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:16,690
Your Majesty, like the salt that is needed in every dish,

412
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:23,070
please have mercy on your subjects that will melt their hearts.

413
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,110
Silence! How dare you trick us?!

414
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:39,490
She's not tricking us. Aren't those words worth engraving into our hearts?

415
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:44,050
I told them to bring the most valuable food in the palace.

416
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,190
Salt is also a food.

417
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,450
[Five]

418
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,050
[Five]

419
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:08,800
How can you call it food when there was no care or effort put into it?

420
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:18,130
That food deserves a fail grade.

421
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,360
Empress!

422
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,060
I gave the question for this round.

423
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,310
If you disrespect that authority, I also

424
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,420
can't let the competition continue.

425
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,240
Welcome, Your Majesty.

426
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,410
Is it going well?

427
00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:02,120
Yes. As you asked, we're preparing a very difficult question.

428
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,080
Come in.

429
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:14,060
Until the third round is over, the Kheshigs will guard the premises.

430
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,960
Pardon? Your Majesty.

431
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:22,740
Without my permission, you may not meet anyone or set foot out of this room.

432
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,730
Understand?

433
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

434
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,390
I will take good care of you.

435
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,480
Is the question for the third round that difficult?

436
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,130
The empress told the administrators to make it so.

437
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:46,510
But Empress Dowager must have prepared for it!

438
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,550
Seung Nyang won't be able to become an imperial concubine.

439
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,080
She failed the second round, too...

440
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,000
She's a bright person.

441
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,200
No matter how bright, it's supposed to be difficult for even scholars.

442
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,850
I will explain the third round of the competition.

443
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:41,290
There is a profound meaning in the painting you see in front of you.

444
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:46,210
You need to write down what that is.

445
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,290
Please begin.

446
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,660
Do you know what meaning it contains?

447
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,380
It's obviously Taepyeongsungdae.
(T/N: An era in which the people are at peace with the rule of a benevolent and kind king)

448
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,350
It's peaceful.

449
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:29,160
Then Taepyeongsungdae?

450
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,550
There's no way the Justice Office's administrators would give such an easy question.

451
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,710
What is it then?

452
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,350
What is that painting trying to say?

453
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,460
That was easier than I thought.

454
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,510
I know.

455
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,900
But why is she simmering so long?
(T/N: taking so much time)

456
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,050
I hear when they make rice in Korea, they let it simmer for quite a while.

457
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,990
She's intelligent. Why can't she solve something so easy?

458
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,310
There's a cow, house, and they're cooking.

459
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:23,040
Even the Bodhisattva is wearing expensive clothes and smiling.

460
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,030
You can tell by one look that it's Taepyeongsungdae.

461
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:30,600
That's not the answer.

462
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,300
It's not?

463
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:42,380
Head Eunuch, what's taking so long?

464
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,920
We can't give you any more time.

465
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,710
Please submit your answer.

466
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:03,920
The farmer couple that's preparing dinner and the smiling Bodhisattva.

467
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:12,890
That scene... I feel like I've seen it somewhere.

468
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:38,470
Maewoonapsae Jeolokchi.

469
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:42,250
Yeocheonbulgeup Myeongnyeongi.

470
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,960
Baekuiseonin Jaegodang.
(T/N: poem by Su Tung-Po)

471
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,570
General, you made a long trip back.

472
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:56,510
Yes. Is there anything to report?

473
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,540
There's a huge problem.

474
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,300
What do you mean?

475
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,510
Seung Nyang is alive

476
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,410
and competing in the imperial concubine selection.

477
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:14,660
What? Seung Nyang is alive?

478
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,670
She is?

479
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:25,970
But... what do you mean the imperial concubine selection? What province is she representing?

480
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,680
Welcome. Was your trip to Goryeo successful?

481
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,880
What's the reason you allowed Seung Nyang to represent Liaoyang Province?

482
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,800
Oh, my niece has a skin problem.

483
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,810
The emperor has a fondness for her, too, so—

484
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,790
Bayan! Are you crazy?

485
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:48,860
I'm perfectly fine.

486
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,990
I think you're the one who's confused.

487
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:54,390
- What?
- You've become fearless now that you're a magistrate!

488
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,660
We don't know whether she will become an imperial concubine or not.

489
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,210
What's the reason you're so opposed to it?

490
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:06,990
That girl hid Jeokho and looked for the bloodletter! She is wielding a sword toward my father!

491
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:13,740
She said she was looking for the bloodletter in order to help restore Wang Yoo's throne by making a contribution.

492
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,340
And you believe her?

493
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,170
That girl told me to relay this to you when I saw you again.

494
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:25,630
That she will never speak about the death of Lady Park.

495
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,310
Just by your reactions, I guess you are all accomplices.

496
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,250
Silence!

497
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,320
Keeping me silent is up to you.

498
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:44,360
Seung Nyang said she would keep it a secret, but I can't promise you that I will.

499
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:50,650
Let's bury what needs to be kept buried.

500
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:55,480
The great General Tanqishi shouldn't let something like this make him so nervous.

501
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,610
It's all right. Don't get up.

502
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,020
How is the competition going?

503
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:20,950
Yang got a fail grade, so it looks like it'll be hard for her to become an imperial concubine.

504
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,790
If she can't become an imperial concubine,

505
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:28,450
there's no need for me to stay here and become a eunuch.

506
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:32,080
You still have the results of the third round left to await.

507
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:37,850
It seems... Yang got the answer wrong on that, too.

508
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,940
Everyone else wrote down Taepyeongsungdae,

509
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:56,080
and only Lady Ki wrote something different.

510
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:04,120
Your Majesty, the administrators decided to hear Lady Ki's explanation for her answer

511
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,280
before giving our grades.

512
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:17,190
Lady Ki, please come out to the front.

513
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:27,690
Please explain to us why you gave your answer.

514
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:35,140
In that painting, where the firewood should be is empty.

515
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,700
She's making fire with the wood from breaking down the house,

516
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:46,860
and the farmer is trying to sell the cow that's their only property.

517
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:55,660
Therefore, Maewoonapsae Jeolokchi,
(I sold the cow to pay taxes)

518
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:59,560
Yeocheonbulgeup Myeongnyeongi,
(and used the house as firewood)

519
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:08,610
Baekuiseonin Jaegodang. I wrote Su Tung-Po's poem as my answer.  (I never thought I'd experience hunger in the coming year)

520
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:17,740
Your Majesty, among the seven answers that were submitted,

521
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:22,650
only this one is correct!

522
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:26,610
It deserves a perfect grade!

523
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,280
Adding up the administrators' grades with the physiognomy grades,

524
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,970
as well as the grades from the question given by the empress,

525
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:48,060
we will make the final selection.

526
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:53,500
Everyone may leave until the results are finalized.

527
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

528
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:00,180
Please follow me.

529
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,710
The upper-level merchants are here.

530
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:27,100
Tell them I'll be right there.

531
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,150
Yes, Boss.

532
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,800
Ask the guard to get us information on the deal.

533
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,820
Yes, Sire.

534
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:45,270
You will need to go to the government office tomorrow early.

535
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:50,990
Well... Bayan isn't in Liaoyang right now.

536
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,320
Where did he go?

537
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,960
The imperial concubine selection is being carried out, so he went to Daedo.

538
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,990
Imperial concubine selection?

539
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,860
You are...

540
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,480
Huh? Batoru?

541
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,790
Can't you give us a hint about the result?

542
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:35,540
Only the emperor knows the result.

543
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:40,660
If you get a money pouch from the emperor, you've been eliminated, and if you get a flower, you've been selected.

544
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:47,270
You failed the second round, so it would be best to give up any hope.

545
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,930
Please step forward one by one close to His Majesty.

546
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:50,400
Not even one has been chosen.

547
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:36,560
♫ Carried on the wind, you are heard ♫

548
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,620
♫ Ceaselessly falling  ♫

549
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:44,460
♫ Drip Drip Drip ♫

550
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,030
♫ In the sound of the rain  ♫

551
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:50,520
♫ for a long time after  ♫
