1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,250
Give me the sword.

2
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,340
With this sword,

3
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,860
I also will fight to the death.

4
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,220
You cannot, Your Majesty.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,940
We will put our lives on the line and protect you.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,690
Please leave it to us, Your Majesty.

7
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:37,550
Then... can you promise me that none of you will die?

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,680
No. I will now give an imperial order.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,760
Don't commit disloyalty by making me sad over your deaths.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,380
Your Majesty...

11
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,490
You must survive and share the glory of killing El Temur!

12
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,420
Yes, Your Majesty. We will uphold the imperial order!

13
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,810
Tell me in detail about what we should do.

14
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:17,180
First, we need weapons for the eunuch warriors to protect this place.

15
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,530
Weapons?

16
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:25,180
Lord Jang, please find some weapons with the eunuchs and bring them to the Women's Pavilion.

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,170
Carefully.

18
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,660
Lady Oh, put the grains into sacks with the servants.

19
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,870
We are going to block the doors into the Women's Pavilion, so you will have to fill them up.

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,800
In case of fire arrows,

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,940
please don't forget to place firefighting water throughout the Women's Pavilion.

22
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,100
Our opponents are highly trained soldiers.

23
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,910
How can we win with mere warrior eunuchs?

24
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:10,310
Once Officer Bayan gets to the capital, he will storm this place first.

25
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,430
It's a fight... to hold on until then.

26
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,740
But... why is His Majesty so late?

27
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,580
It's the first time having a drink alone with you.

28
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,630
Wine makes people open-minded, so tell me candidly.

29
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,260
Do you still seek full authority?

30
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,520
Yes, I do.

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,260
I'm the emperor after all. I would like to give imperial orders using the imperial seal myself.

32
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:59,450
Once you ascended the throne, you had made many mistakes toward me.

33
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,670
But do you know why you're still sitting on the throne?

34
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,080
Because you let go of authority.

35
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,090
If I wasn't around and you had ruled over this country,

36
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,620
someone else would have been seated on the throne by now.

37
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,900
And Bayan probably would have been in my seat.

38
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,150
Authority is like a terrible curse that brings about death.

39
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,060
I am bearing that mishap and driving the misfortune away.

40
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:39,360
If you don't know to be grateful and act up, it will disappoint me.

41
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,540
What happened to the rebel forces?

42
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,260
They're fighting right now.

43
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,210
But where are you going?

44
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,590
I'm going to the prime minister to tell him the news.

45
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,850
I just came from telling him myself, so you don't need to go.

46
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,950
No, it's the order of General Won Jin that I should—

47
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,430
If El Temur finds out, it'll be dangerous for all those inside the palace.

48
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,510
You don't need to worry.

49
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,590
Our soldiers are stationed at each gate.

50
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,060
Put on the bands so that Bayan's soldiers can

51
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,090
recognize us easily.

52
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,570
Put on your headbands!

54
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,610
Yes, Sir!

55
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,160
Shoot!

56
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,830
Attack!

57
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,350
Get over that wall!

58
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,440
Pour the oil!

59
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,670
Where is Wang Yoo?!

60
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,930
Shoot the fire arrows!

61
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,140
Set them on fire and kill them all!

62
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,770
Uncle, please tell them to retreat.

63
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,010
Once they light the fire, all the soldiers will burn to death.

64
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,360
Retreat!

65
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,000
Retreat!

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,280
Retreat!

67
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,250
Fall into the fires of hell.

68
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,970
Archers forward!

69
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,200
Get away from the archers and retreat now!

70
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,760
Shoot!

71
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,790
It's Wang Yoo! Stop him!

72
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,990
We must get through that gate.

73
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,820
Kill everyone who tries to stop us!

74
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,220
Come at me whoever you are. I will kill you all!

75
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,670
Captain.

76
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,190
Yes, General!

77
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,390
Protect this gate. Rest of you come with me!

78
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,800
I think Wang Yoo has mobilized his troops.

79
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,950
It's time. Let's get into the palace.

80
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,470
Stop them!

81
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,780
Wang Yoo!

82
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,430
If you want to go through this gate, you will have to die and become a spirit!

83
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,000
The situation isn't good.

84
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,210
We need just one person to open the palace gate.

85
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,200
I will take the lead and make way.

86
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,010
I will do it with him.

87
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,810
I will cover them.

88
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,950
Everyone listen.

89
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:19,000
If we open it with one try, we will lose 10 people.

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,150
If we open with two tries, half of us will die.

91
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:29,690
If we try three times, everyone will die and we will fail.

92
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,040
Don't die. We only have one chance.

93
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,940
Yes, Sir!

94
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,060
These bastards, I will kill them all.

95
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,350
Follow me!

96
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,160
Block them!

97
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,370
Go!

98
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,000
Father!

99
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,510
Brother sent a messenger hawk.

100
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,250
A messenger hawk? Wasn't he out arresting Bayan?!

101
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,400
Take a look at this.

102
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,020
The magistrates have all taken Bayan's side?

103
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,640
In order to gain military power, he fooled us by scheming with the emperor!

104
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,970
Any news from the Capital Defence Force?

105
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,510
No news yet.

106
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,950
Tell Wang Yoo and Won Jin that the rebel forces will be here soon.

107
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,540
Tanqishi will get here with a large army, so if we hold out for a day, we should be able to destroy them.

108
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,060
Yes, Prime Minister!

109
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,890
Go and kill the emperor, the empress dowager, that Ki wench, and all the royal concubines right now!

110
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,670
Father, what are you planning to do?

111
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,460
The magistrates are rebelling by scheming with the emperor.

112
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,850
Who will protect the people within the capital?

113
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,720
Then...

114
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,110
The heavens gave me a justification to kill the emperor. Understand?

115
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,470
Yes, Father.

116
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,690
I will kill them all.

117
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,620
Let's go!

118
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,410
Yes, Sir!

119
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,650
The emperor went to the Women's Pavilion.

120
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,390
That's good for us.

121
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,460
Gather the soldiers.

122
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,270
We will massacre them all together at the Women's Pavilion.

123
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,490
Yes, General!

124
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,820
Your Majesty!

125
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,560
Your Majesty!

126
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,560
Your Majesty!

127
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,530
What's with all the fuss in the middle of the night?

128
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,310
It's not the time for you to be sleeping.

129
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,460
There's a coup within the palace!

130
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,550
Coup?

131
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,880
Prime Minister has ordered for the emperor to be killed!

132
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,260
Why all of a sudden?!

133
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,590
I don't know the details,

134
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:24,490
but he has ordered for the emperor, the empress dowager, and that Ki wench to be killed.

135
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,130
What are we to do about this?

136
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,110
What do you mean?

137
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:39,630
Father will take care of it all, so all we have to do is watch.

138
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,230
In this world where the emperor and that wench don't exist,

139
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,770
all I have left to do is live in wealth and prosperity for the rest of my life.

140
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,630
You are quite right, Your Majesty.

141
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,220
Your Majesty.

142
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,450
Are you done with all the preparations?

143
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,030
Yes, Sire. We are fully ready.

144
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:35,060
My incompetence is making all of you suffer like this.

145
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:41,760
Please do not say that, Your Majesty. We will be with you until the end.

146
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,970
Thank you, everyone.

147
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,950
The emperor is inside the Women's Pavilion!

148
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,060
Kill them all!

149
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,380
Harder. Harder!

150
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,350
Harder!

151
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,230
It's impossible to open it from the outside.

152
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,560
Climb over the wall!

153
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,790
Yes, General!

154
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,940
Get over the wall and attack!

155
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,790
What soldiers are inside those walls?!

156
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,670
There aren't any soldiers, just servants and eunuchs!

157
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,240
Keep climbing over the wall!

158
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,660
What are you doing? Hurry up!

159
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,470
Attack them!

160
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,250
Save us, merciful Buddha.

161
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,500
Save us, merciful Buddha.

162
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:30,640
Maha, soon you will become the emperor of this country.

163
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:39,590
I will become Regent and lead the state affairs well,

164
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,090
so do not worry about anything and keep growing up.

165
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,660
My son, Maha.

166
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:12,520
Don't leave anyone alive and kill them all!

167
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,320
I will guard this place, so please go to the Cold Palace.

168
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,960
I will not retreat anymore.

169
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,700
Hurry up and attend to His Majesty.

170
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,510
- Your Majesty.
- Even if I die,

171
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,980
I will die here.

172
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,890
Don't give up!

173
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:03,350
The moment you give up, you will die by the enemy's hands! Fight until the end!

174
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,920
Find the emperor!

175
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,830
Yes, Sir!

176
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,920
The emperor is locked up in the Women's Pavilion.

177
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,580
To the Women's Pavilion!

178
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,180
Yes, Sir!

179
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,380
If this really is the will of the heavens,

180
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,650
how can I refuse?

181
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,720
Yes, I will

182
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,660
become the emperor of this country.

183
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,700
Until my last breath,

184
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:47,390
I will recover the prosperity of this great empire.

185
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,660
Prime Minister!

186
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,440
You must get away from here right away.

187
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,990
What do you mean? What are you talking about?

188
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,320
The Capital Defense Force has been wiped out.

189
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,900
Is that true?

190
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,160
Bayan's soldiers just went over to the Women's Pavilion.

191
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,430
You must get out of here in order to survive.

192
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,470
Put down your swords.

193
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:54,160
I am the emperor of this country. How dare you wield that sword at me?

194
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:02,700
My father ordered me to kill everyone.

195
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,200
Then... who will kill me?

196
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,820
Will you?

197
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,150
If not,

198
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,110
will you kill me?

199
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,230
You think I can't kill you?

200
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,450
Whoever cuts the emperor's head off, I will give 10,000 nyang of gold!

201
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,310
Hurry up and kill everyone!

202
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,290
Your Majesty! Where are you?!

203
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,340
Your Majesty!

204
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,190
Your Majesty.

205
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,310
Don't move!

206
00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:00,930
If you take one more step, I will kill the emperor.

207
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,250
Command Bayan to pull back his soldiers.

208
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,920
If you don't do it right now, everyone will die!

209
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,730
- Your Majesty.
- I command, to El Temur's soldiers,

210
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,680
whoever throws down their sword and surrenders, I will spare.

211
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,290
But whoever keeps taking part in the conspiracy,

212
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:31,570
I will find each and every member of your family and relatives,

213
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,780
and wipe out the whole tribe.

214
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,610
Kill him.

215
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,480
Put down your swords.

216
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,660
Kill the emperor I said!

217
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,800
It's an imperial order!

218
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,520
Hurry up and put down your swords.

219
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,540
What are you doing?

220
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,820
Hurry up and hold the sword!

221
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,990
But...

222
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,680
Don't come near me!

223
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:25,430
Talahai, I will end your sorry life.

224
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,570
Your Majesty, I was late.

225
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,500
Forgive my disloyalty!

226
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,960
Forgive our disloyalty, Your Majesty!

227
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,910
Go arrest and El Temur for high treason.

228
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,500
I will uphold the imperial order!

229
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,740
Prime Minister, the north gate has already been occupied!

230
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,920
Prime Minister, there's the south gate.

231
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,690
Let's head to the south gate.

232
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,850
To the south gate!

233
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,810
Yes, Sir!

234
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,420
Prime Minister, the south gate has already been occupied, too!

235
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:14,590
All eight gates of the capital have been occupied by the magistrates.

236
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,570
There's no way to get out of the capital.

237
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,430
What should we do, Prime Minister?

238
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,180
I am extremely tired.

239
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,350
I think I need to go home and sleep.

240
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,500
Prime Minister!

241
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,550
It's the Capital Defense Force!

242
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,870
It's Wang Yoo's army!

243
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,550
Wang Yoo has come!

244
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,220
There's no time to waste.

245
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,460
Before Bayan's soldiers get here, we need to get out of—

246
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,620
His Majesty is waiting for you inside.

247
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,290
Even you... Wang Yoo...

248
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,950
Even you betrayed me!

249
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,430
Would you like a drink?

250
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,830
I had a huge dream along with you.

251
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:18,920
I thought you of all people would become a great man who could assist my grandson Maha.

252
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,500
I believed that you would be the golden stroke in my ambitious dream.

253
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,970
We had the end goal in our sights,

254
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,900
and yet, you turned your back on me just to get reinstated as king of Goryeo that's the size of a palm.

255
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,040
You're foolish and stupid.

256
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,990
Goryeo is my everything.

257
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,040
You tramped on that Goryeo.

258
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,750
My dream and my future and my hope

259
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:49,040
were all trampled on by you.

260
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,210
You can dream again,

261
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,670
but the heavens won't give the same opportunity twice.

262
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,080
Let me out of the palace.

263
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,110
There is still an army by the thousands in the capital who follow me.

264
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:08,340
I even have a sufficient amount of funds that I can use to rule over the universe.

265
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,770
If you help me once, I will give you everything you want.

266
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,160
Whether that's being the king of Goryeo or something more than that!

267
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,240
What are you thinking about doing if you gain back authority?

268
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,550
I will kill the emperor and become the emperor myself.

269
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,970
And then?

270
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:35,610
This all came about because of an insignificant person.

271
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,890
That Ki wench!

272
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:43,020
That wench... I will rip to shreds.

273
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,600
Hurry up and drink that wine.

274
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,950
It's the last drink I am giving you on this earth.

275
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,900
Why is there no news?

276
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,740
If there's a coup, I should have heard something by now.

277
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm sure there are no issues.

278
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,900
I will go and find out secretly.

279
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:31,170
Never mind everything else. Check and see if that Ki wench is alive or dead.

280
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,600
If she's not yet dead,

281
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,830
I will give her a miserable death, so tell them to keep her alive for me.

282
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

283
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,520
Why are you so surprised?

284
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,660
Did you wish for my death or something?

285
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,690
What did you say?

286
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,600
Are you crazy?

287
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,300
How dare you speak like that to the empress?!

288
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,040
Shut up.

289
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,190
Are you wishing for death?!

290
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,930
Your father tried to kill the emperor by inciting a revolt.

291
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,770
What happened to my father?

292
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:31,160
Just wait. You'll see him soon in hell.

293
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,090
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

294
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,890
Your Majesty.

295
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,780
Take her away.

296
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,760
Get her.

297
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,270
Let go! Let go!

298
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,270
Let me go!

299
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,580
Let me go!

300
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,850
Let me go, I said!

301
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,480
How dare you!

302
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,620
Let me go!

303
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,520
You're going to pull our hair out!

304
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,130
Please let go!

305
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,730
What do you think you're doing?

306
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,840
Let me go!

307
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,110
Let me go, I said!

308
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,570
I'm the lawful empress of this country

309
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,410
and the mother of the firstborn of the imperial family.

310
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:23,480
You cannot do this to me because of my father's mistake.

311
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,030
His Majesty ordered for your dethronement.

312
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,820
Dethronement?

313
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,880
What sin have I committed that I should be dethroned?

314
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,230
Are you saying that because you don't know what treason means?

315
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,420
It's high treason that causes nine generations of the clan to be wiped out!

316
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:54,530
If it's family, then my father's son-in-law, the emperor, should be punished, too.

317
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:59,050
Such strange thinking... You still haven't realized what you've done.

318
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,010
I feel wronged.

319
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,620
I have never committed any sin.

320
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,960
Wronged? Look me in the eyes.

321
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,090
You still don't know what sin you've committed?

322
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,710
I don't.

323
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:18,110
No, before God, my conscience is—

324
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,050
Take this wench and lock her up at the Cold Palace.

325
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,930
Let go! I will go on my own!

326
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,660
Don't be triumphant.

327
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:38,920
Until my last breath, this fight is not over yet.

328
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:47,340
To me, that sounds like you're asking me to end your life.

329
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,180
I will fulfill your wish, so don't worry.

330
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,640
Let go! Let me go!

331
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:20,060
She's quite something.

332
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,760
No. She's scary.

333
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,770
It's the imperial order to arrest the criminal.

334
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,890
Untie him.

335
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,740
Uncle.

336
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:04,590
It's my last courtesy to you.

337
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,360
The emperor has also asked for you to come.

338
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,750
You are the main reason we were successful.

339
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:40,380
I would like to get some rest and feed my soldiers.

340
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,630
I will come to ask you again then.

341
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,810
Let's go!

342
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,720
Yes, Sir!

343
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,270
It's El Temur, the traitor! He ruined our country!

344
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,960
He bled us dry!

345
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,850
Let's kill him!

346
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,770
Kil him!

347
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,770
Kill him!

348
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,550
Stop!

349
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,870
Long live General Bayan!

350
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,390
Long live General Bayan!

351
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,090
Long live General Bayan!

352
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,580
Hurray, General Bayan!

353
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,770
Hurray! Hurray!

354
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,750
Long live the emperor!

355
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,460
Hurray! Hurray!

356
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,000
Hurray!

357
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,070
You said the public sentiment was divine will.

358
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,480
The public sentiment of the capital here is the result of

359
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,430
how you ruled this country for the past 30 years.

360
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:01,540
Your true sin is not regicide but maladministration.

361
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,290
For ruining the country with poor politics.

362
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:10,050
Bayan, do you remember?

363
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:15,220
A while back, I suppressed the rebel forces and returned in triumph.

364
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,020
At that time, the public praised me endlessly.

365
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,660
They wanted me to run this country instead of the weak emperor.

366
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,060
Now, the people praise you.

367
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:37,160
But one day, they will point their fingers at you and criticize you.

368
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,130
They will say they had a better life when I was around

369
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,990
and miss those days.

370
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:51,760
There's nothing more shallow than public sentiment in this world.

371
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,440
In the end, you will also live drunk with power and end your life lonely.

372
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,080
That is life, Bayan.

373
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:21,100
When he's about to retreat after the initial attack, I will open the gate and counterattack!

374
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:27,590
I will go. Lingbei Province will have Tanqishi's head.

375
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:31,920
No. I will become the spearhead.

376
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,940
We need to dry off the seeds of El Temur's clan.

377
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,500
General!

378
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:47,360
General, the other gates have been seized by the magistrates as well!

379
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,800
We will attack right away.

380
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,140
With the number of soldiers we have, it's impossible to break down the palace gate.

381
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,130
My father is inside! My sister and brother are waiting for me!

382
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,300
You must remain calm!

383
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:10,740
The soldiers' spirits have already fallen to the ground after finding out El Temur's been arrested!

384
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:16,090
Whoever is in fear, run away. I will attack alone if I have to!

385
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,140
General!

386
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,660
I will open the palace gate!

387
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,390
Attack in full force!

388
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,570
Who killed Talahai?

389
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,640
I did.

390
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,140
That's a relief.

391
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,100
That he didn't die by a common soldier's sword.

392
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,970
Stop shaming him

393
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,860
and bury him for me.

394
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:23,490
It's His Majesty's command that we behead him in the town's square after leaving him that way.

395
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,490
Hurry up and take him inside.

396
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:48,090
He used to be my hero. His exit is unfortunate.

397
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:53,680
It's not the exit of the hero but the fall of the loser.

398
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:02,870
Uncle, you will need to make this a lesson for you to learn from.

399
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,680
I am getting rid of the evil seeds myself.

400
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,530
Why would I take that foolish path?

401
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,270
Your Majesty, when I die,

402
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:43,400
do you think you will become the true emperor of this country?

403
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:50,190
Many influential vassals watched very clearly how you were tamed by my club (strict instructions).

404
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,770
Do you think the vassals who watched that pitiful sight would

405
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:59,540
respect you and look up to you?

406
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,110
You are gravely mistaken.

407
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,720
Even after my death, other El Temurs will come forward

408
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,880
and try to break this frustrating world.

409
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,220
The blood bath will continue.

410
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:22,450
There will never be peace and stability in this imperial family.

411
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,340
I will kill them all.

412
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:35,760
I will not hesitate to swing an iron mace to those who refuse to serve me as the emperor.

413
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:42,420
Are you someone with that type of temperament?

414
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,200
That iron mace will

415
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,920
fall on your head first.

416
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,340
You tamed me with a club?

417
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,760
Yes, yes. You did.

418
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,370
Therefore, how miserable and horrendous

419
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:17,210
your end will be. I will be sure to show the influential vassals of this country.

420
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,240
How did you bewitch him?

421
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,600
What did you do to make him change that much?

422
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,800
What made him change wasn't me

423
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,800
but you, Prime Minister.

424
00:41:52,910 --> 00:42:01,080
Your greed and brutality turned his fear into rage.

425
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:09,430
My long-range plan of a thousand years collapsed because of a mere concubine.

426
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:13,460
You gave me a bigger humiliation than death.

427
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:20,160
Even without my doing, that long-range plan of a thousand years was nothing but an empty bubble.

428
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,550
What are you trying to tell me?

429
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:30,180
Since Prince Maha who you were trying to make into an emperor...

430
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,380
is not the biological son of Danashiri.

431
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,930
She brought a baby who was abandoned and acted as though

432
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:42,460
he was of her blood and fooled the world.

433
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,360
Do you think I would believe that?

434
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,360
The truth won't change just because you don't believe it.

435
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:00,120
If Maha, who shares not even a drop of your blood, was your hope,

436
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,610
now... you must only have desperation left to feel.

437
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,570
Maha...

438
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,380
Tonight,

439
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,850
whoever doesn't get drunk with this wine,

440
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,350
will be kicked out of here naked!

441
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,700
Where have you been?!

442
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,360
Come and have a drink!

443
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,350
Tanqishi...

444
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,170
sustained a crushing defeat.

445
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,950
What?

446
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:38,160
He made an unreasonable attack and lost nearly all of his soldiers. Now he's being pursued by the magistrates.

447
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,100
Where could he run away to?

448
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,370
I'm sure he went to the tin mine where the secret fund is.

449
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:51,300
If he gets his hands on El Temur's secret fund, he will raise up an army again.

450
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,080
Then we shouldn't be here like this.

451
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,010
We need to chase him and take the secret fund from him.

452
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:01,360
Yuan will soon confiscate El Temur's wealth.

453
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:06,170
Even if we get our hands on the secret fund, it will be taken away,

454
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,290
so we should just watch and see.

455
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:13,920
I will send someone over there and see what the situation is like since village chief Makseng is there.

456
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,790
Hurry!

457
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,860
Move it!

458
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,200
How dare you?

459
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,890
Get up! Get up!

460
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,420
Get up!

461
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,100
Get up!

462
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,130
Are you hitting him out of boredom? He's working himself to death!

463
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,900
What are you hitting him for?!

464
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,980
You are praying for death, huh?

465
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,520
Stop it, Chief.

466
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,260
Sorry, Sir.

467
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,880
How dare you act out to me?

468
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,810
Ge-General!

469
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,410
General.

470
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,790
What has happened?

471
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,300
Where's Yeom Byeong Soo?

472
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,820
Y-Yes, over this way.

473
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,430
Who is that?

474
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,740
He's El Temur's son.

475
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,530
But... why does he look like that?

476
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,690
Prime Minister has been arrested?

477
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:25,340
Did you check if he was alive?

478
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:31,480
Maybe we'll get in trouble if we keep staying here.

479
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,280
Be quiet!

480
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:42,790
Has Prime Minister told you where he hid the secret funds?

481
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:45,170
He didn't.

482
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,380
But if he told you to protect it, it must be this mine.

483
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,340
Where is that place?

484
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,450
It's not that far from here, just over the rock hill.

485
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,880
We need to find the secret fund, so get the soldiers ready.

486
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,440
The mine is deep and dangerous, so it'll be better to use the slaves.

487
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,950
We need to hurry, so mobilize as soon as it gets dark.

488
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,340
Yes, General.

489
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,720
From now on, we will search the tin mine.

490
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,880
If you go down deeper, there are many shafts.

491
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,100
Search in pairs as you've been told.

492
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,200
What are we looking for exactly?

493
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,260
It's not for you to know!

494
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:36,440
We don't even know what we're looking for.

495
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,210
Should we catch you some bats or something?

496
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:39,090
That bastard...

497
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,090
They're gold bars.

498
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,090
An unimaginable amount of gold is buried inside.

499
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:49,190
Whoever finds it

500
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:53,250
will be given 10,000 nyang of gold and be freed,

501
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,030
so make every effort!

502
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,830
Really?

503
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:59,320
Seriously?

504
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,470
Go in.

505
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,730
Yes, General.

506
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,360
Follow me!

507
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:18,230
If you find it, what are you going to do with it?

508
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:23,830
I will build up an army and attack Daedo.

509
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:25,790
I see...

510
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,990
That's what you're going to do...

511
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:44,790
If not for Wang Yoo, we would not have been successful.

512
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,570
I won't forget your contribution.

513
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,600
Thank you.

514
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,690
Treat him with respect.

515
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,350
Yes, Sir.

516
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,680
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

517
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,530
Father...

518
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,500
My father was...

519
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:53,180
Your Majesty, did you have a nightmare?

520
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,820
Your Majesty, dreams in the morning don't mean anything, so don't worry.

521
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,580
When you're done eating, leave it outside.

522
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,730
What happened to Prime Minister?

523
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:23,410
He's being executed today.

524
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:30,270
It's probably happening about now.

525
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,520
This is retributive justice.

526
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,610
Father...

527
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,620
Father!

528
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,360
I have to save my father.

529
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,080
Father...

530
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,170
Your Majesty, please be calm.

531
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:55,340
Let me go! My father is dying!

532
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,840
Your Majesty,

533
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,910
please remain calm.

534
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:00,190
Please don't die, Father!

535
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:03,090
You cannot die like this!

536
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,760
What about Maha?

537
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,310
Your Majesty.

538
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,800
Don't kill my father! You will be punished by the heavens!

539
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,490
- Your Majesty.
- Father!

540
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,850
Those damn bastards! Father!

541
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,230
Father!

542
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,930
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

543
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:23,120
Your Majesty!

544
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,070
Please come to your senses!

545
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:29,070
Your Majesty!

546
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:54,330
The high treason criminal El Temur committed regicide on my father and conspired to kill me.

547
00:51:54,330 --> 00:52:00,760
He also committed numerous wicked deeds, too many to mention.

548
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,050
Therefore, at this moment,

549
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,680
I order his execution.

550
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:27,900
Your Majesty, before I die, I will give you some advice.

551
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,600
The person you have such affection for,

552
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,680
that wench Ki, you should keep away from you.

553
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,280
I can see everything.

554
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:54,160
Now that I'm about to die, I can see clearly.

555
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,010
This great empire will be ruined by that wench!

556
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,140
Just wait and see!

557
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,330
If Ki takes Danashiri's place,

558
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:11,910
all the key positions in this imperial palace will be filled by people from Goryeo.

559
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,730
That's enough.

560
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:24,180
You will again

561
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:27,520
become a puppet emperor.

562
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,130
That's enough I said.

563
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:34,380
You should be careful, too, Empress Dowager.

564
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:40,840
Do you think that wench who got rid of me can't get rid of you, too?

565
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,970
You must never make that wench's offspring be installed as the crown prince.

566
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:50,130
How could someone with Goryeo blood become the emperor of this country?!

567
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:53,550
Genghis Khan and all successive generations of emperors

568
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:00,220
will laugh at this while pounding the ground.

569
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,490
That mouth! Shut it!

570
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:20,530
Bayan, you should be on alert, too.

571
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:25,210
You're the warrior of the grasslands who is proud of being a Blue Wolves soldier.

572
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:30,310
Blinded by power, you placed a girl from Goryeo at the head.

573
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:36,080
Even if it's to pay for that sin, you will need to kill that wench yourself.

574
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,780
Hurry up and carry out the execution.

575
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,830
I'm not afraid of death.

576
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:56,820
But thinking about this great empire being engulfed in the skirts of a tramp from Goryeo,

577
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,550
makes me feel bitter

578
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,760
that I don't think I can bear to close my eyes.

579
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:09,660
It's an imperial order. Hurry up and take off El Temur's head

580
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,090
and make him shut that mouth!

581
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,430
I will kill him.

582
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,420
Go ahead.

583
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:42,690
As is the tradition of the grasslands where we treat our enemy with respect,

584
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,180
I will not spill blood.

585
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:50,630
Thank you, Bayan.

586
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,960
El Temur,

587
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,850
you have given me a great idea.

588
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:55,890
Like your prediction, I will make my son the crown prince

589
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:59,730
and become the empress of this country.

590
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,700
I will surround myself with those from Goryeo

591
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,980
and I will rule over the whole country myself.

592
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:07,440
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

593
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:15,210
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

594
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:20,240
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫
