1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,890
Another secret letter from Wang Yoo

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,810
that was sent to Chief Imperial Consort.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,610
I will burn it.

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,180
No.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,340
Give that to me.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,880
Seung Nyang, (Yeom Byeong Soo's voice)

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,450
I still treasure the words you said to me.

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,310
That your body may be with the emperor, but your heart is with me.

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,690
As the mountains and streams of Goryeo never change,

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,590
my love for you will never change.

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,670
I miss you, Seung Nyang.

12
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,330
Your Majesty.

13
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,780
Chief Imperial Consort has come.

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,950
Tell her to go back.

15
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,180
I told her to not appear before me until I command her to.

16
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,190
How can she disrespect my imperial command?

17
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,310
- Your Majesty.
- Tell Chief Imperial Consort.

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,940
If she disobeys my command again

19
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,300
I will punish her severely.

20
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,990
- Your Highness, for today, please...
- His Majesty...

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,430
is still drinking wine?

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,550
After drinking wine this afternoon, he hasn't had any more.

23
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,400
So he is sober right now?

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,450
Yes, Your Highness.

25
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,650
Golta!

26
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,090
I better have some wine with Prime Minister.

27
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,450
Prime Minister...

28
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,050
hasn't entered the palace, saying that he is ill.

29
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,410
He is ill?

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,800
Wang Yoo...

31
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,560
died, you said?

32
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,680
Who did it?

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,300
Who killed Wang Yoo, I asked you?!

34
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,760
If you know who killed Wang Yoo,

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,810
are you going to take revenge on him or something?

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,930
So it was the Prime Minister.

37
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,180
Even if he was a king of an enemy state, he cannot kill him that way!

38
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,750
- How can he, to Wang Yoo—
- I know...

39
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,030
that he was a special person

40
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,510
to you, Chief Imperial Consort.

41
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,710
What do you mean by that?

42
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,740
You were his subordinate, he was your leader.

43
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,530
And you helped each other. And perhaps,

44
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,700
more intimate than that.

45
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,660
- Teacher.
- Do you know why I am silently on your side?

46
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,320
His Majesty and the prime minister

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,900
are currently trapped in the obsession

48
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,740
of recovering the glory of the empire no matter what.

49
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,420
They are running wild like horses without reins

50
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,700
and the only one who can stop them,

51
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,930
is you, Chief Imperial Consort. That is why,

52
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,430
all your misdeeds,

53
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,890
I turned a blind eye to them.

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,270
Chief Imperial Consort, you told me

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,510
to not cling to my family name. And those words,

56
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,080
I would like to turn them back to you.

57
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,320
Don't cling to personal feelings for Wang Yoo. And this kingdom who turned you from a tribute girl to a Chief Imperial Consort

58
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,480
and His Majesty, think only of them.

59
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,030
The blade that killed Wang Yoo,

60
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,990
that it won't be pointed at me,

61
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,810
there is no assurance.

62
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,750
You asked me to stop the horse from running wild. So I will.

63
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,230
But...

64
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,960
if Prime Minister's methods are this cruel,

65
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,620
then I, too, will stop at nothing to fight him.

66
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,500
- Chief Imperial Consort !
- When the opponent picks up a sword,

67
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,980
I will not face him

68
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,730
with only smiles and mercy.

69
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,030
It bothers me that Wang Yoo's dead body was not found.

70
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,280
I will take soldiers and go there myself as soon as the sun rises.

71
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,890
His Majesty is outside.

72
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,590
- Ask him in.
- No need for that.

73
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,810
What brings you here without notice, Your Majesty?

74
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,570
I heard you were ill, so I ran here to see you.

75
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,330
Your Majesty...

76
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,590
But you are not sick, you are wounded instead?

77
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,200
The truth is...

78
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,740
I was trying to kill Wang Yoo

79
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,080
and was injured.

80
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,430
What happened to Wang Yoo?

81
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,490
I stabbed him deeply with my sword,

82
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,570
so he is probably dead.

83
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,860
Why are things getting so twisted?

84
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,660
I don't know.

85
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,670
His Majesty

86
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,580
and Wang Yoo, too...

87
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,790
Wang Yoo,

88
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,010
I cannot believe that he is dead.

89
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,280
I am sorry.

90
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,040
Without realizing it, I...

91
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,710
Please cry in my stead, too.

92
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,460
I don't even have the right to cry for him.

93
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,190
Your Highness...

94
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,490
Every rock, every bush.

95
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,870
Search thoroughly! Don't overlook a single spot.

96
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,250
- Yes, sir!
- General!

97
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,630
Seeing how we can't find his body, I think he escaped this mountain after all.

98
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,440
Before Bayan's soldiers come, I think we should get away.

99
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,690
I am sure that His Majesty is safe now.

100
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,790
But what if we can't find him either?

101
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,330
Please be safe, Your Majesty.

102
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,520
Seung Nyang...

103
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,850
Seung Nyang...

104
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,910
Seung Nyang...

105
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,790
Don't die, Wang Yoo.

106
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,750
I have so many things I haven't told you yet.

107
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,680
So you must live

108
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,530
and hear my truth.

109
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,070
So...

110
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,460
don't die.

111
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,720
"You cannot hide the sky with the palm of your hand."
(T/N: Proverb: A futile effort)

112
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,900
If you want to avenge your mother's death,

113
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,470
then the emperor and Empress Dowager,

114
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,430
Bayan and all the vassals in the Imperial Court, you will have to kill them all.

115
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,870
May I ask you one question?

116
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,890
How did my mother die?

117
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,210
What did Empress Dowager tell you?

118
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,520
She always says the same thing,

119
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,740
but no one ever told me exactly what happened.

120
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,460
Whatever I tell you,

121
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,410
will you believe me?

122
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,080
If anyone will tell me, I will judge for myself.

123
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,180
Your mother—

124
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,600
What are you doing there?

125
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,240
Come this way, Imperial Prince.

126
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,630
You weren't in the palace, so I looked for you everywhere.

127
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,260
Don't go anywhere alone, Imperial Prince.

128
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,170
Yes, Empress Dowager.

129
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,510
To His Majesty,

130
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,280
I must request that he hurry with the investiture of the crown prince.

131
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,790
He hasn't been feeling well lately,

132
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,690
so perhaps we should ask the vassals to submit a petition.

133
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,560
A petition?

134
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,800
I think it will be best for Empress Dowager and her people to submit it.

135
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,080
Do you have a plan?

136
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,820
Yes.

137
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,740
Make Empress Dowager act?

138
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,720
Yes, I have a plan to do that.

139
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,690
His Majesty hasn't been feeling well.

140
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,930
So we must not delay the investiture of the crown prince.

141
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,450
Empress, you truly do not have any greed in you.

142
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,930
I do not feel jealous of Chief Imperial Consort,

143
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,460
but I believe Maha should be the crown prince, which is according to the law.

144
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,700
Of course. That is how it should be.

145
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,120
How about asking the vassals to submit a petition?

146
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,570
The emperor hates Maha so much.

147
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,590
So that's a good idea.

148
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,910
I did what you asked me to do.

149
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,080
I appreciate your help.

150
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,250
Didn't I offer to help you at any time?

151
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,800
But...

152
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,890
are you confident about the investiture of the crown prince?

153
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,800
His Majesty's favor for you

154
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,450
doesn't seem like it was before.

155
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,410
Prince Maha...

156
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,610
is Danashiri's son,

157
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,020
so that's a big disadvantage for him.

158
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,170
That is true,

159
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,050
but you must not underestimate Empress Dowager's influence.

160
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,560
But Your Majesty the Empress,

161
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,000
why are you supporting my son?

162
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,430
I am afraid of Prince Maha's vengeful attitude.

163
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,810
As the leader of the inner court

164
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,380
I must make peace in the palace a priority, shouldn't I?

165
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,090
Your words are wise.

166
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,050
Once Empress Dowager gets rid of you,

167
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,730
then the world will be mine.

168
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,920
After Empress Dowager, then Bayan the Empress,

169
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,480
it will be your turn.

170
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,030
Investiture of the crown prince?

171
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,600
I am still so young and healthy.

172
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,290
But you all...

173
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,210
- want me to decide who will succeed the throne?
- Emperor.

174
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,320
Of course, it is something you should do.

175
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,440
Yes, of course, I should.

176
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,280
Since we never know when yesterday's loyal vassal may turn into today's traitor.

177
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,400
Since the emperor may lose his life at any time, we better make sure to install a crown prince early!

178
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,270
Emperor!

179
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,430
Do you think I don't know your dark hearts?

180
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,120
Those trying to use me...

181
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,380
Those who want power to rule...

182
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,230
Those who are always looking for a chance...

183
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,370
Your Majesty, please calm down.

184
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,610
Look at these petitions, Prime Minister.

185
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,750
They are all telling me to install Maha as the crown prince.

186
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,510
What would you like to do?

187
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,280
El Temür's blood flows in Maha.

188
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,800
But with my own hands,

189
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,280
I exterminated that clan.

190
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,480
But in Prince Ayu,

191
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,770
the blood of Goryeo flows.

192
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,090
Whoever it is, he must be qualified to lead this great empire.

193
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,010
How about an election?

194
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,580
An election?

195
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

196
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,450
Evaluate their learning and temperament.

197
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,670
Then there will be no vassal who opposes the winner.

198
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,190
My Ayu...

199
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:35,500
is still a child.
- But Prince Maha,

200
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,330
due to your command, had less chances to learn.

201
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,660
Election?

202
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,360
He is not at a disadvantage.

203
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,790
Didn't you teach Maha his letters yourself?

204
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,330
And that is why I asked Prime Minister

205
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,530
to speak for his sake.

206
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,780
His Majesty could not know that Maha has been studying.

207
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,840
You did very well, Empress.

208
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,640
Do you have any problems with the election?

209
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,390
There is no reason to object if it is fair.

210
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,930
I trust in Maha's intelligence.

211
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,070
Your son will need to do his best.

212
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,840
Yes, Your Highness. I will heed your words.

213
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,420
Your Majesty, what is the matter?

214
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,010
Golta.

215
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,180
It's such a strange thing.

216
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,950
I have finally become a true emperor.

217
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,960
But why...

218
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,310
why...

219
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,340
why am I so lonely?

220
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,070
Your Majesty.

221
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,810
Even more than when I was under El Temür's thumb...

222
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,480
somehow...

223
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,490
I'm more uneasy

224
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,310
and lonely...

225
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,740
What is...

226
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,800
the reason?

227
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,790
When El Temür was here, no one dared to covet power.

228
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,980
But now you are surrounded by only those who vie for power.

229
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,490
- Is that what this is?
- Think about it.

230
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,330
You have no one you can trust except Prime Minister and me.

231
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,810
Empress Dowager or even Chief Imperial Consort,

232
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,360
they are only trying to satisfy their greed.

233
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,010
Right.

234
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,240
Yang...

235
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,990
At that time in the past,

236
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,590
Yang was by my side.

237
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,380
But how is it now?

238
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:41,060
Chief Imperial Consort is now the most dangerous—

239
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,340
Golta,

240
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,990
be careful of what you say.

241
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,730
Your Majesty.

242
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,930
Everyone out of my way!

243
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,200
- Oh.
- Are you all right?

244
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,900
Your Majesty!

245
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,840
Your Majesty.

246
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,170
Reading a book with no care in the world.

247
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,370
Everyone, leave now.

248
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,180
Did you drink wine again?

249
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,660
In the Great Hall,

250
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,040
you never looked at me, not even once.

251
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,180
Do you think you've won against me again, this time?

252
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,460
Your Majesty.

253
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,580
Stop acting aloof.

254
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,560
- Your Majesty.
- Love me!

255
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,800
Beg me to come to Heungdeok Palace, to show you my favor!

256
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,130
Chief Imperial Consort, act arrogant all you want to.

257
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,850
But once I abandon you, you are finished.

258
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:11,630
Be grateful to me for having made you so honorable.

259
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,950
Like the women at the courtesan house,

260
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,880
would you like it if I acted coquettishly?

261
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,440
If you want to abandon me,

262
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,600
please do so quickly.

263
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,920
I can never abandon you.

264
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,610
No, I won't.

265
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,170
Please be still!

266
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:23,480
♫ Don't you see me? ♫

267
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,770
♫ I continue ♫

268
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,890
Your Majesty, you do not know what I truly fear.

269
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,500
♫ breathing at your side ♫

270
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,440
That you might abandon me...

271
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,760
that is what I fear most.

272
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,670
♫ For you ♫

273
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:45,560
♫ My love is for you ♫

274
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:56,010
♫ Although you remain at my side within my reach, ♫

275
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,910
♫ I am unable to get closer, ♫

276
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,720
♫ I'm wasting away ♫

277
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,550
♫ With the words 'I love you' ♫

278
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,620
♫ Can't you stay with me? ♫

279
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:20,860
♫ Won't you allow me even just one day? ♫

280
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:28,620
♫ Does my loving you make it hard for you? ♫

281
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,880
♫ Sorry. I am sorry ♫

282
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,900
♫ I am sorry for loving you ♫

283
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,930
Toqto'a has arrived.

284
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:09,920
So there is no chance we can find Wang Yoo. Let's return to Yeongyeong.

285
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,600
If you're taking care of Wang Yoo

286
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,990
- where would you go?
- Not sure.

287
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,010
It wouldn't be easy to stay here in Liaoyang.

288
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,690
Goryeo?

289
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,830
That's right.

290
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,540
Goryeo.

291
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:34,640
To treat his wounds and prepare for his return,

292
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,540
there is no safer place than Goryeo.

293
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,830
To go to Goryeo, there is a place they must cross...

294
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,000
This is the place.

295
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,950
Cheonsudap Valley.

296
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,350
So we will get there first and wait for them.

297
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,430
We are approaching the gate.

298
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:12,080
I've already sent a message to the gatekeeper. Don't worry.

299
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,830
Give me the bow and arrow.

300
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,490
Sir, don't you recognize me?

301
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,870
Where is Yeon Bisoo? Why are you alone?

302
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,240
She is in Yeongyeong.

303
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,940
I'm returning after delivering goods to her.

304
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,690
But...

305
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,190
is something the matter?

306
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,680
Be on your way.

307
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,760
What's wrong, Sir?

308
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,860
I have someplace to visit briefly. Continue your search.

309
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,960
Chief, there is blood.

310
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,830
Pull the arrow out.

311
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,620
I will pull it.

312
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,960
Are you all right without treatment?

313
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,220
This isn't a big deal.

314
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,520
You return to the city gate.

315
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,680
Eunuch Bang and the others will be looking for us.

316
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:47,120
If you meet them, tell them we will wait for them at Cheonsudap Valley.

317
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,630
Yes, Chief.

318
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,920
Open it.

319
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,030
Please let Wang Yoo live.

320
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,440
You can kill me,

321
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,310
but please don't take Wang Yoo's life.

322
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,530
What is your reason for saving Wang Yoo?

323
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,590
He saved...

324
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,990
my life.

325
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,200
Is that all?

326
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,680
So that I can do something proper

327
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,950
for this kingdom, please help me, Teacher.

328
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:15,100
It if involves sparing Goryeo, I must refuse.

329
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,130
The money that is saving the people of Yuan is coming out of Goryeo.

330
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,140
El Temür's secret fund

331
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,750
is already depleted.

332
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,890
Please help me, Teacher.

333
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,900
Where were you headed?

334
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,160
We were going to cross the nation's border.

335
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,710
If it becomes known that Wang Yoo is alive,

336
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,410
Yuan's soldiers will go to the ends of the earth to find him.

337
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,410
So go deep into the mountains

338
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,190
and never come out into the world.

339
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,120
Can you promise that?

340
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,590
Yes. I will do that.

341
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,590
Wang Yoo is dead.

342
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,370
Be sure to remember that.

343
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,280
Your Highness, I've brought Court Lady Yeon.

344
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,360
Do you know why I asked you here?

345
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:59,400
When the election for the crown prince begins, and His Majesty and the vassals are gathered,

346
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,360
reveal the truth that Maha is not Danashiri's son.

347
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,460
Your Highness...

348
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,580
Are you afraid?

349
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:18,360
Once Ayu is selected as Crown Prince, I will let you leave the palace.

350
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,020
Do you mean that?

351
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,200
You will really let me leave the palace?

352
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,350
Aren't you a Goryeo person?

353
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:38,730
We are from the same place, and for us to fight amongst ourselves in this palace,

354
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,720
how is that only your misfortune?

355
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,610
Your Highness.

356
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,350
I will protect you,

357
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:52,750
so don't worry and reveal the truth.

358
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,610
Yes, Your Highness.

359
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,960
I will do that.

360
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,210
Your Majesty.

361
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,520
What brings you out here so late at night?

362
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:32,110
What about you? Why are you visiting Chief Imperial Consort so late?

363
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,160
Please let me live, Your Majesty.

364
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:52,410
If you want to live, tell me what you spoke to Chief Imperial Consort about.

365
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,570
Your Majesty.

366
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,770
Remove one more book.

367
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:07,050
If we remove one more book, you will die.

368
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,380
So tell me.

369
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,550
Remove the book.

370
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,610
Yes.

371
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,850
I will... tell you...

372
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,990
Release her.

373
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,220
Yes.

374
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,430
So tell me.

375
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,460
The truth is...

376
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:45,800
Prince Maha is not Empress Danashiri's

377
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,220
true son.

378
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:55,550
She could not bear children, so she brought him from elsewhere.

379
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,830
She told me to reveal that.

380
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,580
I see.

381
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,080
That was why Chief Imperial Consort was so confident.

382
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,330
Your Majesty, what about me?

383
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,820
Please let me live, Your Majesty.

384
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,890
I heard you are meeting with some man in secret?

385
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:21,140
He used to be a captain of the Imperial Guard?

386
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,230
How do you know about that...

387
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:30,690
I will let you leave the palace before the investiture of the crown prince.

388
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,090
Your Majesty.

389
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,760
We can't let Chief Imperial Consort get her way, can we?

390
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,600
Thank you. Thank you, Your Majesty.

391
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,420
Thank you! Thank you!

392
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,820
Imperial Prince.

393
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,220
How your mother, your maternal uncle and grandfather were killed,

394
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,690
your must never forget it.

395
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:24,560
Just think about how to avenge their deaths when you become the emperor.

396
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,780
Oh, my cutie!

397
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,950
We don't have time for this now.

398
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,910
But I have good news.

399
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,740
Good news? What is it?

400
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:48,720
I will no longer be a servant.

401
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,690
I can leave the palace.

402
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,510
Is that true?

403
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:59,490
Yes. Her Majesty the Empress promised me.

404
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,410
Yeon Hwa,

405
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,030
my wishes have finally come true.

406
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:14,030
I no longer want to serve others.

407
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,200
Of course, I know how you feel.

408
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,590
In a large house,

409
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,590
I will have servants of my own.

410
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,790
And they will call me Madam, and I will live with my head held high.

411
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:29,960
Never mind anything else, I can definitely make your wishes come true.

412
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,600
And I want to have about nine babies.

413
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:38,040
How can our thoughts be so alike?

414
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,020
You can make me happy for the rest of my life, right?

415
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,370
Yes, Yeon Hwa.

416
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,270
I won't have greed for anything else.

417
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:55,570
To marry you and raise our children together,

418
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,690
and live happily, that is all I want.

419
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,340
It's the empress's ring.

420
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:16,160
Sell this, buy a house for us to live in, and wait for me.

421
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,540
Even if I don't sell this, I can still buy one right now.

422
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,330
Thank you, my Yeon Hwa.

423
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,650
I've returned.

424
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:47,680
Are you prepared to leave the palace now?

425
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

426
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,320
Before you go,

427
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,480
write a few words here.

428
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,680
What do I write?

429
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,230
Some slander that Chief Imperial Consort tortured you.

430
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,910
I will need a reason to send you out of here, don't I?

431
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,360
I understand, Your Majesty.

432
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,230
[I...]

433
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,690
[Every night, I see...]

434
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,860
[Yeon Hwa]

435
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,360
May I leave now?

436
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,170
Yes, enjoy your trip.

437
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:04,500
This will be enough for me to corner Chief Imperial Consort.

438
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,400
Your Majesty...

439
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,620
Court Lady Yeon!

440
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,940
Hurry and bring her down.

441
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,560
Yes, sir.

442
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,950
Court Lady Yeon...

443
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,850
Court Lady Yeon! Yeon Hwa!

444
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,320
How can this happen?

445
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,070
Court Lady Yeon!

446
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,320
Yeon Hwa? Court Lady Yeon?

447
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,660
Yeon Hwa!

448
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,490
Yeon Hwa committed suicide?

449
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:59,520
They found her body in the morning after she hung herself.

450
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,240
I even promised

451
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,720
to send her out of the palace.

452
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,290
The servants around her were questioned

453
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:13,130
and they said she didn't seem as if she was about to kill herself at all.

454
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:18,270
Empress may have found out she agreed to help me.

455
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,020
Where is Yeon Hwa's body now?

456
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,630
Head Eunuch Dok Man, I'm glad you came.

457
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,440
- I wanted to—
- Yeon Hwa

458
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,580
wrote that she had a grudge against you before she died.

459
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:43,710
I know you disliked her, but you should not have done that, Your Highness!

460
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,570
Do you think Yeon Hwa died because of me?

461
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:52,300
I did my share to help you rise to this rank in this palace.

462
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,290
I hid your pregnancy, after all.

463
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,350
Head Eunuch Dok Man!

464
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:02,930
The reason I helped you was because I couldn't stand Danashiri's tyranny.

465
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:07,670
But you are no different than Danashiri right now!

466
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,070
Watch what you say.

467
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:13,160
If I took the empress's side

468
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,630
and revealed your secret, then what would you do?

469
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,550
Head Eunuch!

470
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,380
If you want to reveal my secret

471
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:27,220
than you wouldn't have come to tell me this.

472
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,370
I want to know your true thoughts.

473
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:35,870
Are you the righteous person I used to know

474
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,530
or have you become a prisoner of greed—

475
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,400
Yeon Hwa...

476
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,020
didn't commit suicide. She was murdered.

477
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:52,700
Just wait and see, I will reveal the truth

478
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:01,080
and let the whole world know of their evil deeds.

479
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,360
Court Lady Seo?

480
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,570
Why didn't my Yeon Hwa come with you?

481
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,480
Yeon Hwa...

482
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:46,800
I feel such pity and sorrow... what to do?

483
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,750
Yeon Hwa! Court Lady Yeon!

484
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,060
Yeon Hwa?

485
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:17,350
What... My Yeon Hwa...

486
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,610
Why is she here, like this?

487
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:23,500
What are you doing right now?

488
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,390
How can you be like this right now!

489
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:36,720
You asked me to buy a house for you, so I bought such a large house for you.

490
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,030
But here...

491
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,730
... like this... how can you?

492
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,180
Yeon Hwa!

493
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,790
Yeon Hwa...

494
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,720
We agreed to live a happy life together.

495
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,370
What is this?!

496
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,400
Yeon Hwa...

497
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:24,200
What are the three disciplines an emperor looks for in a vassal?

498
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,550
"Upright," "caution," and "diligence."

499
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,600
My Ayu, you are very intelligent.

500
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,560
Here, read the rest.

501
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,060
Imperial Father.

502
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,600
Yes, my Ayu.

503
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:54,210
Were you educating the imperial prince?

504
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,730
Yes.

505
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:00,350
I haven't touched a drop of wine after that day.

506
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:01,950
What brings you here?

507
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,540
I had something to tell you about the investiture of the crown prince.

508
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,660
Go ahead.

509
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:12,050
Chief Imperial Consort, did you educate Ayu

510
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,830
as a person of Goryeo?

511
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:21,550
Chief Imperial Consort, you must forget that you are a person of Goryeo.

512
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:28,280
If I can't accomplish it, Ayu will annex Goryeo into Yuan.

513
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:34,510
You must educate Ayu to become that kind of emperor.

514
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,990
Why won't you respond?

515
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

516
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,200
His Majesty is safe.

517
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,700
- What great news.
- I know.

518
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,640
I think Yeon Bisoo loves His Majesty.

519
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,210
That tomboy?

520
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:17,030
I can tell with one look. It's unmistakable.

521
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,390
Isn't that Yeom Byeong Soo?

522
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,160
And that's the empress.

523
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,920
Empress?

524
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,830
Why would she meet with Yeom Byeong Soo?

525
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,000
As her final letter says,

526
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,350
it's as if Chief Imperial Consort killed Court Lady Yeon herself.

527
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,330
With my own hands,

528
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,090
I will relieve Yeon Hwa's grudge.

529
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:58,140
It won't be easy to do by yourself.

530
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,050
Will you join hands with me?

531
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:09,240
Just give me your command.

532
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:15,510
If it's getting rid of Chief Imperial Consort, I will do anything.

533
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,840
Chief Imperial Consort gave grains to the people, so they are full of praise for her.

534
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,870
Yes.

535
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:27,960
Water and oil cannot mix.

536
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:34,030
Like scooping up oil from water, I wish to remove Goryeo people from Yuan.

537
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,850
And, of course, Chief Imperial Consort will be removed along with them.

538
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,140
Tell me what you want me to do.

539
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,730
First, gather those who will help us.

540
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,660
Ouch! Why?

541
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,440
Set fire to his market.

542
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,500
Hey, why are you doing this?

543
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,950
Please don't do this.

544
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,450
Hasn't Yuan sucked the blood out of us, the people of Goryeo?

545
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:21,980
You're from Goryeo?

546
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,220
If Chief Imperial Consort's son becomes the crown prince, it's a good thing for us.

547
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:31,620
Because then, we Goryeo people will take over the markets in Yuan.

548
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,020
What are you saying?

549
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,660
Do it.

550
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,060
Burn! Burn!

551
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:48,100
Cause Yuan people to feel anger towards Goryeo people.

552
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,790
My shop! How can this be?

553
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:55,050
You bastards! You will receive divine punishment!

554
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:59,850
The day Prince Maha becomes crown prince

555
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:02,220
the first thing he will do is kick Goryeo people out of Yuan.

556
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,030
Got that?

557
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:13,090
They are deliberately causing conflict between Yuan people and Goryeo people.

558
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:17,060
But what is their purpose?

559
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,320
I can find out.

560
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:24,890
There was a huge fight again yesterday between Yuan merchants and Goryeo merchants.

561
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,860
Now we just have to kill Prince Maha.

562
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,830
Kill the imperial prince? You didn't mention that before.

563
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:40,520
He was abandoned by the emperor anyway.

564
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:47,010
Maha will come to Seoneop Temple for a memorial service tonight.

565
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:50,820
So we must not miss this chance.

566
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,250
Once this work is done well,

567
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:57,760
you will have in your hands more money than you've ever imagined.

568
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,580
Money?

569
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,690
Is that true?

570
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,750
That is what he said clearly.

571
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:10,600
So, they will kill the imperial prince

572
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,410
and spread the rumor that he was killed by Goryeo people?

573
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:20,810
Not just Chief Imperial Consort, they want to wipe Goryeo people out completely.

574
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,070
Then I'll be on my way now.

575
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,370
Please don't tell anyone about us.

576
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:32,060
I will run away from Yeongyeong tonight.

577
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,750
Chief Imperial Consort is the only one who can stop this.

578
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:43,870
I heard she regards Maha like an enemy because of the investiture of the crown prince.

579
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:46,280
That is why we must stop this.

580
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,170
Poor Maha...

581
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:11,660
I give greetings to you, Imperial Father.

582
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,100
I told you not to read books.

583
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,580
Give that to me.

584
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,150
"The Virtues of a Nobleman."

585
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,580
Are you preparing for the election of the crown prince?

586
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:37,800
How foolish. The election is not to give you a chance.

587
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,400
It's just a procedure to give investiture to Ayu.

588
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:46,440
What do you not like about me?

589
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,580
Please tell me. I will fix it.

590
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:59,940
Maha, you should not have been born.

591
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,070
"The Virtues of a Nobleman."

592
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,040
Your Highness...

593
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:34,950
There is no one to reveal the secret about Prince Maha,

594
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:37,480
so we have a setback for the investiture of the crown prince.

595
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,870
Your Highness, Court Lady Seo will know the secret as well.

596
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:47,540
Court Lady Seo is different from Yeon Hwa. She will never tell that secret.

597
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,610
Your Highness,

598
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:01,710
a Buddhist nun who was friendly with that Buddhist nun who had a burn scar on her face will arrive here in a few days.

599
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:05,610
Does she know the secret about Prince Maha?

600
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:11,100
According to the head monk, based on the relationship between the two nuns, she will know.

601
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:21,070
But Prince Maha is here.

602
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,200
What are you doing here?

603
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,020
You violated the national law.

604
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,250
Praying to an ancestral tablet for a traitor.

605
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,270
Did you have me followed?

606
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:46,350
Does His Majesty know about this, too?

607
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,980
I begged Empress Dowager.

608
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,380
If you want to tell on someone, tell on me only.

609
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:10,110
What despicable act is this?

610
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:19,070
This incense stick is for my mother, who was killed by Tanqishi.

611
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:26,630
When I was just your age, I lost my mother, too.

612
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:34,030
Not only that, but the person you call your maternal grandfather also caused my father to die.

613
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,790
What are you trying to say?

614
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:46,160
So to satisfy my vengeance, I caused the owners of this ancestral tablet to die.

615
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,570
Stop this, Chief Imperial Consort.

616
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:53,230
Imperial Prince, I will not harm you.

617
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,870
Because you do not belong to the family of my mortal enemies.

618
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,610
What nonsense are you saying?

619
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,380
But you must know this.

620
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,030
The people who you believe to be your mother and grandfather,

621
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:18,460
Empress Dowager also participated in their deaths.

622
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,100
Chief Imperial Consort!

623
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:23,580
How long will you deceive Imperial Prince?

624
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,820
Please stop.

625
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,100
All the secrets will be revealed soon.

626
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,070
Who the imperial prince really is, and who killed who,

627
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:38,420
and the true nature of Empress Dowager who engineered all of it from behind.

628
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:45,490
They will all be revealed.

629
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,090
Empress Dowager?

630
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:08,600
Are you deceiving me about anything?

631
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,240
Please forget it, it's just nonsense.

632
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,980
- Empress Dowager?
- I told you to forget about it!

633
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,630
Your Highness.

634
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,440
Eunuch Bang.

635
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:32,680
Your Highness.

636
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,310
I have something to tell you.

637
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,810
Please save Prince Maha.

638
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:47,110
What is this, suddenly?

639
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,360
Save Maha?

640
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,940
Tonight, Prince Maha will die.

641
00:56:53,940 --> 00:57:00,140
The only person who can protect him is you, Your Highness.

642
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,570
What does that mean?

643
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:08,530
Maha... pitiful Maha...

644
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,450
Eunuch Bang?

645
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,190
Maha...

646
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,150
he is Star.

647
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:23,060
St-Star?

648
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:28,300
The baby that you thought died,

649
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:33,450
he is your son.

650
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:41,000
That cannot be true.

651
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,240
Star... he already...

652
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,640
Star is alive. Maha is Star.

653
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:56,630
He is the son born between you and His Majesty.

654
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,780
I told you, that cannot be true!

655
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:04,310
On Maha's foot,

656
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,970
there are three spots shaped like stars.

657
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:13,910
I confirmed it with my own eyes, Your Highness.

658
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:28,420
♫ The more you love me ultimately the more only
you may be hurt ♫

659
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:34,330
♫ Don't test me or my love ♫

660
