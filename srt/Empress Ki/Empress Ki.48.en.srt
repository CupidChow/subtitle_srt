1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,680
Your Majesty, have you come to your senses?

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,100
Your Majesty, can you hear what I have to tell you?

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,670
Yes. Go ahead.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,940
Your Majesty... Prince Maha...

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,100
Your Majesty, I will call the doctor.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,860
No.

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,100
You don't have to.

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,540
Your Majesty.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,680
The truth is, His Highness Maha is...

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,350
Your Majesty, Chief Imperial Consort is coming.

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,880
Your Majesty.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,800
Chief Imperial Consort.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,620
The heavens have helped you, I am so relieved.

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,240
So tell me.

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,520
Maha? What about Maha?

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,170
His Highness Maha...

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,350
passed away.

18
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,070
Maha?

19
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,900
He died?

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,350
If you ever enter the palace without permission,

22
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,050
I will rip you to shreds.

23
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,020
I understand.

24
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,230
I won't come near here, ever again.

25
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,030
Take her outside the palace.

26
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,860
Maha must have resented me a lot.

27
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,680
Chief Imperial Consort? Are you all right?

28
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,460
Yes.

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,180
Your Majesty, I've brought tonic.

30
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,090
You can leave it there.

31
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,380
You must not skip your medicine.

32
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,590
Please drink it now.

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,260
But why am I so sleepy all of a sudden?

34
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,510
Your Majesty.

35
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,240
Your Majesty?

36
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,300
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

37
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,450
What did you do to Your Majesty?

38
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,480
He just fell into a deep sleep. Stop making a fuss.

39
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,440
Are you outside?

40
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,000
Bring His Majesty to Heungdeok Palace.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,740
Your Highness.

42
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,960
I will take care of His Majesty myself.

43
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,350
You cannot do that.

44
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,310
Why can't I?

45
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,370
I will take care of His Majesty, so Your Highness—

46
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,110
Eunuch Baek.

47
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,920
What? Eunuch Baek? How dare you—

48
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,410
Shut your mouth.

49
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,090
I am a high official of the Royal Inspectors, have you forgotten? Anyone who disobeys Chief Imperial Consort

50
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,010
I will not forgive them.

51
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,760
Hurry and bring His Majesty.

52
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,560
Your Highness.

53
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,990
How can you take His Majesty? Just what are you thinking?

54
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,400
Whatever I think,

55
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,140
it's not your place to interfere, Eunuch Baek.

56
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,720
I have to comfort

57
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,260
Star's vengeful spirit.

58
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,340
Kill Bayan (deposed Empress).

59
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,780
I will issue an order for her to drink poisoned tonic. See that her life is ended.

60
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,880
Yes, Your Highness.

61
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,040
And we have to catch Yeom Byeong Soo as well.

62
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,270
Raise the bounty 10 times.

63
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,720
I understand, Your Highness.

64
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,510
Your Highness the Chief Imperial Consort.

65
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,730
This is His Highness Star's

66
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,060
remains.

67
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,100
[Fortune]

68
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,360
My baby.

69
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,370
My Star.

70
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,000
Leaving me like this...

71
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,580
My baby.

72
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,420
My baby...

73
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,510
My baby.

74
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,340
My baby...

75
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,360
My baby!

76
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,930
My son.

77
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,860
My baby!

78
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,060
Let me go. What do you think you are doing?

79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,720
Let go of me!

80
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,500
How dare you? I may have been deposed, but I am still the prime minister's niece!

81
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,670
How dare you be so insolent?

82
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,750
Chief Imperial Consort commanded for you to be killed, you bitch.

83
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,530
What?

84
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,580
Kill... me?

85
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,330
Aren't you afraid of what will happen if you do?

86
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,080
Open this bitch's mouth.

87
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,530
Let go of me!

88
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,270
Let go! Let go!

89
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,200
Let go!

90
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,000
Let go of me! Get away from me!

91
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,280
Let go! Let go!

92
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,100
Let go!

93
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,470
Let go of me!

94
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,150
How dare you make tears of blood

95
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,430
flow from the Chief Imperial Consort's eyes?

96
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,360
[Fortune]

97
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,250
Bayan (deposed Empress),

98
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,000
to pay for your sins, your life alone is not enough.

99
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,520
What happened?

100
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,200
She drank poisoned tonic.

101
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,740
How...?

102
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,840
I...

103
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,870
I am the one who made this child die.

104
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,310
I brought Bayan to become the empress.

105
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,440
I killed her.

106
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,720
Uncle.

107
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,530
Chief Imperial Consort...

108
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,630
this wicked bitch... I will not let her get away with this.

109
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,590
Prime Minister, Chief Imperial Consort took the emperor to Heungdeok Palace.

110
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,930
What does that mean? She took His Majesty to Heungdeok Palace?

111
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,720
I'm sure she is up to something.

112
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,470
We must bring the emperor back from Chief Imperial Consort.

113
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:48,200
See that? Chief Imperial Consort made a bad move.

114
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,310
Now, Bayan just has to do what we want.

115
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,680
Can you get rid of Chief Imperial Consort?

116
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,980
Bayan is different from El Temür. Not only does he have the trust of the emperor,

117
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,290
he has the strong support of the many commanders in the military.

118
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,460
Chief Imperial Consort may dominate the capital and the Imperial Palace.

119
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,550
But when the military makes a move, she is finished.

120
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,390
Have you come to your senses?

121
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,530
Where is this place?

122
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,620
It's Heungdeok Palace.

123
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,220
What happened?

124
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,730
I brought you here.

125
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,560
You shouldn't move yet.

126
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,740
Until you recover from your illness, lean on me, and be comfortable, please.

127
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,160
Your Highness the Chief Imperial Consort?

128
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,350
Your Highness, Prime Minister is outside.

129
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,760
Everyone, leave.

130
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,510
Yes.

131
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,400
Court Lady Hong, remain here and take care of His Majesty if he calls.

132
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,330
Has His Majesty woken up?

133
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,640
Yes, but no one but you and Eunuch Park must know that.

134
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,860
Yes, Your Highness.

135
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,950
I understand what you mean.

136
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,810
A mere eunuch dares to dress in armor? You don't know your place, do you?

137
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,590
I'm sorry, Prime Minister.

138
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,210
I am only following the orders of Chief Imperial Consort.

139
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,530
So if you want to die,

140
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,110
I'll grant your wish.

141
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,270
Prime Minister!

142
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,390
I must take His Majesty with me right now.

143
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,330
Go back, please.

144
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,130
Chief Imperial Consort.

145
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,980
I am the Regent right now.

146
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,180
Did you forget who rules this kingdom right now?

147
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:28,830
I must at least confirm His Majesty's safety with my own eyes.

148
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,780
His Majesty is doing just fine.

149
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,890
I am taking very good care of him.

150
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,060
Toqto'a, clear the way.

151
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,130
What do you think you are doing?

152
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,720
While His Majesty is on the brink of death,

153
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,560
the person who calls himself Prime Minister continues to oppress the immigrants

154
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,660
and is causing public opinion to erode.

155
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,500
Based on my judgment, this is an important time that will determine this nation's fate.

156
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,540
- Chief Imperial Consort!
- And so,

157
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,290
I took emergency measures that are appropriate for this moment.

158
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,920
Prime Minister, do not carelessly interfere.

159
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,900
If anything happens to His Majesty,

160
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,580
this Heongdeok Palace will become a pile of ash.

161
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,180
Not only you, Chief Imperial Consort, but the crown prince,

162
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,280
both of you will not be safe, got that?

163
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:41,780
I will remember clearly that you said that.

164
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,830
Golta?

165
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,660
Golta, are you outside?

166
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,570
Your Majesty.

167
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,640
Where is Golta?

168
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,310
Eunuch Baek is not here.

169
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,950
I better return to the main palace.

170
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,540
Your Majesty.

171
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,800
Please stay here.

172
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,390
No, I'm not comfortable.

173
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,740
I better return to my quarters.

174
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,280
You must not leave.

175
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,180
Yang?

176
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:52,890
While I was unconscious, did something happen in the palace?

177
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,620
No, not yet.

178
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,860
Not yet? What does that mean?

179
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:08,120
Please don't ask anything and trust me.

180
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,030
Follow me.

181
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,330
What is the tonic that you're bringing to Heungdeok Palace?

182
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,460
Well...

183
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,170
Speak the truth. What tonic are you bringing to His Majesty?

184
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:52,780
It's tonic made from licorice root and ephedra.

185
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,090
I'm sorry. I just did as Chief Imperial Consort ordered me to.

186
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,620
Chief Imperial Consort told you to make tonic from licorice root and ephedra?

187
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,190
What are the effects of those medicines?

188
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,330
For His Majesty who has a weak heart,

189
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,340
they will be poison.

190
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,710
Prime Minister, Chief Imperial Consort is trying to kill the emperor.

191
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,290
Have you seen His Majesty?

192
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,690
Since he was taken to Heungdeok Palace,

193
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,090
I have not seen him even once.

194
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,420
Your Highness, I'm bringing in the tonic.

195
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,380
Give the tonic to me.

196
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,360
Is it okay for me to not examine His Majesty?

197
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,490
I'll call you if there's an emergency, so you can go back and not worry.

198
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,400
So Chief Imperial Consort accepts the tonics herself?

199
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,240
Not just the tonic.

200
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,390
According to the servants, Chief Imperial Consort herself takes all his meals to him.

201
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,550
So no one has seen His Majesty in Heungdeok Palace except Chief Imperial Consort herself?

202
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,220
Yes, Prime Minister.

203
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,720
Even the guard eunuchs

204
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,250
haven't been allowed near him.

205
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,300
It seems His Majesty's well-being is at risk.

206
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:40,090
He may have already died.

207
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,090
You can leave now.

208
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,280
Yes, Your Highness.

209
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,590
Prime Minister, Chief Imperial Consort is meeting with the military commanders right now.

210
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,250
What? The commanders?

211
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,680
Why have you requested to meet with us?

212
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,430
I felt that I've been neglecting all of you, so I invited you to tea.

213
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,840
We are honored, Chief Imperial Consort.

214
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,170
She's trying to influence the military?

215
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,710
That means she's planning on getting rid of me and Prime Minister.

216
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,580
If she really did assassinate His Majesty,

217
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:41,450
she will have Crown Prince Ayu enthroned and rule by regency of the queen mother. And you two will be biggest obstacles.

218
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,500
Prime Minister, we cannot stand by and let this happen.

219
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,800
We must do something first.

220
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,540
Toqto'a, how many soldiers are guarding Heungdeok Palace?

221
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,190
Including the Imperial Guards and guard eunuchs, not quite 200.

222
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:02,920
We must kill Chief Imperial Consort and Ayushiridara tonight.

223
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,420
We are fighting for the imperial family.

224
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,630
Good thinking, Prime Minister.

225
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,670
Gather our men.

226
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,600
Yes, I will do that.

227
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:21,090
I am drinking the tonic that the doctor brings.

228
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:27,330
- Then His Majesty... ?
- We have another doctor in here making His Majesty's tonics.

229
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:33,120
Your Highness, what is your plan?

230
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,080
Your Highness, Toqto'a is outside.

231
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,110
I will send him away.

232
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,030
No.

233
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,370
Ask him to come in.

234
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,640
Chief Imperial Consort, I know you will not hurt His Majesty.

235
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,780
Is that what Prime Minister said?

236
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,960
That I would hurt His Majesty?

237
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,180
So what is your plan?

238
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,790
You already know.

239
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,530
Whether I die, or Prime Minister dies.

240
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,360
One of us must die for this fight to end.

241
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,910
Insurrection is rising among the people, all around us.

242
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:37,230
It is our responsibility for having made their lives hopeless.

243
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:46,020
For the sake of the innocent people, I must end the sickening power struggles in this palace.

244
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:54,330
Yi-ta-wi-gwa. You are trying to make Prime Minister commit a crime.
(T/N: Yi-ta-wi-gwa - tactic from "Art of War")

245
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,920
I think you're half successful, so far.

246
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,630
- What about the remaining half?
- That depends on me.

247
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,480
Because if I tell Prime Minister about your plot, you will fail.

248
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:17,120
Has His Majesty awakened?

249
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:26,080
If he hasn't wakened up, Chief Imperial Consort, you and the crown prince won't be able to avoid death.

250
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,690
So it's tonight.

251
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,780
When the revolt will happen.

252
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,230
Has he awakened?

253
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,290
This is war.

254
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:42,300
Shouldn't I hide what needs to be hidden, too?

255
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,390
But I told you everything.

256
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:54,190
You also told me that half of this fight depends on you, Teacher.

257
00:23:55,050 --> 00:24:00,680
So I will only half trust you, Teacher.

258
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,400
He knew our plan like the palm of his own hand.

259
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,190
Should we let him just go like that?

260
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,960
I trust in Teacher Toqto'a.

261
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:40,030
Toqto'a, for this nation, I can kill you.

262
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,800
So tell the truth.

263
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,650
Why did you meet with Chief Imperial Consort?

264
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,240
Did you tell her our plan?

265
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,520
Even if they knew our plan, nothing changes.

266
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,580
Since you are determined, they will all die tonight anyway.

267
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,090
- So then?
- I spied on them.

268
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,660
So what did you find out?

269
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,590
They have less than 200 soldiers.

270
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,040
50 of them are archers.

271
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,780
100 soldiers are stationed in front of Heungdeok Palace, and 30 or so stationed near the rear.

272
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,340
What do you think?

273
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,340
Do you think His Majesty is alive?

274
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:47,190
I could not tell at all, based on Chief Imperial Consort's face.

275
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:56,100
Toqto'a, we see the world differently but I believe our hearts are the same.

276
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:01,190
You are my most precious nephew and also my heir.

277
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,530
So don't be resentful of me.

278
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:21,650
Why do you keep walking along the wrong path?

279
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:29,440
Why can't you see the correct path, Uncle?

280
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,320
Your Majesty.

281
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,510
How dare you?

282
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,480
Out of my way.

283
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,660
Your Majesty.

284
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,350
What do you think you are doing right now?

285
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,360
Out of my way.

286
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,870
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

287
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,250
Calm down?

288
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,650
After you've locked me in here,

289
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,720
do you think you will be safe?

290
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,400
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

291
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,050
Chief Imperial Consort.

292
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,950
Everyone, leave.

293
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,240
What is your reason for not letting me leave here?

294
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,730
What are you plotting?

295
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:23,310
Tonight, Prime Minister will come here tonight to kill me and Crown Prince Ayu.

296
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,410
- What? The Prime Minister?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

297
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,380
If this is not treason, what is?

298
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,180
That cannot be true. Prime Minister is a traitor?

299
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:39,940
For just tonight, please watch from here, then you will know.

300
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,340
Do you not trust me?

301
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,690
If you are not telling the truth...

302
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:57,410
I will shave my head and go to Gameop Temple and live there for the rest of my life.

303
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,120
Prime Minister, the doctor just opened a side entrance to Heungdeok Palace.

304
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:30,200
I will rescue this kingdom from that Goryeo bitch blinded by greed and power.

305
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,230
Be prepared to fight with all your might and follow me.

306
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,850
Traitors have invaded!

307
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,430
- Block them!
- Block them!

308
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,850
Kill anyone who gets in our way.

309
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:24,940
Empress Dowager, Prime Minister just infiltrated Heungdeok Palace.

310
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,000
Merciful Buddha...

311
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,600
Thank you... Thank you, merciful Buddha.

312
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,750
Chief Imperial Consort.

313
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,540
You staged a revolt after all?

314
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,940
The thing I was concerned about happened after all.

315
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,560
Where is His Majesty?

316
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,480
Wherever he is,

317
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,630
I told you that I am taking good care of him, didn't I?

318
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,300
Shut your mouth!

319
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,770
How dare you try to usurp power by taking His Majesty hostage?

320
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:24,340
I will kill you, Bitch, and rescue this kingdom from its misery.

321
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,720
You will rescue this kingdom?

322
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:35,630
Then you should commit suicide.

323
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,870
I will slaughter Chief Imperial Consort.

324
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,720
No one can interfere.

325
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,850
Your Majesty!

326
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,080
Your Majesty...

327
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,580
Prime Minister.

328
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,380
Your Majesty? You were alive?

329
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,440
What is going on?

330
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:17,010
Why are you holding that sword, trying to kill Chief Imperial Consort?

331
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:23,450
Please drop your sword, Prime Minister.

332
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,790
You must kill Chief Imperial Consort now.

333
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,080
Shut your mouth.

334
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,870
We've already taken over Heongdeok Palace.

335
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:33,240
If you don't kill her now, her arrogance will pierce the sky.

336
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,000
Then you will truly become a traitor.

337
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Hurry and command the attack, Prime Minister.

338
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,050
What's wrong, Prime Minister?

339
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:51,850
Must you kill me to be satisfied?

340
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,610
Fine, do whatever you want.

341
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:02,420
You always did whatever you wanted, after all.

342
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:16,530
Prime Minister, I just asked you a question.

343
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,240
Just what is going on?

344
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,590
Uncle.

345
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,820
Prime Minister, hurry.

346
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,810
Your Majesty, please kill

347
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,610
this disloyal subject.

348
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,380
Please kill me as well, Your Majesty.

349
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,160
Your Majesty, please imprison the prime minister.

350
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:21,070
Imprison the traitor Bayan.

351
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,630
Yes.

352
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,630
[Thousand]

353
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,290
Have you heard of the White Lotus Society?

354
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,380
Isn't that a rebel army based on a religious movement of the Han Chinese?

355
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,140
Contact them and give them military funds.

356
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,270
What?

357
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,090
You want us to help rebel forces?

358
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,760
[War]

359
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:27,470
The leader's favorite foundation for making money is war.

360
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,360
Can we get the mask that the Leader of Hawk House wears?

361
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,060
Why, all of a sudden?

362
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,510
Their fatal weakness is that

363
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,250
even the leaders of each branch do not know the leader's face.

364
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,410
So you will pretend to be the Leader?

365
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,980
Can you find out how to contact each branch leader?

366
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,370
It's not easy, but not impossible.

367
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,830
Have they all gathered?

368
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:32,370
Yes, and Tanqishi is here, too.

369
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,300
We will kill him tonight.

370
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,030
Not yet.

371
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,230
We greet the Leader.

372
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,860
We greet the Leader.

373
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,990
We will give you the leader's command.

374
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,360
Exchange all your goods

375
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,750
to Yuan's paper money.

376
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,790
Leader, why are you asking me to do that?

377
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,510
I will tell you the reason in time.

378
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,050
We heard from the White Lotus Society.

379
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,310
What shall we do?

380
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:45,320
Didn't you ask us to give money to the White Lotus Society?

381
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,400
He says to stop immediately.

382
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,390
Chief Imperial Consort influenced the Imperial Court?

383
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,860
Yes, Your Highness.

384
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,980
Not just the magistrates, all the vassals are gathering in the Great Hall right now.

385
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:23,060
I am certain they are conspiring to kill Prime Minister.

386
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,560
Where are you going?

387
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,020
I must meet the emperor.

388
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,360
To petition him to save Prime Minister?

389
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,580
Would that be all? To uncover all your atrocities—

390
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:51,400
Empress Dowager, don't you see me trying very hard to be patient?

391
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,770
Patient?

392
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,570
For the prime minister's revolt,

393
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,090
you've made a significant contribution, Empress Dowager.

394
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:03,320
Revolt? Prime Minister was only trying to stop your tyranny—

395
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,400
Please hear what I have to say.

396
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,770
Until Prime Minister's disposal is decided,

397
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,000
you must not take one step out of here.

398
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,590
So you will lock me up?

399
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:21,390
I told you, I am holding myself back right now.

400
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:28,200
If I lose my patience, what might happen to you,

401
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,980
I can't promise anything.

402
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,960
Head Eunuch Dok Man.

403
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,400
Yes, Your Highness.

404
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,490
Put Imperial Guards outside so that Empress Dowager does not do anything rash.

405
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,960
Have them guard this place vigilantly.

406
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,560
I understand, Your Highness.

407
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,740
Your Majesty.

408
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,370
You thought Chief Imperial Consort would hurt me?

409
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:21,640
I am not mistaken. We have been deceived by her.

410
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:27,970
She manipulated me so that I would mobilize the military.

411
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:38,090
If you trusted in her, none of this would have happened.

412
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,800
Your Majesty, it's a trap.

413
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,440
Chief Imperial Consort used a wicked scheme—

414
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,900
You stay out of this!

415
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,980
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

416
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:57,800
Chief Imperial Consort is as precious to me as you are.

417
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,370
Seeing how you two have become enemies, my heart is heavy.

418
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,880
You must cast out Chief Imperial Consort.

419
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,960
Prime Minister!

420
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,690
Even if you order my execution now, my conviction will not change.

421
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:15,610
It is the last piece of advice I can give you.

422
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:22,190
Please expel Chief Imperial Consort and restore this kingdom on the right path of history.

423
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:28,220
Prime Minister, you should take a step back this time.

424
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:34,400
For me, please do that, Prime Minister.

425
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,250
- Your Majesty...
- That is

426
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:43,610
what you must do to live.

427
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,740
I don't want to lose you, Prime Minister.

428
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,280
This is not a command, but a request.

429
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,930
So please, just this once,

430
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,330
please listen to my request.

431
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,040
Prime Minister, who tried to kill me and Crown Prince Ayu,

432
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,900
I cannot forgive him.

433
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,560
I would prefer execution over dismissal from office.

434
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,260
Is there anyone who opposes me?

435
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,800
This is a clear case of high treason.

436
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,770
How can you come to any other conclusion?

437
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:57,480
We Three Excellencies and the magistrates, along with the other vassals will submit a petition today to His Majesty.

438
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,620
Don't worry, Your Highness.

439
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,540
Don't worry, Your Highness!

440
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:11,150
I won't forget all your sincerity and loyalty.

441
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,620
His Majesty enters!

442
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,310
Your Majesty? Prime Minister should be in prison.

443
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:53,420
Prime Minister said he will pledge his loyalty to you.

444
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:07,390
I have no need for such a thing.

445
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,570
Chief Imperial Consort.

446
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:17,320
Right here and right now, please choose between me or Prime Minister.

447
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:23,470
If you cannot cast out the Prime Minister, I will leave here.

448
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,820
So decide.

449
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:33,620
Is it me? Or is it Prime Minister?

450
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,160
Both of you should leave.

451
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:44,850
Your Majesty.

452
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:50,720
Rather than cast one of you out, I'll just lose both of you.

453
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,400
Everyone.

454
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:58,050
My position was always lonely, very lonely.

455
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,830
I forgot about my loneliness thanks to Chief Imperial Consort and Prime Minister. How could you not know my heart?

456
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,750
How could you?

457
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,620
Your Majesty.

458
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,220
So decide.

459
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,790
Both of you stay, or both of you go.

460
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:34,730
I, Bayan, will protect Chief Imperial Consort and the crown prince,

461
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:37,720
and I will pledge my life for that purpose.

462
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:53,280
Please accept my sincerity and loyalty, Your Highness.

463
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,390
I... this Bayan...

464
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:36,060
got down on my knees in front of the Chief Imperial Consort.

465
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:42,530
To a lowly tribute girl dragged here from Goryeo,

466
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,490
I pledged my loyalty.

467
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,590
It was a brave decision for His Majesty's sake.

468
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:52,700
I... I begged for my life.

469
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,670
Uncle.

470
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,980
In order to live,

471
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:04,900
so cowardly... so miserably...

472
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,410
I shamed my family name.

473
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,130
Please calm down.

474
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:16,570
Toqto'a, won't you help me one last time?

475
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:25,050
Please summon Chief Imperial Consort. She will come if you ask her.

476
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,620
If you have something to tell her—

477
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,990
I will kill her.

478
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,590
I will cut her head off with my own hands.

479
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:38,490
Uncle, when His Majesty recovers—

480
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:41,000
I am doing this for his sake.

481
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:49,820
If you refuse my request, then I will have no choice but to mobilize the military.

482
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,850
I will have no choice but to kill Chief Imperial Consort, the crown prince,

483
00:46:54,850 --> 00:47:01,340
and all the vassals in the Imperial Court and create a bloodbath in the palace.

484
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:09,800
I don't want to go that far, so you should help me.

485
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:22,350
Why did you ask to see me?

486
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:29,000
No matter how much I think about it, my conclusion is

487
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,630
only one.

488
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:42,630
Teacher, may I ask for your help one last time?

489
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:49,660
Please secretly summon the prime minister.

490
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:55,340
I must get rid of him myself.

491
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,820
Can you do what I request?

492
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:09,860
Please give me some time to think.

493
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,760
When will you give me your answer?

494
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:22,170
I will meet you tonight at Ja-si (11:30 - 12:30 a.m.) at the Great Hall.

495
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,700
I will be waiting.

496
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,430
At Ja-si (11:30 - 12:30 a.m.) in the Great Hall?

497
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,700
Yes. I couldn't get her to leave the palace.

498
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:52,540
- What about Park Bul Hwa?
- Tonight,

499
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,830
he has business outside the palace.

500
00:48:54,830 --> 00:49:00,020
Tell Mujin and Jadan to be stationed in the Great Hall before hand.

501
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,640
Yes, Uncle.

502
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,140
You did well, Toqto'a.

503
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,010
Just in case...

504
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,690
I,f His Majesty kills me for having killed Chief Imperial Consort

505
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:34,090
you lead this kingdom.

506
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:35,920
Uncle.

507
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,910
Because you are here, I am afraid of nothing.

508
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,520
Your Majesty!

509
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,240
Your Majesty!

510
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:39,470
Your Majesty, a group holding swords just headed to the Great Hall.

511
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:44,420
Swords? Whose men are they?

512
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:49,130
Would you like a cup of tea?

513
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,150
I can't wait long.

514
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,490
So you go ahead and have some.

515
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:09,810
When I was dragged here as a tribute, the first thing I learned in this palace

516
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,880
was how to make tea.

517
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,520
As I made tea, I swore revenge

518
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,190
against those who killed my parents.

519
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,960
As I overcame many obstacles,

520
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,590
I hid my blade of vengeance...

521
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,120
but I've never broken that blade.

522
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,150
Just what are you talking about?

523
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:43,940
You pledged loyalty to me?

524
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,080
People do not change.

525
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,630
You took a step back while hiding your blade of vengeance.

526
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,770
There is no way I wouldn't know that.

527
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:09,660
Prime Minister, you are not someone who would break your conviction.

528
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,290
Am I wrong?

529
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:19,360
This is my response.

530
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,190
Everyone come out.

531
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,730
They aren't your men, Prime Minister.

532
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,990
Are you surprised?

533
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,410
You deceived me.

534
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,240
Get rid of him.

535
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,690
Toqto'a!

536
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:20,210
Toqto'a!!

537
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:22,290
Are you outside?

538
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,340
Toqto'a!

539
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:19,190
Toqto'a... why you?

540
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,360
Why do you betray me?

541
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,550
Do you remember?

542
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:35,950
If you ever become disgraceful due to desire for power, you asked me to kill you myself, Uncle.

543
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:40,650
Toqto'a... do I look

544
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:43,280
disgraceful to you?

545
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:54,460
Am I truly in the throes of desire for power?

546
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:02,530
I only... for the sake of His Majesty... and our nation...

547
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:08,880
Uncle, in your convictions, there was no consideration for the people.

548
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,710
Toqto'a...

549
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:15,630
A conviction that does not take care of the people's hearts...

550
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,540
that is selfish desire itself, Uncle.

551
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,180
Toqto'a...

552
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,440
Please go peacefully.

553
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,500
Prime Minister?

554
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,300
Your Majesty.

555
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,950
Prime Minister.

556
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:17,830
I was not able to protect Your Majesty until the end.

557
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,100
Please forgive my disloyalty.

558
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:32,210
No, Prime Minister.

559
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:36,150
Prime Minister! Prime Minister!

560
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,630
Prime Minister...

561
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:44,090
No, Prime Minister!

562
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:46,010
Prime Minister...

563
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:22,420
♫ Love is such a sad word to me that it's maddening ♫

564
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:28,410
♫ Even if my heart aches it must be endured ♫

565
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:36,250
♫ Even if dawn breaks with tears and my heart falls apart ♫
