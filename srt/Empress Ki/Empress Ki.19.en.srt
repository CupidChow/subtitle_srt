1
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,040
Stop!

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,200
Everyone, leave.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,950
Yes, Sir!

4
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,920
Even if I can't have your heart,

5
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,980
I will have your life.

6
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,970
You're not supposed to be in here. Can't you hear me? Leave!

7
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,650
I just got permission from your father to take Seung Nyang.

8
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,210
What?

9
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,480
Tell your father if you have a problem.

10
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:34,170
And if you have the courage, tell him this, too.

11
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,630
Seung Nyang...

12
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,940
Seung Nyang... Seung Nyang!

13
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,850
Hurry!

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,310
Put her down.

15
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,980
It's a command! Put her down!

16
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,160
As soon as you leave here,

17
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,810
all of you will die.

18
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,400
Seung Nyang is no longer a court lady.

19
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,410
What?

20
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,740
It's an order from Prime Minister Yeon Cheol that she become my subordinate.

21
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,030
Did you say a command?

22
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:45,030
You can go against the prime minister and try blocking me.

23
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,690
Move!

24
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,420
Where are you going, Your Majesty?

25
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,460
I'm going to meet with the prime minister.

26
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,760
Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

27
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,330
Prime Minister let Yang...

28
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,220
leave the palace.

29
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,930
What about it?

30
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,040
Do you have feelings for that lowly girl?

31
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,940
Don't forget that the empress is my daughter.

32
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,770
Please stop doing useless things.

33
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,410
Damn it...

34
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,240
How is she?

35
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,360
Is she all right?

36
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,340
She had to endure severe pain,

37
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,830
so she's very weak.

38
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,390
Tanqishi, I'll kill you.

39
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,030
From suffering such great pains,

40
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,300
she will have a high fever for the time being.

41
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,510
I will look after her.

42
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,000
You can all leave.

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,840
Yes.

44
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,310
Don't fear, Seung Nyang.

45
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,290
From now on,

46
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll protect you.

47
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,440
There's no one

48
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,750
who will be able to torment you.

49
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,930
I ruined everything.

50
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,840
Looking for the bloodletter and putting Yang in that state, too.

51
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,870
They're all due to my foolish and lacking self.

52
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,960
Your Majesty.

53
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,210
Any news on Yang?

54
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,270
She's still not awake yet.

55
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,890
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

56
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,220
Wang Yoo is working with the prime minister. Were you aware?

57
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,770
What do you mean?

58
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,750
The two of them are colluding together.

59
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,570
What are they colluding about exactly?

60
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,100
Find out what that is.

61
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,950
Why Wang Yoo met with El Temür in secret and what they are scheming.

62
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,220
I understand, Your Majesty,

63
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,800
but has something been going on?

64
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,780
I would like the two of them to disappear forever.

65
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,330
Prime Minister El Temür for certain,

66
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,650
but I also want to kill Wang Yoo, too.

67
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,490
His eyes have even changed.

68
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,800
It's probably because of that girl named Yang.

69
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,980
Yang? He changed over a mere court lady?

70
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,540
Prime Minister El Temür released the girl who was a court lady to Wang Yoo.

71
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,540
Doesn't that also seem strange?

72
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,360
True.

73
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,030
Prime Minister El Temür isn't someone who would get involved in such matters.

74
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,810
I'm sure the two of them made some type of a deal.

75
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,220
Keep an eye on not only Wang Yoo but his subordinates' whereabouts from tomorrow on.

76
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,990
Yes, Uncle.

77
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,960
Empress Dowager is here.

78
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,840
What brings you to my room?

79
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,880
Your brother put the emperor in danger last night.

80
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,670
He was looking for the bloodletter and left the palace in secret.

81
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,510
Why do you blame my brother when His Majesty acted rashly?

82
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,990
Rashly you say?

83
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,130
I heard my father

84
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,980
was also shocked to find His Majesty there.

85
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,860
He's the one who created the misunderstanding with his actions.

86
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,430
It's natural that he should look for his father's will.

87
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,610
Why on earth did General Tanqishi set a trap?

88
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,130
Your Highness, speaking negatively about the relationship between my father and His Majesty

89
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,830
I will no longer withstand.

90
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,470
If there are too many leaves, the branch will bend.

91
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,220
How can His Majesty survive his subordinates' high authorities?

92
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,580
Even so, you can't cut the tree down.

93
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,330
Since His Majesty can't act his part, of course, my father has to step in.

94
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,500
I really hope you have a son.

95
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,930
Yes, I will soon enough.

96
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,770
When your son becomes the emperor

97
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,120
and gets threatened by General Tanqishi, will you accept it as normal?

98
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,460
My brothers aren't like that.

99
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,270
You don't know.

100
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,130
The thirst for power can end a father and son relationship and call for the blood of siblings.

101
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,620
How could a nephew survive that?

102
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,960
Stop.

103
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,350
General Tanqishi will become an even scarier person than Prime Minister El Temür.

104
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,590
At that time, you will come to understand how I feel.

105
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,640
But it will be too late by then.

106
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,280
Empress Dowager!

107
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,690
But then again, you don't even know when you'll become pregnant.

108
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,170
Surely my words are falling on deaf ears.

109
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,040
I guess I got ahead of myself.

110
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,000
Get pregnant first.

111
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,900
It won't be too late to listen to my earnest appeal then.

112
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,120
Take this medicine first.

113
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,010
His Majesty cares about you a lot.

114
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,890
Had your father seen this, he would have been happy.

115
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,670
Please find some clothes for me to wear.

116
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,100
We only have men here.

117
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,290
It doesn't matter. Please find me some short arrows, too.

118
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,200
Short arrows?

119
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,260
I will go back to being the old Seung Nyang and help His Majesty.

120
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,830
He won't allow it.

121
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,130
Do you want me to cook and wash clothes here?

122
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,020
Fine. I will find you some.

123
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,040
But... has His Majesty gone somewhere?

124
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,360
Oh, it's been completely dried with the skin intact.

125
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,720
This one is one with the skin peeled off.

126
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,200
Let's take those.

127
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,540
Jeo Dang Bae and Moo Jin, you two keep following them.

128
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,510
Yes, sir.

129
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,030
Welcome.

130
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,360
What medicine did they just buy from you?

131
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,950
They bought dried toad skins.

132
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,100
What do you use that for?

133
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,660
If you boil it for a long time and make an extract, it becomes a very potent anesthetic.

134
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,820
But... why do you ask?

135
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,800
Anesthetic? Where are they using it?

136
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,210
Wang Yoo also bought this.

137
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,460
Isn't this wine?

138
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,620
It's a red wine from the West.

139
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,690
Red wine?

140
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,730
He's scheming to make someone drink this anesthetic.

141
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,210
That's right.

142
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:50,710
We just need to find out why and whom he's trying to make drink it.

143
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,950
Wang Yoo just went to the Prime Minister's house.

144
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,440
You seem to... always drink the same tea.

145
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,930
I'm waiting for that secret plan of yours right now.

146
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:32,170
What do you think is the most earnest thing the enemy seeks?

147
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,280
Probably my death.

148
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:40,600
Then... will you die?

149
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,560
How dare you!

150
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:53,800
"Hon Su Mo Eo" is a saying which means after you muddy the waters, fish will get caught in the net on their own.

151
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,210
You're telling me to feign death?

152
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:03,930
If you fall, the parties will split into two groups.

153
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,900
Those who will try to protect you with their loyalty,

154
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:13,660
and those who will betray you to attain power.

155
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,450
Then I'll be able to sort out the jade from the rocks.

156
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,730
But Father, it won't be easy to fool them!

157
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,880
That's right. If they sense something is going on,

158
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,350
we could be put in a predicament instead.

159
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,530
This is a red wine from the West.

160
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,890
It's a precious wine made from grapes.

161
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,040
Why don't you try drinking this?

162
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,850
Once you do, you'll see how we can completely fool them.

163
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,120
It's just some sweet fruit wine!

164
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,270
Nothing happened.

165
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,200
Father, don't get fooled by this man's—

166
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,290
What's going on?

167
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,210
Please come to your senses!

168
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,900
What did you do!

169
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,250
He'll wake up in half a day. There's no reason to worry.

170
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,250
It's just an anesthetic.

171
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:47,200
His pulse and breathing will slow resulting in an unconscious-like state.

172
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,400
If you drink this alcohol, who wouldn't be fooled?

173
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,570
El Temür will drink the wine containing the anesthetic?

174
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:25,640
It's a plan to find the writer of the slanderous document by faking his death.

175
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,690
We nearly got put in danger ourselves.

176
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,520
Did it go well?

177
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,790
In-law, there's something called "Cha Do Sal In."

178
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,060
Doesn't that mean to kill someone using another person's sword?

179
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:42,250
Soon, internal strife will take place and they will try to kill each other.

180
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,630
Wow, that will be a sight to behold!

181
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,600
Your skills are as good as ever.

182
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,000
What are you doing?

183
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,520
You're not in any state of health to be shooting arrows.

184
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,300
It's my fault. I wanted to see her skill, so—

185
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,880
No. I asked him if I could shoot.

186
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,320
What if your illness flares up again?

187
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,890
I'm fine now.

188
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:40,880
Look, Your Majesty. The arrows have been grouped at the bullseye—

189
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,030
You're still burning up.

190
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,310
Y-Your Majesty.

191
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,240
Torture is hard to survive though, even for men.

192
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,000
Th-That was nothing.

193
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,460
Like in the old days, if I just drink some rice wine—

194
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,200
You don't need to pretend to be strong.

195
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,690
Tell me if it's difficult or if you're experiencing pain.

196
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,130
Don't bear it all alone like a fool.

197
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,350
You'll get sick at this rate.

198
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,440
Please eat.

199
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,360
Have you heard anything from Yang?

200
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,570
If you wish, I can go see her.

201
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:48,800
No. She's probably still unwell, so I'll wait until she comes back.

202
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,340
Your Majesty, she's now—

203
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,740
Wang Yoo's person.

204
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,340
- She's not coming back, so why must you—
- Silence!

205
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:10,000
In her heart, I'm sure there's a place for me, too.

206
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,430
Your Majesty, General Bayan is here to see you.

207
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,430
Let him in.

208
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,320
What happened? Did you find out Wang Yoo's plan?

209
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,880
Are you all right now?

210
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,100
Yes, Father.

211
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:47,290
Are you really thinking about drinking that?

212
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:51,960
This is a chance to catch those who are trying to stab me in the back. How could I not?

213
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,120
I still don't trust Wang Yoo.

214
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,890
It's not because of jealousy. If something goes wrong by chance—

215
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,890
You also woke up and are normal after drinking this wine.

216
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:09,230
If you want to oppose, bring me a better plan.

217
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,060
He said to muddy the waters in order to catch the fish.

218
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,450
Isn't Wang Yoo's wisdom impressive?

219
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,930
If Prime Minister El Temür

220
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,130
drinks the wine and never wakes up, what happens?

221
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,490
It's only an anesthetic that's contained in the wine.

222
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,730
If we switch it with one that contains poison,

223
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,830
we could take his life away for good.

224
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,430
Your Majesty.

225
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,300
If he dies after drinking that poisoned drink,

226
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,910
Wang Yoo who offered the wine will be blamed entirely.

227
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,550
Kill them both...

228
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,370
that way.

229
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,480
Switching the wine is too dangerous.

230
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,690
Who can put a bell on the tiger's neck?

231
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,160
You two can do it.

232
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,740
Your Majesty, if we make any mistakes—

233
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,110
What action can you take if you only think about what could go wrong?

234
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,890
Whatever it takes,

235
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,640
get it done. I will kill Wang Yoo no matter what...

236
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:39,170
This will bring you back to me, Yang, surely.

237
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,800
For disobeying you

238
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,250
and for disobeying your orders?

239
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,730
I thought helping the emperor

240
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,610
would benefit you.

241
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,100
I wanted to find the bloodletter myself and—

242
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,960
I have never met anyone who doesn't listen as much as you.

243
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,710
But then again, you were always that way.

244
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,800
Stubborn and bullheaded...

245
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,410
The one who's ever made me worry myself sick...

246
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,830
was you alone.

247
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,850
Maybe... that's why you're that much more special to me.

248
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,670
I need you to go somewhere with me, so eat up.

249
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,100
Where are we going?

250
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:53,630
I hear there's a place here in Daedo where they sell special things from Goryeo,

251
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,410
so let's take a look around.

252
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,670
All of you have a round of rice wine today!

253
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,240
Thank you!

254
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,600
You are so generous!

255
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:26,050
Yang seems a lot healthier.

256
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,260
Welcome!

257
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,840
Look! Isn't this ginseng!

258
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,780
Look at this!

259
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,430
It smells great.

260
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,800
Even if you ate this,

261
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,490
you wouldn't get any benefits, huh?

262
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,360
- I would!
- How? You don't even have a woman!

263
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,100
Goryeo's ginseng, paper,

264
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:11,020
and brushes are all recognized to be the best here as well.

265
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,440
They're being smuggled and have become the influential people's main source of income here.

266
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,300
It suits her very well!

267
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,010
I'll take this one.

268
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,280
That's great!

269
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,610
Do you know the weakest point among Yuan's commercial powers?

270
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,450
I heard they don't have the ability to produce their own products.

271
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,720
You know it well then.

272
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,900
When I get restored to the throne, the first thing I'll do is

273
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,810
stop influential people from doing their smuggling business.

274
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,910
If that happens, you could take over

275
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,990
a part of Yuan's commercial power.

276
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,680
Your Majesty.

277
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,700
It will be too bad to return home after coming all this way.

278
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:02,890
Can we have a drink before we go back?

279
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,230
We'll look around some more, so why don't you all go by yourselves?

280
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,000
Thank you. Thank you!

281
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,150
I'll stay behind.

282
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,200
You should have some senses if you lack a woman!

283
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:32,490
Wow! Where did you get all these?

284
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,090
The girls are going to love them!

285
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,810
Is everyone well?

286
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:43,030
Yeon Hwa became a court lady for the imperial quarters to take care of the emperor.

287
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,600
Yeon Hwa?

288
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,430
I don't know why, but he had stopped eating.

289
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,900
He keeps drinking all day.

290
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,300
I know where the bloodletter is.

291
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,630
After you left, she's become worse.

292
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,710
Whenever she regains her senses, she keeps asking for you.

293
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,210
The bald man took it!

294
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:17,220
Oh, Ma'am! I told you you can't speak about the bloodletter!

295
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,250
The bald man took it I said!

296
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,430
You don't believe me either, do you?

297
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,600
I do believe you. The bald man took it.

298
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,570
He's really ugly,

299
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,610
but he loved me even as a mere eunuch.

300
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,410
Eunuch?

301
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:46,630
Then... is that eunuch's name Jeok Ho?

302
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,480
That's right, it is!

303
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,090
Do you know where he is right now?

304
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,140
He jumped over the wall in one leap.

305
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:05,820
- Where to?
- What do mean where to? To his house.

306
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,160
Where is his house?

307
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,830
Aren't they pretty?

308
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,860
Aren't they?

309
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,620
They're so pretty.

310
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,250
Pretty.

311
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,640
What? Yeom Byeong Soo?

312
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,500
I thought you were someone else!

313
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,190
You have nothing better to do than sneak a peek at a man taking a bath?

314
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,050
I'm not some pervert.

315
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:47,400
I heard some noises, so I looked to see who it was.

316
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,960
But...

317
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,590
why did you shave?

318
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,010
Huh?

319
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:05,080
Why? Are the royal forces going to arrest me for shaving it off?

320
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,120
It's not that.

321
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,500
But C-Chief...

322
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,200
I think I have to go away for a few days.

323
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,930
- An important person from Goryeo is coming, so I have to take him and—
- Who's stopping you?

324
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,130
I don't care if you ever come back.

325
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,280
I just need a few days. I'll be back!

326
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,880
I know martial arts,

327
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,140
but that was no ordinary skill.

328
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,730
Something is fishy.

329
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,360
Did you drink again?

330
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,750
Drink?

331
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,550
I didn't. Not even a drop.

332
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,380
If you're drunk...

333
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,800
I'm completely normal.

334
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,860
Who do you think you are

335
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,880
to make me this pathetic?

336
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,970
Who do you think you are!

337
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,160
I'm not a court lady anymore.

338
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:14,620
Don't think you can treat me as you wish.

339
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,300
I treated you with utmost sincerity.

340
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,540
How can you be so cruel?

341
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:28,690
Am I only worth this much to you?

342
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,860
Am I someone whom you can forget if you turn your head?

343
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:40,230
In your eyes... I exist, too.

344
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,250
Not only Wang Yoo,

345
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,140
but I am in your heart, too!

346
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,940
How can you know more about my heart than me?

347
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,340
I have never once...

348
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,600
opened my heart up to you.

349
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,760
That's a lie. Don't lie.

350
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,320
Before Wang Yoo came, you definitely—

351
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,000
It was not because of you!

352
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,520
What is it because of then?

353
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,510
I'm asking what the reason is?

354
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,250
Commander Ki Ja Oh...

355
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:20,100
died because of you.

356
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:25,880
I've already commanded that his family be compensated fully.

357
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,200
Do you think that could be forgiven...

358
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,390
through compensation?

359
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,490
- Was it all because of that mere Ki Ja Oh?
- Mere!

360
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,140
That man was...

361
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,350
That man was my father.

362
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,620
F-Father?

363
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,150
When we were in Goryeo, you two weren't father and daughter!

364
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,810
In order to prevent my being taken as a tribute,

365
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:14,100
we couldn't let it be known that we were father and daughter!

366
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,010
While I was here with you,

367
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,420
do you know what kind of thoughts I had?

368
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,510
I wanted to kill you.

369
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:37,530
Please... don't ever look for me.

370
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,860
Why didn't you kill me?

371
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,700
Just kill me instead.

372
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,940
Hurry up and kill me.

373
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,410
Why can't you kill me?

374
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,620
Hurry up and kill me. If only I can receive your forgiveness—

375
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,530
If I kill you,

376
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:24,000
don't you know that all the people from Goryeo here in the palace will get killed, too?!

377
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,480
Then what should I do?

378
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,010
If I can't receive forgiveness with my life,

379
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,880
what exactly can I do?

380
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,020
Please forget me.

381
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,560
What I want is...

382
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,040
only that.

383
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,930
♫ Disappearing like something blowing and caught in my hand ♫

384
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,930
It's a lie! How could you lie?!

385
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,480
I saw it clearly with my eyes.

386
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,630
Ki Ja Oh...

387
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,580
- Ki Ja Oh wielded his sword at me and—
- Please close that mouth!

388
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,030
I'm sorry, daughter.

389
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,280
This lacking father...

390
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,780
Father!

391
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,820
You can't.

392
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,240
You can't die, Father!

393
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,690
Father!

394
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,660
Father!

395
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,410
You can't...

396
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,980
You can't die!

397
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:21,480
♫ The longing which runs and overflows like tears? ♫

398
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,420
♫ What can I do about it? ♫

399
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,760
♫ Only in sad dreams ♫

400
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,270
♫ You come to my side ♫

401
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,160
♫ I know it, but although I know it ♫

402
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,290
♫ I can't let go even a small bit ♫

403
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,340
♫ No matter how I try and try to conceal them ♫

404
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:49,570
♫ the tears keep filling my eyes ♫

405
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:57,430
♫ The longing which runs and overflows like tears? ♫

406
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,200
♫ What can I do about it? ♫

407
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,950
Tanqishi has the key to the wall cabinet.

408
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:53,080
If we can get that key, we can switch the (wine) bottles.

409
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,670
How can we get a key that he always carries?

410
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,780
I have a plan.

411
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,630
What is it?

412
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,800
Where are you going in such a hurry?

413
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,200
Please be careful.

414
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,110
I should be the one to say that.

415
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,460
We can make a key in this exact shape.

416
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,690
We got a very good impression of it. What about the poisoned wine?

417
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,300
Prime Minister went to the Great Hall.

418
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,480
We said we would wait here for a moment.

419
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,130
He ordered me not to let anyone in.

420
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,900
You!

421
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,150
How dare you call me "anyone"? Do I look that unimportant?

422
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,140
I apologize, General Bayan.

423
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,460
- Get going!
- Yes, General.

424
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,090
Welcome back, Prime Minister!

425
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,900
You're back, Prime Minister?

426
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,120
Put up a ger in the palace!
(T/N: A traditional yurt (from the Turkic languages) or ger (Mongolian) is a portable, round tent covered with skins or felt and used as a dwelling by several distinct nomadic groups.)

427
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,580
Are you declaring an emergency situation?

428
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,910
Not only the emperor but all the ministers, counselors,

429
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,150
and even staff will be called in for a privy council!

430
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,930
Yes, Father.

431
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:29,140
Call in Wang Yoo, too.

432
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,870
Wang Yoo is from Goryeo! How can he step into the ger?

433
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,930
Enough of your babbling!

434
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,020
I understand, Prime Minister.

435
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,630
Are you suspecting Wang Yoo, too?

436
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:51,660
The enemy under my nose is to be feared the most. How could I blindly trust Wang Yoo?

437
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,150
What? He put up a ger on the palace grounds?

438
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,010
Yes, Your Highness.

439
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,020
Were you aware of this?

440
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,820
Of course, I was.

441
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,080
How could I not know what my father does?

442
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,810
Do you know what a ger means? It means declaring an emergency situation!

443
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,520
And what about it?

444
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,250
The whole country has been shaken up by that slanderous document.

445
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,430
If there's something to be corrected,

446
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,680
don't you think correcting it is natural justice?

447
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,420
Listen well, Your Majesty.

448
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:37,670
Emperor Mingzong died the day after a ger was put up!

449
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,220
I see.

450
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:46,690
Stop Prime Minister El Temür.

451
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:51,870
You are not only his daughter but also His Majesty's wife!

452
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,490
If anything happens to him—

453
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:00,230
Is His Majesty the writer of the slanderous document?

454
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,770
- Your Majesty!
- If not,

455
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,030
are you the one?

456
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:12,710
Don't have needless worries. I'm afraid people will misunderstand.

457
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,080
Father, you're here.

458
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,640
What brings you here, Prime Minister?

459
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:48,430
If anyone makes a false move, you will not be forgiven!

460
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,240
What is this unreasonable action you're taking?

461
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:00,660
Until the ger is dismantled, you may not set foot outside this room.

462
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,540
Are you locking me up right now?

463
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,950
Seal the doors and prevent anyone from entering.

464
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,910
Yes, Father.

465
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,980
Are you determined to ruin this country?

466
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,420
Ruin this country?

467
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,610
Have you thought about what Yuan would be like without me?

468
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,480
Everyone from all over would revolt

469
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,860
in order to attain power!

470
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,350
The people would cause a riot and the army will

471
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,000
declare war in order to retrieve the national sovereignty.

472
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,690
Who will stop them?!

473
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:54,090
Will you? If not, could His Majesty do it?

474
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,680
You're delusional, Prime Minister.

475
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:04,210
What you see inside the palace isn't all there is to this world.

476
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,650
You probably want to protect the palace,

477
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,680
but I want to protect this country!

478
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,270
Understand!

479
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:26,240
Seal it!

480
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,870
Your Highness.

481
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,390
Your Highness.

482
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:37,610
Your Highness.

483
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,130
I will never forget what happened today, Prime Minister!

484
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:48,030
I will carve it into my bones and my heart will surely remember!

485
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,080
Your Highness!

486
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,290
What a relief.

487
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:05,440
Has your anger from having to prostrate yourself for forgiveness subsided a bit?

488
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,450
I have a long way to go until that subsides.

489
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:12,980
How could I forget the humiliation I suffered that day?

490
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:17,150
But... I will be able to sleep well tonight.

491
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

492
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,880
It's been a long time, Lieutenant Joo.

493
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,850
It's been a while, General Bang.

494
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,160
They're all gathering.

495
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,280
But why is Prime Minister El Temür asking for you, too?

496
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,420
Well, that's because he thinks of His Majesty as being on his side!

497
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,110
It could be the opposite.

498
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:14,580
Are you saying they're suspecting us or something?

499
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,570
Be careful, Your Majesty.

500
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,710
Have you been well all this time?

501
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,730
Welcome, General Bang.

502
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,200
Did your daughter's wedding go smoothly?

503
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,950
Yes, Prime Minister.

504
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,450
Thank you for caring about such small matters. I am honored.

505
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:31,490
Greetings, Prime Minister. Joo Guk Cheong here to give you my greetings.

506
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:35,090
Thank you for the gift you sent.

507
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:41,380
It wasn't much to speak of and I'm embarrassed, Prime Minister.

508
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,220
Are you done preparing?

509
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:08,150
Prime Minister El Temür just needs to drink the wine now.

510
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:08,090
Welcome, Your Majesty.

511
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,900
Why is he here?

512
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,620
I called for him.

513
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:20,540
But... you seem very nervous.

514
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,360
W-Well, I-I'm still not recovered yet from drinking.

515
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,210
Please take the seat of honor, Your Majesty.

516
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,920
Yes.

517
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,320
The emperor was worried about the state of affairs

518
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,730
and has issued an order!

519
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:08,300
Recently, a villainous group has circulated slanderous documents,

520
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:13,190
fragmented the court, and put the people in a state of confusion.

521
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:17,460
I, for the benefit of the country and its people,

522
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,520
will tighten the discipline of the country

523
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,550
and punish those who have been

524
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,280
extremely disloyal.

525
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,710
Please fill the wine cups.

526
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:44,060
Don't worry. It will take time for the poison to work.

527
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,810
To your health!

528
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:59,210
To your health, Your Majesty!

529
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,360
Your Majesty.

530
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:52,250
Our Ongirat warriors

531
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:58,820
dance to honor the soldiers who died while celebrating our victories.

532
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,640
On this occasion,

533
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,460
may I dance it once?

534
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,950
Of course, Prime Minister.

535
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:43,160
General Bang, was it your doing?

536
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,380
If not, Joo Guk Cheong was it you?

537
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:03,290
She fell!

538
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,560
What's wrong?

539
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:15,790
What happened? She's coughing up blood!

540
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:28,320
I'm sure one of you is the culprit who circulated that slanderous document.

541
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,190
Who could it be?

542
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:40,280
An impertinent bastard who dares to try and challenge me, exactly who is—

543
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,190
Father!

544
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,830
Father!

545
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,690
Father! Father!

546
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:16,350
Father! Father! Call the physician!

547
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,300
Father! Father!

548
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,150
Father! Father! Father!

549
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:25,850
Father! Father!

550
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,890
Father! Father!

551
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:31,250
Please wake up, Father!

552
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,090
It's not the anesthetic.

553
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:36,470
It really is... poison!

554
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:43,910
Wang Yoo, it's your turn next.

555
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:58,220
♫ Love is such a sad word to me that it's maddening ♫

556
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:04,190
♫ Even if my heart aches some words must be endured ♫

557
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:07,350
♫ Even if dawn breaks with tears ♫
