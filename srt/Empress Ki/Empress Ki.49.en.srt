00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,620
[Memorial Tablet of Yuan Dynasty Prime Minister Bayan]

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,050
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,920
Before you killed the prime minister,

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,340
why didn't you discuss it with me?

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,440
Instead of deciding to do it on your own?

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,120
Prime Minister used you to become a tyrant.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,670
A tyrant?

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,340
Prime Minister was trying to set this kingdom on the proper path.

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,650
But you were blinded by the desire for power

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,940
so you killed my most loyal vassal.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,220
Prostrate yourself and wait for my punishment.

12
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:05,830
Repent for your sin for killing the prime minister and request my forgiveness.

13
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,450
I am the one who killed the prime minister.

14
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,940
This isn't something you should receive punishment for.

15
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,360
This is between His Majesty and me.

16
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,030
You shouldn't involve yourself, Teacher.

17
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,560
I found this in the prime minister's home.

18
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,160
The Han Chinese in Yuan, the Jang clan, the Wang clan,

19
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,270
the Lee, Yoo, and Jo... his plan was to wipe them out completely.

20
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,920
They comprise a majority of the people in this kingdom.

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,090
My uncle who raised me...

22
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,340
This is one of the reasons I had to eliminate him with my own hands.

23
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,650
I will show this to His Majesty.

24
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,680
So Chief Imperial Consort—

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,930
He will say that it's fake.

26
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,110
And he will punish you instead, Teacher.

27
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,830
But you can't be blamed for everything—

28
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:39,290
Teacher, I do not want you to get hurt.

29
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,300
For His Majesty, and for this kingdom,

30
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,360
you have so much left to do.

31
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,950
Your Highness the Chief Imperial Consort.

32
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,490
I will solve this.

33
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,440
That's how it must be.

34
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,920
Why won't you prostrate yourself?

35
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,520
I swear on the heavens that I have done nothing wrong.

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,470
What?

37
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,050
So I have no reason to ask for forgiveness.

38
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,330
I told you that I cannot forgive you this time.

39
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:55,660
Out of respect for this ritual, I cannot lie.

40
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,430
Everyone but Chief Imperial Consort, leave now.

41
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,930
Anyone who shows her sympathy or consideration will receive the same punishment.

42
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,220
Chief Imperial Consort will never repent for her sins.

43
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,900
Your Majesty, you are not fully recovered. What if you fall ill again?

44
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,500
As soon as the sun rises,

45
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,080
leave this palace and take all the Goryeo people who serve you with you.

46
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,360
Go to Gameop Palace

47
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,370
and you will receive 100 lashings every day.

48
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,190
Your Majesty.

49
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,580
As you receive the lashings, repent your sins with your own mouth.

50
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,650
If you still cannot repent, even if you become a ghost that haunts Gameop Temple,

51
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,350
you still can never return to this palace.

52
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,230
I won't bend to your will this time.

53
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,240
Never...

54
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:49,200
Once we remove Chief Imperial Consort, there is no one left by the emperor's side.

55
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:57,360
If this kingdom belongs to the emperor, I am the emperor's owner.

56
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,920
But something strange is going on.

57
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,130
What do you mean?

58
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,600
There is an enormous amount of rice and grains being released in the market, at once.

59
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,490
At once?

60
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,390
That is causing the price of grains to be driven down.

61
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,870
But we've had famine for years.

62
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,210
So the price of grains should keep climbing higher.

63
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,270
Who is doing such a stupid thing?

64
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,740
I will find out.

65
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,230
No. You don't have to go to the trouble.

66
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:33,790
Let's wait and see. And when the time is right, we will buy it all.

67
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,700
It's rice!

68
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,470
Oh my goodness!

69
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,480
- It's rice!
- Rice!

70
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,060
As you ordered, Hawk House members are trading their food and gold,

71
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,880
and exchanging them for paper money.

72
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,770
Since the prices have fallen, even high officials

73
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,060
are fighting to sell the food they've kept in storage.

74
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,960
The market is overflowing with grains, but the people still can't even afford to buy a bag of rice.

75
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,390
How much does a bag of rice cost?

76
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,490
It's two and a half bills of Yuan paper money.

77
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,040
Shall we buy some, too?

78
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,970
This isn't the time.

79
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,470
Let's wait and see a little longer.

80
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,920
Your Majesty, Chief Imperial Consort has been kicked out of the palace and sent to Gameop Temple.

81
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,330
What does that mean?

82
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,870
Chief Imperial Consort was kicked out of the palace?

83
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,910
Your Majesty, Chief Imperial Consort is outside to say goodbye to you.

84
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,130
His Majesty said he doesn't want to see you.

85
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,100
Your Majesty.

86
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,200
I don't need it, so you can leave now.

87
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,690
Is His Majesty drinking again?

88
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,680
Wine is like poison to His Majesty now.

89
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,080
How could I allow it?

90
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,990
Don't worry about that, Your Highness.

91
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,520
Please take good care of yourself, Your Majesty.

92
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,100
Chief Imperial Consort,

93
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,340
where did that arrogant attitude go? Look at you now.

94
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,780
So you should have known your place.

95
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:52,030
Running wild with no regard to circumstances. And now look what you've become.

96
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,210
Allow me to make one request of you, Empress Dowager.

97
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,150
If you truly care for His Majesty,

98
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,450
please abandon your desire for power.

99
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:14,100
Stop trying to use His Majesty, please.

100
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,280
You should worry about yourself.

101
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,680
While you're at Gameop Temple, just like you did to Bayan (the deposed empress),

102
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,410
you might be ordered to drink poison tonic.

103
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,480
Just what is going on now?

104
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,770
Chief Imperial Consort was banished to Gamoep Temple?

105
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,530
We should petition His Majesty to bring Chief Imperial Consort back.

106
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,290
His Imperial Majesty enters!

107
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,050
All right.

108
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,870
So Taesa, Taebu, and Taebo,

109
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,110
you are on Chief Imperial Consort's side.

110
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,500
Minister of Affairs of State, Minister of Education,

111
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,310
and Minister of Culture, you guys were on the prime minister's side.

112
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:48,650
Oh, and the loyal dog of the Empress Dowager. You've come, too?

113
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,450
And Toqto'a. That's right, here is Toqto'a.

114
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,300
You must be a bit confused.

115
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,040
Half of you belongs to Prime Minister.

116
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,320
The other half belongs to Chief Imperial Consort.

117
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,440
No, no.

118
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,620
You played a role in Prime Minister's death. So I guess all of you belongs to Chief Imperial Consort now?

119
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,500
Now, there is no Bayan and no Chief Imperial Consort.

120
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,170
So, who will you pledge your loyalty to now?

121
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,200
Your Majesty, how can you say such a thing?

122
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,550
We are vassals who have received your imperial grace—

123
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,070
Shut that mouth!

124
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,030
Now, I will give you an opportunity.

125
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,270
Those who can give me your lives,

126
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,310
get down flat on the ground.

127
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:11,780
If you don't, you will pay for the crime of being disloyal

128
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,960
and I will kill you all with this sword.

129
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,690
Golta, count to three.

130
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,730
One.

131
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,150
Two.

132
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,830
Look at all of you.

133
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,920
Why aren't you on the ground?

134
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,300
If getting down on the ground is loyalty,

135
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,760
I could even cut off my limbs.

136
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,060
But the way you look now, Your Majesty,

137
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,120
I cannot give you true loyalty from my heart.

138
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,920
That's right.

139
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,650
That's right, that's right.

140
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:44,540
You cowards! You can't say the proper things like Toqto'a!

141
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,940
Your Majesty!

142
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,440
Golta, did you see that?

143
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,350
These guys, even just a short while ago,

144
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,930
you were pleading all your loyalty to Bayan or the Chief Imperial Consort.

145
00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:01,200
And now you are afraid of my sword so you throw them away like an old shoe!

146
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:08,420
These treacherous subjects, flying this way and that like migratory birds,

147
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,490
I will kill all of you with my sword.

148
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,380
Emperor!

149
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:27,370
Emperor, please calm down. Come to your senses, please.

150
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,330
Empress Dowager, you get down on the ground, too.

151
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,520
What did you say?

152
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,730
Get down on the ground, I said.

153
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,330
Pledge your loyalty to me.

154
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,300
Emperor.

155
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,120
Why not? Aren't you one of my vassals, too?

156
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,660
Aren't you one of my people?

157
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,930
Eunuch Baek, what are you doing? Escort His Majesty out of here.

158
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,680
Do you want to die?

159
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,640
Hurry and take him to his bedroom.

160
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,470
Let go of me.

161
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,210
I am this kingdom's emperor!

162
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:15,310
I am the ruler of this land!

163
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,250
Since Chief Imperial Consort left, His Majesty's discipline is fading fast.

164
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,730
We cannot just stand by and watch this.

165
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:37,500
Of course, I won't stand by and watch this golden opportunity.

166
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,860
A golden opportunity?

167
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,130
Emperor's intelligence has become as clouded as can be.

168
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,200
We can now remove Ayu as the crown prince.

169
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,460
And isn't this the perfect opportunity to seat a new emperor?

170
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,050
Do you know how long I've waited for this day?

171
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:15,020
Now I will be the one to use your power and authority.

172
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,870
I devoted myself to your service all this time. So I'm entitled to at least this much, aren't I?

173
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,110
Your Highness? What's wrong?

174
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,460
I had a bad dream.

175
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:42,030
The military was trying to harm His Majesty.

176
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,680
His Majesty.

177
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,890
His Majesty...

178
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,700
Did you sleep well?

179
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,830
My head hurts.

180
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,370
It's cottonseed tea that helps relieve alcohol poisoning.

181
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,350
Your Majesty, Toqto'a has arrived.

182
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,030
His Majesty is very tired, so later—

183
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,030
Tell him to come in.

184
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,960
What brings you here early in the morning?

185
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,800
This is what my uncle had planned.

186
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,810
He planned to exterminate the five major clans of the Han Chinese people.

187
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,050
And this...

188
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:33,060
They document transactions between Uncle and Hawk House.

189
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,340
Hawk House?

190
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:42,090
Uncle agreed to oppress immigrant traders in exchange for a large amount of money.

191
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,450
Your Majesty, right now,

192
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,880
Hawk House is dominating our kingdom and sucking the blood out of the people.

193
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,870
You must stop them and punish them severely.

194
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,000
I will assign to you an important duty.

195
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,620
I apologize.

196
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:12,230
I plan to withdraw from all public offices.

197
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,710
What are you saying?

198
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,480
I killed my uncle with my own hands. I can claim it was for the greater good,

199
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,900
but I've committed a sin against Heaven.

200
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,950
How can I dare to put on a show in the imperial palace?

201
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:33,140
I plan to immerse myself in studies for the remainder of my days.

202
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,630
Even you...

203
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,420
Even you will leave me, too?

204
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,300
Your Majesty,

205
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,410
please bring Chief Imperial Consort back.

206
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,600
Her only thoughts are of you.

207
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:58,490
If you are looking for someone who will be sincerely loyal to you,

208
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,810
you must have Chief Imperial Consort at your side.

209
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,870
I was told that as she receives lashings, she has never repented even once.

210
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,850
Not only that, she resents you.

211
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:48,670
You wouldn't, as Toqto'a said,

212
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:53,380
bring Chief Imperial Consort back to the palace, would you?

213
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,430
If you told me this was real money, I would believe it.

214
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:32,700
Our skill at making these counterfeit bills is no different from Hawk House.

215
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,730
But how are we going to use these to strangle Hawk House again?

216
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,820
Everyone, hurry up, please.

217
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,270
Yes, sir!

218
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,820
The amount of counterfeit bills you instructed to be made will be completed soon.

219
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,100
And the price of grain?

220
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,740
Since the high officials began selling their grain as well, the price fell to one-third of the original price.

221
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:59,240
Tell our merchant association to begin buying all the grain in the market.

222
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,500
You wanted the price to fall to one-fifth.

223
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,670
We're going to have to rush.

224
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,770
Is it because of Chief Imperial Consort?

225
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,960
If we wait, Hawk House will find us out.

226
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,360
What are you talking about? You sold our stored grains?

227
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,310
We did it after you ordered us—

228
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,920
When did I ever issue such an order?!

229
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,360
Fifteen days ago. All the branch leaders here heard you.

230
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,440
What's wrong?

231
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,200
Leader.

232
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,450
Just go and buy back all the grain.

233
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,000
Now!

234
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,350
Yes, sir.

235
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,790
All the grains are sold out here, too.

236
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:08,260
The grain that was piled high as mountains were all sold in one night?

237
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,490
Yes, by those whose faces were branded.

238
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,610
They bought them all.

239
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,850
Those whose faces that were branded, aren't they the immigrant merchants who were kicked out of the market?

240
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,660
Yes.

241
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,830
Where did they get the money?

242
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,910
I know, right?

243
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:30,480
Seeing how the leader is acting panicked, something dirty is going on.

244
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,410
But why don't we see General Tanqishi around these days?

245
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,480
I know, ri—

246
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,860
This just isn't something the immigrant traders could plan.

247
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,550
Then, who is buying all the grains?

248
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:54,320
The one immigrant merchant who doesn't have a brand on his face.

249
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,500
Wang Yoo is in Yeongyeong; it is unmistakable.

250
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,670
Search every market and find his whereabouts.

251
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,960
Yes, Sir.

252
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,970
General, it's been a long time.

253
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,250
I didn't know you would become the captain of the Imperial Guard.

254
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,460
When Park Bul Hwa and Toqto'a left,

255
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,520
there were many changes to the key posts.

256
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:36,210
Can you put my men in the Imperial Guard?

257
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,140
That isn't difficult, but why?

258
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,260
Open it.

259
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,100
You were once a trusted subordinate of mine.

260
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,780
So I'm giving you this in return for everything you did for me. Go ahead and accept it.

261
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,970
I am grateful.

262
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,840
Someone is pretending to be me.

263
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,620
Who could be doing that?

264
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,440
I will have to find out who dares to pretend to be the Leader of Hawk House.

265
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,610
I will let each branch leader know about this.

266
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,390
If you do that, we will never catch this guy.

267
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:35,280
We will wait and see, and as soon as he shows his tail, that's when we eliminate him.

268
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,570
Golta? Are you outside, Golta?

269
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,820
Yes, Your Majesty!

270
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,170
Did you look for me, Your Majesty?

271
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,870
What is all this, anyway?

272
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,450
I may rule the world, but why do I feel so empty?

273
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,540
Your Majesty.

274
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,010
"Your Majesty," I'm sick of hearing that, too.

275
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,560
What is making me so frustrated?

276
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:14,700
Allow me to bring you some wine. Please drink some and sleep.

277
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,790
No. I better

278
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,940
go out and get some fresh air.

279
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:50,740
♫ Don't you see me? ♫

280
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:57,380
♫ I continue breathing at your side ♫

281
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:06,000
♫ I guess you don't hear me  ♫

282
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,930
♫ My love is for you ♫

283
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,780
I told you to not be more than three steps away from me.

284
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,400
♫ Although you remain at my side within my reach, ♫

285
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:30,950
♫ unable to get closer, I'm wasting away ♫

286
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:40,090
♫ Can't I keep you by my sides with the words, 'I love you?' ♫

287
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,630
♫ Won't you allow me for just one day?

288
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:46,330
I've closed my eyes

289
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,790
and covered my ears.

290
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,690
I don't see anything, and

291
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,980
I don't hear anything.

292
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,080
♫ Sorry. I am sorry ♫

293
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,130
Just...

294
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,010
please just lean on me comfortably.

295
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,870
This naughty girl.

296
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,070
Your Majesty.

297
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,870
I will go to Gameop Temple now.

298
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,760
Do you miss Chief Imperial Consort?

299
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,800
She showed contempt for me. I will punish her severely.

300
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,020
Your Majesty, what brings you all this way?

301
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,380
Is Chief Imperial Consort still receiving lashings?

302
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

303
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:34,650
Please help His Majesty become a good and wise ruler.

304
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,190
Please keep him healthy.

305
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,830
Your Majesty!

306
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:49,610
She requested that we do not interfere during her prayers.

307
00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:00,530
Please keep him healthy.

308
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,380
Hong Dan.

309
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,080
Stay still.

310
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:20,020
Let's return to the palace now.

311
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:30,440
I am offering devotions to Buddha for Your Majesty and Ayu.

312
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:41,010
I am not finished, so Your Majesty, please return to the palace.

313
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,630
Don't disobey me anymore.

314
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:58,190
This may be the last time I can forgive you.

315
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,410
Chief Imperial Consort, we congratulate your return to the palace.

316
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,780
We congratulate you, Your Highness.

317
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,340
Mother.

318
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,230
My crown prince, have you been well?

319
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,890
Please don't ever leave me behind again.

320
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,900
I cried every night.

321
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,330
Yes, I will make sure you never cry again.

322
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:24,170
I thought peace returned to the palace, but who knew that wicked thing would return so quickly?

323
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:29,330
Those under her influence have all been expelled from key posts.

324
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,030
Her power won't be like it was before.

325
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,160
That's the way it should be.

326
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:40,480
The next time she leaves the palace, I will make sure she is a corpse.

327
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,970
How much grain did we buy back?

328
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,280
It's so much that the 99 grain storage rooms of each of the provinces will overflow.

329
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,090
Time has come to release the counterfeit bills.

330
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,740
Who is in charge of Liaoyang Province?

331
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,130
It's me, Sir.

332
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,670
You are in charge of that province.

333
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,150
Yes, Big Boss.

334
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,760
Yunnan Province?

335
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,880
I will take charge.

336
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,440
Lingbei Province?

337
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,110
I will take charge.

338
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:30,500
And Maksaeng, you are in charge of Yeongyeong.

339
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

340
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:37,050
Right after we release the counterfeit bills, we must also spread the rumor that the bills are fake.

341
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,230
We understand!

342
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,030
Your Majesty.

343
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,820
Toqto'a asked to meet with you.

344
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,900
This is the ledger for the finance office.

345
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:07,390
The livelihood of the people have broken down, so taxes have decreased and our nation's treasury is nearly empty.

346
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,560
And this is for the affairs of the state and the military.

347
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,790
If you study this, it will be a big help when you control the military.

348
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:28,960
And this is the information I've been collecting on Hawk House.

349
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,020
Great amounts from the livelihoods of the people have flowed to that organization.

350
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:40,430
If we find them and hold them accountable for taxes, it will be a big help to our nation's treasury.

351
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:47,370
What is the reason? Why are you giving me all this?

352
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:53,720
I fought with Prime Minister to protect myself and Ayu.

353
00:36:53,720 --> 00:37:00,460
But I no longer need power, so it is right for you to have it.

354
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:08,380
I will now put all my effort into supporting you and educating Ayu.

355
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,720
Wasn't it what you wanted?

356
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,990
I'm sorry.

357
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:30,390
I was foolish to not know your sincerity.

358
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,760
Yang, I am sorry.

359
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,760
If you are sorry, may I make a request?

360
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,630
Yes. Ask me for anything.

361
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,150
Please have good health and live a long life.

362
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:54,460
When you are ill, I cannot stand to watch it.

363
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:02,420
So please avoid wine and become stronger for me and for the crown prince.

364
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,510
Yes, I won't cause you pain about this.

365
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:12,200
I have one more request.

366
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,990
Yes, anything you want.

367
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:26,250
Do I have to kill Chief Imperial Consort myself, after all?

368
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,560
Must I... in the end?

369
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,610
Leader, there are counterfeit bills in the market.

370
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,590
Counterfeit bills?

371
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:41,500
Fake bills in great amounts are exploding everywhere.

372
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:46,600
Didn't you tell me that each branch leader sold their grains for bills?

373
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,160
Now the value of the bills has hit rock bottom.

374
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:59,530
That fake leader dared to challenge me to a fight.

375
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,980
Do whatever you can to find out who he is.

376
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,140
Yes, Sir.

377
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,720
Sir.

378
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,400
What brings you all the way here?

379
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,110
I sent Eunuch Park to you three times.

380
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:45,150
You steadfastly refused to see him, so I had to come myself.

381
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,460
His Majesty permitted it.

382
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:55,460
Teacher, you must be the new prime minister.

383
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,750
That position does not belong to me.

384
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:05,440
It was always a position that someone like you should have been in.

385
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,030
Because El Temür and Bayan sat in that position

386
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:15,420
that was this nation's misfortune.

387
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,510
So I will understand that you've accepted, and I will take my leave now.

388
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,790
The streets are overflowing with counterfeit bills.

389
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,380
Counterfeit bills?

390
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,070
There were many problems in the past due to counterfeit bills.

391
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:41,280
How about you enact currency reform at this time?

392
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,230
Change our money, you mean?

393
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:49,320
Get rid of all the bills used in the markets and change it to silver money.

394
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,160
Royalty and aristocrats will protest severely.

395
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,820
But the people will raise both hands in praise.

396
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:01,360
After all, the higher class possesses most of the paper bills.

397
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,790
So you will put the people before the dignitaries and high officials?

398
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:13,340
Your Majesty, the authority of the emperor comes from the heart of the people, not the aristocrats.

399
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:19,070
So you must practice politics for the people's sake.

400
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:45,260
"Problems regarding counterfeit bills have been endless.

401
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,800
So I will invalidate the existing paper bills and enact currency reform

402
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,220
based on silver currency.

403
00:41:55,110 --> 00:42:00,160
Paper bills can only be exchanged for silver after examination by the General Affairs Bureau.

404
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,670
The purpose is to eliminate "dark money" and stabilize the public.

405
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,390
So I request the vassals follow my intention."

406
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,650
Are you all right?

407
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,370
Listen, all vassals.

408
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,370
I would like to reveal one more intention of mine.

409
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,700
Chief Imperial Consort will become this nation's official empress.

410
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,970
Emperor!

411
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,340
I do not need your permission, Empress Dowager.

412
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:03,430
Chief Imperial Consort, will you accept my intentions?

413
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,410
Hurry and tell me.

414
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:14,200
Will you accept the role of this nation's mother?

415
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,810
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

416
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:33,270
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

417
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:37,250
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

418
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:41,050
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

419
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:44,900
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

420
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,890
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

421
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:53,020
So there will be currency reform?

422
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,350
Hawk House has become penniless.

423
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:59,380
They'll be out in the streets now.

424
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,600
I didn't know we were going to stab Hawk House in the back like this.

425
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,630
You were the only one who didn't know. We all knew.

426
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,400
Is that right?

427
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:15,250
Send all the grains we accumulated to the palace.

428
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,400
What?

429
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,320
Your Majesty.

430
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,410
The grains that are as precious as our blood? Send them to the palace?

431
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:51,780
Who sent all these grains?

432
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,890
This is not all.

433
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:59,680
We cannot see the end of the line of wagons outside of the palace.

434
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,460
He asked who sent them.

435
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:07,830
This is a letter from the person who sent them.

436
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,800
Who sent them and why?

437
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,540
He doesn't state who he is.

438
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:25,310
But he instructed us to use these grains to feed the people.

439
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,010
Do you know who sent

440
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:46,250
these grains to the palace?

441
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,530
I will tell you later.

442
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:54,730
Is there a reason you can't tell me now?

443
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:00,190
When the time is right, you will find out everything.

444
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,490
What brings you here?

445
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,100
Look at me carefully.

446
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:29,430
Golta...

447
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,500
Watch your mouth!

448
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,230
There are two kinds of people who've seen my face.

449
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,900
They die, or they become my right-hand men.

450
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,490
Please let us live.

451
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:53,370
We will do anything you ask.

452
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:58,870
There are people trying to uncover Hawk House. They must be killed.

453
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,980
It is a letter from Tanqishi asking to meet the Leader of Hawk House. I intercepted it.

454
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,960
What is written in there?

455
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:23,130
Tanqishi plans to kill Chief Imperial Consort and the emperor.

456
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,490
Call him out right now.

457
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:29,590
This bastard, I will slaughter him.

458
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,120
First, I will meet with him.

459
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,240
General.

460
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,100
What brings you here?

461
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,310
I've been waiting here for days so I can meet you, General.

462
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,690
Has something happened?

463
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:52,790
What I'm about to tell you is the full truth.

464
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,550
So what are you going to tell me?

465
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,430
Maha... Maha...

466
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:04,140
He was Chief Imperial Consort's child.

467
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,050
Chief Imperial Consort?

468
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:13,540
And his father is no one other than Wang Yoo.

469
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:19,600
Please tell His Majesty about this.

470
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,160
Even like this,

471
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:29,630
to help avenge the late Empress Danashiri's grudge.

472
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,400
In any case, Chief Imperial Consort

473
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:37,090
will die by my hand very soon.

474
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,510
Is that true?

475
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,370
Can you show me your face, Leader?

476
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:55,380
How insolent you are, asking to see Leader's face.

477
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,170
My life depends on it.

478
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:03,360
I can't speak freely when I can't be sure if the Leader is fake or real.

479
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,520
But you don't know what he looks like anyway.

480
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,660
I only need to confirm that you are not on Chief Imperial Consort's side.

481
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,010
Please remove your mask, Leader.

482
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:25,320
If you cannot, we will have to fight each other to the death.

483
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,640
So hurry

484
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,520
and show me your face, Leader.

485
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,960
Due to the counterfeit money, I've heard that you've suffered great losses.

486
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,960
There is only one solution.

487
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,700
Won't you help me crown a new emperor?

488
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,210
That is an absurd plan.

489
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,650
When the nation falls into confusion,

490
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,280
the people's hearts

491
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,860
are bound to leave the emperor.

492
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:26,090
And that will justify the enthroning of a new emperor.

493
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:30,280
So who is the emperor to be enthroned?

494
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,230
A second cousin of the emperor,

495
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,950
Bolod Temür.

496
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,910
All right, yeah.

497
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:42,780
He is a libertine who can't resist women

498
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:49,020
and driven by vanity.

499
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,580
He's perfect as a puppet.

500
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:56,050
Leader, please recruit Bolod Temür and Empress Dowager to our cause.

501
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:00,450
Chief Imperial Consort, the emperor,

502
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,510
and Ayu: I will kill them.

503
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,350
How do you plan to do that?

504
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:09,160
The Imperial Guard that are protecting the emperor

505
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,730
are men loyal to me.

506
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,860
Gosh, how long has it been since we ate?

507
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

508
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,730
Thank you.

509
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,730
Your Majesty,

510
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:44,930
do you know what the safest storage in the world is?

511
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:48,200
It's the people.

512
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,300
The riches you give to the people,

513
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,610
will return to you as even bigger happiness.

514
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:59,130
Chief Imperial Consort, your words are correct.

515
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,710
My heart is so full right now.

516
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,610
Hurray to the emperor!

517
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:10,270
Hurray to the emperor!

518
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,920
Hurray to the emperor!

519
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,430
Hurray to the emperor!

520
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,960
Hurray to the emperor!

521
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,660
Hurray to the emperor!

522
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,080
Hurray to the emperor!

523
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,690
Hurray to the emperor!

524
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:28,510
Hurray to the emperor!

525
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:31,340
Hurray to the emperor!

526
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,790
Hurray to the emperor!

527
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,380
Hurray to the emperor!

528
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,030
Hurray to the emperor!

529
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,430
Hurray to the emperor!

530
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,990
Hurray to the emperor!

531
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:47,430
Hurray to the emperor!

532
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:10,760
His Majesty the Emperor is coming through. Won't you make way?

533
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,930
Tanqishi!

534
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,830
Tanqishi.

535
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:26,150
Look there, and behead him right now!

536
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,820
Your Highness!

537
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,140
How dare you? What are you doing right now?

538
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,090
Tanqishi...

539
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,090
so it's you again.

540
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,060
This boring fight

541
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,750
we should end it now.

542
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,210
Kill them!

543
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,010
Seung Nyang.

544
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,770
Seung Nyang...

545
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,910
Seung Nyang!

546
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,420
Seung Nyang...

547
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,200
Retreat.

548
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,210
Wang Yoo.

549
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,120
Maha...

550
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,340
do you know whose son he was?

551
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:59,700
- Let go of me.
- He was Wang Yoo

552
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,710
and Seung Nyang's child.

553
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,580
That cannot be possible.

554
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,680
Court Lady Seo knows the truth.

555
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:12,980
For the rest of your life, you will live

556
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:16,340
with only the shell of Seung Nyang.

557
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:22,230
- How pitiful you are.
- No!

558
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,160
No! No! No!

559
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,530
No! No!

560
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,100
No...

561
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,530
Your Majesty!

562
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,830
Wang Yoo...

563
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:03,350
♫ Because I’m dangerous, my love ♫

564
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:09,030
♫ The more you love me ultimately the more
only you may be hurt ♫

565
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:11,880
♫ Don’t test me ♫

566
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,890
♫ or my love ♫

567
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:18,460
♫ I can’t ever, ever, ever, ever, ever ♫
