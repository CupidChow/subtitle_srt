1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,880
What? The secret fund is at the tin mining town?

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:14,120
It was "darkest beneath the lamp." We didn't see the gold that was right below our noses.

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,680
We only looked in the mines. We never imagined it could be in the mining town.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,780
We must get to it first before Bayan finds it.

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,910
Hurry and find out how we can leave the capital.

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,640
Yes, General.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:45,650
I'm sorry about this, but I cannot let you have that money, Tanqishi.

8
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,970
We deceived Bayan, so the time has come for us to make our move.

9
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:28,980
Have you thought about how we can move the secret fund?

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,510
There are two ways to hunt a tiger.

11
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:37,560
Draw the tiger out from the mountain or go into the tiger's den yourself.

12
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,400
In most cases, it's safer to draw out the tiger, but I don't think we can do that now.

13
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,630
Our thoughts are the same.

14
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,330
Toqto'a will bring his men to go find the secret fund tomorrow.

15
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,470
To go to the tin mines and return will take a total of four days.

16
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,190
So we must make our plan happen on the second night.

17
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,300
I'll take care of the hunting. You shouldn't worry—

18
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,580
Wang Yoo, you cannot do this alone.

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,710
Even if we succeed with our plan, you could be the target of suspicion later.

20
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,550
That may be so, but it is too dangerous for you to participate in this plan.

21
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:29,120
There are people who will never be suspected. Going with them will help avoid trouble for you.

22
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,710
Who are they?

23
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,680
Palace attendants and the emperor himself.

24
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,850
Making them leave the palace

25
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,880
will be more difficult.

26
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,990
Leave this one to me.

27
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,870
Your Highness.

28
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,350
Did your talk go well?

29
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,810
There is something I request of you two.

30
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,640
What is this?

31
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,180
It is soup for the servants.

32
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,580
That may be food for the servants, but it's too plain.

33
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,130
Bring some meat from the storage room.

34
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,810
Yes, Your Highness.

35
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,060
Court Lady Hong, put spoiled milk in the food for the servants.

36
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,310
Eunuch Park, please catch rats and put them in the well.

37
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,770
So you found the location of the secret fund?

38
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:26,210
Toqto'a will bring soldiers to fetch the secret fund.

40
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,890
We don't know Tanqishi's whereabouts and he must also be looking for the secret fund.

41
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,170
We will take that into account, please don't worry, Your Majesty.

42
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,610
There is no time to lose. Please be on your way.

43
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

44
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:52,240
We must use those funds for a war of conquest. There must be no mistakes.

45
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,870
Why won't you respond?

46
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,490
Uncle...

47
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,780
Do you have something to say to me?

48
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,840
I will tell you when I return.

49
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,060
A war of conquest is illogical.

50
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,020
How can you agree with Prime Minister on this matter, Your Majesty?

51
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,180
All the prime ministers of this kingdom have so far existed to threaten the emperors.

52
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:38,820
So it's fortunate that Bayan doesn't use his position only for personal gain.

53
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:45,470
El Temür was once a very loyal subject as well. His loyalty was acknowledged by all.

54
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,660
You never know how people can change, Your Majesty.

55
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,790
That is true.

56
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,690
And that is why I have my eye on him.

57
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,450
- I don't trust him fully, so don't worry.
- Even so,

58
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,880
you must block his ambition for war.

59
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,110
This is not mere ambition, but a great and noble cause.

60
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,520
Your Majesty.

61
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,190
Yang,

62
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,350
I will not allow myself to be remembered as the foolish emperor.

63
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,890
As Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan are my heroes, to my son Ayushiridara,

64
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,440
I want to be a father he is proud of.

65
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,040
I am not happy with Bayan's opposition to your investiture as empress.

66
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,430
But this will be good for me and for Ayu.

67
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,340
So do not oppose me.

68
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,700
Make way!

69
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,080
Please lead me to the fastest way to the tin mines.

70
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,900
Everyone in Yeongyeong Branch was captured. Why are you the only one who is safe?

71
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,290
Wang Yoo found out that Hawk House protected Tanqishi.

72
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:02,310
Since we couldn't avoid being accused of treason, I had to at least save Hawk House.

73
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,080
Give us more detail.

74
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,730
From now on, Hawk House

75
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,450
will exclusively supply the Imperial Palace with goods.

76
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,680
In addition, we earned Bayan's trust.

77
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,990
So they won't interfere with our business anymore.

78
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,720
Please believe me, Leader.

79
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:04,480
You're not so lucky today. You picked the wrong wooden sword.

80
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,060
It looks like this will be our final sparring session.

81
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,990
Why is that?

82
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,640
I will return to Goryeo soon.

83
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,660
Finally, you're retaking your throne?

84
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:22,350
Yes, and it's all thanks to you.

85
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm a bit sad to find out you are leaving.

86
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,040
If you are sad, how about throwing me a party?

87
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,360
Come to my home tomorrow, we will have a grand feast.

88
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,790
Emperor, how long will you allow the empress to sleep alone?

89
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:58,120
The empress should become pregnant so we can invest in the Crown Prince.

90
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,350
Please stop now.

91
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:07,380
Many are mocking both of you. "Empress is being ignored. Emperor is incompetent."

92
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,300
"The Chief Imperial Consort is wicked."

93
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,760
Empress Dowager!

94
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,460
Your Highness, I am satisfied with the way things are now.

95
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,720
You shouldn't do that, Chief Imperial Consort.

96
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,690
How can you monopolize His Majesty like this?

97
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,360
Please stop already.

98
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,280
What's wrong?

99
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,120
She has a severe fever

100
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,340
and she has hives on her body. A mysterious disease.

101
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,280
A mysterious disease?

102
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,520
Is it a mysterious disease?

103
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,630
We found dead animals in the well.

104
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,190
We must prevent a contagious disease in the palace, no matter what.

105
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,030
Yes, Your Highness.

106
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,660
I will do whatever I can.

107
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,660
Until the disease dies down, how about leaving the palace?

108
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,780
My thoughts exactly.

109
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,960
Ask His Majesty to relocate to the summer palace for the time being.

110
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,120
Prince Ayu has a cold, so it won't be easy to leave the capital.

111
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,220
But there isn't a suitable place in the capital.

112
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,260
There is one place where His Majesty can stay.

113
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,580
Where is that?

114
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,240
Have you asked to see me, Your Majesty?

115
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,340
There is a mysterious disease in the palace.

116
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,030
I heard about it. You should stay somewhere else for a while.

117
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:20,060
So I thought I'd impose on you. Will that be all right?

118
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,120
If you stay at my home, could there be any greater honor?

119
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,750
Thanks.

120
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,320
I will move there soon, so please prepare that for me.

121
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,880
Yes, Your Majesty. I will host you with care.

122
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:55,320
We earned Bayan's trust. Please believe me, Leader.

123
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:12,350
The Leader said he will give you one more chance. You must obey.

124
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,960
My life belongs to you, Leader.

125
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,500
I've been looking for you everywhere.

126
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,340
What's the matter?

127
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,810
Chief Imperial Consort would like to see you at her quarters.

128
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,690
In order to move the secret fund, you will have to come to Prime Minister's home as well.

129
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,830
In order to not receive suspicion later, I will need a reason to be there.

130
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,990
His Majesty said he would send Prime Minister a gift.

131
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,350
You can pack up those goods and bring them there.

132
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,660
I understand. I will do that.

133
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,290
But...

134
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,020
may I ask you one question?

135
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,350
Is Wang Yoo simply someone who helps you?

136
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,220
What do you mean by that question?

137
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,360
Perhaps you, towards Wang Yoo—

138
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,930
Yes.

139
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,260
I...

140
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,630
love him.

141
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,830
I am this kingdom's Chief Imperial Consort. Your question

142
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,570
is offensive, don't you think?

143
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,860
Your Highness...

144
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,420
you are still causing him pain.

145
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,310
I can see it.

146
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,670
To him,

147
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,410
he cannot forget you, Your Highness.

148
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,090
His pain...

149
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,080
I can't endure it.

150
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,300
This is why I am speaking to you.

151
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,750
What was your wish, Your Majesty?

152
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,980
♫ When the sun sets and the day ends ♫

153
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,640
I prayed that we could spend our whole lives together.

154
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,630
That we would die on the same day, same time.

155
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,410
And that I could be by your side even after death,

156
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,050
that is what I prayed for.

157
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:43,150
I prayed for the same thing.

158
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,780
Do you resent me?

159
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:55,490
One feels resentment when one has feelings left. I do not.

160
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,490
Seung Nyang is dead to me.

161
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:05,330
You are a memory that I do not want to think of.

162
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,760
It is meaningless to me now.

163
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,650
♫ Even if I wander and am lost, it is you, it is you again ♫

164
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,880
I'm sorry.

165
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,170
Don't feel sorry...

166
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,050
and don't shed any tears.

167
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,260
Please go on your path confidently.

168
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,710
♫ Your memories are fading ♫

169
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,010
♫ I walk on a path ♫

170
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,360
♫ from which I will never return ♫

171
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,350
Go bring the soldiers.

172
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,030
Yes, General.

173
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,960
Those aren't Bayan's soldiers, are they?

174
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,730
- You've come?
- Where is the storage room for the forge?

175
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,880
The storage room for the forge?

176
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,690
That's been closed down.

177
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,090
Closed down?

178
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,520
It was used as a prison for runaway slaves.

179
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:20,190
No one goes near there now, saying that it's haunted by ghosts.

180
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,880
- Lead the way.
- But why do you want to go there?

181
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,430
We don't have time. Do what we tell you.

182
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,810
Yes. Follow me.

183
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,400
This way.

184
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,810
Here. That way.

185
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,320
Okay, stay out now.

186
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,800
Over there.

187
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,320
They're skeletons.

188
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,920
They say if you get possessed by a ghost who died here, you lose your mind.

189
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,620
Won't you shut your mouth? Such bad luck.

190
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,150
It's that room!

191
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,780
This is all gold and money!

192
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,480
Bring wagons. We have to move these.

193
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,760
Yes, Sir.

194
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,210
Hurry! Hurry!

195
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,500
Hurry and move. Hurry.

196
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,700
Hurry. Move!

197
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,190
You stay here. When Bayan's soldiers come, tell them where Tanqishi went.

198
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,370
Yes, Sir.

199
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,300
Hurry!

200
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,050
Why are you all so lazy?

201
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,430
Hurry! We don't have time!

202
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:56,210
They said there's a river beyond the mountain.

203
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,710
If we cross the river on a boat,

204
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,860
we could evade Bayan's soldiers.

205
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,100
Who knows the mountain paths well?

206
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,670
I know them best.

207
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,830
When do we kill Tanqishi?

208
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:26,450
First, let's evade Bayan's soldiers

209
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,010
then let's get rid of him.
- Yes, Sir.

210
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,750
All the men are on our side, so it will be a piece of cake.

211
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,090
Are you ready to leave now, Your Majesty?

212
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,910
Are you coming with me, too, Empress?

213
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,150
I told her to go with you.

214
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,820
If you are not comfortable, I will go elsewhere.

215
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,910
How can you say that, Empress?

216
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:20,410
Prime Minister's home is like your own parents' home. Of course, you should accompany His Majesty.

217
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,140
Chief Imperial Consort, how about you go to Daewoong Temple?

218
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,950
It's not far from here, so it shouldn't be bad for Ayu.

219
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:34,700
For Her Majesty the Empress, he is her uncle. But Prime Minister is my adopted father,

220
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,370
so his house is also like my parents' house.

221
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,530
Empress Dowager, Chief Imperial Consort is correct.

222
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,160
If we all go together, I think it will be more cozy and fun.

223
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,500
Empress.

224
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,010
Please permit it, Your Highness.

225
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,950
Chief Imperial Consort, please learn from the benevolent example of the empress.

226
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,880
I will do so.

227
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,760
That's enough, let's be on our way.

228
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,130
Everyone bow your heads!

229
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,220
Who are they?

230
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,940
They are members of Hawk House.

231
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,860
They were imprisoned at the prime minister's home, and they are now being transferred to the palace dungeons.

232
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,870
What's wrong, all of a sudden?

233
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,990
Nothing.

234
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,720
Welcome, Wang Yoo.

235
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,000
This seems a bit too grand for my farewell party.

236
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,870
His Majesty will be staying at my home for a short while.

237
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:47,150
Is that so? Is anything going on at the palace?

238
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,670
A mysterious disease is going around, so it looks like I have to welcome His Majesty

239
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,870
and combine it with your farewell party.

240
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,080
I wish to see Toqto'a before I leave for Goryeo.

241
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,910
He should have arrived at the mining town by now.

242
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,420
Are you saying that Tanqishi was here?

243
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,420
Yes.

244
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,320
He left about an hour ago.

245
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,950
In any case, from the storage room at the forge,

246
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,660
he took all the gold and banknotes.

247
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,260
Where did he go?

248
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,170
He said he will climb Samgong Mountain and cross the river.

249
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,440
I know the paths of Samgong Mountain well.

250
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,450
They have wagons, so they probably didn't go far yet.

251
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,300
We will pursue them quickly.

252
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,990
- Pursue them!
- Yes, Sir!

253
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,830
Tell them to hurry.

254
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,420
Yes, Sir.

255
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,980
Walk faster. Hurry!

256
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,610
Yes, Sir!

257
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,700
No!

258
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,070
What is going on?

259
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,220
What?

260
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,260
They're close by.

261
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:44,000
- Oh!
- My money is burning up.

262
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,940
Put the fire out! Put the fire out!

263
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,010
My precious money!

264
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:52,560
Bayan's soldiers are probably nearby already.

265
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,960
The banknotes are burning!

266
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,920
We don't know when they'll get here.

267
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,190
Put the fire out, I said!

268
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,310
My money!!!

269
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,900
Put the fire out!

270
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,500
We have to leave now!

271
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,670
Get them!

272
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,300
It's Toqto'a.

273
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,110
Darn it.

274
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,670
Hurry!

275
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,990
My money!

276
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,330
Capture them. You cannot let them live.

277
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,850
Yes, Sir.

278
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,200
Move the counterfeit money to the mining town.

279
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,180
A few days from now, those who want the money will come to the mining town.

280
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:01,700
You must find a chance and burn the counterfeit money; make it disappear.

281
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,390
Counterfeit money. These are fake banknotes.

282
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,210
What happened to Tanqishi?

283
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,730
I'm sorry. They crossed the river, so...

284
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,090
♪ Eight, Eight King disappeared, they say ♪

285
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,460
♪ He took one step to the swallow's house to catch the swallow ♪

286
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,530

287

288
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,570
Eight, Eight King...

289
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,580
Eight, Eight King...

290
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,970
♪ This life is scarier than the afterworld ♪

291
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,760
Write down the words that those children are singing and bring it to me.

292
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,130
Yes, Sir.

293
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,850
♪ He took one step to the swallow's house to catch the swallow but he just pooped and returned home ♪

294
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:01,620
It's an uncommon song. It must hold the clue to the secret fund.

295
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,730
Eight, Eight King...

296
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,550
Eight, Eight King?

297
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:22,090
The character for "eight" and the character for "king"'

298
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,830
Then add another eight."

299
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,310
Gold.

300
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,670
The character for "gold."

301
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,600
Then the swallow?

302
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,710
"Yeon" for swallow. This character is used for Yeongyeong.

303
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:51,400
The same character is used for "Yeon Cheol." (El Temür)

304
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,290
So where would the swallow's nest be?

305
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,910
- Yeon Cheol's...
- Yeon Cheol's house.

306
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,990
...house.

307
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:14,430
So the house where Prime Minister is living in now, that is where the secret fund is.

308
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,950
We must go to Yeongyeong now. It's urgent, so you and I will have to go ahead of the others.

309
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,410
I understand, Sir.

310
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,590
So where in here did he hide the secret fund?

311
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,540
Even Tanqishi doesn't know?

312
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,750
The song the children sang had these lyrics.

313
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,600
"When will we harvest the field and eat our fill?"

314
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,360
But this house does not have a field.

315
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,230
So that spot marked with the character for 'field' is—

316
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,390
Yes, that is where the secret fund is hidden.

317
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,680
Did you put that document back in Toqto'a's office?

318
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,280
Yes, Your Highness.

319
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,720
Your Highness, they are asking you to attend the party now.

320
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,120
Oh no, what to do?

321
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,760
What's wrong?

322
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,610
Please don't cry, Your Highness.

323
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,570
Your Highness the Imperial Prince.

324
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,380
What's wrong with His Highness the Imperial Prince?

325
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,420
I don't know.

326
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,550
Please give him to me.

327
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,840
Your Majesty, let's just go.

328
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,890
You shouldn't touch the imperial prince.

329
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,060
Will you come to me?

330
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,180
Your Highness the Imperial Prince.

331
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,060
A man shouldn't show his tears carelessly.

332
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,420
When a man shows his tears,

333
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:47,350
it's not when he is hurt, but when others are hurt.

334
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,140
Even if you are a little sad or hurt, you should endure it.

335
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,580
That is being a real man.

336
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,120
It seems you understood what I said?

337
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:26,330
The imperial prince seems to like you a lot.

338
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,860
Toqto'a seems to have figured out that the secret fund is here.

339
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,730
Is that true?

340
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,770
Yeon Bisoo just sent a message.

341
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,710
Things have become more urgent.

342
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,980
We must hurry.

343
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,080
Yeon Bisoo will come earlier than we'd previously planned.

344
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,190
Do you know how to play Mahjong?

345
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,290
Yes, I played it many times in Goryeo.

346
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,930
Suggest that we play Mahjong.

347
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:15,220
I will lose before anyone and take my leave.

348
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:21,090
While we carry out the plan, no one can leave the party.

349
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,830
I understand what you are saying.

350
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,410
I will make sure to win or lose just enough to stall for time.

351
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,560
What are you doing here?

352
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:51,130
What did you two speak of?

353
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,610
Wang Yoo asked to play Mahjong.

354
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Mahjong?

355
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,530
- Do you know how to play?
- We play Mahjong in the palace often.

356
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,190
Then do you want to have a match with me?

357
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,560
You couldn't win against me with ordinary skills.

358
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,200
I've also never lost to anyone.

359
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,200
Let's go in. Let me show off my skills.

360
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:30,420
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

361
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:37,050
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

362
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,590
You've won again, Your Majesty.

363
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,490
What's wrong, Chief Imperial Consort? You seem out of sorts today.

364
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:19,970
Chief Imperial Consort hasn't played this before.

365
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:25,260
I really am no match for you, Your Majesty.

366
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,080
You are a guest in my home. I will lend you more money.

367
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,370
No thank you. Why don't you play, Empress Dowager?

368
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,950
Well then, allow me a turn.

369
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:41,310
Since we're playing to win, those who lost all their money should leave the game.

370
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,030
Of course.

371
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,540
Your Majesty, I won't go easy on you anymore.

372
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,900
Everyone, come at me.

373
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,290
I was caught off guard.

374
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,730
The safest place with the easiest access.

375
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:10,230
The first place you suspect, but once you overlook it you never suspect it again.

376
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,230
Thank you very much.

377
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,230
But on a day like today, you should have a drink.

378
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:47,100
We added medicine to the drinks, so after just one hour, they will be very tired.

379
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,880
Good job.

380
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,130
Yeon Bisoo has arrived.

381
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,420
Why are you here so early?

382
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,280
These are for important people, we shouldn't be late.

383
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,890
Where can I put these goods?

384
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,120
Follow me.

385
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:36,280
Your Highness, the imperial prince is not sleeping yet.

386
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,070
I will go help the imperial prince sleep.

387
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,270
Go ahead, then.

388
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:09,580
We don't have much time, so we must hurry.

389
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,580
Hurry and look for the floor plans for El Temür's house.

390
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,140
I do not see the "jeon" character for field.

391
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:09,000
It's in the library. We are going to Uncle's house right now.

392
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:29,490
But where in here is the secret fund?

393
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,720
Where is east?

394
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,760
That way.

395
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,920
The spot marked with "jeon" for field. Isn't it right where these bookcases are?

396
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,400
Push the bookcase.

397
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,990
There is a door here.

398
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,430
One person, please go and keep a lookout.

399
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,040
I understand.

400
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,160
This is all gold.

401
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,070
El Temür sure stole a lot of money.

402
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,670
Your Highness.

403
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,380
Yeon Bisoo has arrived.

404
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,220
- Wow.
- Put these in the wagons right now. Hurry.

405
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,970
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Let's go.

406
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:17,220
Your Majesty, I did not know you were so good at Mahjong.

407
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,160
Look at that. I am the winner.

408
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:28,150
- Your Majesty, how about some wine?
- Sounds good, let's have some.

409
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,240
I will turn in and rest now.

410
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,980
Let's all gather here again in a short while.

411
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,440
Oh yes, that's right.

412
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,950
I guess I will be having a farewell drink with you, Wang Yoo.

413
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:51,640
When you return to Goryeo, I sure hope we have no reason to meet again.

414
00:45:52,970 --> 00:46:00,430
Don't misunderstand. I just mean, don't get yourself dethroned again.

415
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,190
I shall heed your words.

416
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:23,150
Get up! Won't you come to your senses?

417
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,430
- Welcome, Sir.
- Why are these horses here?

418
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,900
His Majesty has come to stay here for a while.

419
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:40,230
- Stay here?
- I heard that there is a mysterious disease in the palace.

420
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,250
Let's go to the library immediately.

421
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,490
Push that.

422
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:43,630
There is nothing here.

423
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:52,090
There is one more person who saw those floor plans.

424
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:58,870
It is precious money squeezed out of the people with abuse of power.

425
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:04,260
It is proper for it to be put in the state coffers and spent for the benefit of our kingdom.

426
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,020
Your words are correct, Prime Minister.

427
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:12,190
If you begin a war of conquest,

428
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,480
what will happen to Goryeo?

429
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,270
Goryeo is our "son-in-law state" and our brother nation.

430
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:24,070
How can we trample it with military horses?

431
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:33,020
Wang Yoo, I think it's correct for Goryeo to abandon its national sovereignty and join Yuan.

432
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:38,900
If the people of Goryeo become the citizens of a great kingdom, isn't that a happy occasion for both nations?

433
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,700
Such wise words, Prime Minister.

434
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:48,220
When you return to your throne, think well about it. What is the best thing for the people of Goryeo?

435
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:53,560
I don't think this is something we should talk about here.

436
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:01,010
Prime Minister, Toqto'a is here.

437
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:16,700
- I've returned, Your Majesty.
- So what happened? Did you find the secret fund?

438
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,820
Hasn't His Majesty just asked you a question?

439
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:24,220
The enormous amount of banknotes that El Temür stole

440
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:29,680
have all burned up.

441
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:37,390
- What are you saying?
- Tanqishi arrived a step ahead of us.

442
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:41,570
While we were chasing him, the money all turned into a pile of ash.

443
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:45,360
How did you chase him that such a thing happened?

444
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,950
I'm sorry, Prime Minister.

445
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,350
What happened to Tanqishi?

446
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:53,020
We lost him.

447
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,940
The absolute worst result.

448
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,800
We stopped Tanqishi from getting his hands on the money.

449
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,370
So it's not the absolute worst result.

450
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:03,600
Then, what happens to the war for conquest?

451
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,310
If we can't do the best plan, then we must do the second-best plan.

452
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,440
Go and rest now.

453
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:51,050
I will split the secret fund with you, half and half.

454
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:56,180
I will give Yeon Bisoo her share from mine.

455
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,160
I understand.

456
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,510
Wang Yoo.

457
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:19,090
You've worked hard.

458
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:48,870
I have something to say to you, Chief Imperial Consort.

459
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,430
Go ahead, Teacher.

460
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:55,840
Let us speak elsewhere, just for a moment.

461
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,200
- You stay here.
- Your Highness.

462
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,960
Please come in.

463
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:44,200
This is where El Temür hid his secret fund,

464
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,800
but the fund that should have been here

465
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:54,240
have all disappeared.

466
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:00,060
And this happens to be when there's a mysterious disease in the palace, and His Majesty had to stay here.

467
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:05,260
- I don't know what you mean.
- Where did you put it?

468
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,180
The secret fund?

469
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:18,700
Are you saying that I took the secret fund that was stored here?

470
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:23,540
I am waiting for your response, Chief Imperial Consort.

471
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:28,810
Since you are asking, Teacher, I must give you a response.

472
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:34,180
This is the first I'm hearing of it.

473
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:39,070
Even if I did take that money, when I know it will be used

474
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:44,400
to take innocent lives, I wouldn't turn it over, would I?

475
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:52,400
Since that evil money disappeared, that's a good thing.

476
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:01,530
This is my response to you, Teacher.

477
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,480
Your Highness the Chief Imperial Consort,

478
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:12,200
you've won.

479
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:25,950
It's a very rare event, but there are times when you know the truth but you can't do anything about it.

480
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:29,520
This is one of those times for me.

481
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:34,670
Your Highness, you've won against your teacher.

482
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,670
I have never

483
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,990
thought of myself as competing against you, Teacher.

484
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:48,900
Your Highness, I will tell you just one thing.

485
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:58,730
I do not lose twice to anyone.

486
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:05,580
And I will keep both eyes wide open to keep watch over how that money will be used.

487
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:13,450
If there is any harm to my family, then even you, Your Highness, should be prepared for what I will do.

488
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:30,440
Your family...

489
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:37,610
is not more important than your nation or the people.

490
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:48,110
Such an admirable person as you, Teacher, clinging to your family,

491
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:54,190
I do not want to see that anymore.

492
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:16,530
Your Highness, the gold is coming in.

493
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,480
- You've worked hard coming here.
- Please hurry and bring them in.

494
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,680
Your Highness, His Majesty is here.

495
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,770
Yang.

496
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,900
You've come out, Your Majesty?

497
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:54,940
- What is all this?
- They are things to be put in Heungdeok Palace.

498
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:02,360
Well, let's take a look. I'm curious to see what you've chosen.

499
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,500
There isn't much to see.

500
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,290
No need to be shy.

501
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,750
Your Majesty.

502
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:19,900
Is this something I shouldn't see?

503
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:24,870
It's not like that.

504
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,490
Out of my way.

505
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:53,080
What's wrong, Emperor?

506
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,330
Hurry and bring these things inside.

507
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:01,920
Everyone, move them in now.

508
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:32,980
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

509
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,030
♫ That day when we were happy ♫

510
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:40,430
♫ If we could return to that day ♫

511
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:47,900
♫ You can return to me at any time ♫
