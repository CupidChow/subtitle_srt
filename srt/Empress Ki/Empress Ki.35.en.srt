1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,350
I heard you had a nightmare.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,220
This time, I got a wound on my neck.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,560
If you would allow me, I'd like to take a look.

4
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,430
Starting today, look around your quarters.

5
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,250
If it's according to the records, you'll find a nameplate buried in the ground.

6
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,740
A nameplate?

7
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,180
It's a Grim Reaper nameplate.

8
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,840
Then... on that name plate...

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,630
Your name would be on it.

10
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,030
It's an uncommon method, so there won't be many tricks that can be played.

11
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,530
I've already told my subordinates to look for it.

12
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,760
I don't think it's here.

13
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,480
Yang. What's the matter, Yang?

14
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,410
Yang. Yang!

15
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,700
Yang.

16
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,470
Yang. Yang, wake up! Yang!

17
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,580
Anyone there?!

18
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,290
A curse?

19
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,430
It's the empress. She's the only one who could do something so atrocious.

20
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,060
Your Majesty.

21
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,890
Please be calm.

22
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,820
I can't let this one pass.

23
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,020
Until we have solid proof, you must wait.

24
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,780
How am I supposed to watch you suffer until then?

25
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,940
I've overcome worse suffering.

26
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,130
This is nothing.

27
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,030
I will never forgive her. Never.

28
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,240
My Lady, the empress is asking for you.

29
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,370
Tell her she can't come.

30
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,770
No, tell her that I'm not letting her go.

31
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,770
No, Your Majesty.

32
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,340
I will go just for a short while.

33
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,620
- Yang.
- Whether she is truly the one responsible,

34
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,450
I will confirm it as well.

35
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,110
You called for me, Your Majesty?

36
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,570
You're here.

37
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,300
Yes. Is the prenatal education going well?

38
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,570
But you don't look well.

40
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,550
Do you have something on your mind?

41
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:58,840
To be honest, I've not been sleeping well lately due to nightmares.

42
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,330
Is that right?

43
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,510
That's terrible.

44
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,930
Sleep is very important when you're with child.

45
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,620
Go to the physician and get some tonic made.

46
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,170
I would like to do it for you, but since you won't trust me,

47
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,680
I'm telling you to go do it yourself.

48
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,220
Did you make arrangements with the physicians already?

49
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,100
What did you say?

50
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,510
There's no reason you would show me your goodwill.

51
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,220
You've become sick with suspicion I see.

52
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,830
You're already not feeling well, and now you can't even take the tonic...

53
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,220
You may leave now.

54
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,650
My curse seems to be very effective.

55
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,770
She looks incredibly tired!

56
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,180
I don't think it's here either.

57
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,290
My Lady.

58
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,240
Maybe the nameplate doesn't exist.

59
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,610
We've searched for days, but we haven't found it.

60
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,350
Judging by the empress' behavior, I'm sure it'll be found.

61
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,770
I found it!

62
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,580
My Lady.

63
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,270
[Ki Yang]

64
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,730
I really didn't think it could be true, but for the empress to do something this scary...

65
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,910
Every night,

66
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,960
keep an eye on her quarters.

67
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,200
Yes, My Lady.

68
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,910
[Ki Yang]

69
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,910
How is the search for the fortune teller going?

70
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,060
There are a number of them who do sorcery within the capital,

71
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,150
so I'm thinking about whether I need to arrest them all and get a confession.

72
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,690
The empress might find out,

73
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,120
so I'll go meet with those fortune tellers secretly.

74
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,660
Why do I feel so anxious?

75
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,070
What brings you here?

76
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,530
[Ki Yang]

77
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,460
So it was you who cursed me.

78
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,760
Search this place!

79
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,140
We found them.

80
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,580
There's no way to break the curse other than fighting off the fear.

81
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,940
I will break the curse how I see fit.

82
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,120
Who is the person who asked you to put the curse on me?

83
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,330
Even if you put a knife to my neck,

84
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,310
I cannot tell you.

85
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,120
She's an imperial consort who is with child.

86
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,260
If you don't want to lose your head, confess.

87
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,240
I can't incur god's anger.

88
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,590
You're fearful of god's anger,

89
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,180
but not fearful of my anger?

90
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,280
- I'm going to the shrine.
- Your Majesty,

91
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,270
not today. You'll get sick if you keep doing this.

92
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:01,510
When I think about that wench Ki withering up and dying, I get re-energized after feeling tired.

93
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,030
Tell Lady Ki.

94
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,010
Yes, Sir.

95
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,850
We've found the secret shrine!

96
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,170
Your Majesty.

97
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,780
What brings you here in the middle of the night?

98
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,340
This is embarrassing.

99
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,620
The empress of this country, to an imperial consort...

100
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,050
cursing her when she's with child...

101
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,020
Curse? I was only praying

102
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,930
for the sake of our Maha.

103
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,040
It's so contemptible that I can't bear this any longer.

104
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,790
It's true, Your Majesty. Her Majesty was only—

105
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,690
Silence!

106
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,720
Take away all these servants and question them!

107
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,360
Yes, Your Majesty. Take them away.

108
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,960
Your Majesty!

109
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,860
As soon as they confess, you too will be thrown out of the palace.

110
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,510
You will never be able to kill me with this kind of sorcery.

111
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,960
Stop.

112
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,960
Tell me the truth.

113
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,970
Were you trying to curse Lady Ki?

114
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,840
I can't say...

115
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,000
anything.

116
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,000
- Carry on!
- Yes, Sir!

117
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,240
Sir!

118
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,370
Stop!

119
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,470
Sir, I will confess!

120
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,550
- Tell me.
- I will confess.

121
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,520
You wench! Shut that mouth, you wench!

122
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,120
How dare you try to lie?

123
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,650
Whoever lies here,

124
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,260
will all die by Her Majesty's hands!

125
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,210
I guess all of you wish for death.

126
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,080
Torture them even more!

127
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,240
Yes, Sir!

128
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,700
They will not confess. There's no way Court Lady Seo and Yeon will

129
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,920
ever betray me...

130
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,800
Brother!

131
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,280
Why did you call for me so late?

132
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,190
Please go to the underground prison. My servants are dying.

133
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,630
What's going on?

134
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,230
I will tell you everything in detail later, so please stop their torture.

135
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,120
A sorcerer's curse?

136
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,930
There's no end to the evil deeds of El Temur's family.

137
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,120
Are you all right now?

138
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,300
Yes, Sir.

139
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,640
If we go for a decisive battle against El Temur by joining forces with the magistrates,

140
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,720
what is our chance of winning?

141
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,980
It won't be easy.

142
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,150
El Temur has that much military power?

143
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,400
All the magistrates are far from Daedo.

144
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,460
El Temur's army are stationed at every strategic point,

145
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,390
so joining forces will be a difficult task.

146
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,900
How wealthy is El Temur that

147
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,130
he can sustain such a vast army?

148
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,420
It's probably beyond our imagination.

149
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,110
Then is there no way to take out El Temur?

150
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,970
We could bring the army here to Daedo ourselves.

151
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,700
The Capital Defense Force is not an easy opponent.

152
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,510
They could be wiped out even before they make it into the palace.

153
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,600
The reason Wang Yoo willingly became the Commander of the Capital Defense Force

154
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,120
is exactly that.

155
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,150
If he can open the latch for us, we can win.

156
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,500
What's the reason he is helping us while risking himself?

157
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,250
He wants to be restored as king.

158
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,260
- Is that all?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

159
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,600
So what do you think?

160
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,290
Tell him that I will restore him to the throne if we win.

161
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,660
I will tell him.

162
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,650
Please thank His Majesty for me.

163
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,570
I will.

164
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,940
Capital Defense Force is only loyal to El Temur.

165
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,470
How do you plan to gain control?

166
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,180
There are hundreds of soldiers who quit over their discontent with me.

167
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:44,430
I'm planning on picking new soldiers and forming a detached force.

168
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,520
Detached force?

169
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,840
We've already put out a recruitment notice.

170
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,350
Your Majesty!

171
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,770
Your Majesty, there's trouble. There are tons of candidates headed here.

172
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,530
Why is that trouble?

173
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,860
That's... You'll see when you get there.

174
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,240
Listen up!

175
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,990
From today on, you will never starve to death!

176
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:28,220
This is the Commander of the Capital Defense Force you will be serving!

177
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,100
Silence!

178
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,120
Try training them, why don't you?

179
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,110
Goodbye.

180
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,320
Do well.

181
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,520
Maybe you were mistaken,

182
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,770
but we're looking for soldiers.

183
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,820
We saw the notice that we'd be paid three nyangs of gold monthly.

184
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,340
We heard you'd accept anyone as long as all our limbs were intact.

185
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,010
Is it true that you'll feed us and give us a place to sleep?

186
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,160
I will get rid of them all.

187
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,280
Don't.

188
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,920
They're far from being soldiers.

189
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,030
Even if we put up a new notice for recruits, it'll be the same.

190
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:25,460
When are you going to feed us? We're hungry!

191
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,390
Shut up! Do you think this place is for beggars?

192
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,630
Feed them first.

193
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,360
Your Majesty.

194
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,460
Everyone line up and get your food.

195
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,100
Face right!

196
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,500
Don't you know right? Right side?!

197
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,400
The right hand is what you eat with. Got it?

198
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,960
I eat with this hand.

199
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,650
From now on, eat with this side. Got it?

200
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,930
Move it!

201
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,360
Wow, this is driving me crazy.

202
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:12,090
Detached force? We are in trouble.

203
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,490
I think it will cause a major setback in our strategy, too.

204
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,460
Stop what you're doing.

205
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,380
Are you deaf? Stop what you're doing!

206
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,600
- These bastards.
- Leave them be.

207
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,270
What were you doing before coming here?

208
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,680
I used to slash and burn fields, but was running away after being asked to pay taxes.

209
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,120
I lost my entire family after the last plague, and I'm only living because I didn't die.

210
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,790
I was a slave working for a master. I didn't want to be beaten up after getting unfairly blamed, so I ran away.

211
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:14,090
I was chasing after my sister who was taken as a tribute girl, but ended up having nowhere to go.

212
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,100
Make sure they get meat at every meal by killing the pigs and cows.

213
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,220
Your Majesty, why would you to these throwaways...

214
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,900
They are going to become valuable soldiers who will receive a stipend from the country soon as their names get listed on the military register.

215
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,640
We need to treat them as such.

216
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,880
You'll be blessed, Commander!

217
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,870
- I can't believe this is real.
- It's like Heaven!

218
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,210
This is Heaven!

219
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,580
You can tell just with one look. They can't be made into a detached force.

220
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,290
- They're useless losers.
- Please get rid of them right away!

221
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:06,790
They just never got a chance. There isn't anyone in this world who is useless.

222
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,330
If I give them an opportunity to make something of themselves,

223
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:15,750
they will also give me an opportunity to get restored to the throne.

224
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,200
- Why don't you get some more rest?
- We're fine, Your Majesty.

225
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,730
Thanks to you not confessing, I was saved from suffering greatly.

226
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:42,630
We also managed to live thanks to your imperial favor.

227
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:49,300
Withstanding even the sorcerer's curse, I've never seen such a venomous wench in all my life.

228
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,210
Just watch and see. As soon as my son becomes the crown prince, I will—

229
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,800
Your Majesty!

230
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,130
Your Majesty, something is wrong with the imperial prince.

231
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,870
What do you mean something is wrong?

232
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:10,080
- How long has he been like this?
- Since... this morning.

233
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,830
Bring the physician. Hurry!

234
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,290
What's the matter with the imperial prince?

235
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:27,190
It's measles.

236
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,100
Your Majesty, what do we do?

237
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,180
How do you get rid of measles?

238
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,980
Forgive me, but for measles,

239
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,260
there is no cure.

240
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,750
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

241
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,160
Go and bring the emperor.

242
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

243
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,540
Is there really no treatment for it?

244
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:03,780
Other than praying to the gods...

245
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:10,290
Maha... Maha...

246
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:15,980
Baby, what is this suffering?

247
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,890
What is this that you're being so diligent?

248
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,350
- It's the ledger for the Department of Farming.
- Department of Farming?

249
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:48,600
Yes, Your Majesty. The state of affairs has improved,

250
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,080
so from now on, I think we can give Officer Bayan military funding.

251
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,020
A little... I'm a little bit fearful.

252
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,810
Until I met you,

253
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:11,230
I've never once thought about fighting against El Temur as my opponent.

254
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:16,830
Once our baby is born, the decisive match will begin.

255
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,470
While General Toqto'a is planning a strategy and Officer Bayan is building up the military forces,

256
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,950
you must show indomitable imperial authority as the emperor even more.

257
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:33,090
And I will help with everything quietly in the background.

258
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,650
All right. I understand, Yang.

259
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,320
Your Majesty.

260
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,950
The empress is urgently asking for you.

261
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,990
- What's going on?
- The imperial prince has fallen ill.

262
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,540
I'll go in the morning.

263
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,640
Please go and see him, Your Majesty.

264
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,520
I can't help but think about what horrible thing she did to you.

265
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,620
I don't think I can hide my feelings if I see her now.

266
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,480
- Tell her I can't go tonight.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

267
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,200
The imperial prince is sick. Will you be all right?

268
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,750
To be honest, I have never felt any affection toward Maha.

269
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,280
Other than that he's the empress' son and the only grandson of El Temur,

270
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,760
I don't even feel in the least that he's my child.

271
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,800
His child is about to die, and he won't even show up?

272
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,160
Your Majesty.

273
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,250
- Please be calm.
- How can I be calm?

274
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:00,170
He refuses to be a husband and he can't even act like a father.

275
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,470
Your Majesty.

276
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,140
- Tell His Majesty I'm here.
- He won't see anyone tonight.

277
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,650
If you can't tell him, I'll go see him myself.

278
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,870
It's against the law.

279
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,530
- Did you say the law?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

280
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:28,860
The empress cannot enter the imperial consort's room where the emperor—

281
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,000
How dare you speak of the law in front of me?!

282
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,350
Forgive me, Your Majesty. But you cannot enter.

283
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,520
Your Majesty, how can you be like this?

284
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:51,020
Your son is dying, and you're busy with that imperial consort wench?!

285
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,870
Aren't you ashamed as a father?

286
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,520
- How could she be so thick-faced?
- The imperial prince is dying!

287
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,640
- I will not stand by and let this happen tonight.
- Can you not hear me?

288
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,840
Please stay here. I will go.

289
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,520
- It's not your issue.
- This is something I have to do.

290
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,410
Please leave us alone.

291
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:38,500
The imperial prince is on the brink of death. Are you now trying to rip the father and son apart?!

292
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,370
It's not His Majesty who made the imperial prince that way, it was you.

293
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:50,060
- What nonsense are you talking about?
- Do you know who tried to

294
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,000
- put a curse on me through sorcery?
- Don't try to slander me.

295
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,260
The fortune-teller told me that if I can overcome the curse that you put on me,

296
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,050
that curse will end up falling on your siblings or parents

297
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,580
or your child.

298
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,940
There's something you need to know.

299
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,560
It's a relief the curse works and that person dies,

300
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:18,440
but if not, that curse falls on the person who made the request.

301
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,340
This is what you call the natural consequence of one's deeds.

302
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:39,540
- Your Majesty.
- My son... I have to save my Maha...

303
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,850
Your Majesty, please come to your senses.

304
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,880
What do I do? My son has been cursed!

305
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,040
The curse only works on family members who share the same blood.

306
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,420
I can't let him die like this.

307
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,780
Even if Heaven splits in two, I will make sure my Maha—

308
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,530
You know the imperial prince is not your biological son!

309
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,300
He doesn't share even a drop of your blood.

310
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:13,250
So, there's no way he could be cursed!

311
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:19,900
Maha is... my biologial son.

312
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,110
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

313
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:28,090
Don't you dare slander me. You must want to die.

314
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:33,870
Your Majesty. I committed a sin, Your Majesty.

315
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,220
Tell me again.

316
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,480
What did you say about my son?

317
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,030
- Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
- Forgive us, Your Majesty.

318
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,110
I will save him.

319
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,460
My poor son...

320
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,850
I will be sure to save him.

321
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,140
Her Majesty...

322
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,500
must believe he's her biological son.

323
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:14,250
The scary obsession has caused her to become ill.

324
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,930
Your Majesty.

325
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,960
- Pour the water on me.
- Your Majesty, the water is cold as ice.

326
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,430
This could cause severe sickness, Your Majesty.

327
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:36,430
- This is the only way I can lift the curse on my son.
- Your Majesty.

328
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:43,970
Even if I have to offer up my life to Buddha to save my son, I will do it.

329
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,520
Hurry up and pour the water over me.

330
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:05,090
Merciful Buddha, please spare my son.

331
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:10,020
If you ask me to give up my life, I will.

332
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:16,610
So please don't take my son from me.

333
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,950
Your Majesty.

334
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:47,160
Where are you, Your Majesty?

335
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:52,230
Your Majesty.

336
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,680
You have killed so many people. And yet,

337
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,240
you get scared of one dead body?

338
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,780
- What's going on?
- Don't you see?

339
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:28,840
You're... dead.

340
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,000
I ordered for you to be killed.

341
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,190
Toghon Temür... how dare you?

342
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:44,730
Now that you've become a spirit, take a good look at that despicable body.

343
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,400
I'm going to carry out a posthumous execution in the middle of the marketplace.

344
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:57,750
After I cut off all your limbs and your head, I will feed your flesh to the eagles.

345
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:03,320
I will not die like this.

346
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,800
Do you think I will die by the likes of you?

347
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,950
I will kill you all. Your sons Tanqishi and Talahai, as well as Tanashiri and Maha,

348
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,740
I will kill all of you, Prime Minister!

349
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,320
- You bastard!
- Father!

350
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,500
- What's the matter?
- It's us!

351
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,750
I will kill you. Like how I killed your father, I will kill you, too!

352
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:40,700
Father!

353
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,160
What's going on?

354
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:56,610
I had a dream. It was too real.

355
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,870
I think your mind and body are exhausted.

356
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,260
But... what are you two doing here?

357
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,540
What do you mean? We heard you scream.

358
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,110
While carrying a sword into my bedroom?

359
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,180
Father...

360
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,600
Are you also trying to kill me? Because you're jealous of my power?

361
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,270
Father! Please come to your senses!

362
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:33,240
These damn bastards!

363
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:40,050
Father. Father! Father!

364
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,250
- Please come to your senses! Father!
- Wake up, Father!

365
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,660
Father! Father!

366
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,860
Your Majesty!

367
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:08,120
The imperial prince's temperature is going down.

368
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,100
The measles is going away, too. I think he'll recover soon.

369
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,580
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

370
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,390
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

371
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:28,770
Your devotion has saved His Imperial Highness.

372
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,480
From today, military training will begin.

373
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,390
Those of you who make it through the training course will be given a military uniform and stipend,

374
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,580
but if anyone quits during the course, he will be deemed an offender and sent to the border as a laborer.

375
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,750
Laborer? You mean we'll become slaves?

376
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,890
How could you do this to us?

377
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,670
I'm leaving! Never mind the training!

378
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,100
I will kill all you bastards!

379
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,300
There are nine hills on Gubong Mountain. You will climb over one hill per day.

380
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:16,700
If there's even one person who falls behind, you will start over again.

381
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:22,200
You've been warned. You weren't human beings all this time.

382
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,390
But... this training will decide

383
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:32,270
whether you become fighters or be left as insects.

384
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,600
There are soldiers stationed everywhere, so don't even think about running away.

385
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,980
If you die while running away, we will not be responsible.

386
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,420
There are 12 stragglers in total.

387
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,520
You will run from the starting point tomorrow.

388
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,300
Get up.

389
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,290
Your Majesty, I'll do it.

390
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:13,070
Your Majesty, you can't go on with your foot like this.

391
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:18,250
We will handle the rest. Please get some rest.

392
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,510
I'm also a straggler.

393
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,710
Because of my incompetence, I was deposed. What's the difference between them and me?

394
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,350
Your Majesty!

395
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:36,810
Therefore, I cannot give up.

396
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,330
Your Majesty.

397
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:45,510
Without even one person falling behind, I will lead them back.

398
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,630
If I can't even get that done,

399
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,510
with them, I will...

400
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,330
die here.

401
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,770
Your Majesty, are you all right?

402
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,690
We're almost there!

403
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,450
Let's go for it!

404
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,730
How many aren't here yet?

405
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,190
There are two.

406
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,280
I think...

407
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,010
they fell behind again.

408
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,380
Your Majesty.

409
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,820
Look over there!

410
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,780
You did it after all. You did.

411
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,920
Then, are we also not insects anymore?

412
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,860
Everyone...

413
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,710
you did well.

414
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,550
Shoot!

415
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,320
Back to your places.

416
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,700
Pull it! Shoot!

417
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,500
My Lady, just a little more.

418
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,150
Push just a little more!

419
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,400
Please bear with it just a little more.

420
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,570
Please be strong, My Lady!

421
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,140
Why is it...

422
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,360
taking so long?

423
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,050
What if something happens?

424
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,130
Please be calm, Your Majesty.

425
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,170
There's nothing more painful.

426
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,940
I feel like my blood is drying up.

427
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,290
It's coming.

428
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:01,740
The baby is coming! Your Highness, please be strong!

429
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,800
Your Highness.

430
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,030
It cannot be a son.

431
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:31,300
Let it be a daughter or a stillborn.

432
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,860
I pray to you with all my heart.

433
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,430
Your Majesty.

434
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,960
- What happened?
- The wench had a problem-free delivery.

435
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,960
- Is it a girl?
- That is...

436
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,850
It's a son.

437
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,720
Son?

438
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,790
Your Majesty.

439
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,720
Your Majesty.

440
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,140
The baby looks just like you.

441
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,700
You did well.

442
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,720
But... have you thought about

443
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,130
what to name the baby?

444
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,500
I discussed it with Empress Dowager.

445
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,280
We've decided to call him Ayushiridara.

446
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,780
Ayushiridara.

447
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,620
One, two, three!

448
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,510
One, two...

449
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,080
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

450
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,480
They look somewhat like soldiers now.

451
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,010
Imperial Consort Ki...

452
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,820
gave birth to a son.

453
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,670
The palace sent word that they're holding a congratulatory banquet or something.

454
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,780
I will not go easy on you,

455
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,550
so attack me with all your might.

456
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,740
Now, go ahead and attack.

457
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,550
Please don't remember me.

458
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:55,090
I don't even want to be...

459
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,600
remembered by you, Wang Yoo.

460
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,360
Stop!

461
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:37,560
- Allegiance!
 - Allegiance!

462
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,840
Were you looking for me?

463
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,360
Quickly!

464
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,320
Come here quickly.

465
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,060
Last night, I had a bad dream.

466
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,270
What was it this time that you're like this?

467
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:19,890
Yeom Byeong Soo stole all of my secret funds!

468
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,790
Father...

469
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,610
Yeom Byeong Soo is merely in charge of the place.

470
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,880
How would he know where the secret funds are when you're the only one who knows?

471
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,810
You don't know anything!

472
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,370
My foresight has never failed me.

473
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:42,510
Yeom Byeong Soo has an ulterior motive.

474
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:45,490
If you feel that nervous, I'll protect it.

475
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:49,480
If you tell me where the secret funds are hidden—

476
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,850
You'll steal it?

477
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,350
Father...

478
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:04,940
Now you show me your true feelings.

479
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,360
Why are you like this again?

480
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,670
You covet my money.

481
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:15,960
Because with that money, you can take all of my power!

482
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,820
Father...

483
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:20,800
please don't be like this.

484
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:25,160
Did you plan it with Yeom Byeong Soo? That you'll kill me

485
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,830
and take all of that money?

486
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,150
No.

487
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:36,400
Once Yeom Byeong Soo finds out where it's hidden,

488
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,420
killing me after that would be the order.

489
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,090
Please...

490
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,760
Please kill me.

491
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:55,420
I can't bear to see you like this.

492
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,790
Please kill me.

493
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,390
You may leave now.

494
00:50:55,220 --> 00:51:00,330
Am I... really close to death?

495
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,920
Why am I becoming senile?

496
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:21,740
It's amazing. Just look.

497
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,440
His eyes are like yours,

498
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,150
and his nose and mouth are like mine.

499
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,070
It's profound and mysterious.

500
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:35,640
That's why there's a saying an apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

501
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,850
Your Majesty.

502
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,320
It's time to go to Prince Maha's birthday banquet.

503
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,680
I don't want to go.

504
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,820
All the magistrates will be there.

505
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,030
Please go.

506
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,080
You're here.

507
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:12,150
Thank you for coming.

508
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:20,510
The imperial prince is extraordinarily handsome.

509
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:27,320
He will succeed the throne in the future. Of course, he should be extraordinary.

510
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:40,620
There are nuns who will pray for Maha today.

511
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,740
This way, please.

512
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,010
What's the matter?

513
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:05,110
There... That nun with a burn mark...

514
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:14,000
Her Majesty has bestowed this tea to you in thanks for taking care of her all this time.

515
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,240
Please drink it.

516
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,830
Thank you.

517
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:40,480
Your Majesty, our congratulations to you on Imperial Prince Maha's birthday.

518
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,620
We congratulate you, Your Majesty.

519
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,550
Thank you, everyone.

520
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:53,650
Your Majesty, please speak words of good wishes to our Maha.

521
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:05,290
Your Majesty, how can we leave out your congratulatory message on Imperial Prince's birthday?

522
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:11,320
Please say something, as the magistrates are here as well.

523
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,090
Golta, please bring Imperial Prince Ayu.

524
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

525
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,450
Your Majesty, today is our Maha's birthday.

526
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,240
Here...

527
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:46,650
It seems there is already so much interest in the investiture of the crown prince.

528
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:50,410
But I won't rush that.

529
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:54,930
When the princes have grown a few years more

530
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:59,470
I will choose the crown prince after a rigorous selection process.

531
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,920
Your Majesty, what do you mean a selection?

532
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:11,720
Your Majesty, have you forgotten Emperor Kublai Khan's edict that the firstborn sons must inherit the throne?

533
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,430
The prime minister is the one who enthroned my younger brother before me.

534
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:18,550
- It seems you're the one forgetting things.
- But Your Majesty—

535
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:23,460
I've told you my intentions, so no more discussion of the investiture of the crown prince.

536
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,460
My Lady.

537
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,150
It's not time for prayer. Why are you here?

538
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,260
Look here, Court Lady Seo, didn't you hear me?

539
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:02,720
I thought there was a Buddhist nun here with a burn scar on her face.

540
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,000
Have you seen her by any chance?

541
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:10,330
Why are you looking for her?

542
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,820
It's nothing.

543
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,720
You asked to see me?

544
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,880
Yes, Your Highness.

545
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,190
What is it about?

546
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:42,580
I was previously at Hwangak Temple.

547
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,760
Before the empress gave birth to the imperial prince,

548
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,850
she stayed at the hermitage where I was at.

549
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:56,350
The Imperial Prince Maha who is currently in the arms of the empress is not her real son.

550
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,800
What do you mean he's not her real son?

551
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,690
He was an abandoned baby, but she lied to make it seem as though he was her real son.

552
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,400
You mean he's not her son?

553
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,660
I am certain.

554
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:15,090
In order to hide the secret, she poisoned all the nuns

555
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:18,720
and set fire to the temple.

556
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,090
I was the only one who survived.

557
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:31,290
But... why are you telling me that secret?

558
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:35,350
I heard that you gave birth to a son.

559
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,460
I heard that the empress's fake son may become the crown prince,

560
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,740
so I came here to tell the truth.

561
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:49,720
Can you testify to what you just told me in the Imperial Palace?

562
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,320
Yes.

563
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:55,020
If only for the sake of our priests and nuns who were killed at that time,

564
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,360
I will reveal the truth.

565
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,580
In order for you to be believed, there must be clear proof.

566
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:11,350
I know a secret about that child's body that only the empress and her court lady would know.

567
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:16,660
If I disclose it, I think it will be enough proof.

568
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,240
So, what is the secret about his body?

569
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,730
On the top of his foot...

570
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:36,910
♫ That day when I said I loved you until I wept ♫

571
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:44,500
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

572
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:48,500
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫
