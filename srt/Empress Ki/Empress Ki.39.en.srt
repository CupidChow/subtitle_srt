1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,960
Until now, I've been fighting in order to avenge my father.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,750
From now on, for the sake of those who are here from Goryeo, and also,

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,790
for myself, I will fight.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,480
Please make me the empress.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,430
I will make my son the emperor;

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,250
and in this country,

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,850
I will ascend to the highest position.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,780
Will you...

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,940
work with me?

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,360
If you want my help,

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,020
you will also need to do

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,080
something for Goryeo.

13
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,810
This is the answer to the secret orders that were

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,980
given to me by Goryeo's monarch.

15
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,470
Will that...

16
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,940
satisfy you as my answer?

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,830
Please tell me.

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,490
What can I help you with?

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,330
Do you know the whereabouts of El Temür's funds?

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,620
We're looking into it.

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,370
El Temür used it as foothold and gained control of imperial authority

22
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,260
and took power into his hands.

23
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,350
I also will do the same.

24
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,440
You seem troubled.

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,590
It's for the benefit of both parties.

26
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,980
You made the best choice, do please do not worry.

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,480
My Lady!

28
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,040
His Majesty has been waiting.

29
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,260
Where did you go in the middle of the night?

30
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,070
I went to get some air.

31
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,930
To you... I have nothing I can say even if I had ten mouths.

32
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,190
Just watch and see.

33
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,670
I will never put you aside and get a new empress.

34
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,570
Right now, you mustn't have a conflict with the prime minister.

35
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,700
Without their help, we wouldn't have been able to get rid of El Temür.

36
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,440
Then, are you telling me to accept the prime minister's niece as the empress?

37
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,170
You must win by using a frontal attack.

38
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,970
Even Empress Dowager is working with Bayan.

39
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,230
There's no way to stand up to them.

40
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,660
Please rush my investiture as Chief Imperial Consort, and give me Heungdeok Palace.
(T?N: the second empress' quarters)

41
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,700
Heungdeok Palace?

42
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,660
In order to protect our son, Ayu,

43
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,950
I need an equal courtesy to the empress.

44
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,280
I will do so.

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,970
That promise, I'll be sure to keep.

46
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,810
I am against it!

47
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,170
In order to be involved in Yuan's trade,

48
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,420
we need the Imperial family's help.

49
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,640
I trust you, but not Imperial Consort Lady Ki.

50
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,620
Come on, Little Chief Yeon.

51
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,380
She gave birth to the emperor's child.

52
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,870
For the sake of her son, she could easily betray us.

53
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,920
She would never do that.

54
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,370
If you hold her hand,

55
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,830
I will let go of your hand.

56
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,660
Your Majesty, Yeon Bisoo is who we really need, not Imperial Consort Lady Ki.

57
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,620
As long as Bayan's niece is involved, it'll be impossible for her to become the empress.

58
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,230
If Ayushiridara gets installed as the crown prince,

59
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,190
it doesn't matter if she doesn't become the empress.

60
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,770
Then... what happens to Prince Maha?

61
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,880
Who cares what happens to him?

62
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,750
You're uselessly interested in others' affairs.

63
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,780
I know. My mouth is a problem.

64
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,060
Is that Maha?

65
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,670
Yes, Sire.

66
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,120
Your Majesty, you should not hold the Imperial Prince...

67
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,240
Looking at this child makes me feel so bad.

68
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,280
Let's get going, Sire.

69
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,010
Wang Yoo.

70
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,450
He doesn't take to strangers, but he's quite well-behaved with you.

71
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,840
Come here, Prince.

72
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,520
Since His Majesty never holds him, he must have been longing for his father.

73
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,430
Why do you look after the imperial prince?

74
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,050
No matter what happened, he's the firstborn of this imperial family.

75
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,030
There's no one else to look after him, so I should.

76
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,430
This...

77
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,600
Do you call this cleaning?

78
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,800
This wench, how dare you to kick it over?

79
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,010
How dare you call me a wench as a mere servant?

80
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,720
Will getting a lashing make you come to your senses?!

81
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,750
Make sure to mop this place so there's not even a speck of dust, and wash all the bedding.

82
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,810
Got it?

83
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,210
Seriously!

84
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,100
Why aren't you answering? Do you not hear me?

85
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,010
We will.

86
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,960
Get out of my way.

87
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,790
That... Never in my life...

88
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,970
have I've been disrespected by such a little wench!

89
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:48,450
When that wench Ki becomes the Chief Imperial Consort, she'll become a court lady!

90
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,760
I'd rather die than live like this.

91
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,010
Why would you die? You must live.

92
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,670
Our poor empress

93
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,820
asked us to take care of Maha. Have you forgotten?

94
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,360
If you just stay quietly,

95
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,450
one day we'll get our chance.

96
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,380
Of course, we will.

97
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,050
Are you crying?

98
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,930
Don't cry.

99
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,220
Ayu.

100
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,260
The imperial prince's meal is ready.

101
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,440
I will feed him, so give it to me.

102
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,190
Yes.

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,930
The silver spoon is here.

104
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,920
Ayu.

105
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,670
My Lady, the silver spoon...

106
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,080
What happened? How is there poison in his food?!

107
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,420
Tell me the truth!

108
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,290
We know nothing, Sir.

109
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,060
It's unfair, Your Highness!

110
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,830
His Imperial Majesty!

111
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,930
Are these the girls?

112
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,900
Yes, Sire. They made the prince's food in the kitchen.

113
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,610
Don't question them here.

114
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,240
Take them to the dungeon and make them confess!

115
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,660
Yes, Sire.

116
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,320
Take them!

117
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,910
Stop.

118
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,830
Your Majesty, I don't think they are responsible for it.

119
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,510
Then... who would do such a wicked thing?

120
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,420
I will find out.

121
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,780
Please leave it to me.

122
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,630
Do you have someone in mind?

123
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,170
Tell me why you're doing this to us!

124
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,290
Please at least tell us the reason why you're doing this!

125
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,470
- Shut up!
- Shut up?

126
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,550
Someone put poison in the imperial prince's food.

127
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,790
Wh-Who would do such...

128
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,300
It was something that Danashiri whom you served

129
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,250
was well-known for doing.

130
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,580
- We know nothing about it, Your Highness.
- Please believe us, Your Highness.

131
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,830
- After committing so many evil deeds, you want me to believe you?
- Yes, Your Highness.

132
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,020
If you tell me the truth, I'll spare your life.

133
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,790
If you refuse to confess, I will add up all your past sins and have you executed.

134
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,510
Your Highness...

135
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,610
We know nothing about it!

136
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,140
Really, it's not something—

137
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,550
we committed, Your Highness!

138
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,040
I'd rather you twisted my legs!

139
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,340
Please spare us. We swear to the heavens, we didn't do it!

140
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,480
Please!

141
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,280
Empress Dowager enters.

142
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,910
Are you certain they did it?

143
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,730
I'm finding out right now.

144
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,410
Let them go.

145
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,830
Your Highness.

146
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,660
It's a given that you let those go if they don't confess after being questioned.

147
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,840
They were Danashiri's wicked servants.

148
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,470
What's the reason you're letting them live until now?

149
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,850
How could someone go against an order from a higher-up?

150
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,020
They already paid for their sins by being demoted to being servants.

151
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,230
- Your Highness.
- Take them away and treat their wounds.

152
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,700
Yes, Your Highness.

153
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,780
Take them.

154
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,300
Your Highness!

155
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,310
- How long will you be possessed by the spirit of El Temür's family?
- Your Highness.

156
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,420
We're getting ready to greet the new empress.

157
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,810
We shouldn't do anything that causes a disturbance.

158
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,890
My son nearly got poisoned to death.

159
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,590
How is this something that can be avoided?

160
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,160
Even without making such a fuss,

161
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,100
there are plenty of ways to resolve the matter.

162
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,850
I want a peaceful palace. Be mindful.

163
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,530
Empress Dowager is acting suspiciously.

164
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,940
The seventh Khagan, Emperor Wuzong, was the nephew of Emperor Chengzong,

165
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,040
and the eighth Khagan, Emperor Renzong, was the brother of Emperor Wuzong.

166
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,570
The ninth Khagan, Emperor Yingzong, was the son of Emperor Renzong,

167
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,500
and Renzong's cousin Yesün was the 10th Emperor.

168
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,780
The 11th Khagan was the son of Emperor Yesün, Emperor Tianshun.

169
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,350
Whether it be palace etiquette or genealogy,

170
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:41,830
I hear she's doing very well in the empress education.

171
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,030
Your Majesty, other candidates are great,

172
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,700
but there's no one better than Bayan Khutugh in conduct or character.

173
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,080
So please select Bayan Khutugh.

174
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,320
As soon as the new empress is installed, I will install Imperial Consort Ki as the Chief Imperial Consort

175
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,190
and give her the Heungdeok Palace.

176
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,210
The Heungdeok Palace is for the use of the second rank empress. How could a Chief Imperial Consort--

177
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,800
It's empty anyway.

178
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,260
Also, even though the Chief Imperial Consort is a lower rank than the empress,

179
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:20,030
when it comes to courtesy, she will be treated as empress.

180
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,380
Did you nag His Majesty?

181
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,590
How could you speak that way? What do you mean nag?

182
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,850
You tell me. Did you ask His Majesty

183
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,850
to give you Heungdeok Palace?

184
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:40,790
I believe that I deserve to have Heungdeok Palace.

185
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,450
- You deserve it?
- Imperial Consort Lady Ki has

186
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,200
sacrificed a lot for me until now.

187
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,150
When Bayan Khutugh is receiving Gondeok Palace without having done anything,

188
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,180
there's no reason I can't give Heungdeok Palace to Imperial Consort Lady Ki.

189
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,880
I'm not asking for your permission.

190
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,280
I've already made my decision.

191
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:24,870
Once we're set to go to Heungdeok Palace, recruit eunuch guards who are well-skilled in martial arts.
- Yes, Your Highness.

192
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,410
Hongdan, you will become a court lady. Choose girls from Goryeo as maids.

193
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,590
Yes, Your Highness.

194
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,720
Also, another thing.

195
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,560
Before we enter the Heungdeok Palace, build a secret room.

196
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,950
A secret room?

197
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,290
Once we get El Temür's funds, we need a place to hide them.

198
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,270
I will do as you ask.

199
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:58,150
But I can't figure out at all who tried to poison the imperial prince.

200
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,630
Whoever the person, I cannot forgive the person who tried to hurt my son.

201
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:11,890
I really pray that you, Empress Dowager, aren't responsible.

202
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,830
Your Highness.

203
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,290
Once the new empress is chosen,

204
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:31,040
I am going to let you come back as court ladies to the empress' quarters.

205
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,160
Court ladies again?

206
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,000
Your Highness!

207
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,310
We are so grateful, Your Highness.

208
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,690
But in return, for the future of this palace,

209
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,050
there is a mission you must carry out.

210
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,840
We will do our very best and work ourselves to the bone

211
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,290
in order to carry out your order, Your Highness.

212
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,590
Whatever it is, please just give us your order.

213
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,120
Make the new empress trust and depend on you.

214
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,070
Pardon?

215
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,990
She must not find out that you work for me.

216
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,110
We understand fully what you're saying.

217
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,400
You may leave now.

218
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:57,380
Your Highness, are you thinking about making Imperial Prince Maha the crown prince of this country?

219
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,240
Even if I die, I can't let someone of Goryeo blood to become the crown prince.

220
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,030
But the emperor and Lady Ki will be strongly opposed.

221
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,280
Who killed Maha's mother?

222
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,520
Since the family were guilty of being traitors, you can't say one person was—

223
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,360
Imperial Consort Ki. She's the one who killed her.

224
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,340
That is what I will teach Maha.

225
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,670
Your mother was killed by Imperial Consort Ki of Goryeo.

226
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,790
She was so jealous that she instigated the emperor to wipe out your entire family.

227
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,280
Your mother died very pitifully and miserably.

228
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:50,160
So you must wash away her resentment for her.

229
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,010
Do you understand?

230
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:31,900
I'm Court Lady Seo who will take care of you from now on.

231
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,780
I'm Court Lady Yeon.

232
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,730
I heard about you from Empress Dowager.

233
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:43,360
I don't know a lot and I'm weak-hearted, so I will make a lot of mistakes.

234
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,300
Please assist me well.

235
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,880
Please do not worry, Your Majesty.

236
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,430
We will do our best to assist you.

237
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,000
Her Majesty the Empress!

238
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,170
They're dressed as court ladies. How did that happen?

239
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:26,610
I have accepted Prime Minister's niece, Bayan Khutugh,

240
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:34,820
as this country's lawful empress.

241
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,140
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

242
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,530
Long live...

243
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,210
His Imperial Majesty!

244
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,200
Long live Her Imperial Majesty!

245
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,130
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

246
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,720
Long live Her Imperial Majesty!

247
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,250
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

248
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,920
Long live Her Imperial Majesty! Long live His Imperial Majesty!

249
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,310
Long live Her Imperial Majesty! Long live His Imperial Majesty!

250
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:08,830
Long live Her Imperial Majesty! Long live His Imperial Majesty!

251
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,290
Long live Her Imperial Majesty!

252
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,270
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

253
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,790
Long live Her Imperial Majesty!

254
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,910
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

255
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,240
Your Highness, congratulations on your new residence, the Heungdeok Palace.

256
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,710
Congratulations, Your Highness.

257
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,470
This is your room where you will stay.

258
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,790
Where is the secret room?

259
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,440
Do you like it?

260
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,770
Now all we have to do is fill this place

261
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,860
with the secret funds.

262
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,370
Wang Yoo sent a letter.

263
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,930
I heard that you will soon become Chief Imperial Consort.

264
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,150
By the time you read this letter,

265
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,850
I will be headed over to the tin mine.

266
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:06,500
Please remember. If anyone finds out that we're after the secret funds,

267
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,240
you and I will both lose everything in one moment.

268
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,770
But if we get out hands on the funds safely,

269
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,750
the end result will be the opposite.

270
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,610
I will pray for your good health.

271
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,610
I heard that Prime Minister confiscated the ledger from El Temür's home.

272
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:34,420
Find out where it is quietly.

273
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,950
Yes, Your Highness.

274
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,150
You look very uncomfortable.

275
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,690
You should take off your robes.

276
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,420
Until His Majesty comes, I will stay as I am.

277
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:03,000
That is... my duty toward my master.

278
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,830
How could you be so kind?

279
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:14,440
Even His Majesty who is without feelings will melt into your arms.

280
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:23,380
By chance, have you heard about Ki who became the Chief Imperial Consort?

281
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:26,750
I hear His Majesty's affection for her is like no other.

282
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,070
That's putting it mildly.

283
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,740
No wonder the late empress was filled with so much hatred for--

284
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,990
Forgive me. I spoke too comfortably.

285
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,860
It doesn't bother me. You may leave now.

286
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:50,550
Your Majesty, you should go to the empress' quarters.

287
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,390
How can you be drunk before your first night?

288
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,720
I'm going to Heungdeok Palace.

289
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,060
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

290
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,320
I'm going to Yang's quarters.

291
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
Your Majesty! How could you spend your wedding night with the Chief Imperial Consort?

292
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,450
It's my choice!

293
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,950
It's up to me, the emperor!

294
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:28,020
Since when was the emperor of this country not allowed to have feelings for whomever he wants?

295
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,810
That's what being the emperor means.

296
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,570
Oh. Empress Dowager.

297
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,560
You're not the emperor because you can do whatever you want.

298
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,690
For a just and great cause, he must hold back and suppress,

299
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,880
and sometimes even do the opposite of what he wishes. That's what being an emperor means.

300
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,300
That's what makes him great.

301
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,760
Great?

302
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,760
That's...

303
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,910
That's just a spineless emperor!

304
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,680
But... our empress dowager

305
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,930
doesn't seem to sincerely want the best for me these days.

306
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:26,230
If you act like this,

307
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,480
I will have to kick Chief Imperial Consort Ki out of the palace.

308
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,830
Your Highness!

309
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,390
That's what happened to Emperor Xuanzong's Consort Yang during the Tang Dynasty.

310
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:38,960
The emperor's excessive affections for her brought about dissolution within the palace.

311
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,250
Why don't you realize that your behavior right now is making Lady Ki into a treacherous person?

312
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:56,290
Even for her sake, please protect your seat.

313
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,250
I'm saying spend tonight with the empress.

314
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,820
Your Highness.

315
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,680
His Majesty just went to the empress' quarters.

316
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,760
Ayu. My son, Ayu.

317
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,520
Son.

318
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,820
My little child.

319
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:52,120
Because of you, your mother doesn't even look at me these days.

320
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,400
How dare you try to take away a precious person from me?

321
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,120
Stop it. Ayu will be sad.

322
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,990
It's making me more sad.

323
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,820
Tell me. Who do you like better between Ayu and me?

324
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,860
Then between him and me, who do you like better?

325
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,960
Well, that's...

326
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:33,970
Yang, I've never been this happy in all my life.

327
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,500
While eating and while walking,

328
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:44,020
I suddenly wonder if this is a dream and terrify myself.

329
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,950
It's not a dream.

330
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:53,580
I'm here beside you and Ayu is beside you like this.

331
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,080
That's why sometimes

332
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,990
I'm more fearful.

333
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,360
Since waking up from reality is

334
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:13,090
scarier than waking up from a dream.

335
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,920
That will not happen in the future.

336
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,660
♫Don't you see me? ♫

337
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:27,360
Therefore, whether this is a dream or reality, in order to not wake up from it,

338
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,720
♫I continue ♫

339
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,210
I will make you the empress.

340
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,990
♫ breathing at your side ♫

341
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,370
I will make our Ayu the crown prince.

342
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:45,220
♫ My love is for you. ♫

343
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,480
So until we die at an old age in the distant future,

344
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,400
let's live happily, the three of us.

345
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,070
♫Although you remain at my side within my reach, ♫

346
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,560
Don't worry, my baby.

347
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,030
No one will ever hurt you.

348
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,600
I will make sure to protect you

349
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,420
so that you become...

350
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,780
the crown prince of this country.

351
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,040
Let me pour you a drink.

352
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,920
- Bayan.
- Yes, My Liege.

353
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,000
Sorry.

354
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,410
What are you sorry for?

355
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:09,300
Right now and in the future, too,

356
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,050
there will only be things that I'm sorry towards you for.

357
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:20,000
This is my last apology. I"m done telling you what I must.

358
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,110
Your Majesty.

359
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,430
I'm saying...

360
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,800
don't seek out my heart.

361
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,590
You called me by my name, Bayan.

362
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,600
You also called me "empress." That's enough for me.

363
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,070
If you do not wish it, I will not ask for more.

364
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,310
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

365
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,140
Are you awake?

366
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,320
You've been like that all night?

367
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:17,120
You should have called for someone and asked them to remove your crown for you.

368
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:22,550
How could I have a court lady remove my clothes on my wedding night?

369
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,950
- What's the matter with you?
- My leg has a cramp.

370
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:37,930
This foolish person. You've been sitting there until your legs went numb.

371
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:46,560
- Anyone there?
- Please don't call anyone.

372
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:52,510
If you would at least remove my crown for me...

373
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,380
I feel like I can live now!

374
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:08,050
I think Gondeok Palace has the wrong owner again.

375
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:13,970
Danashiri, the person before you, was too wicked, and you're too nice.

376
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:18,510
If one can't be too much or too little,

377
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:23,250
exactly who can become the rightful owner of this place?

378
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,020
- Golta, are you there?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

379
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:37,460
I will have my breakfast at Chief Imperial Consort Ki's place.

380
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,840
I will send the message.

381
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,860
Please don't worry about me.

382
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:48,470
People say husband and wife are of one body and mind.

383
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:55,020
Since you treat Chief Imperial Consort Ki so preciously, I also will do the same.

384
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,100
- Where are you going?
- To meet with Master Toqto'a.

385
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:17,090
- Did you not send the message that I will be having breakfast at the Heungdeok Palace?
- I did, but...

386
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,940
I had a previous engagement.

387
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,980
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

388
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,300
Yang.

389
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:35,120
Last night, I was in bad shape from drinking too much.

390
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,300
- My head hurt, I didn't feel well, and—
- I also

391
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,730
stayed up all night.

392
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,990
I asked for breakfast to be prepared, so take care of His Majesty.

393
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Your Majesty, people are watching, and I think Chief Imperial Consort Ki is acting disrespectfully.

394
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:14,860
While she was up all night, she must have felt so hurt.

395
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:33,050
You've looked at all these documents, but there's not even a clue about the secret funds.

396
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,300
There could be something we missed, so check diligently.

397
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,620
Sir, Chief Imperial Consort Ki is here.

398
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,560
You're here.

399
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:02,910
What are all those documents?

400
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,890
They're ledgers regarding El Temür's assets.

401
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,430
You still haven't confiscated all his assets?

402
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:16,870
We still don't know the whereabouts of the secret funds, but we're looking, so we should find out soon.

403
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,220
You don't look well.

404
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:28,050
Do you resent my uncle?

405
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,570
I feel like the dog that's been killed after the hunt, so if I said I don't resent him,

406
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,370
I'd be lying.

407
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,910
What brings you here?

408
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,580
I heard that the empress was ignored by the emperor on her wedding night.

409
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:51,040
That happened to Danashiri, too, and I was hated for it.

410
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,460
So I hope you put in a good word to the empress for me.

411
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:01,630
I'd prefer to not get involved in palace-infighting like during Danashiri's days.

412
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,370
I came here to request this of you.

413
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,720
I understand.

414
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:23,390
I heard Prince Ayu was almost poisoned to death recently.

415
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,590
Poisoning such a young prince? Was the criminal caught?

416
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,780
He was not, so it remains a mystery.

417
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,580
Do you have any guesses?

418
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,840
No. Not at all.

419
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,750
You didn't sleep a single wink all night long.

420
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:00,270
This is all because of that Chief Imperial Consort Ki.

421
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:04,290
That wicked thing has His Majesty wrapped around her finger.

422
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,400
Please stop.

423
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,460
I'm afraid I might really end up hating Chief Imperial Consort Ki.

424
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,530
But you should hate her, Your Majesty. That Ki bitch...

425
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,670
I mean, because of Lady Ki, you are alone even while a married woman.

426
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,980
So, of course, you should hate her.

427
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,150
How can you be so kind and tender-hearted?

428
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,270
Your Majesty, Toqto'a is here.

429
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,780
Ask him in, please.

430
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

431
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,790
Welcome, Elder Cousin.

432
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,270
I was feeling a bit down, so I'm so glad you came.

433
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,450
Please bring us some tea.

434
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,590
We won't need tea. Please excuse us.

435
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,630
Yes, Sir.

436
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,000
What brings you here?

437
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,650
Maybe you heard that I was not visited by the emperor on the first night?

438
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,360
May I speak to you familiarly for a moment?
(T/N: without addressing her formally as Empress)

439
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,710
It's uncomfortable for me, too, Elder Cousin, for you to speak to me formally.

440
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,160
Please speak to me comfortably.

441
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,070
Bayan.

442
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,380
Yes, Elder Cousin?

443
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,010
We are not closely related, but when we were young,

444
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,300
I spent a lot of time with Uncle.

445
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,180
Yes, we had a lot of fun together.

446
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:33,720
So I know you better than anyone.

447
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,680
So you must...

448
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,130
never do such a thing again.

449
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,510
Trying to poison the imperial prince who is still a baby? Are you a human being?

450
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:59,980
When you were young, you were more jealous and vicious than anyone.

451
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,210
When a pet bird was too loud,

452
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,990
you chopped it into pieces and put it back in the birdcage.

453
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:12,440
You must now stop speaking to me familiarly.

454
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:19,740
That kind of talk is not pleasant to hear now that I am the empress.

455
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,930
Yes, I did it.

456
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,240
But if I really wanted to kill him, would I have been that lame about it?

457
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,650
I used a tiny bit. I just gave him a taste.

458
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,890
I am the empress of this kingdom.

459
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,690
If I intended to let a mere Chief Imperial Consort steal the emperor from me,

460
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,440
I wouldn't have bothered coming here at all.

461
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:56,650
So wait and see how I cast out that Chief Imperial Consort bitch and how I steal the emperor back.

462
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:01,820
I do not concern myself with the inner court. But

463
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,290
if your bad behavior harms our family name,

464
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:16,440
then I will not stand for that.

465
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,430
Crazy...

466
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:52,600
These documents are definitely about El Temür's assets.

467
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:59,590
We must copy these documents tonight and return to where they were.

468
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:01,650
Yes, Your Highness.

469
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,620
What is this?

470
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,020
It looks like the floor plan of a house.

471
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:38,490
Floor plan? Is this for El Temür's house?

472
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,520
Yes, Your Highness. It appears so.

473
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,630
What has happened to El Temür's house?

474
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:50,490
I heard that Prime Minister Bayan now lives in that house.

475
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:58,290
We haven't found a single clue about the secret fund for days.

476
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:03,120
If Tanqishi finds it first, that would be terrible.

477
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,230
There is one way.

478
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,780
What is that?

479
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,690
El Temür had a very close relationship with the leader of Hawk House.

480
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,760
If we could meet with the leader

481
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,380
I'm sure we could find a clue about the secret fund.

482
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,960
But you said no one knows who the leader is.

483
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,860
Based on the information we've secretly gathered so far,

484
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:30,890
the head of the Yeongyeong Branch of Hawk House knows who the leader is.

485
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,220
Find him.

486
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,210
We are looking for him right now,

487
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,420
so I expect we will meet him soon.

488
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,260
That secret fund must never get into anyone else's hands.

489
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,170
The leader of the merchant army that I deal with.

490
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,360
She helped us connect with the leader of the Yeongyeong Branch.

491
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,400
Please call me Chief Yeon.

492
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,160
I won't forget your help.

493
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,150
Please go inside. He is waiting for you.

494
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,870
Go on, please.

495
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,290
Welcome,

496
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,850
General Tanqishi.

497
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,470
Do you know me?

498
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:28,820
I've received great favor from Prime Minister in the past.

499
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,850
At that time, I have seen you from a distance.

500
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,970
I will get to the point.

501
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:37,980
I'm looking for the secret fund that my father hid.

502
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:43,000
Do you have any clues?

503
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,430
Some time ago, Prime Minister massacred an entire mining town.

504
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,390
What was his reason?

505
00:47:53,390 --> 00:48:00,420
What do you mean? He made those guys hide the gold, then made sure the secret was kept.

506
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,000
Do you know where that is?

507
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,360
I don't know that.

508
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,900
Maybe the leader would know.

509
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,460
Please let me meet with the leader of Hawk House.

510
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:15,320
He never lets anyone see his face.

511
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,230
Isn't that why I am pleading with you desperately?

512
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,260
I will try to ask him.

513
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,860
Thank you.

514
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,400
This is an inn that we own.

515
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,350
It will be safe for you to stay here for the time being.

516
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,300
Please escort him to his room.

517
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,920
Bayan is frantically looking for Tanqishi right now.

518
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,960
Helping him could put all of Hawk House in danger.

519
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,670
We can kick him out after speaking with the leader. It won't be too late.

520
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,630
Where is the leader?

521
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,830
He is very close by.

522
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:11,990
Could I meet him as well?

523
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,630
When the time is right.

524
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:24,770
What? You want us to steal the secret fund—

525
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,360
I oughta just...

526
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,720
Sorry.

527
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:43,360
Tanqishi intends to use that money to raise an army for an insurrection.

528
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,320
Why would I want to be a part of that? Am I crazy?

529
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,560
So the reason you are helping Tanqishi now—

530
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:59,420
Once I get that money in my hands, there won't be anything in this world I cannot do.

531
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,160
Indeed, your scheming brain—

532
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,620
I mean, your brain is extraordinary.

533
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,630
Things have gotten messy, I admit.

534
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:17,150
But I have to get that money into my hands no matter what.

535
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,980
And I will also rescue poor Court Lady Yeon, too.

536
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,390
What?

537
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:26,930
Oh, yes, of course, you must.

538
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:33,170
I'm sure that Bayan is looking for the secret fund, too.

539
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:36,750
Have someone find out what's going on in the palace.

540
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,590
Yes, General.

541
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,320
♪ Eight, Eight King disappeared, they say ♪

542
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,440
♪ He took one step to the swallow's house to catch the swallow ♪

543
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,520
♪ but he just pooped and returned home ♪

544
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,230
♪ When will we harvest the field and eat our fill? ♪

545
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:00,210
They're making fun of us, aren't they?

546
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:04,390
It seems it's a song about being hungry and resentful.

547
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:10,560
Oh, you kids. Singing about poop again? Go play over there.

548
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:14,430
You've traveled far to get here.

549
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:16,170
You have many hardships, don't you?

550
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,730
We searched every hole we could find. Not only the mines,

551
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,200
we even searched every single cauldron.

552
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,990
But not a single flake of gold anywhere.

553
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:30,060
So if it's not here, we've lost our chance to find that gold, haven't we?

554
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,750
Where did Tanqishi go?

555
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:35,360
I don't know. One day suddenly,

556
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,050
he disappeared along with Yeom Byeong Soo.

557
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,400
Maybe they found out where the secret fund is?

558
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,990
If they did, would only just a few of them go?

559
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:47,600
Moving all that gold would be a lot of work.

560
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:53,580
This isn't as easy as I thought it would be.

561
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,150
♪ Eight, Eight King disappeared, they say ♪

562
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,320
♪ He took one step to the swallow's house to catch the swallow ♪

563
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,940
Oh, those kids.

564
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,830
Kids, go play over that way.

565
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,680
Kids these days, they just don't listen.

566
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,180
What song is that, that they are singing it so much?

567
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,990
I heard it's been passed down since this mining town was built.

568
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:28,480
It's a lament about being hungry, so no need to pay attention.

569
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,580
Your Majesty, I don't think we have the time to stay here longer.

570
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:59,430
The likely places El Temür hid his secret fund are six places;

571
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:04,380
including a forge in a mining town where he could extract tin.

572
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,480
And based on El Temür's usual movements,

573
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,500
the possible spots are narrowed down to three.

574
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,280
So it has to be one of these three places.

575
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:22,660
Your Highness, the tin mine that Wang Yoo spoke of is not one of the three.

576
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:27,270
El Temür would have listed someone else as the owner.

577
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:34,170
Your Highness, His Majesty is coming this way.

578
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:46,650
What brings you here without any notice?

579
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:58,110
Why won't you respond when I summon you?

580
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,950
Are you still angry with me?

581
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:04,310
I told you that I wanted to be alone.

582
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:08,850
Maybe you are fine without seeing me, but I am not.

583
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:13,860
If you are not by my side, I am so uneasy that I cannot stand it.

584
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,290
Please give me time to pull myself together.

585
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,320
It won't take long.

586
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,810
Chief Imperial Consort...

587
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,460
I will request this of you.

588
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,540
Please don't make me angry.

589
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:49,720
Why won't you discuss the secret fund with His Majesty?

590
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:54,730
If he finds out about it, the money must go to the state coffers.

591
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,420
But right now, I need power to protect myself.

592
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,290
Wang Yoo recently sent word

593
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:05,990
requesting to see you at the Yeongak Buddhist temple.

594
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:15,420
I'm sure the secret fund is not hidden too far away.

595
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:20,420
A place where he can easily access it, but difficult to find.

596
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:24,360
And with no danger of being stolen.

597
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,660
Where can that be?

598
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,140
My books are in a different order than before.

599
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:55,740
Anyone outside?

600
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,860
Have you touched these books?

601
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,680
We have not.

602
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,950
Has anyone come in here when I wasn't here?

603
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,270
Not at all.

604
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:15,760
What is the matter?

605
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:21,840
Looks like there is one more person in this palace

606
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,350
who is interested in the secret fund.

607
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:47,750
General, do you know who just exited the palace?

608
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:53,760
The soldiers just sent word that Seung Nyang, that bitch who deserves to be beaten to death,

609
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,320
just stepped out of the palace.

610
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,420
Get the soldiers ready.

611
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,420
Yes, General.

612
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,260
What's wrong, Your Highness?

613
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,670
Assassins.

614
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:34,520
Protect Her Highness!

615
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:37,750
Who are you?

616
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:41,020
Who sent you?

617
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:52,360
Finally. Finally the heavens

618
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,340
have heard my desperate pleas.

619
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:56,740
Tanqishi.

620
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:02,030
I will make sure to spray your blood and flesh on the graves

621
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:05,370
of my father, Danashiri, and Talahai.

622
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:12,600
That's what I want to say to you, my mother's murderer.

623
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:20,560
Today, my mother's blood-soaked grudge will be avenged by me.

624
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,690
♫ With only the words 'I love you' ♫

625
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:36,930
♫ isn't that enough for you to stay with me? ♫

626
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:41,060
♫ Can't you even grant me ♫

627
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,770
♫ just one day with you? ♫

628
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,650
♫ My love for you ♫
