1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,790
Park dares to carry His Majesty's child.

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,430
Go feed this to that bitch!

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,480
Is this a poison?

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,850
Why so surprised?

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,020
Are you scared?

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:32,170
It could... get you into trouble instead.

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,390
Don't worry about that.

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,060
It's a medicinal herb extracted from gourd flowers.

9
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,080
Did you say it was fatal only to the fetus?

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

11
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,690
If you must do this job right so that you can live freely outside the palace,

12
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,710
I'll issue you a document that guarantees your identity.

13
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,280
But if you even make the smallest mistake,

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,460
only your dead body will leave the palace.

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,620
Understood?

16
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

17
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,170
She is so cruel.

18
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,050
She is Tanqishi's sister after all...

19
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,940
Why is she coming out from Empress's palace?

20
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,680
No way. Did she get a secret order from the empress?

21
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,740
Seung Nyang is a girl?

22
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,120
It can't be.

23
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,510
She is better at archery and riding horses than me.

24
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,310
Wait. No way I lost to a girl.

25
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,010
But...

26
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,100
If Seung Nyang was to wear women's clothing....

27
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,020
She's beautiful.

28
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,410
She's so beautiful.

29
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,130
The air is cold, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,310
How about you go back to your quarter—

31
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,680
Troublemaker! I can't think because of your nagging.

32
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,620
Your Majesty, I am worried you might catch a cold.

33
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,330
I'll be fine alone. Don't follow me!

34
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,620
My goodness...

35
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,740
This-This... unruly mouth of yours...

36
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,690
Are you disregarding me, too? Do not follow me!

37
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,560
Your Majesty, but that's not—

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,530
While I am still being nice...

39
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,280
You should heed my words.

40
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,930
Your Majesty.

41
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,280
Can you really ignore the deaths of the Goryeo people?

42
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,730
It's none of my business.

43
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,150
Your friends are among them.

44
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,080
I have no friends.

45
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,450
You are deceiving yourself now.

46
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,170
My heart is about to burst...

47
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,860
in frustration.

48
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,690
Now I can think about Seung Nyang to my heart's content.

49
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,350
I miss you.

50
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,120
Where are you?

51
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,590
Who are you missing?

52
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,260
Your Majesty.

53
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,110
I am asking you now.

54
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,990
Who do you miss that much?

55
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,670
Why can't you answer me? By chance...

56
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,410
is there someone you secretly like?

57
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,050
That's...

58
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,510
not it.

59
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,420
Your Majesty!

60
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,580
Your Majesty!

61
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,320
I'll be leaving now.

62
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:47,100
I came wondering who that person was. Isn't she that girl?

63
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,790
What's going on with finding Seung Nyang in Goryeo?

64
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,190
It's only been a few days since we sent out the word.

65
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,460
Your Majesty, you don't seem well-rested.

66
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,360
Ah, yeah... I didn't sleep well last night.

67
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,610
What do you mean you didn't sleep well? Do you have something you're worried about?

68
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,310
It's nothing.

69
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,500
Emperor Dowager, Court Lady Park is coming in.

70
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,220
Good morning, Your Majesty, Empress Dowager.

71
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,050
I'll leave then. You carry on with your visit.

72
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,170
Leaving already?

73
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:57,490
How about you take a walk with Lady Park?

74
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,580
I hear light exercise is good while pregnant.

75
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,470
They say there's nothing better for prenatal education than hearing the father's voice.

76
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,860
I understand.

77
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,780
I'm sure you're busy. I can walk alone.

78
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,470
You seem to have a good heart.

79
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,790
I can't complain even if you call me heartless and indifferent.

80
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,790
Not at all, Your Majesty.

81
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,320
What's wrong?

82
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,780
My Lady?

83
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,550
Did you eat something wrong?

84
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,600
I am fine. It's morning sickness.

85
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,930
What do you mean morning sickness?

86
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,260
It's a common symptom during pregnancy.

87
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,380
You don't have to worry about it.

88
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,360
Is that right?

89
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,380
Are you sure Yang is feeding her the medicine?

90
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,020
I'll check it out.

91
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,980
No, I'll make her eat it in front of me.

92
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,330
Bring Lady Park to my quarters.

93
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

94
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,790
Do not blame me.

95
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,720
What made me this vicious...

96
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,180
is all because of you.

97
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,570
It's your fault.

98
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,410
Court Lady Park is coming in.

99
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,350
Your Majesty.

100
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,980
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?

101
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,880
A few days ago, I dreamed these fish jumped out of the tank and

102
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,070
fell into my arms.

103
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,950
I thought it was a dream of pregnancy.

104
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,200
But it was you who got pregnant and not me.

105
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,950
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

106
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:04,310
No need to feel anxious. It won't be good for the baby.

107
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,620
When that child is born,

108
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,130
the child will call me "Mother" and not you.

109
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:18,530
So... don't you think we should be a little more friendly?

110
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,020
I am sorry, Your Majesty

111
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,620
The child is not yours only.

112
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,370
If you don't manage to deliver the baby, I will not forgive you.

113
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,440
I'll keep that in mind.

114
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:46,100
Therefore, I would like to have a chat with you once a day and enjoy some refreshments together.

115
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,980
How do you feel about that?

116
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,310
Of course, I would be honored.

117
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,670
I don't want any groundless suspicions,

118
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,200
so it would be best for your people to prepare the refreshments.

119
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,270
I will do so.

120
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,980
You may leave.

121
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

122
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,750
You have to make the refreshments.

123
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,140
You know what that means, right?

124
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,150
Do you think the empress is on to us?

125
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,220
Seeing that I'm being asked to prepare the refreshments,

126
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,160
I don't think she is doubting me.

127
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,790
That's a relief.

128
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,160
But the big task is ahead of us.

129
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,290
I'm sure the empress will check to make sure the gourd flowers are in the refreshments.

130
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,200
How about we tell Empress Dowager?

131
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,460
Not unless we have solid proof. If not, you could get charged with slander instead.

132
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,630
That's true.

133
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,850
But what should we do?

134
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,820
I'll try to find a way.

135
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,560
Thank you, Yang.

136
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,480
You don't need to thank me.

137
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,510
In return for turning a blind eye to the sin I nearly committed,

138
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,180
this is just my way of repaying you.

139
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,990
Sift the flour and the sweet rice flour.

140
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,030
Then put in the refined rice wine, honey,

141
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,140
and some sesame oil, then knead it.

142
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,440
Hm? Where is it?

143
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,910
Inside that cupboard.

144
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,950
I'll get it.

145
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,820
Why don't you knead it?

146
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,400
Why the powder?

147
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,910
It doesn't look like it's enough.

148
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,420
I want to make plenty while we're at it.

149
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,600
You must want some, too.

150
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,550
Sure, let's make some extras.

151
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,110
Looks good, right? Good job!

152
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,430
You're sure she put it in the Goryeo Rice Cakes?

153
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,010
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

154
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,390
Did you bring the refreshments?

155
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

156
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,630
They look tasty.

157
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,400
What is this?

158
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,970
They're Goryeo Rice Cakes.

159
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,880
Goryeo Rice Cakes?

160
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,420
Good, try some first.

161
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,450
You eat first, Your Majesty.

162
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,500
The gourd flowers have no harmful effect on those who are not pregnant.

163
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,100
If there is a side effect, you'll use the privy screen more often.

164
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,060
- The privy screen?
- There are no other issues,

165
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,020
so you can eat freely, Your Majesty.

166
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,440
Do they suit your taste?

167
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,030
The taste is very unique.

168
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:31,270
Bring these every morning when you come to see me.

169
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,220
I understand.

170
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,080
Here, you eat some too.

171
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,800
I only put it in the cakes that are topped with pine nuts.

172
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,200
The spies are on their way back.

173
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,650
Open the gates for them.

174
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,550
Open the gates!

175
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,530
I'm worried whether Eunuch Bang and Jeom Bak are doing well.

176
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,540
Hey! Are you going to eat the chicken all by yourself?

177
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,360
Why are you being so petty?

178
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Listen up, in here, I'm the boss.

179
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,270
If I'm dung, you're the dung fly. Got it?

180
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:21,520
But will those bastards believe us?

181
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,710
One slip up and we're done for.

182
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,500
At least try a little bit.

183
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,720
Being full without eating,

184
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,120
not feeling cold when unclothed is the way of the Taoist.

185
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,180
But... where is General Baghatur?

186
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,600
I'm saying this again, my elder will not talk

187
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,190
unless General Baghatur is here, so just keep that in mind!

188
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,370
This is General Baghatur.

189
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,130
What?

190
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,690
This woman is General Baghatur?

191
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,560
Are you asking me to believe that?

192
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,040
Stop playing around and bring him in here!

193
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,360
Hey, you!

194
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,220
- Elder!
- Watch your mouth.

195
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,570
I recognized you from earlier.

196
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:46,560
I was waiting for you to reveal yourself. Thank you for opening your heart to us.

197
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,570
Since you saw my face,

198
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,470
if you can't earn my trust, you're both dead.

199
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,440
Well, how could I earn your trust?

200
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Your tactics were perfect.

201
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,710
Interrupting the enemy's sleep by playing the gong and incapacitating their military power.

202
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:19,330
That's all you had? Get rid of them.

203
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,450
The soldiers...!

204
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,170
Couldn't be the only tired ones.

205
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,040
Why so surprised?

206
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,870
Oh! Does Bayan know, too? Don't worry.

207
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,940
Since the only one in the world who knows your intentions is

208
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,440
just me, Bang Shin Woo, the strategist.

209
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:04,090
It may be called a wooden fence, but it's a vast fortification.

210
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,330
The only way to attack them is head-on.

211
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:16,800
The time of the attack is in two days. When they retreat, it should be the fifth hourly period. (3:30-4:30 a.m.)

212
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:23,930
In two days, fifth period...
- When you head out to lure Baghatur and the Turks standing guard,

213
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,890
I and Toqto'a will seize the enemy camp.

214
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:33,110
Even with the standing guards gone, it won't be easy to seize their camp.

215
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,740
Don't worry. I have already set up a secret plan.

216
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,640
- Tell me what that is.
- You don't need to know.

217
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,480
We're having a strategy meeting in order to achieve victory.

218
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,280
If it's for victory,

219
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,010
not knowing everything is a strategy, too.

220
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,190
We're attacking in the fifth period.

221
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,460
Things are going to be urgent.

222
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,020
If it's as expected, Bang will return tonight.

223
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,520
- Relay this news.
- Yes, Sire.

224
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,980
What are they whispering about?

225
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,840
I'm sure he said to relay something.

226
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,140
General Yeom!

227
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,510
Hurry up. General Bayan is asking for you.

228
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,730
You... keep an eye on that guard.

229
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,720
- What for all of a sudden?
- I trust my gut.

230
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,380
- They're up to something, I'm sure of it.
- Like what?

231
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,540
What that is, is...

232
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,250
Anyway, watch and see if there's anyone who leaves the camp tonight!

233
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,210
Relay? What did the deposed king want to be relayed and by whom?

234
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,330
Unfortunately, I didn't hear what that was.

235
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,950
But... it bothers me that Eunuch Bang and Jeom Bak aren't around.

236
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:10,010
- They died during the battle.
- You believe that?

237
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,870
Then, are you saying the Turks and the deposed king have communicated?

238
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,360
Tonight, if his guard goes missing,

239
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,310
I'm certain they've been communicating.

240
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,220
Those bastards...

241
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,020
You bastards!

242
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,070
Look. Like I said, his guard is missing.

243
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,140
- Where's your guard?
- What is this about?

244
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,830
Where is your guard?

245
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,390
Why are you looking for me?

246
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,070
We needed more torches, so I went to make some.

247
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,020
Is there something you want to say to me?

248
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,910
- Have all the torches been prepared?
- Yes, a total of 12.

249
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,160
Yeom! If you're going to bring me information, make sure you know what you're talking about!

250
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,000
It's strange. There's no way my gut was wrong.

251
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,920
Hey, Jo Cham!

252
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,350
Has any soldier left the camp?

253
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,790
No, I didn't see any.

254
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:23,040
You idiot. If you talk nonsense one more time, I won't let it slide!

255
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,730
I'm sure he said to relay something...

256
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,600
Light the torches.

257
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,280
The torches are lit.

258
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:57,140
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

259
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,430
12! That means an all-out attack!

260
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,760
At what time?

261
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,600
Take out two torches.

262
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,630
Two have been unlit.

263
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,770
- In two days!
- Take out three more.

264
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,280
Three more have been unlit.

265
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:30,590
It means a full-frontal attack in two days in the fifth period!

266
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,150
Do you think Eunuch Bang got the signal?

267
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:50,550
He had to. That's the only way my plan will work.

268
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,540
To the right.

269
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,910
Do you have a brother named Seung Nyang in Goryeo?

270
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,040
I don't.

271
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,880
If it's really him, there were plenty of chances to tell me.

272
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,690
No way... Does he still resent me because of that King of Goryeo?

273
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,740
My Majesty, would you like more hot water?

274
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:34,700
Oh, M-My Majesty!

275
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,440
Is there no news of Seung Nyang from Goryeo?

276
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,070
I apologize.

277
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:49,810
Why is it so late? News should have come by now!

278
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:54,360
I think there's a problem. I will find out what ha—

279
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,540
Never mind!

280
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,620
The one who's thirsty should dig a well first.

281
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:08,490
Tell Yang to bring some refreshments. I'm going to ask her myself.

282
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,200
Why aren't you looking at me?

283
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,620
Do you not like being with me?

284
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:12,150
Servants do not dare to look.

285
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,800
Is that really the only reason?

286
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,460
Raise your head.

287
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,950
It's an order, raise your head.

288
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,330
That's enough. You can lower it.

289
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,040
Why am I getting so flustered?

290
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,390
If there's nothing else, I'll leave.

291
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,010
Yes, leave.

292
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:16,190
Your Majesty, why are you sending her away? You said you were going to question her.

293
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,190
It's not that easy.

294
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,540
Your Majesty, just one lowly servant—

295
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,000
What do you mean just one lowly servant? Don't you dare speak that way!

296
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

297
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:35,580
Maybe she's the Seung Nyang I'm searching for...

298
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:43,170
The way he looked at me wasn't normal.

299
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:50,690
Damn... If he's caught on, it'll create issues.

300
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,530
Yang!

301
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:59,360
Where did you go? The empress was looking for you.

302
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,960
Did you do something wrong?

303
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,700
Who knows?

304
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,980
Good job. Lady Park really loved your cakes.

305
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,340
But what about the letter you promised to give me?

306
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,350
When I'm certain Park has miscarried, I'll give it to you.

307
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,710
Don't be disappointed.

308
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,230
It'll happen earlier than we thought.

309
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,820
When the toxicity has built up, at the right time,

310
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,300
I'll give her a tonic that calms her morning sickness.

311
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,500
A tonic?

312
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:55,760
The toxicity is twice as strong when the gourd flower is combined with licorice.

313
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:02,620
Until then, you need to keep an eye on her...very, very, carefully.

314
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,420
I'll keep that in mind.

315
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,440
What is Seung Nyang and the empress doing?

316
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,690
Perhaps...

317
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,220
I saw a servant of the inner court leaving here.

318
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,460
Is she the one who's helping us?

319
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:48,400
Yes. She's very intelligent, so she's doing a great job.

320
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,230
But why... do you look so concerned?

321
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,770
Is there something wrong?

322
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,770
It's nothing.

323
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,650
Did you give her that powder?

324
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,170
Of course, I did.

325
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:18,050
I saw that wench eating it myself.

326
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,470
Seung Nyang wouldn't help us.

327
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,850
Oh my goodness!

328
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,030
Are you Yeon Hwa?

329
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,430
Yes, Sir.

330
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:41,240
I will be at the imperial library. Come meet me a little later.

331
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,850
Do you know who I am?

332
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,060
Of course.

333
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,590
You're the older brother of the empress.

334
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,090
What's your dream?

335
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,030
Becoming a maid-in-waiting and not being a servant anymore.

336
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,590
Your greed is lacking. You should want to become a court lady.

337
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,980
Is that... really possible for me?

338
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:29,780
It's up to you. You could be something even better than a court lady.

339
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,540
Just command me and I'll put my life on the line for you.

340
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,330
Make sure that wench Park eats that.

341
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,200
I finally have an opportunity.

342
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,620
What's so great about the wenches in high places?

343
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:21,360
I am holding my own fortune in my hands.

344
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,610
Why a mandoo soup? I guess when you're pregnant, you want a lot of different things.

345
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:35,750
If you're curious, meet a man and get pregnant yourself.

346
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,060
That's horrible!

347
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,240
Why would I want to lose my life?

348
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,570
That's horrible.

349
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,880
Yang, are you done with the laundry?

350
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,010
Yes, but what are those?

351
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:03,620
Oh, our precious lady wants mandoo soup today.

352
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,780
Should I help?

353
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,920
I would love it!

354
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,730
You're not supposed to be here.

355
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,560
Don't you know that other than the emperor, no other man can be in the inner court?

356
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,510
I just got lost while on my way to see the empress.

357
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:54,890
It's just a mistake. You're so inflexible.

358
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,090
Please have some before it gets cold.

359
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,980
I wanted it earlier, but I don't feel so well.

360
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,460
Please have some for the sake of your baby.

361
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:34,350
She's right. You should think of your baby and eat a lot.

362
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:53,690
Once you have the crown prince, not only your life, but everything will change for you.

363
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:57,080
Until then, you have to hang on.

364
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,310
Yes, Your Highness.

365
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,140
Yangyang.

366
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,620
Yangyang.

367
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,860
Do you need to go again?

368
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,650
I'll bring the chamber pot.

369
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,490
Are you emptying out the chamber pot again?

370
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,680
Yes, Sir.

371
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,810
Did she drink a lot of tea?

372
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:42,510
She doesn't drink tea at all since she became pregnant.

373
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,710
I heard that it's normal when you're pregnant.

374
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,230
For that to happen,

375
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:55,350
there's still two months left.

376
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:04,950
I saw General Tanqishi wandering around in the inner court earlier.

377
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,960
You never know, so keep a watch on her surroundings.

378
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,140
Yes, Sir.

379
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,210
Gourd flowers...

380
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,130
No way, Tanqishi...

381
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,500
The enemy is retreating.

382
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,980
Bring me my armor.

383
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,970
Great Tengri, since you've watched over all descendants of the Blue Wolves,
 (T/N: Tengri was the national god of the Göktürks, described as the "god of the Turks" (Türük Tängrisi))

384
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:14,810
I will be sure to take down Baghatur...
 (T/N: Tengri was the national god of the Göktürks, described as the "god of the Turks" (Türük Tängrisi))

385
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,830
...and seize the Silk Road.

386
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,280
Just watch and see, Bayan.

387
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,140
I will never lose the Silk Road to you.

388
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:32,330
If you go here, you will find—

389
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,120
There will be an all-out attack in the early morning.

390
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,400
But the ones at the peak aren't the main force.

391
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,940
They're just a bait to lure in the Turk soldiers.

392
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,970
Bayan is leading Yuan's main force.

393
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:12,710
He's planning to seize your camp once it's emptied out.

394
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:17,970
War is a fight to deceive your enemy.

395
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:21,220
Are you saying we should use the reverse of their tactic?

396
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,930
That's exactly it.

397
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,250
General, we can't stake everything on his word.

398
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,690
How can you hope for victory without putting everything at stake?

399
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:36,200
You must be cautious. We could get wiped out.

400
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,920
What time did you say the attack was?

401
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,050
It's in the next... fifth period.

402
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:47,710
If they don't get here by then?

403
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:51,540
If they don't...

404
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,390
I'll give up my life.

405
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,930
Elder!

406
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:02,530
Fine. Tell me more.

407
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:06,540
Sun Tzu said thus.
(T/N: Sun Tzu was a Chinese general, military strategist, writer and philosopher who lived in the Eastern Zhou period of ancient China.)

408
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,450
"Take them unaware and attack where they least expect."
(T/N: Sun Tzu was a Chinese general, military strategist, writer and philosopher who lived in the Eastern Zhou period of ancient China.)

409
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,560
Attack where they're unprepared

410
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,550
and attack when they're least expecting it.

411
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,220
Why isn't there any action when the fifth period has almost passed?

412
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,770
I know. I am certain of the torch signals, though.

413
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,450
So why did you say you would give up your life?!

414
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,930
I had to make them trust us!

415
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,880
It's nearly the end of the fifth period.

416
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,730
Kill them at daylight.

417
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,810
They're coming!

418
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,210
Attack!

419
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,540
Everything is turning out the way I said.

420
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,630
Soon, they'll be told to pull back.

421
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:54,590
When they retreat, Bayan's soldiers will show up.

422
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,120
Pull back!

423
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:17,900
Attack! Don't leave anyone alive!

424
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,650
Things are going according to our plan.

425
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,190
There are still a lot of soldiers left in their camp.

426
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:42,280
How are you going to open their gates alone?

427
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:02,940
Then... the secret plan that Toqto'a spoke of...

428
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,640
Get Baghatur!

429
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,180
General Baghatur is being chased!

430
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,160
Open the gates! Hurry!

431
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,060
Kill the enemy!

432
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:53,760
Kill them all! Every last one of them!

433
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:14,860
Your Highness, what's the meaning of this?

434
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,760
Please have some refreshments with us.

435
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,280
Enough with the refreshments. She has had bad morning sickness these days.

436
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:28,220
That sounds like you're blaming me for her bad morning sickness.

437
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,420
I'm just saying the morning sickness will go away once she's comfortable.

438
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,820
To me, before-birth education is more important than morning sickness.

439
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,660
Before-birth education?

440
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:45,840
The baby needs to hear the voice of the woman who is to be called "Mother" while in the womb.

441
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,760
Why aren't you eating?

442
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,840
Is it because you're not comfortable with me?

443
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,340
No.

444
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:14,880
Are you all right?

445
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,120
I'm fine.

446
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,370
You look pale. It seems like your morning sickness has become worse.

447
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:27,330
Stop with the refreshments from now on.

448
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,680
If the morning sickness is severe,

449
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,780
she just needs a tonic to calm it.

450
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,690
Head Eunuch, get the tonic ready.

451
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,990
Yes, Your Majesty

452
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,770
Then, I'll leave first.

453
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,530
Come to my quarters at the same time tomorrow.

454
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:54,810
Yes, Your Majesty

455
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:22,550
Once she takes the tonic, I'm going to spread a rumor that she falsified her pregnancy.

456
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,830
How dare she try and fool the emperor?

457
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,270
Isn't that a high treason that can wipe out generations to come?

458
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:39,600
Please don't get involved anymore. I'll take care of the rest.

459
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,810
Please do that, Older Brother.

460
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:56,660
Empress Dowager, you also won't be able to

461
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:00,890
avoid being charged for high treason either.

462
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:25,740
Give it to me. I'll take it.

463
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:31,500
Horrible wench. Trying to get credit all by herself.

464
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,510
It's all right, I'll take it.

465
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,520
I said I'll do it.

466
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,770
It's all right.

467
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,500
Then... you take it.

468
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:55,470
Go on. Everyone is waiting.

469
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,660
Here's the tonic.

470
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,220
Hurry and drink it.

471
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:01,370
I want to return to the inner court.

472
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,920
Do you not like it here?

473
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,380
I liked working in the inner court better.

474
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,950
If it's really Seung Nyang...

475
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,050
it means she doesn't like being with me.

476
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,300
Please become Seung Nyang

477
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,550
and help me.

478
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:32,140
It's not something I can do.

479
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:40,680
Seriously, what's wrong with these tasteless persimmons?

480
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,710
They were the best in Goryeo. But in any case,

481
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:49,530
it would be nice if that girl isn't really Seung Nyang.

482
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:53,010
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

483
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,200
Your Majesty!

484
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,840
Why all the fuss?

485
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,650
I have news of Seung Nyang.

486
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:04,330
Tell me! Where is that brat now?

487
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:07,260
He was taken to Yeongyeong with the deposed king.

488
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,520
Then he's with the deposed king?

489
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,620
That's not it.

490
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,880
What do you mean?

491
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,660
Just in case, I asked the tribute girls who came in recently.

492
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:22,990
And Yang used to be that boy Seung Nyang!

493
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:30,340
No! What? What do you mean?

494
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:35,760
Why would a boy pretend to be a girl?

495
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,200
While Seung Nyang was being taken,

496
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:42,480
she put her life on the line to save the deposed king.

497
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:49,410
After that, somehow, she turned into a girl.

498
00:55:54,950 --> 00:56:00,410
Your Majesty, according to the tribute girls, Wang Yoo favored Yang and—

499
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:02,470
Enough!

500
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,390
I don't want to hear anymore.

501
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:11,220
Should I call Yang over?

502
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:13,130
Your Majesty!

503
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:15,100
No need.

504
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:20,390
From now on, don't have any interest in that girl.

505
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,480
You were looking for her so desperately!

506
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,690
I said no need!

507
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,640
She pretended not to know me.

508
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:38,290
I will never ask for her first, ever again.

509
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,110
Your Majesty!

510
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,920
You will get sick. Please go slowly.

511
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,790
Head there first and find out where she is!

512
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:57,520
Hurry!

513
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,380
You...

514
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,680
Yang... you!

515
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,020
You!

516
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:57,730
♫ You are the love wind. You blow in ♫

517
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:04,550
♫ You spread through my heart ♫

518
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:07,000
♫ I love you. Although I still haven't said anything ♫
