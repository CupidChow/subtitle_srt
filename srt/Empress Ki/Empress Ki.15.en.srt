1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,510
Seung Nyang!

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,570
Seung Nyang!

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,200
Seung Nyang, it's me.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,180
Y-Your Majesty.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,990
Yang!

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,070
Seung Nyang!

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,720
It's strange. She was definitely here.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,550
Seung Nyang!

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,070
Yang!

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,320
How could you walk so quickly?

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,950
She was around here somewhere.

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,810
Yang walks as fast as you,

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,840
so she probably arrived at her quarters.

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,050
Your Majesty!

15
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,890
You're pretty.

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,390
Your Majesty,

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,720
what brings you here?

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,870
Your face is cold.

19
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,780
- I'm fine.
- Stay still.

20
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,910
Yang! Ya—

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,500
She's not here yet.

22
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,450
I'll look for her.

23
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,890
Never mind. She'll come if I keep waiting.

24
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,460
You may leave.

25
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,860
In this shabby room, you're going to wait for her?

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,570
Your Majesty!

27
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,600
But...

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,220
even if it's a room for a court lady,

29
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,190
it's too shabby for words.

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,100
Now, let's see.

31
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,420
Right.

32
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,040
I'll put a dressing stand for her right here

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,290
and get her a new bed, too.

34
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,730
Seung Nyang's handkerchief...

35
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,680
Seung Nyang.

36
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, Seung Nyang smells good, too.

37
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,720
The bloodletter exists?

38
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,700
It's a will written by

39
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,180
Emperor Mingzong in blood before he died.

40
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,870
Then the one who killed Emperor Mingzong is...

41
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,140
I'm sure it was Prime Minister El Temür.

42
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,520
That's the reason in Daecheongdo

43
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,520
he tried to kill the emperor.

44
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,280
With this, he will start

45
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,480
being suspicious of his closest associates.

46
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,210
I will keep encouraging that suspicion

47
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,600
and make him cut off his own limbs.

48
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,210
This is a dangerous place.

49
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,530
With one mistake, your life could...

50
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,430
When I was deposed

51
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,790
as a king,

52
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,030
I had already died.

53
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,610
Your Majesty!

54
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,120
I will make sure

55
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,140
I get restored to the throne as the King of Goryeo.

56
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,750
In order to do that,

57
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,360
I must eliminate Prime Minister El Temür.

58
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,980
I will help you also, Your Majesty.

59
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,790
Whatever it is, give me your command so that I may do it.

60
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,980
- There's nothing for you to do.
- Your Majesty!

61
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,760
Are you telling me to

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,660
push you into danger again?

63
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,650
If I can help you to restore your throne,

64
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,410
I don't care about...

65
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,330
my life.

66
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,530
Seung Nyang.

67
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,360
Do you... only see me as a court lady serving the Emperor of Yuan?

68
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,960
As before, I am still a subject of Goryeo

69
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,390
and your faithful servant.

70
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,670
So, please don't block my willingness.

71
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,960
Even if I get caught,

72
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,210
I will never let any harm come to you.

73
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,700
I thought wrong.

74
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,610
I shouldn't have come to see you.

75
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,260
Your Majesty.

76
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,420
It's an order.

77
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,340
Don't ever get involved in this matter.

78
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,700
It's Hae-si! (between 9:30-10:30 p.m.)

79
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,420
It's Hae-si!

80
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,580
I should get going.

81
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,950
Your Majesty.

82
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,170
It's done.

83
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,930
I'm sorry, Seung Nyang.

84
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,330
If you get in trouble,

85
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,620
neither me nor the emperor

86
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,350
can save you.

87
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,220
Seung Nyang,

88
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,610
lie down.

89
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,750
Your head is light as a feather.

90
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,210
Your arm pillow is

91
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,300
comfortable.

92
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,470
Is that so?

93
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,490
Now, how about you now

94
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,720
come into my arms then?

95
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,500
Hurry and come into my arms. Come on, Seung Nyang.

96
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,510
Here.

97
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,770
- Your Majesty.
- That's right.

98
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,970
This is the time.

99
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,130
What are you doing?

100
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,150
Oh... the bed was...

101
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:10,400
H-How dare y-you as a woman... Where have you been that you're c-coming back so late?

102
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,930
After coming here intoxicated and insulting me last time,

103
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,550
was it still not enough?

104
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,150
In-Intoxicated?

105
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,690
Wh- When did I do that?

106
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,610
- You don't remember?
- I can't remember anything.

107
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,280
Then ask Eunuch Baek,

108
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,590
about that day and what happened while you were drunk.

109
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,150
D-Did I m-make a lot of mistakes?

110
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,480
Please return to your quarters.

111
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,940
F-Fine. Well...

112
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,710
Fine, I'm g-going.

113
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,090
But, Seung Nyang, that day, what did I...

114
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,660
I-I-I'm going. I should go.

115
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,490
Then... sleep well.

116
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,390
Do you really not remember?

117
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,660
I told you I don't.

118
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,870
You ran into Yang's room intoxicated and...

119
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,440
You fool! You should have stopped me!

120
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,700
How could you just standby and watch?

121
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,350
You were so determined.

122
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,980
So?

123
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,230
Then... so...

124
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:44,530
did I perhaps... make a mistake towards Yang?

125
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,360
That I do not know.

126
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,690
I'm going to kill you!

127
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:02,900
Seriously... When Wang Yoo just stands there with his hands clasped behind his back, people remark how great he looks.

128
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,080
But I don't know why everything I do turns out this way.

129
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,830
What are you looking at?

130
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,420
I look great, too.

131
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,060
Yes.

132
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,860
I need to enrage El Temur enough to go after his servants.

133
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,770
If I was El Temur with infinite power,

134
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,350
what would I get enraged by the most?

135
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,850
It's been a long time, Steward Jang.

136
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,230
I heard you were invited by Empress Dowager.

137
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,010
Yes. I'm on my way there right now.

138
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,460
Have a nice time.

139
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,320
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

140
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,380
It's a petition.

141
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,180
Petition?

142
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,770
El Temur is said to be using the royal seal instead of the emperor.

143
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,880
The emperor is said to be illiterate.

144
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,650
If we use a petition well,

145
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,780
we might be able to pour oil on El Temur's rage.

146
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,350
But it won't be easy to get a petition delivered.

147
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,820
That... I'll take care of.

148
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,520
You know that I have connections.

149
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,400
It has to be someone trustworthy.

150
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,370
There's no need to worry, Your Majesty.

151
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,860
If there's anything I can help with, mark your face.

152
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,880
What do you mean, "mark?"

153
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,930
If I see a mark on your face,

154
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,550
I'll come here at this hour.

155
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,410
I understand, Seung Nyang.

156
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:49,120
His Majesty must not know that I'm helping.

157
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,670
If he knows, I'll be dead first.

158
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,100
I can't help it.

159
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,450
It's not something that can be done without Seung Nyang's help.

160
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,190
What? Empress Dowager is hosting a luncheon?

161
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:12,690
Yes, Your Majesty. She has invited the King of Goryeo and is having a luncheon with the emperor.

162
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,000
But I'm being excluded?

163
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,530
She blatantly disregards me.

164
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,100
Tell them to set a place for me, too.

165
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:33,220
Your Majesty, it's being called a luncheon, but it's just a little get-together.

166
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,860
But you weren't invited. Why would you—

167
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,820
Hurry up and tell them, I said!

168
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

169
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,200
She invited the King of Goryeo?

170
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,650
Wang Yoo.

171
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,740
May I pour you a drink?

172
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,720
How could I refuse Your Highness's offer?

173
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,550
I heard you were skilled in the military arts and I thought you would be rough,

174
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,400
but your artistry is also extraordinary.

175
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,880
Artistry goes with duty,

176
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,220
and duty is in line with honor.

177
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,190
So artistry and military arts are not so far apart.

178
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,400
That is very true.

179
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,650
An impudent's sword can't be courageous.

180
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,790
Nothing is more cowardly than artistry without learning, and

181
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,780
nothing is more dangerous than military arts without knowledge.

182
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,010
That's right. You've said it right.

183
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,120
Are you suggesting Wang Yoo lacks knowledge?

184
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:25,390
I heard the rumor that he is hot-tempered and a womanizer.

185
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,050
Wang Yoo is my invited guest.

186
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,070
Watch your mouth.

187
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,220
The empress is not wrong.

188
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:45,090
When I encounter an enemy on the battleground, I become brutal and when I see a beauty

189
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,280
at a drinking table, my breathing becomes faster.

190
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,680
How can he be so blatant...

191
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,580
That was a witty remark.

192
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:05,730
Enough. I've been reading poetry at bedtime lately.

193
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,270
You were?

194
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,080
Your Majesty, do you know how to read?

195
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:22,680
If I recite a verse, will you respond with another?

196
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,610
Please go ahead.

197
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,060
Jang An Seong Du Du Baek Oh.

198
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,430
Jang An Seong Du Du Baek Oh.

199
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:46,310
A white crow over the head of Jangan Palace.

200
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,110
Ya Bi Yeon Choo Moon Sang Ho.

201
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,420
It flies in during the night and cries over the Yeonchu Gates.

202
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,240
Ok Jeo Dal Gwan...

203
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,370
Ju... Ju...

204
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,790
Ah... that is...

205
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,130
I knew it until a moment ago.

206
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,600
Thanks for the great poetry.

207
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,020
What does it mean?

208
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,440
That... is...

209
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,600
Right. The crow...

210
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,330
The crow...

211
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,240
head turned white...

212
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,460
Right. At night it cries and then...

213
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,170
What comes after?

214
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:50,420
Seriously! Everyone here knows what it means except you!

215
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,580
You respond.

216
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,140
Guk Pa San Ha Jae, Seong Choon Cho Mok Shim.

217
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,080
The country is ruined but the river and mountain remain the same.

218
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,160
The trees in the palace in spring are covered in green.

219
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:19,060
Gam Si Hwa Cheon Roo, Han Byeol Jo Kyeong Shim.

220
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:26,710
Even the flowers cry, even the birds in the sky weep for our parting.

221
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,670
Bong Hwa Yeong Sam Wol, Ga Seo Jeo Man Geum

222
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:37,090
The signal fires of war burn for three months

223
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:42,580
and news of home can't be heard even by paying 10,000 nyang.

224
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,450
Baek Du So Gaeng Dan, Hon Yok Bul Seung Jam.

225
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:53,260
The white hair keeps getting shorter so I am unable to even wear a hairpin.

226
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,020
That poetry doesn't sound right.

227
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,010
You should work on reciting poems some more, Wang Yoo.

228
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,980
Why?

229
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,920
That was very fine.

230
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,790
You're very good at composing poems.

231
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,820
That was "Chungmang" by Dubo.

232
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,900
It's a poem worrying about the family and the country.

233
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,840
Seeing you are skillful in both literature and martial arts,

234
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,390
I understand why admiring women are lined up for you.

235
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,680
You are over complimenting me, Empress Dowager.

236
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,270
Dubo?

237
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,120
- Golta, let's go.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

238
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,840
Why aren't you apologizing to me?

239
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,170
There's no way you forgot about your rude behavior that night

240
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,250
already, did you?

241
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,940
For a scholar with literature, martial arts, and duty, where are your manners?

242
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:03,370
Is it Yuan's manners to lay a hand on a former king of a country?

243
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:07,890
I think your manners warrant you to apologize to me.

244
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,830
How could I have known that it was you that night?

245
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,850
I, too, never dreamed it was you.

246
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,840
It was a mistake that happened by chance, so I wish you not to talk about it anymore.

247
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,820
Why is he being so arrogant as only a deposed king?

248
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,120
He is so impertinent.

249
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,890
Can you put the petition in the imperial office?

250
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,520
I'll find a way.

251
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,670
El Temur is a determined person.

252
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,420
If that petition is found, not only the secret group,

253
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,340
but everyone who's been in and out of the office will be tortured. Then...

254
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,810
you won't be safe either.

255
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,010
I understand.

256
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,960
Not only you...

257
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,360
but remember that His Majesty's life will be on the line, too.

258
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,820
I'll keep that in mind.

259
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,890
Give me a signal as soon as the petition is completed.

260
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,900
We'll meet back--

261
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,050
A long tail is bound to be stepped on. You can't use the same method twice.

262
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,090
Then...

263
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,500
In this book, by tomorrow night...

264
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,380
I'll put it inside.

265
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,590
I understand.

266
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,800
Don't get too upset with the king.

267
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,840
He's only worried about you.

268
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,230
I understand.

269
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,470
Oh, I hope she does well.

270
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,860
Ah, I am so irritated I can't sleep.

271
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,000
Look at me.

272
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,880
Not you.

273
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,040
Look at me.

274
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,970
Should I read you a book?

275
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,910
What can't Wang Yoo do?

276
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,800
There's probably nothing that he can't do better than you.

277
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,440
W-What... What did you say?

278
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,970
How about a kickball game?

279
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:06,310
- Kickball?
- That's what you're best at.

280
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:12,400
Well, since I was little, I competed a lot,

281
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,050
so I'm actually pretty good at it.

282
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,260
Is Wang Yoo good at it?

283
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,710
I've never seen him play.

284
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,470
Really?

285
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,710
Not even once?

286
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,160
But... he'd probably be good at it.

287
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,220
Uh, how can he be good at something he hasn't done before?

288
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,220
Ask Wang Yoo to play.

289
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,530
While getting all the servants to attend,

290
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:43,270
if you win over him easily, they will all respect you.

291
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,950
You really are a good fellow if you don't nag.

292
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,030
Gather up the eunuchs. I am going to practice.

293
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,730
This late?

294
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,800
Let's go now.

295
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,080
Aren't you following me?

296
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,960
I told you not to lag more than three steps behind.

297
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,050
Congratulations!

298
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:07,110
No one is more skilled than you.

299
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,040
You're so fast that I can't see your feet.

300
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,490
You're amazing, Your Majesty.

301
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,750
My goodness...

302
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,220
How can you be guarding me when you all lack so much?

303
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,330
I'll be even rougher.

304
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,810
Try blocking me well.

305
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

306
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,340
You!

307
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,670
How dare you take his ball?

308
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,640
I'm sorry...

309
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,570
Kick it over here. Oh, never mind.

310
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:50,510
The ball is harder than it looks, so carry it over here.

311
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,260
Emperor Mingzong's lament was buried in the ground

312
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,220
as El Temur's laughter pierced the sky.

313
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,480
The day the emperor's letter written in blood is revealed,

314
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,000
Heaven and Earth shall fill with rage and the winds will fill with blood.

315
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,990
Jeom Bak, do you know how to read and write?

316
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,630
Not a word.

317
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,970
I think your writing will be good.

318
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,520
Just copy what's on here

319
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,230
in your writing.

320
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:41,050
Me? I have callouses from holding a sword,

321
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,590
but I've never even once held a brush!

322
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,590
That's why he's asking you to do it!

323
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,220
He's asking for you to draw it, not write it.

324
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,340
So... not to write

325
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,980
but to draw them? All right then.

326
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,260
Are you shaking?

327
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,380
Hold on!

328
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,010
I'm not shaking but the hand is. What's the matter with you!

329
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,950
Loosen up the wrist and do it slowly.

330
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,440
I understand.

331
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,340
There.

332
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,930
Do it well!

333
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,120
I know.

334
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,950
There. Loosen the wrist.

335
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,040
It's done.

336
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,700
This is good.

337
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,120
Did you find a way to get this inside the imperial office?

338
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

339
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:03,540
Eunuch Dok Nam who is also from Goryeo will help us.

340
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,210
I'm going to attack now,

341
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,080
so see if you can block me with your skills.

342
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,730
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

343
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Are you hurt?

344
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,890
You attack this time.

345
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,140
I won't go easy on you, just know that.

346
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,570
See? I blocked you, too.

347
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,650
That's how you play kickball.

348
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,280
Do you understand?

349
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,880
I won.

350
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,300
What?

351
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,110
I'm not playing anymore.

352
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,550
You!

353
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:07,420
Oh, tonight, I will take care of you, Sire.

354
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,110
Am I that pretty?

355
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,180
Your Majesty!

356
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,560
Your Majesty!

357
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,930
Where are you going, Your Majesty?

358
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,850
W-What is this?

359
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,940
I was waiting for you.

360
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,400
Why are you doing this?

361
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,130
Please embrace me, Your Majesty.

362
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,110
Lady Noh! Lady Noh!

363
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,030
Who is that woman?

364
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,770
She's a court lady who has gone insane.

365
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,160
My apologies, Your Majesty.

366
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,530
Lady Noh! Lady Noh!

367
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,060
Why is there an insane person living inside the palace?

368
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,400
Who are you?

369
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,970
The emperor protects me,

370
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,340
so no one can take it from me!

371
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,240
She's somewhere here. Find her.

372
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,920
Let go. Let go! Please let go of me!

373
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,800
Did a court lady come by here?

374
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,560
She was quiet for a while...

375
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,190
I was wrong! I was wrong! I was wrong!

376
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,970
Give me one more chance, please!

377
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,060
Give me one more chance...

378
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,040
Take her.

379
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,020
Please! Please, this is my room!

380
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,600
This is my room! My room!

381
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,360
Yes, yes! I understand.

382
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,890
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Where are you? Your Majesty!

383
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:39,060
Who is she, exactly?

384
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,680
She was favored by the late Emperor Mingzong

385
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,700
and became a court lady.

386
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:53,070
When the emperor died, she ended up like that from the shock.

387
00:34:54,530 --> 00:35:00,490
I felt sorry for her, so I put her deep inside the Inner court and looked after her,

388
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,880
but she's suddenly acting up again.

389
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,250
[Fabricated bloodletter]

390
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,050
What are you doing here?

391
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,910
That's none of your business.

392
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,410
Why are you reading this book?

393
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:23,730
The emperor asked me to read it to him to sleep.

394
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,660
I'll leave first.

395
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,050
Why are you doing this?

396
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,890
I'm a court lady of the Imperial Court.

397
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,930
Impudent wench.

398
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:47,300
You say that I killed your mother? Countless tribute women have died by my hands.

399
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,060
How do I know which arrow she got killed by?!

400
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:56,630
Don't be fooled. It's not that I can't kill you,

401
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,920
but that I won't.

402
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,110
One day, I also will kill you.

403
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,270
You two Geopsols

404
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,740
killed the head of your unit!

405
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,240
We didn't!

406
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,490
Please believe us!

407
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,070
You have two choices.

408
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:47,070
If you admit to killing him, you won't die in pain.

409
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,440
If you don't admit to it,

410
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,890
you will die after experiencing worse pain than death.

411
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,090
We don't know anything!

412
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,300
I don't think they did it.

413
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,210
Then we'll have to come up with a culprit.

414
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,610
If we don't find the culprit,

415
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,030
General Tanqishi said he'll kill us.

416
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,740
- Did you get their confession?
- They're refusing to talk.

417
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,220
Don't worry.

418
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,380
I'll torture them and soon—

419
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,340
Why are you breaking out in such a cold sweat?

420
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,080
I'm not sure. I'm getting chills, so I think I'm coming down with a cold.

421
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,570
Let me see your hand.

422
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,160
Do you have any other symptoms?

423
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,970
I think I ate something wrong. I've been having diarrhea since morning.

424
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,090
Let me see your tongue.

425
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:11,430
Uncle, I think he has caught the plague.

426
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,060
What? The plague?

427
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,310
This dirty bastard!

428
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,030
What do you mean the plague? There's no way!

429
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,730
Lock him up!

430
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,750
Aish, you should have been cleaner!

431
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,780
Hurry and lock him up!

432
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:33,060
I've never even set foot outside of the palace! How can I have the plague! That doesn't make sense! General!

433
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,900
General!

434
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,450
General!

435
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:41,100
It's strange. How did he get the plague when he has never even set foot outside the palace?

436
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,600
It's the dead body.

437
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,720
Dead body?

438
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,890
Captain of the Geopsol Unit?

439
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,790
I'm certain.

440
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,100
The one I threw down into the well in Goryeo Village...

441
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,310
He got infected with the plague from the body of the captain of the Geopsols.

442
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:06,660
General! General! There's no way, General.

443
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,990
General.

444
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,730
General.

445
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,020
In the next life,

446
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,060
even if you're born as a dog or a pig,

447
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,530
don't ever be born as a subject of Goryeo.

448
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,660
Chief, the people from before have returned.

449
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:45,890
Who? The king or whatever?

450
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,130
Why are you here again? Did you come to slap us while wanting to cry?

451
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,870
I want to help you.

452
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:05,160
With what? Give us a feast?

453
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,880
If not, since we don't have anything for the ancestral rite table,

454
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,590
will you give us some meat off your bones?

455
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:17,880
You're being too rude! His Majesty is here to give you money!

456
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,240
Money?

457
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,040
He's giving you the money that the emperor awarded him with!

458
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,310
I know very well that you resent me,

459
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,300
but those who are alive need to stay alive.

460
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:38,820
If you have eyes, take a good look at these people.

461
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,630
They were abandoned by their own country and living on in a foreign land because they can't die.

462
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:49,540
Do you think we'd welcome you over with a little bit of money?

463
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,400
We don't need it. So unless you want to get hurt,

464
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,760
leave right now!

465
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:02,610
These people are too rude! Do you know what this money represents?

466
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:08,890
After fighting in battle, he came back alive. It's the reward of his own life!

467
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,650
Your Majesty, there's no need to help these fools.

468
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,220
Stop it.

469
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:20,400
If you feel that strongly, I'll leave for today.

470
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,510
But it's too far to go back,

471
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,790
so let us walk through the village.

472
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:32,120
The plague is going around! Unless we want to die, why would we walk through the village?

473
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,840
In return for going through the village, we'll pay the access fee.

474
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:43,810
Every 10 steps, 10 nyang in gold. How about it?

475
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,900
Why? It's too little?

476
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,130
Then... 20 nyang?

477
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,530
Twenty?

478
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,320
Impossible!

479
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,220
I can't pay you any more than that.

480
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,230
[Forbidden]

481
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:16,100
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

482
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,760
Your Majesty, the money is...

483
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:18,110
We're all out of money and we haven't made it out of Goryeo Village. What should we do?

484
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:23,760
We're thirsty, so let us have some water at your place and talk a little.

485
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,290
Get the water from the well.

486
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,690
- Men.
- Yes, Sir!

487
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:35,660
Going out is on their tally sheet, so calculate well how many steps they take.

488
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,610
Yes, Sir.

489
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:43,010
- That horrible man!
- That man would squeeze blood out of fleas!

490
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,550
What's the matter with him?

491
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:05,070
My ear is itchy all of a sudden.

492
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,510
Come here and clean it for me.

493
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,510
Pardon?

494
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:18,980
Didn't you hear me? You want me to clean your ears instead?

495
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,710
Come here and clean my ears.

496
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:27,850
I... have never cleaned anyone's ears.

497
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:34,280
I see. I also have never cleaned my own ears.

498
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,100
Come here and do it.

499
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:42,730
Come on now! Hurry! Come here!

500
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:59,670
With this, do it carefully and well.

501
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,530
Hurry up!

502
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:19,560
That's it. That's good. Not bad for your first time.

503
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,440
That's right. Right there. That feels nice.

504
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,770
Your Majesty! Wang Yoo is here.

505
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:34,310
Don't stop.

506
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:38,230
Show him in!

507
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:58,480
Welcome, Wang Yoo. It'll be over soon, so just wait for a little.

508
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,920
Come on, do it properly. Ouch!

509
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,640
Seriously! It hurts!

510
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,070
I apologize.

511
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,360
You may leave.

512
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,560
What's the reason you wanted to see me?

513
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,670
How about a kickball match?

514
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:45,960
- Kickball?
- Kickball.

515
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,610
You and I... no, Yuan and Goryeo will compete against each other.

516
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:55,600
How about it? Do you want to play a round?

517
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,950
Why? You're not confident?

518
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,210
You can't compete without a bet.

519
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:12,420
A bet? As expected, you know how to play. All right.

520
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,990
What kind of bet would be good?

521
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:25,350
[Fabricated bloodletter]

522
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,920
All the petitions are gathered in the Ministry of the Secretariat.

523
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:35,810
The petitions will be checked individually,

524
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,920
and then put on the tray.

525
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:45,610
It'll pass through Daemyeong Palace and then down the hallway to the front of the Imperial Court.

526
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:49,820
It's then taken to the imperial office.

527
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,700
In order to switch the petitions,

528
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,400
it has to happen during that process...

529
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:10,990
The air is cold.

530
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,740
You want me to wash the floor with wet rags?

531
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:33,360
Yes. Clean it by wetting the rags with water.

532
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,230
In this weather, it'll freeze quickly. What if someone falls and gets hurt?

533
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:43,910
- Please do as I ask, Hong Dan.
- All right, it's not hard to do.

534
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,900
- Are you all right?
- Oh, my back.

535
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,440
Are you all right?

536
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,140
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

537
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,190
Why is it so slippery?

538
00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:00,180
I have a kickball game today, so I'd like to finish this quickly.

539
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:05,000
You're worried about a game while we're dealing with the country's future?

540
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,030
P-Please check the petitions.

541
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:17,240
Go on and play your game then.

542
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,090
M-May I do that?

543
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,790
T-Thank you, Prime Minister El Temür.

544
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:57,700
Wang Yoo is coming to play.

545
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:04,670
Why are they making such a fuss? And why all that makeup?

546
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:10,360
His Majesty is having a kickball game with Wang Yoo.

547
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,890
- Kickball?
- Would you like to go and watch, too?

548
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,100
Who cares about a ball game?

549
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:24,000
I'd rather read than go see that.

550
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:35,310
I'll be late at this rate. Those awful people

551
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:38,450
not telling me about the game.

552
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,970
Your Majesty...

553
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,940
Why are you getting made up?

554
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:02,230
I think I need to go and cheer on His Majesty.

555
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:07,140
Well, that is true, Your Majesty.

556
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:25,040
Squeeze my shoulders more.

557
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:49,870
I got word from Head Eunuch Dok Man that the petition was delivered to Prime Minister El Temür.

558
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:52,600
Good. Tell him, thank you.

559
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

560
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,200
If we lose, I will round up your wives and children.

561
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,340
Your Majesty, eunuchs don't have wives and children.

562
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,480
Ah, that's right! I know...

563
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,150
Anyway, my honor and dignity is riding on this match. Don't hold back.

564
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

565
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:33,180
Goryeo's honor is on the line. Don't ever lose.

566
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,180
Yes, Your Majesty!

567
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,370
What brings you here to watch kickball?

568
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:14,620
It's a match between Goryeo and Yuan. Of course, I need to be present and cheer our team on.

569
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:20,020
But... what are they wagering?

570
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:25,850
I'm not sure. It's probably... money.

571
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,860
There are no special rules as long as you don't use your hands.

572
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,380
Whichever team scores three times in the other's net wins.

573
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,270
Let's start.

574
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,860
Stop them!

575
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:40,950
Your Majesty, are you hurt?

576
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:43,790
I'm fine.

577
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:00,120
Emperor Mingzongs lament was buried in the ground

578
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,680
as El Temur's laughter pierced the sky.

579
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,370
The day the Emperor's letter written in blood is revealed, Heaven and Earth shall fill with rage

580
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:11,460
and the winds will fill with blood.

581
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:15,290
Who is it? Who did this?

582
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,810
Who dares to challenge me?

583
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,180
Who is it, exactly?

584
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,640
Get them!

585
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,740
Who could it be?

586
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:42,460
Who dares to insult me like this?

587
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:50,840
Who is it, exactly?

588
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:58,700
♫ Love is such a sad word to me that it's maddening ♫

589
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:06,260
♫Even if my heart aches some words much be endured ♫
