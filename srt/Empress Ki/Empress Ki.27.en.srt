1
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,100
Why aren't you drinking it?

2
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,700
You can't be doubting me?

3
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,350
Drink it.

4
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,590
Hurry up!

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,540
If you refuse to drink it,

6
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,870
even if I have to force open your mouth, I will—

7
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,960
Don't drink it.

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,530
What's in the Gwibitang that you're so desperate to have her drink it?

9
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,630
Do you not know what Gwibitang is?

10
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,080
What I'm saying is a Gwibitang that contains herbs and mung beans which prevent pregnancy

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,780
is a tonic I've never heard of.

12
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,720
The empress forcing imperial concubines to use birth prevention.

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,080
How do you plan on dealing with that humiliation?

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,850
What's important right now is the inner court carrying out a firm discipline.

15
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,920
I'm saying that it's not time to disrupt order by anyone and everyone becoming pregnant.

16
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,900
Empress, you're being too eccentric!

17
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,920
Whether by being eccentric or something else,

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,080
I will do what it takes to protect the Imperial Family.

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,960
What are you doing? Hurry up and drink it!

20
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,960
Don't drink it, I said!

21
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,730
Are you dismissing me?

22
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,130
Drinking this decoction would go against my duty

23
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,430
toward His Majesty's favor.

24
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,460
What did you say?

25
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,040
I may disobey your orders,

26
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,390
but I cannot commit disloyalty to His Majesty.

27
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,670
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

28
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,260
How dare the likes of you—

29
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,500
Lady Ki's judgment is correct.

30
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,030
Imperial concubines must never forget their duty under any circumstance.

31
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,860
Because of that tribute girl, we're all going to fall out of favor with the empress.

32
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,180
I know.

33
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,710
Acting like you're the only smart one!

34
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,240
Greetings, Your Majesty.

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,060
Sire!

37
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,780
What brings you here?

38
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,410
Sire!

39
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,230
Your Majesty.

40
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,310
It seems that His Majesty has regained a lot of his strength.

41
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,260
But... why do you look at me that way?

42
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,420
Do you think I'm jealous?

43
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,180
I'm not at all interested in who he highly values.

44
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,440
Are you all right?

45
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,200
I know about the decoction that the empress gave.

46
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,170
It's not physically harmful.

47
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,410
Did you drink it?

48
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,260
I did not.

49
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:57,820
From today on... could you call for me every night?

50
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,770
Every night you say?

51
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,130
Please have a table set with wine and snacks as well.

52
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,170
Wine, too?

53
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,870
Golta, did you hear that?

54
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,710
Yes, Your Majesty. I will get it prepared.

55
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,720
You're here.

56
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,760
What brings you here?

57
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,860
I missed the crown prince so much that

58
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,970
I came to your room without you present knowing it's discourteous.

59
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,400
He's very handsome.

60
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,030
His eyes are big like His Majesty,

61
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,740
and his lips are just like yours.

62
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,960
Is that so?

63
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,510
When you have an imperial prince,

64
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,210
what could you fear that you're preventing the imperial concubines from getting pregnant?

65
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,000
An imperial palace must overflow with sons to be greatly blessed.

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,030
Who would dare go up against Maha's authority?

67
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,950
When it's time, he will be installed as the crown prince.

68
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,180
And when it's time again, he's clearly going to become the emperor—

69
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,530
Among the reigning emperors of the preceding generations, do you know how many first sons succeeded the throne?

70
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,830
There have been many instances where the brothers shed blood over their right to the throne.

71
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:45,680
On top of that, many emperors have been dragged down from the imperial throne.

72
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,800
Power forms factions and factions always make the emperors die young.

73
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,680
I can't let my son become such an emperor as long as I live.

74
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,090
From early on, it was Emperor Kublai's wish that the eldest son succeeds the throne.

75
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:11,780
I also yield to his wish and believe the first son should succeed the throne.

76
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:19,260
Whom I fear the most is... you.

77
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,140
You put on a smile in front of someone

78
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,980
but strike them down with an iron club.

79
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,060
You're being too harsh.

80
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,430
I have a firm will.

81
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,800
Just know that I don't want to chitchat over this matter with you anymore.

82
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,980
I don't see the emperor in the baby's face.

83
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,670
Pardon?

84
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,230
Not only His Majesty, but his features are also nothing like his mother's.

85
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,660
We won't know for sure until he's older, but I'm certain I'm right.

86
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,700
But, Your Highness, there is no proof left at the Hwanggak temple.

87
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,440
Furthermore, the court ladies who were present during the birth—

88
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,490
Court Lady Seo and Court Lady Yeon would both bark like dogs if Empress ordered them to do so.

89
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,960
Even the fire that happened at the Hwanggak temple seems suspicious the more I think about it.

90
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:28,230
If... your intuition is right, this is a frightening matter.

91
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,060
It's only a firm belief right now.

92
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,790
We will need to slowly and meticulously get to the bottom of this.

93
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,450
I will bear that in mind, Your Highness.

94
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:45,670
Empress... just because it's not visible, it doesn't mean the claw isn't there.

95
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:52,520
A hidden claw... causes a deeper wound.

96
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,630
Greetings, My Lady.

97
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,730
And the books I requested?

98
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,050
Here's Baesumun that was written during the Liang Dynasty.

99
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,750
With 250 proverbs, it contains 1,000 characters.

100
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,650
Once His Majesty learns all those characters,

101
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:37,810
not only Great Learning, Doctrine of the Mean, Analects, Mencius, Classic of Poetry, Book of Documents, Book of Rites, Book of Changes, and Spring and Autumn Annals,

102
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,950
he will still need to read through The Four Books and Five Classics in order.

103
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,040
Do you think you can get all this done?

104
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,760
I survived many life-or-death crises to get here.

105
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,220
I doubt it'll be more painful than death.

106
00:09:54,130 --> 00:10:02,900
More than anything, no one must find out that he's learning to read.

107
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,170
I have something in mind.

108
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,750
Your Majesty,

109
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,620
Lady Ki is here.

110
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,040
Yang.

111
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,860
- What is this?
- You're going to study every night.

112
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,620
Study?

113
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,860
If you want to gain back your power as the emperor, you must first understand the Sangsomun.
(T/N:Written opinion, memorial)

114
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,940
First, you'll learn this Baeksumun first.

115
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,930
You must read and write all 1,000 characters inside.

116
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,950
A thousand? Then what about...

117
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,550
Why did you make me prepare a wine table?

118
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,110
Cheonjihyeonhwang.
 (T/N: sky and the earth are black and suppressing)

119
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,660
Cheonji...

120
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,510
Woojuhonghwang.
 (T/N: universe is wide and rugged)

121
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,300
(Hwang...)

122
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,110
Don't look this way.

123
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,010
Yes, My Lady.

124
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,190
- Eat up.
- Yes.

125
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,150
People will think that you're drinking and womanizing every night.

126
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,330
We must burn everything you've written right away.

127
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:12,360
We cannot leave a trace that you're studying.

128
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,170
Spies are everywhere.

129
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,960
You must never let your guard down.

130
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,600
Your Majesty.

131
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,290
He called for that wench tonight again with a wine table prepared?

132
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,400
Your Majesty, you drank too much.

133
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,950
So did you find out what fun he's having with her?

134
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,380
I heard music—

135
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,060
Music?

136
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,090
He's having a great time, isn't he?

137
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,580
Let's see how long he has fun.

138
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,160
I will be counting the days.

139
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,240
Your Majesty, please be calm.

140
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,160
Your Majesty, I'm someone

141
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,670
who has a lot of patience.

142
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,790
But once I explode,

143
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,300
I don't even know how I will change!

144
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,670
- Oh, Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

145
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,150
- Please stop.
- Let go!

146
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,520
Your Majesty! Stop her!

147
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,660
The emperor is addicted to drinking and womanizing?

148
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,830
That idiot!

149
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,440
Father, I think you drank too much.

150
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,680
Bayan, it's all thanks to you.

151
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,530
You sent in a great imperial concubine.

152
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,700
Thanks to you, my plan has been advanced.

153
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,970
- Take Father out.
- Yes, Brother.

154
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,330
He's still a man after all!

155
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,430
Father, let's get up now.

156
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,950
Let go.

157
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,200
Are you treating me like an old man?

158
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,600
I'm still fine.

159
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,490
He seems to be in a great mood.

160
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,050
Bayan,

161
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,420
why don't you take off that contemptible mask now?

162
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,520
From the moment you sent in Seung Nyang as a candidate for imperial concubine,

163
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,800
I no longer trusted you.

164
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,790
And if you don't trust me?

165
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,250
Should I tell you what your true intention is?

166
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,140
You want to control the emperor through Seung Nyang

167
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,150
and seize supreme power over this country.

168
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,150
Why?

169
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,610
Did I hit the target too easily?

170
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,480
There's something you're wrong about.

171
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,940
I am loyal to Prime Minister, not you.

172
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,390
Power?

173
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,840
I'm not royalty. It doesn't make sense for me to rule over the likes of you.

174
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,820
- What?
- Tanqishi.

175
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,660
Once Prime Minister dies, you'll be after his seat. The same goes for me. But...

176
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,480
do you know the difference between you and me?

177
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,240
Your power will fulfill only your selfish interests and desires, but my power will be

178
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,540
- used for the good of Yuan.
- Silence!

179
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,470
Stop being dependent on your father's halo

180
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,380
and step forward and fight me confidently.

181
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,970
That's how...

182
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,300
power is gained.

183
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:36,170
Bayan... let's see if you live out your years!

184
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,370
Don't come any closer than three steps.

185
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,220
When we're alone,

186
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,530
you must stay three steps away.

187
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,450
- How can you say that?
- Don't do anything to distract from your study.

188
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,490
Buchangbusu.
(T/N: wife follows her husband's lead)

189
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,620
Buchangbusu.

190
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,270
That's wrong.

191
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,930
Please just concentrate on your studies.

192
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,090
It...

193
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,460
makes me concentrate better when I do this.

194
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,140
Just watch.

195
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,640
Bu...

196
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,120
chang...

197
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,080
bu...

198
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,190
su.

199
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,500
I memorized it right away.

200
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,310
I can memorize new letters at once.

201
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,500
Whenever you grab my hand,

202
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,460
I'll double the number of letters you must learn.

203
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,610
I'm going to go to bed for the night.

204
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,760
- Please get up.
- I don't want to.

205
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,790
You didn't even learn 20 characters today.

206
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,420
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- Your Majesty.

207
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,910
If you're tired,

208
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,080
come here and sleep with me.

209
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,490
Move it!

210
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,060
Hurry up!

211
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,630
Who are those people?

212
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,520
Slaves who were sold but returned.

213
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,310
You over there!

214
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,920
What are you doing?

215
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,160
Take that mole with you tonight.

216
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,540
- Him?
- Yes.

217
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,520
We can't kill him so easily.

218
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,990
I'm going to make him

219
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,560
put a knife into his master's neck.

220
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,470
Deeply.

221
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,110
If I don't warn him he's caught in a trap,

222
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,600
he will die.

223
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,970
But... what is it you want to tell me?

224
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,870
I wanted to have a drink with you face to face.

225
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,600
Do you not want to?

226
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,840
Of course, I do.

227
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:41,160
Do you by chance... have a connection to Hawk House?

228
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,940
I want to do business with them.

229
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,150
If possible, please introduce me to them.

230
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,420
Hawk House

231
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,530
isn't one I'm familiar with.

232
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:02,480
But... no matter how much I look, being a merchant doesn't suit you.

233
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,530
You also don't look like a keeper of an inn for merchants.

234
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,750
You don't distrust me, do you?

235
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,990
I trust you as much as you trust me.

236
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,970
You trust me more than I thought.

237
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,010
I have something to do, so I'll get up.

238
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:30,150
I'll drink a bit more.

239
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,310
Suri.

240
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,390
Yes, Boss.

241
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,630
It looks like there's something I need you to do.

242
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,330
Just give me an order.

243
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,770
Find some gunpowder.

244
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,360
Yes, Boss.

245
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,110
What brings you here?

246
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,220
My boss sent over some wine.

247
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,040
Good job.

248
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,150
According to the letter Moo Song sent, tonight at Sul-si, (7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.)

249
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,590
the people who have the counterfeits will be coming over Suryong Hill.

250
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,450
Jeom Bak, you go there in advance and wait there with the men.

251
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,710
Yes, Your Majesty. I'll see you later.

252
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,460
What are you planning to do now?

253
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,470
We will gather as much counterfeit currency as possible,

254
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,950
just like how Hawk House did in Goryeo,

255
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,390
I will then take over the trade rights of Yuan the same way.

256
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,510
It's also a way to stop El Temur's source of funds.

257
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,460
Your Majesty, that's the signal from Eunuch Bang.

258
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,080
They have come over the hill.

259
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,810
Everyone put on your masks.

260
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,730
Yes, Sire.

261
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,730
We came the wrong way.

262
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,260
This is not the way to the mountain.

263
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,210
The destination has changed.

264
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,050
Then... where are we going?

265
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:03,200
I usually enjoy hunting at night.

266
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,400
Animals hide in the dark.

267
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,910
Why are you so nervous? Are you afraid of animals?

268
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,850
The hunt will begin soon.

269
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,460
They're coming.

270
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,130
Watch carefully,

271
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,960
how your master's head falls.

272
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:28,560
Hold. Don't shoot any arrows until they're in our view.

273
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,260
Just a little more.

274
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,640
Come a little closer.

275
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,250
That's it.

276
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,020
Just a bit more.

277
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,350
Stop.

278
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,060
What's that?

279
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,810
Kill them!

280
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,900
It's a trap.

281
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,370
Chase them!

282
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:51,540
♫ When the sun sets and the day ends ♫

283
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,860
Retreat!

284
00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:02,130
♫ You are heard, ceaselessly falling  ♫

285
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,930
Who was that! Who shot that arrow?

286
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:13,920
♫ Even if I wander and am lost ♫

287
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,940
You shot the arrow right at the target.

288
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:26,030
Wang Yoo, with this, I've paid back my debt for you saving my life.

289
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,400
We are enemies once again.

290
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,940
Why are all the magistrates suddenly here?

291
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:58,160
Can't you tell? Since the empress gave the imperial concubines contraceptives,

292
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,580
of course, they would be that angry.

293
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,130
Strange things are happening in the palace these days.

294
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,600
At times like this, we just need to prostrate ourselves and—

295
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,240
You scared me.

296
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,070
Jo Cham, this is that man. Right?

297
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,200
It-It's Park Bul Hwa.

298
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,820
You're going to wet yourself.

299
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,670
How are you here?

300
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:31,160
Thanks to you, I'm doing well living in the Imperial Palace and eating warm food.

301
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,530
What's going on?

302
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Where are your manners in front of Her Ladyship?

303
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,210
I remember very clearly...

304
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,450
the arrow you shot at me.

305
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:30,070
That arrow... changed my fate.

306
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,670
Listen carefully to what I'm telling you now.

307
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:40,380
Your fate, too... will be decided by me.

308
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,650
Even Park Bul Hwa is by her side now.

309
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,680
Things have become complicated.

310
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:07,700
Were you aware that Empress tried to prevent the imperial concubines from becoming pregnant?

311
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,120
Is that so?

312
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,480
It's disrespectful to not only the imperial family but to each of us!

313
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,900
I can see how you might feel that way.

314
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,800
Prime Minister, this isn't to be taken lightly.

315
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,100
What do you mean?

316
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,500
I'm taking this matter very seriously.

317
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,840
Then you must take action.

318
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,160
I should take action. Whether that's throwing out the imperial concubines

319
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,990
or getting rid of you men.

320
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,640
Prime Minister!

321
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Why did you send your daughters to be imperial concubines?

322
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,990
You were trying to gain power by establishing a connection to the emperor!

323
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:02,300
Incompetent men having power is a sin and disloyalty!

324
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,510
Do you really think

325
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,850
you can handle the weight of the supreme power of this country?

326
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,780
Your legs will shake and you'll end up collapsing hideously after ruining the country!

327
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,140
Even in death, I can't allow you to ruin this country.

328
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,000
Don't show partial loyalty

329
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,450
but do your utmost from the bottom of your heart for the good of this country!

330
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,480
If you understand, go back to your homes.

331
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,220
Show your true intentions through something that's happened at the palace

332
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,890
and will never be allowed again!

333
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,710
After the imperial concubines were selected, the magistrates' provocations are becoming more frequent!

334
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:07,450
Leave this to me. I will call in a magistrate one by one and force them to kneel!

335
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,770
Don't make this more complicated.

336
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,930
There's a way to get rid of all their delusions of grandeur at once!

337
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,460
Go to the emperor and tell him I want a private meeting tonight.

338
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,670
Yes, Father.

339
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,230
I have served...

340
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,360
nine emperors through the years.

341
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,200
Among them, some have died mysteriously

342
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,090
and several have died from an illness.

343
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:58,620
But only 30 years have passed.

344
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,340
In just 30 years, there have been

345
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,560
nine emperors seated on this throne.

346
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:12,060
There's loneliness at the top.

347
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,980
Another word for power is being all alone.

348
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,800
Right now, you're very lonely and pitiful.

349
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,280
So that's why you can't even speak.

350
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,030
Therefore, I will now

351
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:38,400
help you unload the

352
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,100
heavy weight from your shoulders.

353
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,000
Why not abdicate?

354
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,230
Thankfully, you have a son.

355
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:55,880
If you hand your authority over to the prince, the empress will have regency.

356
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:03,540
I would like you to live a very long life.

357
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,940
That cumbersome robe, which doesn't even fit you,

358
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,100
please take it off now.

359
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,560
If you act rashly,

360
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,450
there will be a blood bath in this palace once more.

361
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,300
When that happens, don't ask for my mercy.

362
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:37,000
Your duty is done.

363
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,590
Are you all right, Sire?

364
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:02,460
Prime Minister pulled out his sword sooner than I expected.

365
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,430
Today, I'm going to grade you on what we've learned so far.

366
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,220
I would like to take a break today from studying.

367
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,380
Write down what I say.

368
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,230
Cheonjihyeonhwang.

369
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,600
Your Majesty.

370
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,030
"Dark sky, golden earth," don't you remember?

371
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,600
I can't remember.

372
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,410
Woojuhonghwang.

373
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,570
Ilwonyeongcheuk.

374
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,330
Why can't you recall even one?

375
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,660
- Maybe I'm not made to study.
- You got them wrong on purpose.

376
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,140
Studying or whatnot...

377
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,020
I'll give it all up.

378
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,030
- Your Majesty!
- I've already made up my mind,

379
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,470
so please stop talking about revenge or—

380
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,870
Don't you know what I gave up to be here?

381
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,190
All right. What did you give up?

382
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,780
Are you trying to say Wang Yoo?

383
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,540
What's precious to me,

384
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,180
I lost all of it,

385
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,830
I threw it all away and came here.

386
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,020
I also...

387
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,470
I am also trying to throw it all away for you.

388
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:15,790
Revenge for my father, my identity as the emperor, for your sake,

389
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,490
- I'm trying to throw them away for your sake!
- Don't say it's for me.

390
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,710
It's for your sake.

391
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,860
I fear...

392
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,630
your death more than my own.

393
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,330
I want to give up everything

394
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:39,340
and live with you without any greed. With you, Yang.

395
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:45,240
Just eating together every day, sleeping together,

396
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,290
and being together like this...

397
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:55,070
Living alone with you... Couldn't we live like that?

398
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:00,230
I believed that you were the only one who could help me get revenge

399
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,130
for my deep resentment, but

400
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,400
it seems that I just had an idle dream.

401
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,530
I will never

402
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,180
come to see you again.

403
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,340
Since I'm useless to you, you'll throw me away?

404
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,500
Is that what you mean?

405
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,290
To you, am I really...

406
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:30,630
Am I really merely just a tool for your revenge?!

407
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,040
Do you not like it?

408
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,840
You mean...

409
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,970
nothing to me anymore.

410
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,270
I mean nothing?

411
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,740
You're like the walls in this palace.

412
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,630
No, you're even less than that.

413
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,750
No matter who she is, she cannot disrespect him like that.

414
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,320
She's not wrong in anything she says.

415
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,510
- What?
- I will say this to you, too.

416
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:12,990
I may only be a eunuch, but I know how to serve my master.

417
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:18,170
If you truly care about His Majesty, you must be honest even if it hurts him.

418
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,430
I guess you wish for death.

419
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,900
You came to me as a mere shell

420
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,020
without your heart.

421
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,800
Even if you don't help me,

422
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,800
I won't stop my revenge.

423
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,050
Stop.

424
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,990
If you leave like this,

425
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,960
I won't ask for you again.

426
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,060
Then don't ask for me.

427
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:09,070
♫ Disappearing like something blowing and caught in my hand ♫

428
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:19,860
♫ At night when I clutched my chest and held my breath ♫

429
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:29,590
♫ In the darkness my day passed in sadness ♫

430
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:32,190
♫ No matter how I try and try to conceal them ♫

431
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,750
Go.

432
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,780
I won't look for you again.

433
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,650
Never.

434
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,010
♫ What can I do about the longing  ♫

435
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,320
What is it about at this late hour?

436
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,270
How I should teach His Majesty...

437
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,220
I've lost my way.

438
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,510
I wanted your advice, so I asked to see you.

439
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,850
You don't need my advice.

440
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:19,930
You have the answer.

441
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,830
The one teaching is more impatient than the one who's learning.

442
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,030
The fight is already leaning to one side.

443
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,330
You're saying it's my fault.

444
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:37,370
That's all the advice I have for you.

445
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,510
It seems like he wouldn't even bleed even if stabbed.

446
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:58,310
He gave me a big lesson.

447
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,250
The one who's thirsty digs the well.

448
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,830
Your Majesty, you should go to bed now.

449
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:21,810
I heard that Emperor asked for Ki again tonight.

450
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

451
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,930
Do you know how many days it's been?

452
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:31,150
I think about... 10 days.

453
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:36,000
It's been exactly... 15 days.

454
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,710
Were you counting?

455
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:44,880
Do you know how the servants look at me in this palace?

456
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,290
It's with pity.

457
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:55,200
The empress of this country

458
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,700
is being pitied. Does that make sense?

459
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:04,410
It's my fault for teaching them wrong, Your Majesty.

460
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,460
It's not your fault,

461
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:14,880
but the fault of the emperor who has no backbone and that wicked wench.

462
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,780
Your Majesty.

463
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,220
I've been patient long enough.

464
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:28,360
I will teach her a lesson tomorrow,

465
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,490
so prepare for it.

466
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,210
I understand, Your Majesty.

467
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,910
Your Majesty,

468
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,840
what the result of ignoring me is,

469
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,110
watch very closely.

470
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:59,990
There's no way Moo Song would have sent false info.

471
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,030
And who was it that helped us?

472
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,720
I can't tell what's going on.

473
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,600
Have you heard anything about Moo Song?

474
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,530
Eunuch Bang went to find out, so he'll bring back some news.

475
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,070
Please do not worry, Your Majesty.

476
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,230
Hurry up!

477
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,540
Please spare us.

478
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,490
My Lord, let me have some food.

479
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:33,600
I'm-I'm going to die of hunger.

480
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,820
What is this bum doing?

481
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,900
Get lost.

482
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,560
My Lord.

483
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,130
I've not had food for... one, two, three, four...

484
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:49,630
It's been four days since any food.

485
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:53,210
You have the face of someone who'll live as a slave all your life.

486
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,330
Please.

487
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:58,200
Really, there are all sorts of people.

488
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,940
Seriously. Push him aside!

489
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,890
My Lord!

490
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:04,450
Let's go!

491
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,960
Jeok Ho is there.

492
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:34,210
Chief. Chief!

493
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,710
What? You are—

494
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,100
It's Bang Shin Woo.

495
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,700
You're worse off than me.

496
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,030
You've become a beggar since the last time I saw you.

497
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:59,090
Never mind me. How did you become a slave?

498
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:07,350
I was sold off to a rich madam,

499
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,660
but when she found out I was a eunuch, she returned me.

500
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,950
- Why you...
- Of course, she'd return you. You are a eunuch.

501
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,510
Anyway, I'm looking for someone.

502
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,130
You haven't met Seung Nyang yet?

503
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,620
Seung Nyang?

504
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:32,280
You didn't come looking for her?

505
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,030
Is Seung Nyang...

506
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,570
alive or something?

507
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,550
Yes.

508
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,160
Your Majesty...

509
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,140
Why are you so late?

510
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,870
I was so worried that I was on my way to find you.

511
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,890
Moo Song... What happened to Moo Song?

512
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:06,750
I don't have any news on him yet.

513
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:11,570
I found out something else.

514
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,960
Something else?

515
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,710
Your Majesty...

516
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,360
What's the matter?

517
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,570
Seung Nyang is...

518
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,760
Seung Nyang is... alive!

519
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:30,520
What? What are you talking about?

520
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,410
She didn't die. She's alive!

521
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:41,830
Who said that?

522
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,390
I met the chief of Goryeo Village.

523
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:48,040
She was taken as a slave alongside him.

524
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,220
Where...

525
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,390
Where did he say she is right now?

526
00:47:54,390 --> 00:48:00,540
According to him, Bayan bought Seung Nyang and saved her.

527
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:06,000
Then... when Bayan comes back, we can see Seung Nyang!

528
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,570
Seung Nyang...

529
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,990
My Lady, you need to go to the hall.

530
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,370
It's not the time for that yet.

531
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,770
The empress changed the time,

532
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,190
but the wicked servants didn't tell us.

533
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,690
Those dreadful wenches!

534
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,590
Please forgive me for being late.

535
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:31,900
Didn't you hear about the lesson going on today?

536
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,400
Forgive me, Your Majesty. The servants didn't tell me, so—

537
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,780
Just because you have a mouth, you're making an excuse again?

538
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,280
Let's see how great you are that

539
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,340
you're dismissing this lesson.

540
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,440
Recite the Naehun.
(T/N: Instructions for women)

541
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,760
If you get one word wrong, you will be severely punished.

542
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,120
Go ahead.

543
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,920
Jaeilsoojeol, Jaeicheongjeong.

544
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,590
Faithful and chaste,

545
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:08,500
pure and obedient.

546
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,300
First and foremost, a woman must remain faithful.

547
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,550
Second, she must be pure and obedient.

548
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:23,610
If there is a visitor, she must not set foot in the yard.

549
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:29,340
If there are guests in the house, she must speak quietly.

550
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,130
She wasn't taught that yet.

551
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:40,830
Being discreet, reserved, a lamp must be held at twilight,

552
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,060
and in the dark—

553
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,880
That's enough. Stop being full of yourself.

554
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,140
When did you memorize it?

555
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,280
I memorized it at night.

556
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,860
At night?

557
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:56,570
When you receive His Majesty's favor every night,

558
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:00,280
I guess you have time to study.

559
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,000
If you didn't know the doctrine, I was going to forgive your tardiness,

560
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,910
but since you knew it and you were late, your offense is even bigger.

561
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:13,750
- Your Majesty--
- It means you think nothing of the education!

562
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:17,090
- Head Eunuch Dok Man.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

563
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:21,400
Strip this wench down to her undergarments and lock her up in the library.

564
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,240
Have a Kheshig stand guard.

565
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:30,710
While inside, copy the Naehun doctrine out 100 times in 100 books.

566
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:35,240
Until you're done, you can't come outside.

567
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,620
And you won't be given any food or water.

568
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,480
Got it?

569
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:49,670
Either starve inside or come out after you're done.

570
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:59,270
What are you doing? Lock her up in the library.

571
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,560
You'll soon find out how bitter

572
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,140
receiving His Majesty's favor is.

573
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:52,600
Copying out doctrines has been used as a form of punishment often,

574
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:58,390
but also preventing food and water... this is the first time.

575
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:03,990
Don't worry about me. You can leave.

576
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,640
I won't lose.

577
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,740
Danashiri.

578
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,750
I will not bend to the likes of you.

579
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:40,200
Welcome, Court Lady Yeon.

580
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,410
Did you bring ink?

581
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:44,400
No one gave her food and water?

582
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,180
For three days, I stopped even the ants from approaching the room. Don't worry.

583
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,320
But not even letting her drink water... What if she dies?

584
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,170
If she's thirsty, she'll drink the ink instead.

585
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,210
Take it inside.

586
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:12,070
What if she dies like that?

587
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:16,210
I can't watch it any longer. I should just kill him first!

588
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,400
Don't do anything.

589
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,760
Do you want to bring her more harm?

590
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,820
No one can help her.

591
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:34,290
She will have to hold on and fight and come out on her own.

592
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,910
This time, you'll be able to

593
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:46,010
crush that arrogance of hers!

594
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,160
Do you think all I'm doing is trying to crush her mere arrogance?

595
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:54,120
If she doesn't write out 100 books,

596
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,100
I'm going to let her die inside.

597
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:02,880
I'm going to get rid of her once and for all.

598
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:09,320
There will soon be another ghost in the library.

599
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,880
Of course.

600
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:20,030
Horrible and cold-hearted...

601
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:23,360
When I'm trying to throw it all away for her...

602
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:27,730
Why doesn't she understand?

603
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,450
Your Majesty!

604
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:35,080
I just got word from Head Eunuch Dok Man and Lady Ki—

605
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,270
I told you not to speak about Yang.

606
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,610
Your Majesty.

607
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:42,510
Did she say she misses me?

608
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,540
It's not that.

609
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,970
She's locked up in the library right now.

610
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,270
Locked up in the library?

611
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:52,370
It's been three days already.

612
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:57,670
She hasn't had any water for three days. She is being severely punished by the Empress.

613
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,440
Your Majesty!

614
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,040
Greetings, Your Majesty.

615
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,630
- Greetings, Your Majesty!
- Greetings, Your Majesty!

616
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:13,020
Your Majesty, forgive me, but the empress has ordered that no one...

617
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:17,040
Forgive me, Sire.

618
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,640
If he could speak and told me to kill you,

619
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,540
you would have lost your head.

620
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,020
Yangyang. Yangyang!

621
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:02,480
♫ Carried on the wind, you are heard ♫

622
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:10,420
♫ Ceaselessly falling Drip Drip Drip ♫

623
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:14,600
♫ In the sound of the rain ♫
