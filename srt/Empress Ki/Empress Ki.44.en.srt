1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,880
They conspired against our kingdom!

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,470
Kill Wang Yoo's spy Chief Imperial Consort Ki, too!

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,950
They're all on the same team! Kill them!

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,380
Kill Chief Imperial Consort Ki!

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,720
Kill Chief Imperial Consort Ki! Kill her!

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,660
Kill her!

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,140
Kill Chief Imperial Consort Ki?

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,480
That is what the people are saying? Why?

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,730
They believe that Chief Imperial Consort Ki and Wang Yoo are working together.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,550
No.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,890
No, that cannot be true.

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,520
But Your Majesty, the public sentiment is worrisome.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,330
There are people who are controlling public sentiment from behind the scenes.

14
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,950
Empress Dowager and Prime Minister. Now we know

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,260
what they are really after.

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,140
So you mean that they are after you?

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,320
It is certain.

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,020
If I fall into danger,

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,430
who will stand with me?

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,380
Taesa, Taebo, Taebu. The Three Excellencies.

21
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,000
The Minister of Culture, The Minister of Literature, The Minister of the Military.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,710
The commander and generals of the military.

23
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:27,130
Some of the other magistrates and lower officials.

24
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,990
It's possible that

25
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,110
the power I'd been accumulating all this time,

26
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,390
may need to be revealed.

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,470
But Your Highness.

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,900
I know it's not a good time right now, but

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,900
they've shown their claws.

30
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,150
So I can't stand by and do nothing.

31
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,010
- I think I will have to draw my sword.
- What do you mean?

32
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,880
Chief Imperial Consort is in danger.

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,720
So, then...

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,870
To save her, the moment Wang Yoo arrives,

35
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,890
I must kill him.

36
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,600
I will make sure the King of Goryeo lives.

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,460
That is...

38
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,970
how I can survive and protect my Ayu.

39
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,770
Your Highness, the King of Goryeo has arrived.

40
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,720
You trampled on my grand dream.

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,730
It is such a huge crime that dethronement will not be enough to wash it away.

42
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,620
So,

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,070
I cannot let you live.

44
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,240
Please kill us first.

45
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,920
Move out of the way.

46
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,140
Sure, I'll kill all of you, then.

47
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,040
Your Majesty, you must not kill Wang Yoo yet.

48
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,230
Don't interfere.

49
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,050
Your Majesty!

50
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,990
I told you to not interfere.

51
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,650
Please stop, Emperor.

52
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,250
Toqto'a is correct, you must not kill Wang Yoo yet.

53
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,450
- Empress Dowager.
- The King of Goryeo definitely did not do this alone.

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,660
You must find his accomplice and punish them together.

55
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,140
When you speak of that accomplice, are you talking about me?

56
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,960
- Chief Imperial Consort...
- Don't resent me. It's not me, it's what the people think.

57
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,980
Your Majesty, since I have been suspected,

58
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,550
I request that you not decide on King of Goryeo's punishment until you learn the whole truth.

59
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,060
Your Majesty.

60
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,860
I told you to not interfere.

61
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,170
Why don't you ever listen to me?

62
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,770
Wang Yoo is innocent.

63
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,800
- He's innocent?
- I know that because I am innocent as well.

64
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,590
Someone is trying to corner me and Wang Yoo—

65
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,400
Chief Imperial Consort!

66
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,230
Do not...

67
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,870
defend Wang Yoo in front of me.

68
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,310
Then,

69
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,580
who will resolve the unfairness against me?

70
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,490
That unfairness,

71
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,780
why do you think it happened?

72
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,350
What do you mean?

73
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,530
You and Wang Yoo...

74
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,260
being spoken about in the same breath, I cannot stand it.

75
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,020
Your Majesty.

76
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,840
Are you doubting me?

77
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,020
I will solve this problem myself.

78
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,270
So be informed.

79
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,060
Don't go.

80
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,690
Yang! Don't go, Yang!

81
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,360
Yang!
- Your Majesty.

82
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,710
Bring me wine.

83
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,010
You said you wouldn't drink anymore.

84
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,730
Just bring it already!

85
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,540
Wang Yoo is safe.

87
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,000
Do you have a plan to save him?

88
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,530
There will be something I will ask you to do,

89
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,040
so wait for me to contact you.

90
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:11,050
Please promise me one thing. You must stop drinking wine.

91
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,750
Take the wine away.

92
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,370
Your Majesty.

93
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,060
Yang...

94
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,020
Yang.

95
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,130
Prime Minister, Our Majesty really doesn't know anything about this.

96
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,360
Shut up.

97
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,370
I will make it short. Who is your accomplice?

98
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,660
First, bring me evidence that I sold sulfur and saltpeter to an enemy state.

99
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,990
We blocked all trade routes to Goryeo on both sea and land.

100
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,900
Even if a merchant association in Yuan assisted you—

101
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,170
You couldn't have done it unless someone loaned you a great deal of money.

102
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,010
So speak. Who helped you?

103
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,260
I didn't even do it. So who would be my accomplice?

104
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:17,490
Wang Yoo, you've caused my pride as a warrior to shatter to pieces.

105
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,560
So don't test my patience.

106
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,240
Jadan, I will kill him now. Be prepared.

107
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,690
Yes, Prime Minister.

108
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,330
Prime Minister.

109
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,070
I want to speak to Wang Yoo alone. Please excuse us for a moment.

110
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,010
Prime Minister's war of conquest was never a sure thing.

111
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,490
Even if you hadn't aided our enemy,

112
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,000
victory was not guaranteed. That is my judgment.

113
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,960
You are the king of a nation.

114
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,430
What wouldn't you do if your nation could benefit?

115
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,410
I understand how you feel.

116
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,580
So what is it that you want to say?

117
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,010
I can forgive you, but I cannot forgive the person who helped you.

118
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,940
If you help us, I will help you avoid dethronement.

119
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,640
So the help you want from me is... ?

120
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,000
Please say that Chief Imperial Consort Ki was your accomplice.

121
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,220
I will make her take responsibility for all of it.

122
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,590
That is the only way you can survive and keep your throne.

123
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,730
What reason can you have to protect Chief Imperial Consort Ki?

124
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,610
So take my hand.

125
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,900
I am offering to negotiate with you, Wang Yoo.

126
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,410
It's not a negotiation,

127
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,450
it's a trick.

128
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,540
I think you've misjudged me.

129
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,890
I will pretend I didn't hear what you said.

130
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,000
People are all the same.

131
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,110
There is no one who isn't afraid when facing death.

132
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,160
My offer may not seem tempting to you now,

133
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,010
but you will change your mind.

134
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,480
So I will wait, Wang Yoo.

135
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,200
Your Majesty, this is a trap, just as you suspected.

136
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,050
Fortunately, they don't seem to have any concrete proof.

137
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,460
As you already know, Empress Dowager and Prime Minister

138
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,620
are trying to cast me out of the palace.

139
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,260
So I will have to ask you to assert yourselves.

140
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,520
Your Highness,

141
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,570
we've discussed this matter

142
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,190
and we cannot help you this time, Your Highness.

143
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,260
What do you mean?

144
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,840
By protecting the King of Goryeo, we may all fall into danger.

145
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,670
It would be easier for you to abandon the King of Goryeo—

146
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,180
Abandoning the King of Goryeo

147
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,130
is the same as abandoning me.

148
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,240
So are you going to betray me?

149
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,080
Your Highness, it's not like that.

150
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:07,200
Let me tell you a big secret in this palace.

151
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,890
A secret?

152
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,350
Prince Maha who is being coddled by Empress Dowager right now,

153
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,840
he is not the emperor's son.

154
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,700
What?

155
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,130
Danashiri brought him from outside the palace.

156
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,830
The evidence and witness proving that are all in my hands.

157
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,940
Everyone here has earned a large amount of money, thanks to me.

158
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,140
Some of you have also received high ranks as well.

159
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:45,580
Why do you think I did things that would benefit you?

160
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,780
So when my son Ayushiridara becomes the emperor,

161
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,490
I wanted him to have all your unchanging loyalty.

162
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,360
I need that power now.

163
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,830
I am not asking for your help. I am saying that you must help me.

164
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,850
Those who still don't understand what I mean,

165
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,720
please step forward.

166
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,800
I will send you to your home.

167
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,890
So what we must do,

168
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,940
please command us, Your Highness.

169
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,930
Your Majesty!

170
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,970
Tell us who you colluded with.

171
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,240
I have nothing more I can say.

172
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,800
Put another stone slab on him.

173
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,000
Please interrogate us instead!

174
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,200
Your Majesty hasn't done anything wrong!

175
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,940
One more stone slab, and you will lose the use of your legs forever.

176
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,930
He isn't someone who will give in easily.

177
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:35,530
Everyone watch clearly. Your king's eyes, tongue,

178
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,880
and ears will all be blocked.

179
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,430
So tell us before it happens. Who is your accomplice?

180
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,210
What do you want us to say?

181
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,790
Tell us!

182
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,660
Whose name do you want us to say?

183
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,590
Chief Imperial Consort Ki!

184
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,480
If its for your king's sake, you tell us that Chief Imperial Consort is the accomplice,

185
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,290
your king will be safe.

186
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,790
You must not ever say that.

187
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,070
Your Majesty...

188
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,000
Your Majesty.

189
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,370
It can't be helped.

190
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,810
I have no choice but to cut his tongue off and make him blind and deaf.

191
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,560
As a warrior, aren't you ashamed?

192
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,790
You created a fake ledger. Now you will create a fake confession, too?

193
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,260
For His Majesty! For this kingdom!

194
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,820
I am not ashamed of anything.

195
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,610
So watch clearly.

196
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,180
Your Majesty! No!

197
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,350
You must not!

198
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:58,750
Prime Minister, there's a big disaster. Please go to the Great Hall.

199
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,100
A disaster?

200
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,070
Your Majesty, the ledger that was sent from Goryeo is fake.

201
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,850
Please acquit and discharge Wang Yoo.

202
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,930
Please acquit and discharge Wang Yoo.

203
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,760
Please free him, Your Majesty!

204
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,530
Please free him, Your Majesty!

205
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,870
Please free him, Your Majesty!

206
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,170
What do you think you're doing?

207
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,120
Your Majesty, Kim Soon Jo, the Minister of Political Affairs,

208
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,900
sent a secret letter saying that he created a fake ledger.

209
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,470
Why would Kim Soon Jo send such a letter?

210
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,470
The reason...

211
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,040
please ask Kim Soon Jo himself.

212
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,150
The one who can reveal the truth,

213
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,230
there is no one but Kim Soon Jo.

214
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:13,140
Please command for him to be summoned immediately.

215
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,960
Please summon Kim Soon Jo, Your Majesty.

216
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,130
Please summon Kim Soon Jo, Your Majesty!

217
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,080
Please summon him, Your Majesty!

218
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,160
Please send someone to Goryeo immediately and bring Kim Soon Jo.

219
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

220
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:44,190
Until Kim Soon Jo arrives, Wang Yoo and his men will be tied up.

221
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,790
Without my command, they will not eat a single kernel of rice or a drop of water.

222
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,900
Your Majesty!

223
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,900
This is the most mercy I can show them, as I am at the limits of my patience.

224
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,500
So shut your mouth now.

225
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,700
Not only the Three Excellencies, but key posts of all the main factions are all on Chief Imperial Consort's side?

226
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,500
How can such an astonishing thing be true?

227
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,260
It's not just the vassals of the Imperial Court.

228
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,930
The key posts of the military have also submitted a petition requesting the acquittal of Wang Yoo.

229
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,950
Imagine that Chief Imperial Consort had this much influence.

230
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,470
Did you expect this?

231
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,260
This is the first I'm hearing of it.

232
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,630
What will you do with Kim Soon Jo?

233
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,680
Kim Soon Jo is on my side.

234
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,170
Chief Imperial Consort got the Yuan Imperial Court and the military on her side.

235
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,860
It wouldn't have been hard for her to get a Goryeo person on her side.

236
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,680
Seeing how confident Chief Imperial Consort appears,

237
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,410
Kim Soon Jo may have already betrayed you, Prime Minister.

238
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,070
Then maybe it will be best to silence him.

239
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,770
Send Mujin and Jadan and make Kim Soon Jo disappear.

240
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,360
I understand, Uncle.

241
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,750
Chief Imperial Consort becomes scarier, the more I think about it.

242
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,540
If we leave her alone,

243
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,870
she is more than capable of devouring our great kingdom, Prime Minister.

244
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,350
Please tell me honestly. How did you influence all the vassals, great and small?

245
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,810
I provided them with funds for their political activities.

246
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,960
Where did you get the money?

247
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,450
Wang Yoo...

248
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,460
sent me the money.

249
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,200
- What?
- I used that money for Ayu's sake

250
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,120
to establish political influence.

251
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,670
I am the one who invests the crown prince.

252
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:50,460
I was afraid our son would be scorned because he has Goryeo blood.

253
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,050
Just as you waged a war of conquest so that you can be a father Ayu could be proud of

254
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:02,640
from those who are looking for a reason to attack Ayu,

255
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,090
I had to protect our son.

256
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,900
My heart...

257
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,800
My desperate love for my child...

258
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,320
Please understand it, Your Majesty.

259
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,920
Get out.

260
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,330
I told you to get out.

261
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,980
Your Majesty.

262
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,440
You...

263
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,040
did not trust me.

264
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,550
So get out now.

265
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,970
Is Golta outside?

266
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,800
Bring me some wine.

267
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

268
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,530
Seeing His Majesty this angry towards you,

269
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,960
this is the first time I've seen that.

270
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,960
Your Highness?

271
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,080
I am worried that you may lose his favor.

272
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,110
If we leave them like this, they will die before Kim Soon Jo arrives.

273
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,690
Speak with the gatekeeper and ask him to give them food and water.

274
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,640
Yes, Your Highness.

275
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,300
I have to meet with Yeon Bisoo.

276
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,680
I will send her a message.

277
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,410
In order to save Wang Yoo,

278
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,440
you must make sure to bring Kim Soon Jo here alive.

279
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,660
There is no reason for him to cooperate with us.

280
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,420
If you do what I say,

281
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,610
it's not impossible.

282
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:59,740
This is Minister of Political Affairs, Kim Soon Jo.

283
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,430
Make way. This is Minister of Political Affairs, Kim Soon Jo.

284
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:10,010
Make way. This is Minister of Political Affairs, Kim Soon Jo.

285
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,060
Make way.

286
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,630
Elder! Elder, please come to your senses.

287
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,730
Elder!

288
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,650
Is he dead for sure?

289
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,040
The arrow had poison on it.

290
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,010
Elder!

291
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,460
The Prime Minister Bayan sent those assassins?

292
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,950
They are Mujin and Jadan, Bayan's right-hand men.

293
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,240
How can Prime Minister Bayan do this to me?

294
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,030
If you don't trust him, go to Yeongyeong and confirm it for yourself.

295
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,760
Did Chief Imperial Consort Ki promise to save me?

296
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,360
If it wasn't for her, you'd be on your way to the afterworld right now.

297
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,000
Because of me,

298
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,040
you guys are suffering so much.

299
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,200
As long as you are safe,

300
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,770
we are all right.

301
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,400
Please endure just a little longer, Your Majesty.

302
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,790
When they bring Kim Soon Jo...

303
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,370
Give them water.

304
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,010
Your Highness.

305
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,060
Hurry and give them water.

306
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,280
Thank you, Imperial Prince.

307
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,250
You don't have to thank me.

308
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,050
You cannot die yet.

309
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:33,300
Die after Chief Imperial Consort's crimes have been revealed.

310
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,960
Is that what Empress Dowager told you?

311
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,470
"You cannot hide the sky with the palm of your hand."
(T/N: Proverb: A futile effort)

312
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:49,680
If you want to avenge your mother's death, then the emperor and Empress Dowager,

313
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,910
Bayan and all the ministers in the Imperial Court. You will have to kill them all.

314
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,920
Let's be on our way, Your Highness.

315
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,830
What is this man saying?

316
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,210
You must not be fooled by his words.

317
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:09,090
The reason your mother died is not only due to me or the Chief Imperial Consort.

318
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,030
Everyone around you right now—

319
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,380
Won't you shut that mouth?

320
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,480
Lord Jang, hurry and take Imperial Prince away from here.

321
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,480
- Empress Dowager.
- Hurry and go, Imperial Prince.

322
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,460
Your Highness, please.

323
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,010
Kim Soon Jo will not come.

324
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,620
I tried to give you a way to survive,

325
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,860
but you ignored me.

326
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,780
Welcome, Prime Minister.

327
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,090
Your Majesty, they say Kim Soon Jo died.

328
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,260
So there is no longer any reason to keep Wang Yoo alive.

329
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,830
Please order his execution now.

330
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,890
Wang Yoo's death,

331
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,760
I will make sure the people know about it.

332
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,230
So drag him outside the palace.

333
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

334
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,470
Drag these men away.

335
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,060
Yes, Sir.

336
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,370
Where are you taking them?

337
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,970
His Majesty issued an imperial command for them to be executed in the streets.

338
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,270
We were told Kim Soon Jo is dead.

339
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,170
So there is no longer any reason to let Wang Yoo live.

340
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,710
Haven't we heard from Yeon Bisoo yet?

341
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,330
If they received our message, they shouldn't be this late.

342
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,260
We better go out there, too.

343
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,730
A public execution in front of the people?

344
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,910
Yes, Your Highness. His Majesty will be there, too.

345
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:14,230
It's a golden opportunity to drive Chief Imperial Consort into a corner.

346
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,870
Begin inciting the people.

347
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,570
What do you mean?

348
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,870
Shouldn't His Majesty see what the public sentiment is?

349
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,200
I understand, Your Highness.

350
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,720
Chief Imperial Consort did it with them!

351
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,440
Execute Chief Imperial Consort also!

352
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,420
Get rid of all Goryeo people!

353
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,970
- Get rid of all Goryeo people!
- Kill them!

354
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,830
Kill them! Kill them!

355
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:53,760
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

356
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,810
Kill them! Kill them!

357
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:01,500
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

358
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,190
Kill them! Kill them!

359
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,590
Chief Imperial Consort gave us grains to eat!

360
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,370
We survived thanks to Chief Imperial Consort!

361
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,980
Hurray to Chief Imperial Consort!

362
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,450
Hurray! Hurray!

363
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,760
Hurray! Hurray!

364
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,740
Hurray!

365
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,770
How did the people find out I gave them grains?

366
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:30,410
I don't know myself.

367
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,900
Spread the word about the grains.

368
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,150
Your Highness.

369
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,400
Kill them! Kill them!

370
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Kill them! Kill them!

371
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,930
I don't see Chief Imperial Consort here.

372
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,780
Execute them.

373
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,230
Yes!

374
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,890
Take me first!

375
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,040
I will be next! So take me!

376
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,190
Why are you two doing this?

377
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,520
We have to stall for time no matter what.

378
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,740
Your Majesty, until the very last moment,

379
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,910
you must not lose the last shred of hope.

380
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,360
Bang Shin Woo!

381
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,610
Eunuch Bang...

382
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:02,150
What do you think you're doing, Chief Imperial Consort?

383
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,000
Don't hang them. Kill them with swords!

384
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:15,930
Kim Soon Jo has arrived.

385
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,030
Didn't you tell me that Kim Soon Jo died?

386
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,040
I am Kim Soon Jo, Minister of Political Affairs of Goryeo. I greet His Majesty the Emperor.

387
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,940
This is...

388
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,860
a secret letter sent to Kim Soon Jo, Minister of Political Affairs from Prime Minister Bayan.

389
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,230
This letter says for him to create a false ledger and to submit a petition to you, Your Majesty.

390
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,920
Did you see that?

391
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,060
You can never kill me.

392
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,790
Because Nyang belongs to me!

393
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,140
Shut that...

394
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,980
mouth of yours.

395
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,880
Your Majesty?

396
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,450
Emperor?

397
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,040
If Yang turns her back on you,

398
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,990
you will have nothing left.

399
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:37,050
That is because you are incompetent and idiotic...

400
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,950
emperor!

401
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,270
Wang Yoo, won't you shut up already?

402
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:46,990
So just try to kill me! Try it!

403
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:52,390
I will seriously kill you! How dare you?

404
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,390
Did His Majesty drink wine again?

405
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,640
Yes, Your Highness.

406
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,800
Your Majesty, please come to your senses.

407
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,480
What is wrong with you, Emperor?

408
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,050
Wang Yoo! Wang Yoo, you bastard!

409
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,840
Hurry and bring His Majesty back to the palace. Hurry!

410
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,060
Calm down, Your Majesty.

411
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,120
Wang Yoo!

412
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,420
Have you regained your senses?

413
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,000
Why did you do that?

414
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:46,340
You treasured honor more than anyone else. So why?

415
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,400
Why did you plot a scheme like that?

416
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,990
It may not seem like it, but I know how you feel deep inside.

417
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,540
You want Wang Yoo

418
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,930
to die and disappear, don't you?

419
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,910
So you did this for me?

420
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,240
I was not able to lessen your pain.

421
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,960
Please do not forgive me.

422
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,540
Why are you pledging such loyalty to me?

423
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:25,950
I became a warrior under your father, our late emperor's guidance.

424
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,130
But I was not able to protect him in the end.

425
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,610
And that is my eternal regret.

426
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,230
Such disloyalty,

427
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,010
I dare not repeat it.

428
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,830
If you are sincere right now,

429
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,480
then whatever punishment I give you,

430
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,470
will you accept it?

431
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

432
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,930
I am prepared.

433
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,030
Lord Jang, read the edict.

434
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:32,510
The attitude shown by deposed king Wang Yoo towards our Great Kingdom was insolent beyond compare.

435
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,290
You ejected loyal subjects of Goryeo accusing them of disloyalty for their collaborations with Yuan.

436
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:40,630
And you refused to send tribute concubines, eunuchs, and goods. This is also a serious crime.

437
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,900
So I, to deposed king Wang Yoo,

438
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,260
I sentence him to be exiled.

439
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,980
Deposed King, do you have something to say?

440
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,140
The Prime Minister falsified documents and plotted a scheme

441
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,540
to try to have me killed.

442
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:16,120
If you sentence me to exile, you should rightfully

443
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,260
punish the prime minister as well.

444
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,950
Prime Minister, come closer.

445
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,970
Golta.

446
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,730
All vassals, great and small, hear me now.

447
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:46,040
Starting now, all important documents from this Imperial Court

448
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,010
will have my imperial seal and this seal as well.

449
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:59,010
In addition, when our kingdom is in danger, this stamp will serve as a substitute for my imperial seal.

450
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,990
Your Majesty, who does that seal belong to?

451
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,700
Prime Minister.

452
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,090
Please accept this seal.

453
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,230
- Your Majesty.
- Except for treason,

454
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,540
you will not be detained for any crimes.

455
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:29,030
And no one aside from myself can exceed your authority. The reason is

456
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,930
you are no different than my other self.

457
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:40,550
I, Bayan, pledge all my loyalty to you, Your Majesty.

458
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,570
So you are being exiled?

459
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,830
You two will be released tomorrow.

460
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,200
So return to Goryeo.

461
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,600
We will follow you.

462
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,900
We will be with you, Your Majesty.

463
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,240
The emperor gave to Bayan

464
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,920
enormous power.

465
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,970
Chief Imperial Consort, you will remain here.

466
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,030
And I am worried about you.

467
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,930
I'm sorry...

468
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,610
that you suffered all this because of me.

469
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,570
It's not because of you, Chief Imperial Consort.

470
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,050
Empress Dowager and Prime Minister tried to get rid of me

471
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,800
and that is why they involved you.

472
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,920
When I acquire more power, I will release you from exile.

473
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,890
So please endure, even though it will be difficult.

474
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,130
I am more sorry to you, Your Highness.

475
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,270
What do you mean?

476
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,930
Then...

477
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:22,240
You did sell the sulfur and saltpeter to our enemy state?

478
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,000
Is that true?

479
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,200
Why can't you answer me?

480
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,770
I just asked if you sold to our enemy state.

481
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,230
Yuan must never

482
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,400
win this war, that was why.

483
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,430
Did you forget that I am the Chief Imperial Consort of this kingdom?

484
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,010
Our alliance is over.

485
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,030
Please be so informed.

486
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,010
Your Highness.

487
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,780
Who do we...

488
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,790
belong to?

489
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,460
Are we Goryeo people?

490
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:33,490
Or are we Yuan people?

491
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,950
Head Eunuch Dok Man said this,

492
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:44,300
that there are people who don't belong anywhere.

493
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,100
So those people need to protect themselves.

494
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,850
What a sad story.

495
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,040
There is no nation to protect us,

496
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,690
so we must protect ourselves.

497
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,760
Did you ask for me?

498
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,670
You take charge of Wang Yoo's trip for exile.

499
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,420
Yes.

500
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,390
And you will meet me at Yongsu Mountain.

501
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,340
Why would you go there?

502
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,250
I will kill Wang Yoo with my own hands.

503
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,660
Uncle.

504
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,630
We didn't find the evidence, but Wang Yoo's aiding of our enemy state

505
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,940
is a certain fact.

506
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:45,160
Is this His Majesty's command?

507
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,720
I will inform His Majesty after I behead Wang Yoo.

508
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,950
So you must not let anyone know.

509
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,230
But without an imperial command—

510
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:00,940
Don't worry. His Majesty secretly wants this, too.

511
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,960
♫ When the sun sets ♫

512
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,220
♫ and the day ends ♫

513
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:25,070
♫ A dark moon rises ♫

514
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:33,270
♫ I who am alone under that dark moon's light ♫

515
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:38,980
♫ Like that scarecrow in the field ♫

516
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,610
♫ I dry up and die ♫

517
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:49,750
♫ Carried on the wind, you are heard ♫

518
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:54,010
♫ Ceaselessly falling ♫

519
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,750
♫ Drip Drip Drip ♫

520
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:03,880
♫ In the sound of that rain, for a long time after ♫

521
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,080
♫ Even if I wander and am lost, ♫

522
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:14,520
♫ it is you, it is you again ♫

523
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,850
♫ When I must send you away ♫

524
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:21,980
♫ My heart ♫

525
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:28,200
♫ Burning up, more each day ♫

526
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,430
♫ It feels like hell ♫

527
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:46,840
The deposed king is coming!

528
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,760
Die, deposed king!

529
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,000
Your Majesty...

530
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,640
Terrible person!

531
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,000
Go and die!

532
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:30,780
Right here, they will pass by this spot for sure.

533
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,430
Good spot to lie in ambush.

534
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:33,970
General!

535
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,330
General, Wang Yoo is coming this way.

536
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,110
Everyone hide.

537
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,090
But...

538
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,740
Bayan is here, too.

539
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,640
What? Bayan?

540
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,790
Yes, he was already here waiting for them.

541
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:53,600
Wang Yoo and Bayan, too?

542
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,900
All your wishes have come true, Leader.

543
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,160
Not just those two,

544
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,790
I have to kill Chief Imperial Consort with my own hands to be fully satisfied.

545
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:07,050
Where are they right now?

546
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,880
Open the cage.

547
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,250
Come out.

548
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:56,910
Give him a sword.

549
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:05,150
Your greatest crime is not aiding the enemy state,

550
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:09,320
but for having broken my faith when I believed you were a comrade.

551
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,300
I will give you a send-off befitting a warrior.

552
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:18,130
Draw your sword.

553
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:27,050
Until one of us dies, no one must interfere.

554
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,980
Bayan is trying to kill Wang Yoo.

555
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:11,600
Wang Yoo, you do not disappoint me.

556
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,070
Since we do not have wooden swords,

557
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,590
I won't lose to you this time.

558
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:46,960
Uncle!

559
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,650
I am fine. Who are these guys?

560
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:53,260
Kill all of them! Don't let a single one live!

561
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,470
I will take care of this, so please get away. Mujin!

562
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:11,130
Endure until Prime Minister is safely away!

563
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:23,050
What is going on there?

564
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,480
Who knows what you will run into? Come this way.

565
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,910
Come on.

566
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,830
Where is Wang Yoo's body?

567
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,550
It rolled down that slope.

568
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,130
I will find his body.

569
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,400
Do you need to do that?

570
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,040
I saw that he was shot with arrows and stabbed in his belly.

571
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:55,100
We don't know when Bayan will return with his soldiers.

572
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,970
Follow me.

573
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,790
He's determined to be killed by Bayan. Geez!

574
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,940
But Wang Yoo died for sure.

575
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,560
Stop.

576
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,470
Is that...

577
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,010
There's a body.

578
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,990
Your Majesty!

579
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,760
His heart is still beating.

580
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,010
There they are!

581
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:33,900
Kill them all!

582
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,030
I will take care of the rest, go and kill them all.

583
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:43,340
Kill them. The rest will follow me.

584
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,070
Yes, Sir!

585
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:01,670
Your Majesty... Your Majesty... Your Majesty...

586
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:04,840
They're nearby! Follow me!

587
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,000
I will distract them, so you take care of His Majesty.

588
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,030
Hey, you bastards!

589
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,660
I am Jeom Bak! I will kill you all!

590
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,000
Please come to your senses.

591
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,220
Please open your eyes.

592
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,800
It's Yeon Bisoo.

593
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,960
You cannot die like this.

594
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,780
You must live!

595
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,260
Wang Yoo, open your eyes.

596
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,700
Open your eyes, I said!

597
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:27,990
Your Majesty, may I offer you a cup of wine?

598
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:32,520
Sure, pour me one.

599
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:40,960
Your Majesty, what brings you to summon all of us?

600
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,820
What is so strange about me summoning my empress and concubines?

601
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:53,010
Everyone drink. I want to get drunk today.

602
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,880
Welcome, Chief Imperial Consort.

603
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,750
Your Majesty, did you forget your promise with me?

604
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,260
How can you drink wine?

605
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:22,790
Chief Imperial Consort, return to your quarters.

606
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,590
Your Majesty,

607
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:30,940
isn't this a gathering you've specially prepared for the sake of harmony in the inner court?

608
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,870
Chief Imperial Consort should also—

609
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:37,420
Is the Chief Imperial Consort ignoring an imperial command?

610
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:43,240
Until I command you to, do not appear in front of me!

611
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,710
I will accept your command.

612
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:14,990
I want to be alone now.

613
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:19,280
Everyone leave.

614
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:58,310
I heard that you accompanied the exile procession.

615
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:02,960
Why are you injured?

616
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:10,030
Has something happened to Wang Yoo?

617
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,890
Please tell me.

618
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:18,060
What happened?

619
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:21,760
Wang Yoo...

620
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,490
died.

621
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,320
Wang Yoo...

622
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,170
died, you said?

623
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,990
Who did it?

624
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:54,670
Who killed Wang Yoo, I asked you?!

625
00:57:55,650 --> 00:58:01,330
♫ Because I’m dangerous, my love ♫

626
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:06,960
♫ The more you love me ultimately the more
only you may be hurt ♫

627
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,870
♫ Don’t test me, my love ♫

628
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:16,790
♫ You can’t ever, ever, ever, ever, ever ♫
