1
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,400
Sir.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,070
Yes, are you feeling all right?

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,560
After taking the tonic you sent me, I am a lot better.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,410
This medicine isn't from me but from the physician.

5
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,160
Why did the physician give me...

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,850
While you were lying in bed sick, the emperor came by.

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,600
You mustn't show such disloyalty again.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,060
Understand?

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,260
Yes, Sir.

10
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,070
When I looked into it,

11
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,310
it seems that the deposed king led a ragtag mob

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,080
and brutally suppressed the Turks.

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,990
Your Majesty, it's Yang.

14
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,200
I was late, Your Majesty.

15
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,250
Return to your room and rest today.

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,970
I'm... much better now.

17
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,740
I said return to your room!

18
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,450
Until I say otherwise,

19
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,330
don't come out of the inner court!

20
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,180
Wang Yoo? You mean the one who was the King of Goryeo?

21
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes, Your Majesty. He's coming to the palace to see His Imperial Majesty.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,100
What's the big deal about him coming?

23
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,460
According to the rumors, he is vicious

24
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,130
and he lusts after women.

25
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,720
How contemptible.

26
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,100
But then again, no wonder he was deposed.

27
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,680
I have to send over some servants if the unwelcome guests stay the night.

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,500
Who should I send?

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,420
Just send any...

30
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,140
Right. You can send that wench Yang.

31
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,920
Sticking her into a lion's cage wouldn't be enough to calm my anger toward her.

32
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,650
If the deposed king is that hideous, we can send that wench.

33
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,340
He's the deposed king?

35
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,100
Unlike the rumors, he's very handsome.

36
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,420
I know. He's tall, too.

37
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,930
His face just glows.

38
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,560
Your Majesty, I don't see Seung Nyang.

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,250
I've looked, too.

40
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,400
If she heard the news, she would be out here.

41
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,530
Oh, she must not have heard yet.

42
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,580
Your Majesty, have you been well?

43
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,100
Welcome, General.

44
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,630
I haven't seen you in a while either.

45
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,310
It's been a while, Your Majesty.

46
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,330
I've heard about your fortune of war. You achieved a great feat.

47
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,180
Your Majesty, giving credit for the victory and their rewards should not be lacking in the least.

48
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,550
You are quite right.

49
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,480
General Bayan, please step forward.

50
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,080
I will personally pour you some wine.

51
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,350
Uncle.

52
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,080
Come and receive a drink from me.

53
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:20,870
Your Majesty... the victory of this war isn't mine.

54
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,500
Bayan, what do you mean?

55
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,270
In the most critical situation, the one who saved us and led us to victory was...

56
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,020
the unit led by Wang Yoo.

57
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,040
Is that true?

58
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,570
Yes, Father. It is.

59
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,700
We can divide up responsibility for defeat, but we cannot divide victory achieved by fighting along side each other.

60
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,000
So, isn't it everyone's victory?

61
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,650
Both letting the other take the credit?

62
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,330
These are true men, Your Majesty.

63
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,810
That's right, Prime Minister.

64
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,720
I present Wang Yoo with 1,000 taels of gold and 10,000 taels of silver.

65
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,800
I'm obliged.

66
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,280
And to General Bayan, along with 10,000 taels of gold, you will now be the captain of the Imperial Guard.

67
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,190
Your benevolence is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

68
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,250
Your benevolence is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

69
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,700
Yangyang.

70
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,660
What's going on today? The inner court is so empty.

71
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,760
Everyone went to the imperial courtyard.

72
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,030
Why is that?

73
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:51,270
The deposed king from Goryeo came and he's really handsome.

74
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,300
Everyone's there trying to get another glimpse of him.

75
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,020
His Majesty came back alive?

76
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,130
He achieved a huge victory in war.

77
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,000
Yangyang! Yangyang!

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,030
♫  You always look far away ♫

79
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,900
How can he be so handsome?

80
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,940
♫  You always pretend you don't know how I feel ♫

81
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,780
♫  Even if you are a small step behind me ♫

82
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,650
Your Majesty.

83
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:33,700
♫  I keep being afraid you will become even farther away ♫

84
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:41,650
♫  Love is such a sad word to me that it's maddening ♫

85
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,630
♫  Even if my heart aches some words must be endured ♫

86
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,360
Your Majesty, I'm here.

87
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,260
This way... Please turn your head this way, Your Majesty.

88
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,510
♫  Even if dawn breaks with tears and my heart falls apart ♫

89
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,390
♫ The words I didn't get to say ♫

90
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:04,090
♫  I love you ♫

91
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,490
♫ How much... ♫

92
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:15,530
♫ How much more do I have to cry before you will know how I feel? ♫

93
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,890
♫  I can't last even a day without you ♫

94
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,120
♫  I can't last even a day without you ♫

95
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:38,360
♫  You are my last love ♫

96
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,850
Did you see Seung Nyang on our way out?

97
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,190
I didn't. Did you see her?

98
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,630
There were others around so I pretended not to see, but she was definitely looking at me.

99
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,690
The Head Eunuch Dok Man of the inner court is a long-time friend of mine.

100
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,830
I can go meet with Seung Nyang and figure out a place for you to meet her.

101
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,810
Good. Please do that for me.

102
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,860
I have a message from the Imperial Court. The emperor is requesting to see you alone.

103
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,740
Alone?

104
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,630
Sitting here in front of you like this, the past memories are rushing by.

105
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,570
Well, you must remember them, too.

106
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,750
The day I first stepped foot into Goryeo's Royal Palace.

107
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,210
H-How-How impertinent!

108
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,000
How d-dare you—

109
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,570
Silence. Listen carefully.

110
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:54,160
The one who's protecting your life isn't Yuan but Goryeo.

111
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,790
Do you realize the misery of being unable to protect my own people

112
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,820
while protecting your safety?

113
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,500
You never know how things turn out in life.

114
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,340
The one who was exiled has now become an emperor

115
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,940
and you, who used to be a king, is now a shabby hostage.

116
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,220
Whatever happened, in order to protect your life, I made every desperate effort.

117
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,740
Let's give credit where credit is due.

118
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,540
My life was saved not by you but Seung Nyang.

119
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,010
But that kid who was so rough back then

120
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,590
has turned into a girl and ended up in here. Isn't that amazing?

121
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,540
She would even pretend to die if you commanded her to.

122
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,600
Don't you miss Seung Nyang?

123
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,800
Please send her back to Goryeo.

124
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,440
I heard that women who get brought here as tribute girls but go back to Goryeo are called impure.

125
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,630
Do you want her to be scorned that way?

126
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:11,830
She would be happier in her hometown mountain village than here.

127
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:18,090
If it's for her happiness... I am going to do everything for her.

128
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,960
Do you think that's what she wants?

129
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,860
I'm the emperor of this kingdom.

130
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,950
Whether it's heaven or hell, her fate rests in my hands, not yours!

131
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,940
Then... in whose hands rests your fate?

132
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,830
What?

133
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:39,760
You can't even freely use the Royal Seal. How can you talk about having control of someone's fate?

134
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,910
Shut that... mouth.

135
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,820
I know Seung Nyang better than you.

136
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:54,310
Things will never... turn out the way you want.

137
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,440
I guess... you're the only one time hasn't affected.

138
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,900
You still look the same.

139
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,560
You, too! You looked really old when you were young and you still do now!

140
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,640
Wait! Is this a criticism or a compliment?

141
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,990
It's a criticism! How is it a compliment?

142
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,720
Anyway, thanks to you, I've laughed for the first time after coming here.

143
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,290
Really?

144
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,150
But... I came because I have a request.

145
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,290
Tell me. What is it?

146
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,360
In the inner court, there's someone named Seung Nyang. No, no. I heard she's called Yang here.

147
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,020
The king who I serve wants to see her.

148
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,100
Yang is a court lady.

149
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,790
How can she meet another man?

150
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,950
That's why I'm asking for your help.

151
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,050
Since we're both from Goryeo, please help with this one.

152
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,500
Look! I'm no longer someone from Goryeo but the Head Eunuch of the Imperial Family of Yuan.

153
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,380
This man, how can you say you're not from Goryeo? Once from Goryeo, always from Goryeo.

154
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,100
Please help with this just once.

155
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,540
Hey, Dok Man.

156
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,680
Dok Man! Dok Man!

157
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,000
Maybe His Majesty didn't see me.

158
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,860
If not, maybe he's pretending not to?

159
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,250
But then again, to His Majesty, I'm just a subordinate.

160
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,890
Seung Nyang.

161
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,340
Eunuch Bang, Sir!

162
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,780
Long time no see!

163
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,680
Wait, let's see. You're pretty. Very pretty.

164
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,740
I did think you looked too pretty to be a boy.

165
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,210
You weren't a boy after all!

166
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,880
Have you been well?

167
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,470
Yes...

168
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,310
How about His Majesty?

169
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,770
Oh, where's my head?

170
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,710
He's staying at the guesthouse.

171
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,440
He will stay there from now on.

172
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,030
I'm so glad he's... safe.

173
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:47,320
Oh, before 8:00 tonight, come to the pagoda in the back garden.

174
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,820
His Majesty will wait for you over there.

175
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,780
Morning greetings are enough. Why do I have to go in the evening, too?

176
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,980
Did you forget Prime Minister's orders?

177
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,220
For the time being, you must not do anything you can be criticized for.

178
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,330
Empress Dowager, I'm here to say my evening greetings.

179
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,050
You came.

180
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:38,120
It must be bothersome to have to come to my quarters.

181
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,990
It's something I naturally must do.

182
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,740
How can I say it's bothersome?

183
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,490
I've requested a tonic for you from the apothecary.

184
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,730
Tonic?

185
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,180
You need to become pregnant, too, don't you think?

186
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:02,290
In this world, nothing happens for free.

187
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:10,480
How can you protect your position without a male heir in this royal palace where people whisper?

188
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,340
I didn't realize you were so concerned for me.

189
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,000
Of course, I am!

190
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:25,230
Do you think I dislike you because of petty feelings?

191
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,530
She wants to rub salt in the wound?

192
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,030
Of course not.

193
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,930
The whole world knows of your benevolent character.

194
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,170
Is that so?

195
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,610
This place doesn't wait for the right time.

196
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,190
You need to work a little harder, Empress.

197
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,350
That sly fox is looking down on me because I can't get pregnant.

198
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,280
Your Majesty, I heard that if you pray under the full moon and circle the pagoda 108 times,

199
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,120
you can become pregnant.

200
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,530
Are you telling me to do such a thing?

201
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,660
All the empresses of the forefathers did the same.

202
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,950
What if the servants see?

203
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,670
There will be a rumor that I've become desperate to get pregnant!

204
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,300
You need to grab at even straws right now.

205
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,380
Pride is also important to me, too.

206
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,150
Not becoming pregnant is more--

207
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

208
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,850
Your Majesty, you're going to wear out the mirror.

209
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,470
You're meeting with Seung Nyang. Why are you getting so dressed up?

210
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,860
What? I didn't get dressed up.

211
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,420
Stop the nonsense and leave the room.

212
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,340
- Yes, Sire.
- Yes, Sire.

213
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,350
If you want us to leave, we must, but...

214
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,020
Hurry and leave!

215
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,780
Yes, Sire.

216
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,520
Let's go.

217
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:08,700
A chick that breaks out of the shell and is born considers the first thing it sees as its mother.

218
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,800
To a chick, its mother cannot change.

219
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,620
I know Seung Nyang better than you.

220
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,880
Things will never... turn out the way you want.

221
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,330
No.

222
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,790
I will do what I want.

223
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,860
What I wish for.

224
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,190
Empress, try praying a hundred or a thousand times.

225
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:10,710
You will never be able to become pregnant.

226
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,750
What method are you using on the empress?

227
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,450
I did something only the Buddha knows.

228
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,810
No one will ever be able to figure it out.

229
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,120
Your Majesty!

230
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,540
Why are you so surprised?

231
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,440
What brings you here?

232
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,070
In the Imperial Palace, is there any place I cannot be?

233
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,540
I pray to the compassionate and merciful Buddha.

234
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,480
Please let me have a male heir of the emperor.

235
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,030
I pray.

236
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:14,140
I pray to you so that I can become pregnant.

237
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,690
I told her not to let anyone in since it might ruin the prayer!

238
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,380
What is Lady Seo doing letting a man in here?

239
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,190
The deposed king of Goryeo is supposed to be here. Maybe it's him?

240
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,740
Where did he go?

241
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,690
What a strange person. Coming like a cloud and going like the wind.

242
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,300
You scared me.

243
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:55,720
Since you're in white, you don't look like a servant. Maybe a court lady?

244
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,800
Men are not supposed to be here. Please leave.

245
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,630
I heard that's only after 8:00.

246
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,540
It's not time yet, I don't think.

247
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,100
May I ask you something?

248
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,290
Impertinence! How dare you touch me?

249
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,940
Please leave.

250
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,130
If not, I'll scream.

251
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,690
Do that then.

252
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,790
Do you think you'll be safe being found with a man in the middle of the night?

253
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,500
What?

254
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,490
I told you I'd leave when it's time!

255
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,570
How dare you be so rude as a mere palace maid?

256
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,260
Hitting me first before asking who I am...

257
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,200
You have a horrible temperament.

258
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,630
Let's see if you can be just as confident in daylight.

259
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,370
It's 8:00!

260
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,540
Seung Nyang.

261
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,010
Why are you so late?

262
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,040
Hurry up and come.

263
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,870
What are you doing?

264
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,730
What do you mean?

265
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,240
How dare you question the emperor when you are just a palace maid?

266
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,950
Please move.

267
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,470
Try screaming if you want.

268
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,960
All my guards will protect this room rigorously.

269
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,880
Your Majesty!

270
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,980
If it was Wang Yoo and not me, would you push me away?

271
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,200
I'll call Eunuch Baek in.

272
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,530
Don't leave.

273
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,960
I can never... send you to Wang Yoo.

274
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:13,010
The first person I saw... was you.

275
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,380
When I broke out of my shell,

276
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,970
to me,

277
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,610
you were the mother bird.

278
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,000
Your Majesty.

279
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,990
Where are you?

280
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,110
Your Majesty.

281
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,180
I'm sure she had a reason she couldn't come.

282
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,360
That's right, Your Majesty.

283
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,050
When you met Seung Nyang, how was she?

284
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:52,210
Yes. She looked healthy and happy.

285
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:58,560
Shall I go back to her tomorrow and relay your message—

286
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
That's enough.

287
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,400
But, Your Majesty, you've been so worried about her.

288
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,890
If she's living comfortably here,

289
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,360
that's enough for me.

290
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:16,340
I don't want her to become uncomfortable because of me.

291
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,720
Congratulations on your appointment as Captain of the Imperial Guard, General.

292
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,530
I will need a lot of Imperial Guards' help from now on.

293
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,550
What do you mean help? Just give us your command.

294
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:49,880
The general is hosting a feast tonight. Will you come?

295
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,130
Of course. I will be sure to attend.

296
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:05,190
What do you mean a bloodletter? The late Emperor Mingzong wrote a will in blood?

297
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,770
I know he wrote the bloodletter before he was poisoned by me.

298
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:36,660
When you wake up after drinking this poison,

299
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,280
you will end up in a very nice world.

300
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,160
In return for me drinking this poison,

301
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,590
please keep your promise to me.

302
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,330
To my son, Toghon,

303
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,600
you must hand over the power of the emperor.

304
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,700
Please don't worry about anything,

305
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,710
and go comfortably... Your Majesty.

306
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,270
When I saw the blood on the dead emperor's finger,

307
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,000
I realized he wrote a bloodletter.

308
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,240
But where is it right now?

309
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,890
There are only rumors going around secretively.

310
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,930
No one has come forward to say they've seen it.

311
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,980
But besides me, there are others who are looking for the bloodletter.

312
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,100
Who are they?

313
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,690
I've returned, Prime Minister.

314
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,010
Did you meet with the informant?

315
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,790
He's coming back in two days since he's traveling abroad.

316
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:10,880
You're sure that man knows the identity of the person looking for the bloodletter?

317
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,480
Yes, Prime Minister.

318
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,470
Looking for the bloodletter means he's taking a knife to your throat, Father.

319
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,940
I'll find him right away and kill him!

320
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,340
We can't kill him.

321
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,760
If we capture him and backtrack,

322
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,730
we may be able to get that bloodletter in our hands.

323
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,670
I guess I came too early.

324
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,580
Has the feast been moved elsewhere?

325
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,190
The informant you're looking for has died already.

326
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,530
Then... the people looking for the bloodletter are—

327
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,010
We've managed to put out the more urgent fire, but it won't be easy to find the bloodletter.

328
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,890
The arrow has already left the bow.

329
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,200
In order to cause the collapse of El Temür's entire family

330
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,030
and gain power myself, we need to find that bloodletter.

331
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:39,000
I'll bury him somewhere where no one knows.

332
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,800
I don't like any of these clothes! Something else!

333
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,650
What is this?

334
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,920
Your Majesty, you will be late to the banquet.

335
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,570
I said bring me something else.

336
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,860
There's someone I need to teach a lesson to today.

337
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,300
Who are you teaching a lesson to?

338
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:14,410
Someone arrogant, rough, and very rude.

339
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,360
There's such a person.

340
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,250
But, Your Majesty, because Yang is working at the Imperial Court,

341
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,280
it's a little difficult to send her to tend the unwelcome guests.

342
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,740
Forget about her. I'm sending one of ours to the unwelcome guests.

343
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,080
I heard that the one named Wang Yoo had a lot to do with this victory.

344
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,620
And also that he's very handsome and manly.

345
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,700
The palace is full of rumors about him.

346
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,270
What do you mean handsome?

347
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:52,130
He looks rough and dark like some cow thief and—

348
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,470
People equate that to strength.

349
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,560
Having capable people around

350
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,100
is a huge blessing to you.

351
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,330
- King Simyang.
- Yes.

352
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,620
Today, this will become your farewell party.

353
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,350
What do you mean?

354
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,670
Just... leave Yeongyeong.

355
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,520
Are you throwing me away like this?

356
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:49,580
Well, it's not throwing away but letting you go.

357
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,030
Stop your obsession with royal authority.

358
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,830
I hope you have a pleasant life living out your years in Goryeo.

359
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,580
Prime Minister!

360
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,750
His Imperial Majesty!

361
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,090
Welcome, Your Majesty.

362
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,210
Have you been well, Empress Dowager?

363
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,330
Well done, General Bayan.

364
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,810
I'm Wang Yoo.

365
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:05,350
True to rumor, you exude an uncommon spirit.

366
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:10,140
Thank you for such a welcome. I'm truly grateful.

367
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:32,130
I would like you to marry one of the princesses in the Imperial Family.

368
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,520
What is your opinion, Your Majesty?

369
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,670
Empress Dowager.

370
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,650
What do you mean "marry?"

371
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,490
I'm not yet interested in marrying—

372
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:50,820
Goryeo has been for generations a son-in-law nation of ours.

373
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,610
We can't lose such a great man like you.

374
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,440
Don't you think so, Prime Minister?

375
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,060
Time is delaying. Let's start the banquet, Your Majesty.

376
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:09,570
This is for all of you! Please drink freely and enjoy yourselves!

377
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,740
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

378
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,670
Her Imperial Empress!

379
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,090
Sorry, I'm late.

380
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,420
I told you I'd leave when it's time!

381
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,690
How dare you be so rude as a mere palace maid?

382
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,970
It's nice to meet you. You're Wang Yoo?

383
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

384
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,070
It's my honor to meet you.

385
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,890
Where am I supposed to put this?

386
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,440
I can't understand a word—

387
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:17,720
I hear Wang Yoo has quite a talent for playing the geomungo.

388
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,480
Could we hear a song tonight?

389
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,840
I've been wielding a sword in battle.

390
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,500
If you suddenly ask me to play the geomungo...

391
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,810
That's right, Your Highness.

392
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,100
It doesn't suit the occasion.

393
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,580
That makes me more curious.

394
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,650
Please show us your talent, Wang Yoo.

395
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:53,020
Then... although my skills are lacking, I will give it a try.

396
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,480
Your Imperial Majesty!

397
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,490
The Captain of the Imperial Guard

398
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,580
has been found dead!

399
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,980
Uncle.

400
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,600
I will look into it!

401
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,260
Where was the body found?

402
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,620
General, she's the one who found the body.

403
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,940
He was found hanging.

404
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,280
They should have preserved the scene, but these idiot eunuchs...

405
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,900
Make sure no one enters.

406
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,190
Dammit. I've dealt with many murder cases before.

407
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,270
I used to be in that division in the military defense.

408
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,010
How did this happen?

409
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,410
I definitely threw the body into the well.

410
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,560
Where's the well?

411
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,500
Outside the capital in Goryeo Village.

412
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,050
Goryeo Village?

413
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:49,210
- Why did you get rid of it there?
- There's a plague going around in that area.

414
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:52,190
So even if the dead body is discovered, no one would bat an eye.

415
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:55,280
There's no way a dead man would have walked here himself.

416
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,080
It means someone saw us kill him.

417
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,820
Move aside.

418
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,530
There are two rope marks on his neck.

419
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,820
One is from the hanging

420
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:26,200
and the other is definitely from someone strangling him.

421
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:31,880
If this news gets out, there will be chaos within the palace.

422
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,120
We need to quieten the controversy and carry out a secret investigation.

423
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,380
The Captain of the Imperial Guard

424
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,670
- killed himself?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

425
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,970
He killed himself by hanging!

426
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,570
Is it true?

427
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,810
No, it's not. It's murder.

428
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,860
Why kill himself inside the palace? What disloyalty!

429
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,030
That's enough!

430
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,310
Today's banquet will end here.

431
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,630
Everyone, go back! Everyone!

432
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,430
Your Majesty, how did you become so intoxicated?

433
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,390
I was so happy that I drank a bit.

434
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,690
- Golta, let's go.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

435
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,070
Do you know a place called Goryeo Village?

436
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:20,060
It's where the migrants who were taken from Goryeo live.

437
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:24,410
They're the most ragged and starved in Daedo.

438
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,760
You used to be called a king. Wouldn't it be only right to go pay them a visit?

439
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,480
I've already sent my subordinates there.

440
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,230
Is that so?

441
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,470
Just as expected, you are always different.

442
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:43,200
With that mouth, don't speak of Goryeo's people.

443
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,100
It's contemptible.

444
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,370
I'm going back to Goryeo tomorrow.

445
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:50,940
But before I do, I would like to meet with you urgently.

446
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,770
I have a present to give you.

447
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:58,590
Just give my father my best.

448
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,730
Do you believe that the Captain of the Imperial Guard killed himself?

449
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:08,310
Gyeonjimangwol.

450
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:14,530
A foolish person will only see the finger and not the moon it's pointing at. (T/N: Can't see the forest for the trees.)

451
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,810
What nonsense is he spewing?

452
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,950
I know.

453
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:31,500
Any word from Jeom Bak and Bul Hwa from Goryeo Village?

454
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,560
I'll go and see.

455
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,800
No, I'll go instead.

456
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,910
Are you saying he was hanged after being killed?

457
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:14,820
Looking at the state of the body, I'm certain it was murder.

458
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:21,450
The killer is somewhere very close.

459
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,170
He wanted this man's death to be known to the world.

460
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,130
Bayan.

461
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,240
- Yes, Sir.
- Find the killer.

462
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,800
You must move quietly and covertly.

463
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,610
- Yes, Sir.
- You may leave.

464
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,430
It's the work of those who are also after the bloodletter. It's not enough to leave it to Bayan.

465
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,830
I need you to do something else.

466
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,910
Find the bloodletter.

467
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,550
I'm certain it's inside the palace somewhere.

468
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:00,190
Before the others find it,

469
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,260
- we need to find it first.
- Yes, Father.

470
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,100
We understand.

471
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,260
Bloodletter?

472
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:24,070
The rope that will let me ascend to the sky is

473
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:26,940
the bloodletter?

474
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,170
Your Majesty!

475
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,340
What brings you here?

476
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,940
I came to see the village myself.

477
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,500
Please don't! You cannot go in!

478
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,940
- What do you mean?
- There's a plague going around.

479
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:51,050
Your Majesty, I think it'll be best to come back another time.

480
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,490
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

481
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,580
It's the plague!

482
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:59,790
I'm weak-bodied, so I get sick easily!

483
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,970
Eunuch Bang!

484
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:07,000
Do we have to go in, too?

485
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,290
You can't go, Your Majesty!

486
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,650
They're dead.

487
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,010
What wretchedness.

488
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,790
It's a living hell.

489
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,510
Have you met with the head of this village?

490
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:32,710
I tried to speak to him, but he had such a bad temper.

491
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,730
Over there, the person holding the stick is the head.

492
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,340
Are you the head of this village?

493
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,310
I would like to ask you something about Goryeo Village.

494
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:50,920
Don't get taken out of here on a stretcher for no reason

495
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,260
- and just leave.
- This is

496
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,160
the King of Goryeo.

497
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,790
I am now just a deposed king,

498
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:05,210
but I wanted to find out how the people of Goryeo were living.

499
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:10,030
Is that so? The king has arrived!

500
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,200
This crazy old man!

501
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,020
Anytime we see a member of the Royal Family of Goryeo,

502
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:28,740
it makes us grind our teeth with rage.

503
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:34,310
You disposed of us, so why come here? To see us in this state? Why?

504
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:38,360
Does it make you feel happy to see us in this state?

505
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:44,060
Men, these people are worse than the plague,

506
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,010
so get rid of them!

507
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,790
Let's go, Your Majesty.

508
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:58,360
Not bad enough that a crazy bastard took a dead body from the well last night.

509
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,020
Do you know about a place called Goryeo Village?

510
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,580
Do you believe the Captain of the Imperial Guard killed himself?

511
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,800
I knew you'd come.

512
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:31,160
Since you're... someone who never misses an opportunity.

513
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:43,870
What is it... that you want to say to me?

514
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,240
Don't you want to get rid of Prime Minister El Temür?

515
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:59,020
You and I have differing motives, but the end goal is the same.

516
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,480
If only El Temür dies,

517
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,080
you being restored to the throne isn't impossible.

518
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,330
For the past ten or so years,

519
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,750
you were his hunting dog.

520
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:18,090
I was. I barked if told to bark, I bit if told to bite.

521
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:21,920
If he told me to wag my tail, I did all kinds of tricks while crawling on the ground.

522
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,730
But... in the end, once the hunt was over,

523
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,710
he slaughtered me and ate me up.

524
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:37,720
He ended up throwing me away... so pitifully and pathetically.

525
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,660
I wasn't able to become the King of Goryeo, nor his loyal subject.

526
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,840
I have lost my country and honor, everything!

527
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,670
What's the reason you killed the Captain of the Imperial Guard?

528
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:52,220
I didn't kill him.

529
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,340
I only moved the body to the Imperial Palace.

530
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:02,170
Then... who did it and why was he killed?

531
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:10,380
That person was looking for the bloodletter.

532
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,310
Bloodletter?

533
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:17,200
It's a will that was written in blood by the late Emperor Mingzong.

534
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,920
The emperor was a fool, and that was the end of his obedience to El Temür.

535
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,730
The one who finds the bloodletter will push El Temür out of the way and take his place.

536
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:35,580
I'm saying that he will ride along with the dragon on his throne. (T/N: be the power behind the emperor)

537
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:01,240
Your Majesty, I have something to say.

538
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,330
I don't want to hear it.

539
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:06,360
- Your Majesty...
- I don't want to hear it.

540
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,160
I already know what you're going to say.

541
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,030
You'll ask me to send you to Wang Yoo. Do you think I want to hear that?

542
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,780
You can't say anything else besides reading a book when you're with me.

543
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,400
Even if I fall asleep, you must read the rest of this book.

544
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,680
What are you doing and not reading it out loud?

545
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,360
"Jang An Seong Du Du Baek Oh.

546
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,250
A white crow over the head of Jangan Palace."

547
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,610
"Ya Bi Yeon Choo Moon Sang Ho.

548
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:06,980
It flies in during the night and cries over the Yeonchu Gates."

549
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,120
"Oo Hyang In Ga Tak Dae Ok.

550
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,140
It again flies to a dwelling and pecks at a big house."

551
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,750
"Ok Jeo Dal Gwan Ju Pi Ho.

552
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:26,070
The high-ranking officials flee from the barbaric outlanders."

553
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,490
Now that the body of the Captain of the Imperial Guard has been discovered,

554
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:44,170
El Temür will start to become suspicious of his close associates first.

555
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:49,460
Even through a fine crack, the rain seeps in.

556
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,460
You should burrow your way through that crack.

557
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,650
How can you put back a wall once it's been cracked open?

558
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,530
It's only a matter of time before it falls.

559
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:05,410
This is my last present to you.

560
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,470
I need the help of someone who knows the ins and outs of the palace. Someone who can help me.

561
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:19,430
- Is anyone there?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

562
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,300
You called?

563
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,380
Did you say that Seung Nyang serves the emperor?

564
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:34,830
Yes, Your Majesty. She's a court lady in the Imperial Court.

565
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,820
I need to meet Seung Nyang right now.

566
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,450
Your Majesty, it's too late to enter the palace.

567
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:44,630
Just tell me how to get to the inner court.

568
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,300
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

569
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,020
I treated her so well, but in the end, she wants to go back to Wang Yoo.

570
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:56,980
Are you outside, Golta?

571
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

572
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,580
Has Seung Nyang left?

573
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,760
Just a moment ago. She thought you were sleeping and—

574
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,740
Bring her here immediately.

575
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,510
No.

576
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:15,120
I'll go to Seung Nyang myself.

577
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:28,750
Once you're inside the inner court, just follow the wall straight.

578
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:32,970
You'll soon see the court ladies' residence.

579
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,710
Your Majesty, please walk slowly. Your Majesty!

580
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:41,110
Your Majesty, are you running again?

581
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,000
Seung Nyang!

582
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,160
Seung Nyang!

583
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,050
Seung Nyang, it's me.

584
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,100
Y-Your Majesty...

585
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:32,600
Yang!

586
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,880
Seung Nyang!

587
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,670
She was definitely here.

588
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,040
Seung Nyang!

589
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:57,970
♫  Love is such a sad word to me that it's maddening ♫

590
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:05,990
♫  Even if my heart aches some words must be endured ♫
