1
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,830
Bloodletter...

2
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,100
It's the bloodletter.

3
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,710
Why aren't you sleeping?

4
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,000
Take a look at this.

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,870
Huh? What is it?

6
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,520
This is... the real bloodletter, right?

7
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,650
It is. It's definitely Emperor Mingzong's blood letter.

8
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,460
Your Majesty, don't you wish to see your baby?

9
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,900
How come you won't pay a visit to my quarters?

10
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,510
I was told that your illness is from your heart.

11
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,840
So you should heal yourself with happiness.

12
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,560
So here, please hold our baby.

13
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,440
The baby is very pretty, his eyes resemble yours.

14
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,960
Here, hurry, Your Majesty.

15
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,520
Oh, Your Majesty.

16
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,620
How can you do such a thing?

17
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,550
I see now that you've gone crazy.

18
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,170
You are not in your right mind. You have gone mad.

19
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,760
Please leave now, Your Majesty.

20
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,340
Your Majesty, keep living that way.

21
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,120
No one will remain by your side.

22
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,730
Your Majesty...

23
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,380
please stop now, Your Majesty.

24
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:26,870
My name is Heuk Soo, I am in charge of the Liaoyang division of Hawk House.

25
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,580
So what brings you here?

26
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,950
Prime Minister El Temür has sent

27
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,320
an invitation to a feast at the palace.

28
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,600
I went to Ilkhanate to study and returned after six months.

29
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,560
My belated congratulations on your appointment.

30
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,760
All right, you can leave now.

31
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,940
And this is a gift from our leader.

32
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,570
They are rubies and emeralds from the west.

33
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,900
Give your leader my thanks.

34
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,630
Yes, Sir.

35
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:25,310
Hawk House is a large merchant association that funds El Temür's political activities and he is one of the leaders.

36
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,080
I don't think it's a good idea to turn our backs on them.

37
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,490
There's an odd aura about him. Keep watch over that fellow just in case.

38
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,510
Yes, Uncle.

39
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,930
I can give you a lot more food.

40
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,340
All right, eat now.

41
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,440
He is fattening us up so he can sell us for more money.

42
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,750
Eat while we have a chance.

43
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,770
Being sold off to someone else

44
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,380
will give us a better chance to escape from here.

45
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,990
What is this?

46
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,720
One banknote of Yuan currency is now worth 3 taels of silver?

47
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,800
No one has any Yuan currency anymore.

48
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,470
Are they telling merchants like us to die?

49
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,660
Oh no!

50
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,440
Aigoo. What to do?

51
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,060
Use the Yuan currency and buy ginseng.

52
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,630
Yes, Leader.

53
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,620
Give this to Heuk Soo in Liaoyang.

54
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,990
I understand.

55
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,340
But Wang Yoo is here.

56
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,460
Has he found out who we are?

57
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,320
He doesn't request any courtesans, he only drinks wine.

58
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,460
Your Majesty, you must return to the palace.

59
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,910
Do you also

60
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,430
want me to marry El Temür's niece?

61
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,720
Even if you refuse,

62
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,920
you should meet with your father, the king, first.

63
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Get out. Everyone get out.

64
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,460
- Yes.
- We understand.

65
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,480
Seung Nyang.

66
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,550
What is your reason for letting me live?

67
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,400
The reason we fought each other was because of Yuan.

68
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,100
Don't they say that the enemy of my enemy is my friend?

69
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,620
Did you just say "friend?"

70
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,440
I did, friend.

71
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:12,230
The important thing is not now, but what will happen in the future.

72
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm sorry

73
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,790
but my future is different from yours.

74
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,800
The magistrates of various provinces are gathering in the palace.

75
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,210
Having them participate in electing the imperial concubines was an excellent plan.

76
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,140
Bayan, Magistrate of Liaoyang, greets you, Your Imperial Majesty.

77
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,840
Oh Gwang, Magistrate of Yunnan Province, greets you, Your Imperial Majesty.

78
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,720
Bu Sagi, Magistrate of Lingbei Province, greets you, Your Imperial Majesty.

79
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,850
Jeok Gong, Magistrate of Shaanxi Province, greets you, Your Imperial Majesty.

80
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,200
Seol Do Gwan, Magistrate of Sichuan Province, greets you, Your Imperial Majesty.

81
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,090
Since all the magistrates have gathered,

82
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,050
even Prime Minister El Temür must feel burdened.

83
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,620
Things were noisy due to the bloodletter

84
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,500
so there will be added weight to the magistrates' presence.

85
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,250
I am curious

86
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,300
to know what they'll talk about at the feast today.

87
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,430
Everyone enjoy yourselves to your heart's content

88
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,680
and relieve the stress we've all felt lately.

89
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,520
I, Oh Gwang, representing all the magistrates

90
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,820
would like to speak to you, Prime Minister.

91
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,210
Please go ahead.

92
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,270
The emperor, including the empress,

93
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:56,970
can have four concubines with "bi" title, nine concubines with "bin" title, and 27 with "sebu" title.

94
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:04,510
But since there are so few ladies in the inner court what do you think of adding imperial concubines?

95
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,970
Imperial concubines?

96
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,420
His Majesty is ill, how can you speak of imperial concubines?

97
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,700
Imperial concubines are about the dignity of the emperor.

98
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,260
This is why you need imperial concubines more than ever, Your Majesty.

99
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,090
- We were fine without any imperial concubines—
- Your Majesty,

100
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,410
please compose yourself.

101
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:38,050
- Keep speaking.
- So we magistrates discussed amongst ourselves

102
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,820
and considered submitting candidates that represent each province.

103
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,640
We will submit candidates and after a fair selection process

104
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,670
the imperial concubines will be elected. How about that?

105
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:58,380
Since Her Majesty has even given birth to an heir, this is the right time!

106
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,850
Do that then.

107
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,800
- Father!
- Father!

108
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,970
Anything else?

109
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,710
Empress Dowager is in charge of selecting the imperial concubines.

110
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,900
Who will take on that great task when she's been deposed?

111
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,420
I will do it myself.

112
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,840
Your Majesty cannot select the imperial concubines!

113
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,540
How about bringing back Empress Dowager from Gameop Temple?

114
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,460
Do you not know what sin she committed?

115
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,730
I heard there has been no proof that she was directly involved in Bang Jin and Joo Guk Cheong's revolt.

116
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,590
Moreover, she's the lawful wife of the late Emperor Mingzong

117
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:54,510
who is the most respected of all our past emperors.

118
00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:00,360
Even for the sake of an official process in the selection of imperial concubines, I think it's only right that she be reinstated.

119
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,260
Please hear our request, Prime Minister!

120
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,290
Please hear our request, Prime Minister!

121
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:27,100
How could I deny your loyal concern for the imperial family?

122
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,280
Reinstate Empress Dowager and select new imperial concubines.

123
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,980
Father...

124
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:46,910
Now, since I've listened to your requests, let's all have a round of drinks!

125
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,880
Prime Minister, we wish you a long and healthy life!

126
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,430
We wish you a long and healthy life, Prime Minister!

127
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,030
That's quite right!

128
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,250
The magistrates wish for family ties to the imperial family.

129
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,120
Empress Dowager used their ambitions to her advantage.

130
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,880
But don't you think the Prime Minister allowed it too easily?

131
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,830
I also was taken aback by that, too.

132
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,770
Do you think he's got an ulterior motive?

133
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,600
To the magistrates, it's a plan to have the Emperor become their son-in-law.

134
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,400
But to the Prime Minister, imperial concubines could become hostages for him to use against them.

135
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,560
Hostages?

136
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,060
Yuan is a vast land. How can you prevent

137
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,500
anyone from sharpening their swords and getting on their horses in faraway places?

138
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:03,010
If we can keep those magistrates' daughters within the palace, there are no better hostages than them.

139
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,770
Then trying to marry Wang Yoo into the family was also...

140
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:12,020
I plan on getting rid of Goryeo's sovereignty and make it a part of Liaoyang.

141
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,340
We need to start handling Wang Yoo well.

142
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,270
She is Prime Minister El Temur's niece. Even if for your restoration,

143
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,170
it's a marriage that's necessary.

144
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,610
Could you not do it even for my sake?

145
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,830
- On one condition.
- Tell me.

146
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:44,620
When I go back to Yuan after the wedding, I will return alone.

147
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,340
You want to leave your bride here?

148
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:55,560
It's an arranged marriage, so I don't think El Temur will oppose it.

149
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,310
Why did you change your mind?

150
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,250
In order to aim for the heart, I have to be in the arms of the enemy.

151
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,030
I will destroy El Temur and his children

152
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,820
and avenge Seung Nyang's death.

153
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:35,910
Sir... Was your trip to Yeongyeong successful?

154
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,270
Go ahead of me.

155
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,360
How was she captured?

156
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,050
She was running away from someone in the hills. Do you know her?

157
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,300
She's not someone who should be sold as a slave. Let her go.

158
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,260
I cannot.

159
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,050
Why not? Even if the magistrate is asking?

160
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:45,290
It's the Hawk House's principle. If you must have her,

161
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,550
please participate in the sale of slaves.

162
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,690
But she's someone I am especially taking care of,

163
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,670
so she will be quite expensive.

164
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,290
Then, farewell.

165
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,330
- We need to save Yang.
- You'll participate in the sale?

166
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:16,690
It's thanks to her that I became the magistrate of this province. If she hadn't warned us that El Temur was alive,

167
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,960
I would have met the same fate as Bang Jin and Joo Guk Cheong.

168
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,920
You've traveled very far. And the ginseng?

169
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,420
I bought up all the ginseng in Goryeo so there's none left.

170
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:47,450
The chief will be very pleased. But could you do me another favor?

171
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,950
Favor?

172
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,520
- 33.
- 35!

173
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,890
- 40!
- 45!

174
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,320
50 over here!

175
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,400
50. It's at 50 now.

176
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,290
Anyone else?

177
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,640
50 is the selling bid!

178
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,330
As long as we stay alive,

179
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,680
I'm sure we'll meet again somewhere.

180
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,450
Next.

181
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,700
More precious than a treasure

182
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,770
are eyes that can recognize a true treasure.

183
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:43,460
There should be a pair of eyes here that recognizes a treasure.

184
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:51,970
We're starting with 200 nyang of gold for this girl here.

185
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:58,990
- Isn't it too steep?
- He's basically saying he doesn't want to sell her.

186
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:04,020
- 250 nyang.
- 260.

187
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,460
- 300.
- 300?

188
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,820
Anyone else? Are you giving up?

189
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,820
350.

190
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,760
500.

191
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,500
500!

192
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,610
I think we're being tricked.

193
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,970
Bid more.

194
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,550
700.

195
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:42,110
- 1,000.
- We have 1,000!

196
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,070
That's too high. It's best that we give up now.

197
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,320
3,000!

198
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,790
Uncle!

199
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,740
We have 3,000!

200
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,540
3,000. Sold!

201
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,160
You spent an amount equal to a year's worth of provisions for our soldiers in one moment.

202
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,210
Think of it as the price for our lives she saved.

203
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:50,230
Thank you for saving me.

204
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,990
How did you end up getting brought here?

205
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,790
When Lady Park died,

206
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,940
I was with her.

207
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,150
She just fell asleep after looking after the crown prince all day.

208
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,130
I will bring him, so please wait here, Your Majesty.

209
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,780
The empress instigated the murder.

210
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:46,640
Lady Park and Yang both died because of you!

211
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,040
Your Majesty.

212
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,930
When did you get here?

213
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,840
His Majesty suffers from aphasia.

214
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,480
He found out that it was the empress's doing, so the shock was too great.

215
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,510
By that you mean... he cannot speak?

216
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:39,490
His mind is also in a fuddled state. The family has a history of dying young, so I'm concerned about what will happen to him.

217
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,180
Magistrate, Sir, General Tanqishi has arrived outside.

218
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,470
He doesn't know I'm alive.

219
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,260
Over here.

220
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:18,640
- What brings you here without any notice?
- I had to get some items for the marriage ceremony from Hawk House merchants,

221
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,920
so I stopped by while on my way to Goryeo.

222
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,220
Items for a marriage ceremony? Is someone getting married?

223
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,220
Our cousin is marrying into the Royal Family of Goryeo.

224
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,810
Who is going to be her husband?

225
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,550
It's Wang Yoo.

226
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,690
Wang Yoo accepted the marriage proposal?

227
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,530
He dreams of being reinstated to the throne. There's no reason for him to reject it.

228
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:47,610
Once he's reinstated, we won't be able to see him in Yuan. Give him our congratulations.

229
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,180
There will be an imperial concubine selection soon. Who are you sending from here?

230
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,080
I'm concerned that there isn't a suitable person.

231
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,810
When you get back to Goryeo, please give this to my mother.

232
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,600
All right.

233
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,980
Mine too.

234
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,410
Mother, it's Giok, the youngest.

235
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,290
I couldn't write all this time since you can't read,

236
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:51,640
but Yang who's giving this letter to you said she would read it for you so I'm sending it.

237
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,910
I eat well here without any suffering, so don't worry.

238
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,160
Mother, it's soon the anniversary of father's death.

239
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,380
You're not still crying in secret on his death anniversary, are you?

240
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,740
I heard that brother has married.

241
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,680
I will save up all my money earned here,

242
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,920
and send it to you soon.

243
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:24,690
I miss you, Mother. I miss you so much.

244
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,880
Who are you going to send to the imperial concubine selection?

245
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,950
Sending my niece doesn't feel right.

246
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:19,560
If we don't send a candidate, we'll become the laughing stock of the other magistrates.

247
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,760
Who is there?!

248
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,230
Why are you not sleeping?

249
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,770
Please send me to the imperial concubine selection.

250
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,570
- You said you were going to Goryeo.
- I will stay here.

251
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,900
You must be insane. Get out of here right now.

252
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:03,730
Hold on. What's the reason you want to become an imperial concubine? Do you wish for wealth and honor?

253
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:10,310
In all the world, there's no one else who has a bigger resentment than I do toward El Temur's family.

254
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,820
You don't get revenge by the size of your resentment.

255
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:19,800
Even if it's like piercing a rock with rainwater, I will achieve it.

256
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,000
Please allow it, Magistrate.

257
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,420
- We don't want any future trouble because of you. Get out of here right—
- Tell me how.

258
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,000
It's extremely dangerous and could even bring about your dismissal!

259
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,820
- If I like your method, I will send you as my imperial concubine candidate.
- Uncle...

260
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,620
First, we need to establish the emperor's authority. Only then

261
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,680
will we have the justification to stand against El Temur.

262
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:54,750
You know it well. But there's no one right now who can wake up the emperor. I know he has great affection for you,

263
00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:01,270
but if you think your plan on waking him up just by wrapping him up in your skirt, you can forget it.

264
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:09,370
I... have the bloodletter.

265
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,780
Bloodletter?

266
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,130
Did you just say bloodletter?

267
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,250
How can you prove that this is the real bloodletter?

268
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,310
There's a drawing of a butterfly in the lower corner.

269
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:41,740
The emperor will know that's the signature of the late Emperor Mingzong.

270
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,760
- How do you know that?
- I heard it from Jeok Ho.

271
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,420
You met Jeok Ho?

272
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:55,390
The man named Mak Saeng who was captured with me was Jeok Ho.

273
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:01,010
It's a letter of request written in blood from father to son. With this bloodletter,

274
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:07,100
we can wake the emperor up from his unenlightened state.

275
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,030
I'm against it.

276
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,300
We have seen what she's capable of since our days on Daecheong Island.

277
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,650
You praised her endlessly, too. Why are you against it?

278
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,820
When she was a subordinate, her abilities were flawless.

279
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:44,490
But... if we put her above our heads, her abilities could become poison in the future.

280
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,500
She's just a girl from powerless Goryeo.

281
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,590
Have you not considered the fact that she should be feared more because she's from Goryeo?

282
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,440
I have made bids for victory, time and time again.

283
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,950
But they all resulted in failure. This is my last resolute decision.

284
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,890
I will bet everything on Yang.

285
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,370
I will give her the imperial concubine training. If you change your mind, let me know.

286
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:46,820
Your Highness, we congratulate you on your return to the palace.

287
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,930
We congratulate your return, Your Highness.

288
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:55,410
Thank you for all your hard work. Where is the emperor?

289
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:02,280
He hardly... steps out of his bed chambers.

290
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,890
Your Majesty...

291
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,790
You suffered so greatly.

292
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,930
Don't make too much of an effort.

293
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:53,900
I know full well what you're trying to say.

294
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,090
We'll begin again.

295
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,210
I returned, haven't I?

296
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:10,250
Please gather up your courage.

297
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,800
Give up on the imperial concubine selection.

298
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:28,130
I want to know why you're opposed.

299
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,730
You're not our family. I can't leave the fate of our family in your hands.

300
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:37,950
I will never betray you in gratitude for your saving me.

301
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:46,420
People don't betray. Time does.

302
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,270
Behind the impressiveness of the Imperial Palace, death surely exists.

303
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,620
When the moment of choice comes, you'll definitely betray our family.

304
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,830
If I was scared to die, I could commit a betrayal.

305
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:08,090
But when Lady Park died,

306
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:13,760
I buried my fear along with my friends on the ground.

307
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:22,810
My biggest fear is only that I will fail to get revenge.

308
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,750
Isn't she impressive?

309
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:43,330
Whether etiquette or the arts, whatever I teach her, there's nothing she can't do.

310
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:49,360
It's one thing to have the talent, but her efforts are praiseworthy.

311
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,650
You should accept her will, too.

312
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,020
Do you call that a dance?

313
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:17,230
The girls who are entering the imperial concubine selection are from the best families in all of Yuan.

314
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,920
You won't have a chance with your meager talents,

315
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,150
so why don't you give up?

316
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:41,460
♫ Disappearing like something blowing and caught in my hand ♫

317
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,890
♫ You are as distant as a harsh wind ♫

318
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:48,070
Jeonchutaesan. Huakhomi.

319
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:52,230
Extend your hand with strength as if you are pushing a large mountain.

320
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:57,740
♫ At night when I clutched my chest and held my breath ♫

321
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,770
Jeonchutasan.

322
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,800
Huakhomi.

323
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,460
♫ In the darkness my day passed in sadness. ♫

324
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,990
Give me your hand.

325
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:15,790
♫ Even though they were hard to erase and
erase the painful memories ♫

326
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,750
There's no need to be disappointed.

327
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,230
To properly shoot baby arrows, it takes at least three years.

328
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:28,970
♫ Which are imagined again make our sad love sadder ♫

329
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:33,110
♫ No matter how I try and try to conceal them
the tears keep filling my eyes ♫

330
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:37,320
♫ No matter how I try and try to conceal them
the tears keep filling my eyes ♫

331
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,790
♫ What can I do about the longing  ♫

332
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:44,300
Your Majesty, Prime Minister El Temur's niece just now

333
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,250
arrived from Yuan.

334
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,790
♫ like tears?  ♫

335
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:57,130
You really never know what happens in life. You becoming a part of our family...

336
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,840
Seung Nyang has died.

337
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,870
Is that so?

338
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,540
But... how did she die?

339
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,790
I heard it was mountain bandits.

340
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:34,360
She was very bright. You must be very sad.

341
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,280
I have a request to make of you.

342
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,290
Tell me.

343
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:47,000
When I get back to Yeongyeong, I'm going to find the men who killed her

344
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,690
and kill them myself.

345
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,540
Please help me.

346
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,110
We're family now, aren't we?

347
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,390
Of course, I'll help you.

348
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:15,250
What's happening to my reinstatement?

349
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:20,420
Just wait. Father will give you good news.

350
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:32,270
Seung Nyang, I will bury you in my heart

351
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,540
and put your bitterness in my chest

352
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:41,530
and cause a thousand times more pain to these people who killed you.

353
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,800
Watch me, Seung Nyang.

354
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,520
[Sun Tzu 's Art of War] [Wu Zi's Art of War]

355
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,680
I have a question.

356
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,990
Between Sun Tzu 's Art of War and Wu Zi's Art of War, which one do you think is right?

357
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,400
Why are you reading books about the art of war?

358
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,160
When I was at the Imperial Palace, the covert fights happening in the palace

359
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,880
felt no different than what happens on the battlefield.

360
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,890
There's is no right or wrong.

361
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:09,300
Then... which one is the better of the two?

362
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,880
Wu Zi believes in military strategy,

363
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,820
and Sun Tzu tells us to send spies to the enemy or use their strengths against them.

364
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:31,080
In the actual fight, Sun Tzu's method is more valuable.

365
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:37,340
Recruiting soldiers and making a strong army takes too much time and money.

366
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:44,010
If you know it so well, why do you oppose me becoming an imperial concubine?

367
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:47,600
You recruiting soldiers to face El Temur is

368
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,140
Wu Zi's Art of War. Me becoming the imperial concubine and eliminating El Temur is

369
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,650
Sun Tzu's Art of War.

370
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:59,860
The Imperial Palace is a battlefield.

371
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,980
And what I'm trying to do is wage the actual battle.

372
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:09,550
If you truly want victory, don't oppose me.

373
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:14,760
So you asked the question knowing how I would answer.

374
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,550
I was disrespectful with what little knowledge I have.

375
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,850
["Han Feizi" by philosopher Han Fei]

376
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:40,740
"Han Feizi," it's one of the books you must read.

377
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:46,860
First, try to figure out my real intention for giving you this book.

378
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,320
Are you done reading it?

379
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,290
Yes.

380
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:07,520
Instead of talking about laws or ideas, just answer my questions.

381
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,410
What was in Han Feizi's text?

382
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:16,000
In this book was a method to read people's hearts.

383
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,560
Do I need to explain it more?

384
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,480
The Analects.
[The Analects of Confucius]

385
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,780
Figure out the meaning of this book as well.

386
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:40,220
What was in "The Analects"?

387
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:44,430
It had a method to govern people's hearts.

388
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,730
Am I wrong?

389
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:57,010
Stop... reading any more texts.

390
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:12,540
Yang is... a girl who General Tanqishi tried to kill.

391
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,700
Right now, Tanqishi and Talahai are in Goryeo.

392
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,990
By the time he returns, she will have already become an imperial concubine. What can he do about it?

393
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:25,590
She's our candidate, so it's as though we're rebelling against El Temur.

394
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:29,650
How will you handle the aftermath?

395
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:33,860
I have my own ways. Don't worry.

396
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:39,880
Toqto'a, there's nothing in this world you can attain safely.

397
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,390
The bigger the prize you seek, the more courage you need.

398
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,110
Right now is that time.

399
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:51,410
We can't gain anything by being fearful.

400
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,370
Yes, Uncle.

401
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,700
I understand.

402
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,830
So cute!

403
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,360
Buddha doesn't exist.

404
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,980
If you existed, you would not have taken Yang away from me, too.

405
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,120
You cannot make a world in which those wicked people are laughing!

406
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,110
Your Majesty!

407
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,770
Your Majesty! Please let go!

408
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,040
Are you done preparing?

409
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,020
Yes, Magistrate.

410
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,380
Have a safe trip.

411
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,410
I prayed that we'd be together forever.

412
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:07,540
That we died at the same time on the same day.

413
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,420
And even in death, that I can be by your side...

414
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,020
That's what I prayed for.

415
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:28,100
This is my last tear for you, Your Majesty.

416
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:35,430
Even if only for the sake of the powerless people of Goryeo, please be restored to the throne.

417
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,360
I will now take my own path.

418
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:46,430
On those who took away my father, my baby, and my friends,

419
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:50,630
I will get revenge in my own way.

420
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,830
Your Majesty, please do not be this way.

421
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:08,100
You must drink this medicine and speak again.

422
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,140
Did you tell him he's meeting with the imperial concubine candidates?

423
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,540
He knows.

424
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,980
Gather up your strength.

425
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:37,120
Do you wish to become a laughingstock to the imperial concubines from the first meeting?

426
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,760
Your Majesty, would you like to drink it?

427
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:00,160
Your Majesty.

428
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,300
Are all the candidates here?

429
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:07,690
Except for the adopted daughter of Commander Bayan of Liaoyang Province, everyone is gathered.

430
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:09,710
Why is that wench late?

431
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:16,130
Before Empress Dowager meets with the candidates, I think you should go.

432
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,600
You have the medicine ready?

433
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,240
It's ready for you.

434
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:29,280
Who cares whose daughters they are? How dare they try to become imperial concubines?

435
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,780
I heard that Her Majesty is very scary.

436
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,960
Really?

437
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,260
I heard that too.

438
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,630
Have you heard the rumors? Her Majesty is supposed to be very scary.

439
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:43,110
His Majesty doesn't speak at all because of Her Majesty.

440
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:47,160
It's a problem even if I become an imperial concubine. Maybe I should drop out.

441
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,920
Her Majesty, the Empress!

442
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:03,260
We give our greetings to Your Majesty.

443
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,480
You came a long way.

444
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,630
The test to become an imperial concubine will begin tomorrow.

445
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:27,400
You can't tense up already.

446
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,560
- Court Lady Seo.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

447
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,470
Bring them in.

448
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:41,340
Take one each.

449
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:50,580
Drink up.

450
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,690
Court Lady Seo.

451
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,920
Are they all deaf?

452
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:05,440
If they aren't deaf, then they're treating you with disdain.

453
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,360
Hurry and drink it up!

454
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,650
We deserve to die.

455
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:11,950
Die?

456
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:18,470
Oh, I see. You are suspicious of me.

457
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:22,920
Why? Did you think I would give you poison to drink?

458
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:43,750
I gave you all a tonic to help ease your nervousness.

459
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,690
How dare you ignore my goodwill?

460
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:51,920
And you believe you're fit to become imperial concubines?!

461
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:58,030
Kneel down and hold the tonic over your heads.

462
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:59,990
Right now!

463
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,270
We've arrived.

464
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,270
Won't you regret it? The moment you come down from the palanquin

465
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:33,280
and set foot in this palace, you will begin a path from which you can never return.

466
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:38,460
I won't regret it.

467
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:05,090
From now on, it will be a long fight.

468
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:07,390
It's something I've been ready for.

469
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,070
I see that you're just getting here.

470
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,740
Why are you leaving already?

471
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,700
I've done what I have to.

472
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:04,000
Mix the medicine in their tonic next time around.

473
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

474
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:10,590
They will all drink it without any suspicion.

475
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:15,950
His Majesty only needs my son as his offspring.

476
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:20,260
No wench should ever carry his child.

477
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,700
What are you doing?

478
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,020
Everyone get up.

479
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,690
Is this the empress's doing?

480
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,190
It's all right, so relax.

481
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:04,180
But... why is one candidate not here yet?

482
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,340
I apologize I'm late.

483
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,800
From Liaoyang Province, I'm Ki Yang.

484
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:45,140
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

485
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,680
Do you see any signs of him speaking again?

486
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,400
I apologize, Your Highness.

487
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,660
Your Majesty, just bear with it for a moment even if it's difficult.

488
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:01,350
Selecting the imperial concubine is important for the future.

489
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:07,730
Only give a flower to the ones I signal and hand money pouches to the others.

490
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:12,300
The chosen ones receive the flowers and the eliminated get the money pouches.

491
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,020
Understand, Your Majesty?

492
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:27,960
Your Majesty, here are the candidates for the imperial concubine.

493
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,570
Yang.

494
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,480
Yangyang...

495
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,330
Y-Yangyang...

496
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:35,900
♫ No matter how I try and try to conceal them  ♫

497
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:40,040
♫ the tears keep filling my eyes ♫

498
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:47,600
♫ What can I do about the longing which runs and overflows  ♫
