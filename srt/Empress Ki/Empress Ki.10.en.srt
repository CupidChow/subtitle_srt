1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,620
Your Majesty, what do you mean an imperial concubine?

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,010
That's nonsense for a lowly palace maid.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,280
Nonsense, you say?

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,380
She is carrying the child of the emperor.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,370
Even the fifth rank of an imperial concubine isn't enough.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,490
What's the matter? Come to your senses!

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,310
What are you doing? Get a doctor!

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,780
Is she well?

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,920
Please make a resolute decision, Your Majesty.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,130
Yes. Please issue your Imperial command.

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,290
She doesn't have a deadly illness, does she?

12
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,810
Your Majesty!

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,610
Are you listening?

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,570
Yes... So what did you decide to do?

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,280
What do you mean? We were waiting for your decision.

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,960
I will do what the two of you want.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,990
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,030
Is Golta out there? Get me some cold water!

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,240
Your Majesty, you can never do this until the day I die.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,350
Just know that.

22
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,560
Your Majesty, you don't need to consider the empress's feelings on this issue.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,600
Install Lady Park as your imperial concubine, understand?

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,350
She dismisses me just because I look weak and soft.

25
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,670
Empress Dowager, it was your mistake to disturb me.

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,450
It's time you shed tears of blood.

27
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,800
Impertinence. How dare she try to teach me?

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,500
She will be begging for me to spare her.

29
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,990
Those two women are depleting all my energy.

30
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,930
I will get some tonic made that restores your energy.

31
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,730
No, never mind.

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,590
This is more important.

33
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,810
Find out what happened to the girl who fainted on the palace grounds.

34
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,540
Your Majesty, have you taken a liking to her?

35
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,870
What do you mean?

36
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,800
Don't... Don't even say anything of the kind.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,950
I'm scared the empress might hear of it.

38
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,470
But why would you care about a lowly girl like her?

39
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,540
I said... she looks a lot like the kid who saved my life in Goryeo.

40
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,950
Whenever I see her, I don't feel suffocated anymore and can breathe.

41
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,630
If that's so, how about having her serve you?

42
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,770
Are you telling me to bring her to the emperor's palace from the inner court?

43
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,250
Those who serve in the emperor's palace get more of a stipend and work more comfortably that

44
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,620
they fight to come here, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,810
That girl sure would be very happy then.

46
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,140
I'm certain she will be moved over and over again by your imperial grace.

47
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,780
That's good. Then let's do that.

48
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,270
She will be moved over and over again?

49
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,820
Your Majesty!

50
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,420
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,780
Do you still have the ornament I gave you?

52
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,900
I will never forget your kindness and remember it until I die and become a skeleton.

54
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,330
Well, that won't do.

55
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:10,670
No. Until my bones break and become dust, you have my undying loyalty.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,380
Don't let your bones break, just be loyal to me.

57
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,670
Your grace knows no bounds, Your Majesty.

58
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,620
Your grace knows no bounds, Your Majesty.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,690
Your grace knows no bounds!

60
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,090
Your grace knows no bounds!

61
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,650
It would have been nice if she were Seung Nyang.

62
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,850
I wonder if he's living well.

63
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,650
You're here, Sir.

64
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,420
Have there been any changes?

65
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,730
She woke up earlier but fell back asleep.

66
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,270
Not being able to take care of your own health is considered disloyalty in the palace.

67
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,890
As soon as she wakes up, tell me.

68
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,260
Yes, Sir.

69
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,010
Your Majesty, where are you?

70
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,810
I miss you.

71
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,770
Your Majesty.

72
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,620
Tonight, I will take your head.

73
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,390
Your Majesty.

74
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,750
The attack has begun.

75
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,940
Into position!

76
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,150
They're advancing!

77
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,620
Retreat!

78
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,750
Don't chase them too far.

79
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,690
If we stand guard at the crossroads, they will come back out again.

80
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,670
Understood.

81
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,070
It's a trap! Trap!

82
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,540
Retreat! Retreat!

83
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,640
It's a trap!

84
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,960
It's now. Hit it!

85
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,580
Attack!

86
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,560
Where is that coming from?

87
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,910
It's the hill to the east.

88
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,380
Is there a fight?

89
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,180
If you listen, the screams are endless.

90
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,290
Whose screams are they? The Turks or the slaves?

91
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,960
I think Wang Yoo got ambushed while in pursuit of the Turks.

92
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:45,270
Fool. He followed the enemy to their camp blinded by his own ambition.

93
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,360
Yeom Byeong Soo followed them, didn't he?

94
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,290
Yes, General.

95
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:55,710
Even if the deposed king survives by the luck of the heavens, he will die by Yeom Byeong Soo's sword.

96
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,520
But are you sure they're coming this way?

97
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,910
Hey, I made this map!

98
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,340
The Turks will have to come this way.

99
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,830
Look, it's Baghatur!

100
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:43,350
Baghatur! I will cut off his head!

101
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,230
Attack!

102
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,010
There's a body over here!

103
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,350
They were massacred.

104
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,460
They're all the bodies of the Turks!

105
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,370
What happened? The screams in the night belonged to the Turks?

106
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,970
Ge-General.

107
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,070
We were collecting their weapons, so we're late.

108
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,780
What's that horse?

109
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,170
It's the horse that enemy commander Baghatur was riding.

110
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,590
Baghatur?

111
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,990
Did you kill him, too?

112
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,310
General!

113
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,020
Hundreds of our soldiers died.

114
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,810
But where's Bang and Jeom Bak?

115
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,090
They died with

116
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,240
honor.

117
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,520
Died?

118
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,890
The best news I've heard late—

119
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,990
Your Majesty, have you been well?

120
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,900
It's been a while, General Tanqishi.

121
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,140
Why did you call for me, Your Majesty?

122
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,440
You must remember a kid named Seung Nyang.

123
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,410
I told you to release him from prison when I was on my way back to Yuan.

124
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,290
Yes, Your Majesty. I remember well.

125
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,810
If you have any news of him, tell me.

126
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,250
Whether he got married, where he's living, and what he is doing.

127
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:49,030
According to the envoy in Goryeo, he's living well with his siblings in his hometown.

128
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,240
I see.

129
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,050
But... why are you asking?

130
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,740
Nothing. I suddenly...

131
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,000
wondered how he was doing.

132
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,350
You're the emperor of our Great Empire.

133
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,120
You should forget everything that happened in Goryeo.

134
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:19,040
Before he finds out, I need to take Seung Nyang away as soon as possible.

135
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,870
His Imperial Majesty is coming!

136
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,530
You over there.

137
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,350
You, I said.

138
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,230
His Majesty is addressing you.

139
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,100
Do you still have the ornament I gave you?

140
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,360
I lost it.

141
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,040
You wench. How dare you lose something His Majesty—

142
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,390
I'm going to the back garden. Have this girl prepare some tea.

143
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:37,100
He especially picked you as a servant in the emperor's palace. Were you aware of it?

145
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,230
Yes, I was.

146
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,600
Is that all?

147
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,430
Wench, if you've received the imperial grace of the emperor—

148
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,990
Never mind. Has it been difficult working in the imperial palace?

149
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,350
If you need anything, just tell me; whatever it is.

150
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,930
I apologize, but I want to return to the concubines' quarters.

151
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,050
You-You don't like it here?

152
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,270
I liked working in the concubines' quarters better.

153
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,740
Do you call this tea? It's already cold!

154
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,830
I will bring it again.

155
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,070
Never mind, so take the tea tray away!

156
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:45,010
Well, what happened? You... said she would be moved again and...

157
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,820
I know. My goodness, she's so tactless.

158
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,710
Your Majesty, are you awake?

159
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,260
Wait. Everyone out.

160
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,560
You.

161
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,280
You do it.

162
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,520
Ouch. Be gentle.

163
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,080
I will apply the oil now.

164
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,850
Hey!

165
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,770
Ouch! Ouch!

166
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,960
This wench!

167
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,160
Here. Massage it.

168
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,570
How could you look so much alike?

169
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,820
Why don't you like working here?

170
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,340
I heard it pays better and it's easier work.

171
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,540
For what reason do you keep wanting to go back to— Ou-Ouch!

172
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,540
That hurts!

173
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,870
Your Majesty!

174
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,210
I apologize, Your Majesty.

175
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,570
What kind of a girl is so rough?

176
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,180
I will punish this wench right away.

177
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,400
No. You may leave.

178
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,420
I think she needs to be returned to the concubines' quarters.

179
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,630
She even behaves just like Seung Nyang.

180
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,760
There's a way... to deal with someone like her.

181
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,740
It's hot!

182
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,380
Now I'm less hot.

183
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,380
Oh, it's hot.

184
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,140
It's cold.

185
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,340
I think it's getting hot again.

186
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,920
Cold, cold, cold, cold.

187
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,940
Cold, cold, cold!

188
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,260
Can't you even use a fan properly?

189
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,010
That I can't kill you right now,

190
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,600
is my eternal regret.

191
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,100
The way you're looking at me is very unpleasant.

192
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,160
This is how I always look.

193
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,430
Oh, I see. Then, why don't you try smiling?

194
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,010
Don't you know how to?

195
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,950
I said try smiling.

196
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,320
Who told you to make a sound and laugh?

197
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,860
I just meant smile prettily.

198
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,280
Your Majesty.

199
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:17,100
Your Majesty, the prime minister is looking for you.

200
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,360
What is it about?

201
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,770
Do you want to run the country?

202
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,300
Oh, no. Running the country is your job.

203
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,380
Wh-Where else do you need the seal?

204
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,100
You can never give her rank as an imperial concubine.

205
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,820
Tonight, sleep at the empress's palace.

206
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,420
Even the kitchen servants are talking about how you keep your distance from the empress.

207
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,920
That humiliation affects me is what I'm saying.

208
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,960
Yes. I should go.

209
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,010
I will go.

210
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,470
It's not over there.

211
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,370
It's here.

212
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,230
Your Majesty, His Majesty is here.

213
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,570
Please show him in.

214
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,130
I will take care of him, so, everyone, stay out.

215
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

216
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,990
Why aren't you looking at me?

217
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,790
I would like you... to disrobe me.

218
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,850
Please.

219
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,040
Extinguish the candles.

220
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,550
The body contains the heart, they say,

221
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:21,090
but the one who embraced me in the night was not the emperor

222
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,900
but his empty shell.

223
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,260
Your Majesty, I heard you slept in the empress's quarters.

224
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,010
I understand how you feel.

225
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,880
Don't worry. The empress will never get pregnant.

226
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,960
I made it so. So you just—

227
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,430
Who am I really?

228
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,600
What do I do in this palace?

229
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,070
For what do I eat, sleep, and breathe?

230
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,900
- Your Majesty.
- I'm asking, why do I live?

231
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,100
Exactly, why?

232
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,130
You're just waiting for the right moment.

233
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:33,780
You can wait for the right moment, but you need to make your own opportunities. To do that, you need courage.

234
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,150
Please be strong.

235
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:40,830
That's all I can tell you.

236
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,330
There was a kid who looked very similar to you.

237
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,320
That kid probably hates me,

238
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,330
but he was my only friend.

239
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,050
One time, that kid and I were being

240
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:38,620
pursued by people who wanted to kill me.

241
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:43,800
I thought we were going to die when we arrived at the edge of a cliff.

242
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,720
But that kid shouted at me.

243
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,630
In order to become the emperor, what have you done until now?

244
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,020
I-I-I—

245
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,000
You just wanted your brother to die.

246
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,360
That's why... you're in this situation right now.

247
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,240
If you want to live,

248
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,490
if you want to become the emperor, you must jump.

249
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,560
So do you know what happened?

250
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,330
I did it, Seung Nyang!

251
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,980
That was the first time... I protected my own life.

252
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:38,790
That was the only time I'd ever done something for myself.

253
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,420
Please become that kid

254
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,810
and give me courage.

255
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,880
Please become Seung Nyang

256
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,150
and help me.

257
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:11,880
That's not something I can do.

258
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,400
I apologize.

259
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,510
Fine.

260
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,700
Fine. You're right.

261
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,780
You're not Seung Nyang after all.

262
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,120
I was mistaken.

263
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,310
Very much so.

264
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,200
Is Golta out there?

265
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

266
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,220
Send this girl back to the concubines' quarters.

267
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,290
Follow me.

268
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,330
You brought us our first victory.

269
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,950
It's not a war I won on my own.

270
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,980
If you want to give credit, give it to my soldiers.

271
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,520
Toqto'a, give the soldiers drinks and meat.

272
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,400
Yes, Uncle.

273
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,610
You prevented our soldiers from having a significant loss.

274
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:21,320
And they will no longer come every night and make noise.

275
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,220
Let's have a drink.

276
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,670
There is an outstanding plotter in their midst.

277
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,670
Bayan of Merkid is a courageous fighter but not one who uses his head.

278
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,550
By the side of that bastard, Bayan, is his nephew, Toqto’a.

279
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,990
Toqto’a...

280
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:44,990
There's secret intel that his intellect is outstanding.

281
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,440
The one who caused us to fail was someone who was leading the foreign legions.

282
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,730
If it was Toqto’a's idea,

283
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,650
Bayan would have taken the lead himself.

284
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:06,230
Then, who was it?

285
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,070
Whoever he is,

286
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,290
he won't be able to figure out our plans.

287
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,710
Baghatur's horse, it's a rare specimen, as we've heard.

288
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:43,800
That may be a great horse, but His Majesty's riding skills are also outstanding.

289
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,810
How about we compete since we're both on horseback?

290
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:58,390
Get your sword. I'd like a duel.

291
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,690
Show your swordsmanship to the enemy.

292
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:07,320
Just because you won once, somehow your arrogance has gone through the roof.

293
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,310
General!

294
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,740
Are you hurt?

295
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,960
Is that damn horse crazy?

296
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,900
What's going on?

297
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:37,420
Calm down!

298
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,670
Calm down!

299
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,040
Come on!

300
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:46,620
I heard that they eat and sleep on running horses, but they keep falling off these days one by one.

301
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,090
Did someone else fall off?

302
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:53,210
Earlier, a Yuan soldier fell off and broke his leg.

303
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,390
Aren't those Turks over there?

304
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,760
They don't look like prisoners of war.

305
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,330
It was drawn up by our spies.

306
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,380
This is the bastards' main encampment.

307
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,550
Three sides are surrounded by mountains and rugged terrain.

308
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,650
In the front, there's a narrow canyon.

309
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,990
It is worthy of being called a natural fortress.

310
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,460
Around how many soldiers did he say there were?

311
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,240
Easily surpasses 5,000.

312
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,960
Five thousand. The opponent's manpower is more than we had thought.

313
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,740
Even if we attack the base camp directly, it will be hard to guarantee a win.

314
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,480
In order to catch a raccoon in a cave, we need to stoke a fire.

315
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,720
Why don't you lure them?

316
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,120
Baghatur knows your face. When he sees you,

317
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,150
he will grit his teeth to pursue you.

318
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:54,550
When they empty their encampment, we will invade it.

319
00:35:55,790 --> 00:36:01,060
Trying to use us as bait and then steal all the achievements.

320
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,250
General!

321
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,670
The Turks have come again.

322
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:20,010
We put some men in the hills, so there won't be a repeat of what happened.

323
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:30,290
Such dogged bastards. Have they been possessed by a ghost who died while playing a gong?

324
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,740
Isn't it strange? Coming back after all that damage.

325
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,880
I'm sure there's another goal in mind besides keeping us from sleeping.

326
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,350
Then why are they...

327
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:46,510
Baghatur, what is it that you are after?

328
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:51,640
Don't get too full of yourself over your first victory. Soon

329
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,550
there will be a bloody revenge.

330
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,320
You need to come with me.

331
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,200
Whoa!

332
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,560
Whoa!

333
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,110
There's something wrong with the horses.

334
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,590
It's not just the soldiers who are lacking sleep.

335
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:28,860
Then... the reason for all that noise day and night is to prevent the horses from sleeping?

336
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,920
The enemy will attack first with their cavalrymen.

337
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,210
If the horses can't go into battle, it's no different than us fighting while sitting.

338
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:42,590
Don't tell anyone about this.

339
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

340
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:49,600
Baghatur is more persistent than imagined.

341
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,750
Going after the horses...

342
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,920
Are you sure she's definitely pregnant?

343
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,630
Yes. I checked with the physician.

344
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:06,530
How am I supposed to live in this palace after being humiliated this way?

345
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,740
I can't let this slide even if this is an Inner Court matter.

346
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,420
You should stay away from this, Father.

347
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,880
I have a clever way... to deal with it.

348
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,630
A clever way?

349
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,960
I heard the servants who serve Park are all from Goryeo.

350
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,440
I'm sure Park's trust in them is like no other.

351
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,130
Are you planning to plant a spy amongst them?

352
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:34,200
Yes, Father. We can get rid of the Park wench and that headache of an empress dowager this time.

353
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,320
If you fail, it will return to us as poison.

354
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,530
So I have to put extra care into picking someone.

355
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:51,460
Your Imperial Majesty, you must listen to me well and carry out the plan without any deviation from this point.

356
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,520
Tell me, Older Brother.

357
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,470
Before we find a servant who can help us, she will need to pass a few tests.

358
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,980
Among the Park's servants,

359
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,520
bring me someone who knows how to read and write.

360
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,620
Yang must be upset.

361
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,980
From being a servant in the emperor's chambers to being back in the rear palace.

362
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,230
Tell me honestly.

363
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,860
You have powerful ties in the imperial palace, don't you?

364
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,050
If not, how could you go from the emperor's quarters--

365
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,490
Who's Yeon Hwa?

366
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,330
I am Yeon Hwa.

367
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,590
Come with me.

368
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,520
Why would Empress's Court Lady Seo take Yeon Hwa away?

369
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,090
No need to be nervous.

370
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,390
Take it.

371
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,830
In there are the names of the court ladies who have had private correspondences with the Kheshigs.

372
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:28,350
Take that letter and pass it on to the captain of the Kheshigs.

373
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,040
Many lives could end up dead,

374
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,730
so you must use the utmost care.

375
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,940
Yes, Your Imperial Majesty.

376
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:44,870
No one must know that I'm involved in this matter.

377
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,420
So that's why I'm asking you and not someone from the empress's palace.

378
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,100
I understand and will obey as you say.

379
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:55,740
Seeing how quickly she understood what you meant, she must be quite smart.

380
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,550
One more thing you must remember.

381
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:06,680
You must never read the contents of the letter, no matter what.

382
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,700
Understood?

383
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,840
I will do as ordered, Your Majesty.

384
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:23,710
When the court ladies are killed, you will need to replace them I see.

385
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,570
As I said, your cerebral connections are quite quick.

386
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:36,110
Just pass the letter well and I will recommend you as a court lady.

387
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,510
Really, you will?

388
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:41,760
Her Imperial Majesty the Empress seems to think well of you, too.

389
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,760
Thank you!

390
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,960
Thank you, Court Lady Seo.

391
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:59,120
People naturally want to look the more you tell them not to.

392
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:04,530
On top of that, the names of the court ladies who she'll step on to replace are listed there,

393
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,650
so how could you not take a look?

394
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:19,970
I'm dying to see. Who are the women who've been speaking to the Kheshigs in private?

395
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,060
What do I do?

396
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,280
What should I do?

397
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,540
I apologize Your Imperial Majesty.

398
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,860
I was passing by a pond and my foot slipped.

399
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,330
Perhaps, you took a look at the contents of the letter?

400
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,060
No, I did not.

401
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,240
Give her another letter.

402
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,150
Please spare me, Your Imperial Majesty.

403
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,700
Please spare me!

404
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,000
Go back to your dorm.

405
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:33,600
If you ever tell anyone about this,

406
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,580
you won't stay alive.

407
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,000
Yes, Your Majesty. Thank you!

408
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,160
Thank you!

409
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,600
How did you pick one that couldn't even pass the first test?

410
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,450
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

411
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,230
Search again.

412
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,200
Yes.

413
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,120
Your Majesty.

414
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:12,160
Welcome. Did anyone see you?

415
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,850
The guards are all our men. Don't worry, Sire.

416
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,770
It's finally time.

417
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:27,000
You two must carry out a very important duty.

418
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:46,430
If you follow the horse that Baghatur rode,

419
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,130
you'll surely be able to find the enemy's base camp.

420
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,360
You want us to stand with the Turks?

421
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,870
This war isn't with the Turks.

422
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:06,720
Our war is with General Bayan of Merkid, for possession of the Silk Road.

423
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,680
So we must catch Baghatur with our own hands.

424
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,120
But...

425
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,810
would they trust us?

426
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:19,000
If you do as I tell you,

427
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,030
you'll surely succeed.

428
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,820
Open the gates!

429
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,770
Who are you?

430
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,930
I came to see General Baghatur.

431
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,210
You don't know who I am... it seems.

432
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,830
Listen carefully.

433
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:56,490
To tell you about this person right here—

434
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,950
No! Let go you, bastards!

435
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:04,700
These bastards!

436
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,900
They surrendered at the camp?

437
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,160
Yes. They came on the military horse that you had lost, General.

438
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,650
Are they foot soldiers?

439
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:20,280
They tell me they are military strategists.

440
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,850
Military strategists?

441
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,290
Why did he tell me to shave my head for no reason?

442
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,950
It's grown back a lot, though.

443
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,000
What brings you here?

444
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,630
This is...

445
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,020
not someone who would speak with the likes of you.

446
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,350
Bring me General Baghatur right now!

447
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,390
I serve the general.

448
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:55,550
If you have something tell him, tell me.

449
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,290
How regrettable.

450
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:01,050
What a shame.

451
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:07,220
I wished to meet a legitimate master to conquer the universe,

452
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,010
so I even castrated myself and studied.

453
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,490
How regretful.

454
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,540
What do you mean castrated?

455
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,520
Sima Qian was castrated as well

456
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,240
and wrote the great work, "Records of the Grand Historian."

457
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,050
So I also cut off all my desires

458
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,770
and only studied astronomical geography and the military arts.

459
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:36,680
However, what I thought was a good omen turned into a crow! How pitiful!

460
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,960
It's so regretful.

461
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,800
So regretful.

462
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,230
How can I trust you two?

463
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,950
What is the use of having a steely horse nearby?

464
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,700
They are all illiterate.

465
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:55,200
There is no way they can read letters.

466
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,890
Sir, please.

467
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,230
So regretful.

468
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:08,720
General, I think they are spies. Shall I get rid of them?

469
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,030
It's not too late to be rid of them after confirmation.

470
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,420
How did I do?

471
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,770
Were you a snake-oil salesman before? All that male vigor went to your mouth!

472
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:25,860
Shut up, bastard. But...

473
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,770
that person just earlier was a girl, right?

474
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:32,840
Yes, there's no mistake.

475
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,420
Oh... it really hurts.

476
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,020
A girl? Girl.

477
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,320
I am worried whether Eunuch Bang has died.

478
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,790
If he succeeds, it is a relief, but the mission itself is full of danger.

479
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,120
Seung Nyang, wait for just a little while.

480
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:06,630
I will definitely stay alive to meet you again.

481
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,630
Long time no see, Seung Nyang.

482
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,050
Ah, they call you Yang here, I heard.

483
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:28,630
Your face has gotten very rough.

484
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:37,290
That hot temper of yours is still the same, I see.

485
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:47,520
Seeing that child, General Tanqishi is probably very surprised, too.

486
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,810
Seung Nyang!

487
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,830
Could this person be...?

488
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,310
There's no way.

489
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,470
Seung Nyang is a man.

490
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:59,250
Moreover, they said he's in Goryeo.

491
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,710
Your Imperial Majesty, are you all right?

492
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,580
Send a person to Goryeo.

493
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:11,950
Pardon? Find the man named Seung Nyang and have them bring him directly to me.

494
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,680
Understood?

495
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:31,090
Out of the maids from Goryeo, the only one who knows letters is this child.

496
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:36,950
But why does Empress's palace keep seeking them out?

497
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:40,260
It's nothing, Elder Chief Eunuch.

498
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,330
Please follow me momentarily.

499
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,170
Your Imperial Majesty the Empress.

500
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,400
You... Aren't you the one from the garden?

501
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,010
There is only this child remaining.

502
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,530
How about you trust her?

503
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:24,510
Please send this discretely to the captain of the Kheshigs.

504
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:28,220
If you successfully complete this mission, I will have you promoted to a court lady.

505
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,450
I am not interested in becoming a court lady.

506
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:37,730
Instead, let me leave the imperial palace.

507
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,160
Since she is Her Imperial Majesty the Empress, she should be able to do so.

508
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,780
I will try telling her that.

509
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,310
Thank you, Court Lady Seo.

510
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,430
That child is not to my heart's liking.

511
00:52:55,430 --> 00:53:00,450
If she were to seduce His Imperial Majesty after I needlessly promote her to a court lady...

512
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,470
She says she doesn't want to be a court lady.

513
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:10,500
Her request is to leave the imperial palace.

514
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,200
Her gaze also displeases me.

515
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,210
For sure, she will open the envelope I gave her.

516
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:56,110
Kill the one who relays this letter.

517
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:03,180
There's no reason for the empress to kill me.

518
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,770
Then, what does this mean?

519
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,890
There's only this child remaining.

520
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:12,450
How about trusting her one time?

521
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,970
It's a test.

522
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:17,530
She's attempting to test me.

523
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,290
Damn it.

524
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:26,050
It looks like I'll be sucked into another nuisance.

525
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:41,390
What? That child has met the captain of the Kheshigs?

526
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:45,410
There is no doubt she didn't read the letter.

527
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:52,750
She has passed the first test, but she won't be able to pass the second.

528
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:58,190
Who sent this?

529
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,590
I don't know.

530
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,180
Do you know the contents of this letter?

531
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:05,730
It's a conspiracy to burn down the imperial palace.

532
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,880
It's different from what was written in the letter.

533
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,890
If you do not open your lips, I will punish you for conspiring in treason.

534
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,840
It's certain I am being tested.

535
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:29,280
If you'd like to live, reveal who sent this letter.

536
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,340
I don't know, so how would I be able to gather those words on my lips?

537
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:36,540
This bitch truly has a death wish.

538
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,970
She did not open her mouth to the end.

539
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:50,840
Next time, I will truly have your neck.

540
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,810
That's enough, stop!

541
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:15,680
Why did you not report that I had ordered you?

542
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,130
I simply obeyed your command, Your Imperial Majesty the Empress.

543
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:29,430
Even risking your life to keep trust with me, that is strange.

544
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:34,130
I was taught that trust is something that is always kept.

545
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,880
Not keeping trust would be a strange thing.

546
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,080
You're refusing to be a court lady?

547
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,520
Why is it you wish to leave the palace and go outside?

548
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,910
I must go outside

549
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:50,860
and meet someone.

550
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:56,710
There is someone you have in your heart.

551
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,310
If you help me... I'll let you meet that person.

552
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:16,240
What do I have to do?

553
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:36,470
The wench with the surname Park dares to carry the imperial seed of His Imperial Majesty.

554
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,930
Go... feed this to her.

555
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:58,600
♫  You are the love wind. You blow in ♫

556
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:05,500
♫You spread through my heart ♫

557
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,830
♫I love you ♫
