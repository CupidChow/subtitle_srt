1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,800
Your Majesty, our congratulations to you on Imperial Prince Maha's birthday.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,050
We congratulate you, Your Majesty!

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,520
Thank you, everyone.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,540
Your Majesty, please speak words of good wishes for our Maha.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,050
Your Majesty, how can we leave out your congratulatory message on the Imperial Prince's birthday?

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,110
Please say something, as the magistrates are here as well.

7
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,050
Golta, please bring Imperial Prince Ayu.

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,840
Your Majesty, today is our Maha's birthday.

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,400
Here...

11
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,180
It seems there is already so much interest in the investiture of the crown prince.

12
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,960
But I won't rush that.

13
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,480
When the princes have grown a few years more,

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,040
I will choose the crown prince after a rigorous selection process.

15
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,290
Your Majesty, what do you mean a selection?

16
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:25,080
Your Majesty, have you forgotten Emperor Kublai Khan's edict that the firstborn sons must inherit the throne?

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,780
The prime minister is the one who enthroned my younger brother before me.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,880
- It seems you're the one forgetting things.
- But Your Majesty—

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,960
I've told you my intentions, so no more discussion of the investiture of the crown prince.

20
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,500
I am a bit late, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,190
Welcome, Prime Minister.

22
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,050
Father.

23
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,430
Is that Lady Ki's child?

24
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,950
How handsome he is.

25
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,290
But it seems the guest of honor has changed for Prince Maha's birthday celebration.

26
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,490
What is going on?

27
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,590
She's a Buddhist nun with a burn scar on her face.

28
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,400
She must not have left the palace yet, so you must catch her no matter what.

29
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,110
Are you sure she was a Buddhist nun at Hwangak Temple?

30
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,600
If she wasn't, why would she run away?

31
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,240
If she was lucky enough survive, she should have kept herself hidden.

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,370
How dare she show up to try to steal my son?

33
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,550
I heard that the empress's fake son may become the crown prince,

34
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,290
so I came here to tell the truth.

35
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,940
Can you testify to what you just told me in the Imperial Palace?

36
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,400
Yes.

37
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,730
If only for the sake of our priests and nuns who were killed at that time, I will reveal the truth.

38
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,860
In order for you to be believed, there must be clear proof.

39
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,640
I know a secret about that child's body that only the empress and her court lady would know.

40
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:05,860
If I disclose it, I think it will be enough proof.

41
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,680
So what is the secret about his body?

42
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,100
On the top of his foot—
- Your Highness.

43
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,360
Her Majesty the Empress has brought soldiers, looking for the Buddhist nun.

44
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,370
- What soldiers?
- They are soldiers that Prime Minister brought with him.

45
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,340
So, Prime Minister has arrived?

46
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,210
Yes, Your Highness.

47
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,500
This isn't a good time, so I think the truth should be revealed after we form a more complete plan.

48
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,100
Which temple are you at?

49
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,670
I'm at Seoneop Temple outside the capital.

50
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,290
Eunuch Bang is staying near that temple.

51
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,090
He will attract less suspicion, so he could take the Buddhist nun and leave.

52
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,310
If the empress found out about you, Seoneop Temple is dangerous.

53
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,970
Is there anywhere else you can hide?

54
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,140
There is an underground tunnel in the mountains behind Seoneop Temple.

55
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,360
I will hide there.

56
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,790
Look in the library, too.

57
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,630
Your Highness, the empress and her people are coming this way.

58
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,760
Search in there, too.

59
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,160
What are you doing here, bringing soldiers?

60
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,340
That's none of your business.

61
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,230
But anyone would think this is strange.

62
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,580
You should be in the middle of Prince Maha's birthday celebration right now.

63
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,310
Why are you so interested in what I'm doing, anyway?

64
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:52,570
Maybe it's something you can't tell me about?

65
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,750
Let's go towards the West Gate.

66
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,690
Maybe she got away already?

67
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,410
We searched thoroughly, but there was no sign of her.

68
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,190
Seoneop Temple, was it? Send the soldiers that way.

69
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,190
I understand, Your Highness.

70
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,380
You should be safe here.

71
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,840
It's late, you should sleep here before you leave.

72
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,560
No, thank you. I will leave before the sun rises.

73
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,830
Thank you.

74
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,090
I heard from Eunuch Park

75
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,460
that the empress's son is not hers...

76
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:04,150
Don't worry. Eunuch Park and we are like family.

77
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,830
That is true.

78
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:15,620
Then the fire at Hwangak Temple was the empress's doing as well?

79
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,690
It's all because of me.

80
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,660
If only I hadn't brought that baby back from Turtle Rock two years ago...

81
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,700
Please drink before it gets cold.

82
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,260
Wait.

83
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,160
Turtle Rock... near Hwangak Temple...

84
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,750
Yes.

85
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:49,860
I was passing by and saw a baby in the arms of a man who fell to his death off the cliff.

86
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,910
I left Buddhist prayer beads on the body and brought the baby back with me.

87
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,270
Buddhist prayer beads?

88
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:06,150
I went down to Turtle Rock and the baby was gone.

89
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,740
And there were Buddhist prayer beads on top of the dead imperial guard's body.

90
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,060
The baby's body was never found?

91
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,350
Seung Nyang, your baby is dead.

92
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,710
No... that can't be true.

93
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,070
- Baby!
- Seung Nyang!
- Baby!

94
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,260
He didn't die!

95
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,680
- Baby! Baby!
- Let's go.

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,250
- Baby!
- Please, let's go.

97
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,480
Baby! Star! Star!

98
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,770
Seung Nyang called out her baby's name...

99
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,940
Star!

100
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,220
... and she was so devastated.

101
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,030
So what name did she call the baby?

102
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,430
Star, she said.

103
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,270
Star.

104
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:06,460
She said there was a birthmark that looked like three stars on the top of his foot.

105
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,040
His Majesty

106
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,980
has the same birthmark.

107
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,140
Is that right? So it's hereditary.

108
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:26,420
Then, by any chance... on the top of the baby's foot...

109
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,020
were there three marks?

110
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,430
How do you know that?

111
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,100
Eunuch Bang? What's wrong?

112
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,240
It's nothing.

113
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,450
How can this happen?

114
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,580
Just imagine.

115
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,680
This can't happen. How? His Majesty's son...

116
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,970
What do I do about this?

117
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,820
How can such a disaster happen?

118
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,600
Doing this won't solve anything.

119
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,770
So what's your plan?

120
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:18,840
If anyone finds out about this, His Majesty and Seung Nyang cannot avoid death.

121
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,860
So isn't our first task to shut that Buddhist nun up?

122
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,530
Let me try speaking to her.

123
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,700
Buddhist nun?

124
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,080
The Buddhist nun has disappeared.

125
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,330
Darn it. You said it was Seoneop Temple?

126
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,650
What shall we do?

127
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,290
El Temür's soldiers.

128
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,600
What are those guys doing here?

129
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,720
Those bastards wouldn't dare to kill the Buddhist nun, would they?

130
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,770
Darn it.

131
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,500
We were a step behind.

132
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,980
This is the empress's deed as well.

133
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,820
How can she... to a Buddhist nun... May her soul rest in peace, Merciful Buddha.

134
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,400
Let's get her down, first.

135
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,580
The Buddhist nun disappeared?

136
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,530
Yes, Your Highness. We cannot find where she is at all.

137
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,050
You shouldn't go that way.

138
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,460
There you go.

139
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,330
Please give him to me, Your Highness.

140
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,700
Can I hold him for just a moment?

141
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,400
Yes? Yes.

142
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,160
So what is the secret about his body?

143
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,650
On the top of his foot—

144
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,030
What do you think you are doing?

145
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,550
Enjoying a walk?

146
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,700
How dare you touch my son?

147
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,600
What are you doing? Take the prince back inside.

148
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

149
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,960
If you care about your son, don't even think about the crown prince position.

150
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:23,010
Even if His Majesty shows you favor 100 times, I will never stand by to watch

151
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,690
your son rise above mine.

152
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,250
If you covet the crown prince position so much, I will step back.

153
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,190
What did you say?

154
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,460
Please seat Prince Maha as this kingdom's crown prince.

155
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,690
Are you mocking me with empty words right now?

156
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,840
I am being sincere.

157
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,210
You're not the type to give up so easily. What's your reason?

158
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:56,480
I think peace in our palace is more important than the crown prince position.

159
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,480
Acting like the elder of the inner court when you are a mere concubine?

160
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,960
I hope there are no more quarrels about this matter.

161
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,090
Must we actually believe what she says?

162
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:29,140
Believe her or not, she said it herself. I will hold her to it.

163
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,050
I think you said something you didn't need to say.

164
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,140
What if she uses this against you later?

165
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,220
It doesn't matter. Before the investiture of the crown prince

166
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,880
there will be a war.

167
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,740
Move faster.

168
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,300
How do they look to you guys?

169
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,240
With just one look, they are very skilled.

170
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,120
Imagine that he transformed an undisciplined mob like this,

171
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,030
Wang Yoo is a truly skilled and scary person.

172
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,950
You've come?

173
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,350
His Majesty would like to meet you at his home.

174
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,410
The time has come for us to eliminate El Temür.

175
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,990
Please tell me the strategy you've prepared so far.

176
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,290
Once we leave here,

177
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,680
this petition will be submitted to the Imperial Office.

178
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,870
All petitions are seen together by His Majesty and the Prime Minister.

179
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,630
That is why we are submitting this petition.

180
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,910
It is a declaration of war and a warning to El Temür.

181
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,860
Why are you so surprised?

182
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,670
Imperial Consort Ki could fall into great danger.

183
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:36,390
Is it just her? Your life is on the line, too.

184
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:42,320
The moment I took over the Capital Defense Force, my life was no longer mine. But...

185
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,270
We are all the same. Me, the emperor, everyone participating in this rebellion.

186
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,620
There is no one who doesn't have his life on the line.

187
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,160
Is this really the only way?

188
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,950
This is our best effort. No matter what we choose, there isn't a method that is not dangerous.

189
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,780
You should leave here before the rebellion begins.

190
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,150
Even if this petition is made public, El Temür can't do anything to me. But—

191
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,550
I will not leave here.

192
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,190
Yang.

193
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:26,550
I will help you by your side and see El Temür's last moment with my own eyes.

194
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,410
No one knows how this rebellion will turn out.

195
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:36,580
So how can I avoid this rebellion only so I can survive?

196
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,830
I will fight.

197
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,370
And we will win.

198
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,120
You've summoned me?

199
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,660
Last night, I dreamed that I was being chased by demons.

200
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,090
Demons were carrying blue blades and trying to kill me,

201
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:33,480
they were all over the place. But you appeared,

202
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,100
held my hand, and we ran away from the demons.

203
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,080
When I went in where you told me to hide,

204
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,800
there was a very high cliff below my feet.

205
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,830
Please stop, Father.

206
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,940
I looked down and saw roaring flames.

207
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,540
I have never seen such a frightening fire in my life.

208
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,530
And you pushed me into those fires of hell.

209
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,840
So it wasn't those demons, but you who killed me.

210
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,680
It was just a dream.

211
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,410
Explain yourself.

212
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,630
Father.

213
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,220
If your explanation doesn't convince me,

214
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,980
I may kill you right here, right now.

215
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,010
Please kill me.

216
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:39,280
Since I couldn't protect and serve you, I should die.

217
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,870
Whether that was in your dream or hell, it's due to my negligence.

218
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,460
I'm relieved that your explanation convinced me.

219
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,400
Now, I don't have to kill a man of talent with my own hands.

220
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,720
Father has had a lot of anxiety lately,

221
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,920
so please understand.

222
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,290
Even the Prime Minister feels anxious sometimes?

223
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,820
He is usually so meticulous,

224
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,760
so he is under duress.

225
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,590
Take good care of him.

226
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,080
He is the pillar of this kingdom, after all.

227
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,210
Don't worry.

228
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,290
He will get up and be just like he was before, very soon.

229
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,970
Hurry and move.

230
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,120
Hurry and move. Move faster!

231
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,860
Hurry and get up! How dare you stop!

232
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,780
Stop that!

233
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,180
Are you all right? Ouch.

234
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,850
Even as a slave, we have to be dragged to the worst place.

235
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:23,000
I am still grateful that everyone from Goryeo Village are together.

236
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,070
Hey, you!

237
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,410
Won't you get moving?

238
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,950
Have you come, Sir?

239
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,560
He may not have the bloodletter,

240
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,170
but should we really leave that Maksaeng alone?

241
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:06,560
I told Prime Minister about him and he said we should slave him here to death.

242
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,480
But is this all we've got?

243
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,910
I'm sorry, the slaves are sick.

244
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,720
How will you mine 10,000 geuns of tin this way?
(T/N: "geun" - Korean pound, also known as a "catty.")

245
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,710
- If you'll wait just three days—
- Hey, you bastard.

246
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,430
Hawk House is coming today. Three days?

247
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,240
- I'm sorry.
- Even if

248
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,730
you have to squeeze the blood and sweat out of them, make sure you get the agreed amount by tomorrow.

249
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,070
I understand, Sir.

250
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,280
Speed up your work!

251
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,740
Anyone who slacks off

252
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,610
will not be fed!

253
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,160
Wow!

254
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,790
Solid gold is best when it comes to embezzling.

255
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,460
From this position, I do not envy the imperial family.

256
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,510
Sir, a leader of Hawk House has arrived.

257
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,830
Wait a moment.

258
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,150
- Let them in.
- Yes, Sir.

259
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,930
Welcome, Chief Yeon.

260
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,860
I heard you didn't get the agreed amount.

261
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,250
I know.

262
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:09,180
We will get enough by tomorrow, so please stay in the guest house here.

263
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,200
Chief, I will bring in your dinner.

264
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,520
Bring it in.

265
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,630
- Chief Yeon.
- Did you find out?

266
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,530
Are you sure this is where El Temür hid his secret fund?

267
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,430
It should be accurate. I got the information from the Hawk House information department.

268
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,520
It's not in any of the other tin mines,

269
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,370
but there is one spot that is suspicious.

270
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,890
A suspicious spot?

271
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,200
An abandoned mine that appears completely useless.

272
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,090
But Yeom Byeong Soo won't let anyone near it.

273
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,120
- Isn't that strange?
- An abandoned mine?

274
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,960
- You must not let even an ant in here.
- Yes, Sir!

275
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,130
- Follow me.
- Yes.

276
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,810
I'm certain that

277
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:55,370
at the end of that mineshaft, Prime Minister's secret fund should be in there.

278
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,230
Bats! Oh my!

279
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,110
I'm sorry, Sir.

280
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,830
But we tried last time and found nothing, so we gave up.

281
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:18,260
It's so deep and so many different paths. We two will not be enough.

282
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,250
But we can't use soldiers for this.

283
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,870
So wait. Our chance will come.

284
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,490
But are you sure

285
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,340
that the secret fund is here?

286
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,560
Why would Prime Minister

287
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,320
tell us that this spot should be treated as more important than our lives?

288
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,360
This is the place for sure.

289
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,130
Please bring that to Wang Yoo.

290
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,680
Wang Yoo should know the suffering you've endured, too.

291
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,370
What terrible suffering you've endured returning to Hawk House.

292
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,310
Stop saying useless things.

293
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,330
Are you doing this

294
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,910
because you love Wang Yoo?

295
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,950
I told you to shut up.

296
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,480
I apologize.

297
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,900
Wang Yoo and I are only comrades with a common goal.

298
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,690
Don't ever say such things again.

299
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,670
Yes, Chief.

300
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,220
The fight has now begun.

301
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,370
Please pick up your brush.

302
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,910
My allies, hear my pledge.

303
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,790
El Temür does not honor the heavens

304
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,340
and scorns the people. As such, he has committed many evil deeds.

305
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,500
Therefore, the gods of Heaven and Earth have become angry and made this kingdom suffer with famine and illnesses.

306
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,560
And the powerless people bear these burdens.

307
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,950
We must make El Temür pay for these sins

308
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,190
and punish him severely by annihilating his entire clan and appease the heavens.

309
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,140
My allies,

310
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,710
the heavens will not ignore our people anymore.

311
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,650
In order to erect virtue, we must allow its branch and leaves to grow strong.

312
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:04,470
And to get rid of evil, we must pull it out by its roots.

313
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,180
Therefore,

314
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,730
I have drawn my sword to enact swift punishment.

315
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,700
Please help me

316
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,420
clean this world which El Temur has made dirty.

317

[Memorial Tablet of Emperor of Yuan Dynasty Khutughtu Khan]

318
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,810
Except for Magistrate Bayan,

319
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:00,560
the other eight magistrates have gathered.

320
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,070
- I am grateful you've all come.
- Your Majesty,

321
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,080
we ran here immediately as soon as you summoned us.

322
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,530
On the secret orders I've sent to you,

323
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,000
I've already made my intentions clear.

324
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,350
Now it's time for you to make your intentions clear.

325
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:28,890
Your Majesty, we've all been waiting for this day.

326
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,220
Since you've accepted the will of the heavens,

327
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,100
we will accept your will, Your Majesty.

328
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,570
Please issue your imperial command, we will make sure to accept it.

329
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,710
Please raise armies.

330
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,080
- Begin gathering military forces.
- Your Majesty,

331
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,750
the reason we couldn't do that before is because

332
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,130
El Temür's large army is stationed in each province.

333
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,660
The moment we begin raising an army,

334
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,310
El Temür will accuse us of treason.

335
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:08,660
And even if we did raise armies, the entire kingdom would be swept into war.

336
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,180
I know all this, so...

337
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:18,030
I'm about to make El Temür want you to raise armies.

338
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,200
Do you have a plan?

339
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,180
The preparation for dispatch is complete.

340
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,860
The soldiers will be divided into groups of about 100

341
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,290
and leave every half hour, so you can travel secretly.

342
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,840
You will be out of Liaoyang before the rooster crows, and we will reassemble at the bank of Yobaek Mountain.

343
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,370
You must reach Daedo in three days, and make sure to travel only on mountain paths.

344
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,400
Bayan's warriors,

345
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,600
there may be death, but there can be no defeat. Be fierce like tigers,

346
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,560
fight like eagles, and endure like brown bears.

347
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,820
The heavens will help us.

348
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,260
General, we will give you our lives.

349
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,510
We will give our lives, General!

350
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,930
The imperial petition will finally be made public.

351
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:00,180
So what did you need to tell me?

352
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:05,250
A strong gust of wind will blow through this palace very soon.

353
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,500
What do you mean?

354
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:12,230
A rebellion to get rid of El Temür has begun.

355
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,890
It seems you've forgotten.

356
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,580
I no longer need your help, Prime Minister.

357
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,980
It looks like Seonjeongwon is having difficulties due to a lack of officials.
(선정원 宣政院 - Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs)

358
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,690
You are being hasty.

359
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:52,120
I am not in a good mood, so you should back off.

360
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:05,210
I, Bayan, Magistrate of Liaoyang, dare to bow my head and appeal to His Imperial Majesty.

361
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,950
The evil deeds of El Temür are too many to list here

362
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:14,910
and his deeds are so wicked, it wouldn't be enough to behead him 100 times.

363
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,040
I, Bayan,

364
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,900
will draw my sword honed by my angry tears to get rid of this traitor.

365
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,170
Please command each magistrate

366
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,830
to help me in this quest.

367
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:38,620
"I have a secret weapon that is stronger than El Temür's army that is 100,000 strong.

368
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,750
It is the bloodletter that the late Emperor Mingzong left behind.

369
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,430
The bloodletter of our emperor who died at the hands of El Temür

370
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,690
will serve as our declaration of war to get rid of a traitor.

371
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:57,700
Your Majesty, please understand my intent."

372
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,610
This is the full text of the petition that Bayan sent.

373
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:16,630
Prime Minister, I think you owe us an explanation about Emperor Mingzong's bloodletter.

374
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,150
Bring it to me.

375
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,420
This...

376
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,370
is the real bloodletter of Emperor Mingzong.

377
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,710
Your Majesty, Bayan is wickedly

378
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,630
trying to mock this governing body with a fake bloodletter.

379
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,460
Please read your father's last words yourself.

380
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,760
Hurry and read it, Your Majesty.

381
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:08,600
"My son, everything is your father's fault for not being strong enough.

382
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,720
Once I die and you become the emperor

383
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,880
trust in and rely on Prime Minister El Temur.

384
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:24,560
He is the only one who can protect you and Yuan.

385
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,840
I'm sorry, my son."

386
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,450
Have you all heard that?

387
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:36,800
This bloodletter has Emperor Mingzong's

388
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,000
imperial seal on it!

389
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,800
This is the bloodletter that my father left me.

390
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,460
My father...

391
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,470
left a symbol only I would recognize, instead of his imperial seal.

392
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:05,660
It's this butterfly.

393
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,840
This is proof that this is the real bloodletter.

394
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:19,320
Your Majesty, now that we have confirmed Bayan's rebellion please command us to invade Liaoyang.

395
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:26,140
I, Magistrate Oh Gwang of Yunnan Province, intend to raise an army to defeat Traitor Bayan.

396
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,530
Please permit me, Your Majesty.

397
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:33,430
I, Magistrate Bu Sa Gwi of Lingbei Province, must fight as well, Your Majesty.

398
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,800
I, Magistrate Seol Do Gwan of Sichuan Province, must participate as well.

399
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,840
I will participate as well.

400
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,560
And I will, as well.

401
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,960
I will participate as well.

402
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,760
I will participate as well.

403
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,910
- I will participate as well.
- I will participate as well.

404
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,890
Your Majesty, your magistrates are so loyal,

405
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,190
how can you ignore their devotion?

406
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,610
I will permit it.

407
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,990
Please raise an army and defeat the rebel forces

408
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:13,770
and bring me the head of Bayan the traitor.

409
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,650
Before that, there is something we need to address.

410
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:28,830
The adopted daughter of this traitor is in this palace right now as an imperial consort.

411
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,510
Your Majesty, please behead Lady Ki right now

412
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:38,130
and hang her head in the streets as an example.

413
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,210
That cannot happen.

414
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,780
It can't?

415
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,070
It wouldn't be enough to exterminate her whole family. Are you suggesting we let her live?

416
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,250
She is Prince Ayu's mother.

417
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,540
How can you kill an imperial prince's mother?

418
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,050
Your Majesty, please hurry and command her to be killed.

419
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:03,580
If you won't, you will make the magistrates' loyalty a laughingstock.

420
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,400
Your Majesty, let's send her to the Cold Palace.

421
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,360
Her execution isn't urgent, is it?

422
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,200
Cold Palace?

423
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,970
Yes, Your Highness.

424
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,570
Even if El Temur makes this palace into a bloodbath,

425
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:35,600
the Cold Palace could serve as an impregnable fortress against them.

426
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,310
Cold Palace, huh?

427
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,220
That doesn't sound bad.

428
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,790
Imperial Consort Ki...

429
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,230
send her to the Cold Palace.

430
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,570
I'm sorry, Yang.

431
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:57,230
Everything is going according to our plan.

432
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:01,350
Thinking about you shivering with cold in that terrible place

433
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,960
makes my heart so heavy.

434
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:15,910
Your Majesty, Officer Bayan fights with his sword, but we must fight with our hearts.

435
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:19,330
We must be bold and determined.

436
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:24,520
We must never waver. Only then can we defeat El Temur.

437
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,850
Is this what they call the "irony of fate?"

438
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:04,310
How arrogant you were and how pathetic you look now.

439
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,650
Do I seem that way?

440
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:12,590
Feel the ice deep into your bones in the Cold Palace.

441
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:17,740
Executing you after that doesn't sound too bad.

442
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:22,530
Make sure to get your fill of this laughter. Because very soon,

443
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:25,640
your laughter will turn into wailing.

444
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,810
She's about to die soon. Why does she look so confident?

445
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:37,630
She must be so terrified that she lost her mind.

446
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,950
Please make her suffer a lot when you kill her.

447
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,990
You don't need to tell me twice.

448
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:49,760
I will make sure she suffers 10,000 times the pain that I suffered.

449
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,150
Oh, it's so cold.

450
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,010
Have you sent a notice to the other concubines?

451
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:16,520
They will all gather here as soon as you command them to.

452
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:28,090
They have fewer troops but Bayan's soldiers are well-trained.

453
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:32,450
If they arrive at the palace gates and we have to protect the palace walls, it could be a prolonged war.

454
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,390
I think it will be good to unite all the forces from each province and strike them at once.

455
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,550
I agree.

456
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:43,410
Station your troops here, at Joongchu Field.

457
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:47,930
Because this place is at a different distance from each province,

458
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:50,170
it will take a while for everyone to arrive.

459
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:54,320
Once 10,000 soldiers arrive, we will begin our first attack.

460
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,440
So let's have everyone gather at Joongchu Field in four days.

461
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,380
We understand.

462
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,320
We are about to go to battle now.

463
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,240
Capture Bayan alive.

464
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:26,830
He betrayed me, shouldn't I kill him with my own hands?

465
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,760
I will do so.

466
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,230
Once you return, I will tell you where the secret fund is.

467
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,410
From now on, the command of the troops and the funds are in your control.

468
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,850
Father.

469
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,220
You will become this kingdom's prime minister.

470
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:49,780
Does this mean that you trust me?

471
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,660
There was never a moment I did not trust my own son.

472
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,820
Aren't you the first-born of our clan?

473
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,410
If I don't trust you, who would?

474
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,350
Father...

475
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,800
Go now.

476
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,330
Take good care of Father while I'm gone.

477
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:34,130
Don't worry and return safely, Brother.

478
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:13,760
Let our troops know that war has begun.

479
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,320
Your Majesty, Yeon Bisoo is here.

481
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,910
It's been a while.

482
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:44,360
I received your letter well. But what brings you here?

483
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,870
I heard about you from Soori.

484
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:51,380
So you came just to help His Majesty?

485
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,860
Do you have any idea what a dangerous place this is right now?

486
00:46:54,860 --> 00:47:00,590
I happened to have business around here, so I could escape the suspicion of Hawk House.

487
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:05,810
It must not have been easy to reenter Hawk House.

488
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:12,630
Fortunately, they believed what I told them so it wasn't that difficult.

489
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,220
What about Maksaeng?

490
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,290
He's laboring in the mines with other Goryeo Village people

491
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:21,070
so he's having a very tough time.

492
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:25,060
Go to my house and rest for now.

493
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,690
She would brave a war just to help His Majesty,

494
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,520
how praiseworthy.

495
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,340
When it comes to loyalty, Yeon Bisoo is amazing.

496
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,030
So cold.

497
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:55,790
I think we might freeze to death like this.

498
00:47:55,790 --> 00:48:00,040
Your Highness, are you all right?

499
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,200
I can endure it, so don't worry about me.

500
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,160
Your Majesty.

501
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,540
Please excuse us.

502
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:46,410
You shouldn't come here yet.

503
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:53,040
I will stay here just for tonight.

504
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:59,490
♫ On that day the wind was blowing ♫

505
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:03,630
Being alone in my bedroom while you are here...

506
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,720
my cushions feel like needles.

507
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,870
Your Majesty.

508
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:12,860
♫ Embraced in your arms, resting ♫

509
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,710
Your body...

510
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:21,990
Your body is as cold as ice.

511
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:29,110
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

512
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:36,870
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

513
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:39,020
♫ Even if I were to ache ♫

514
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,060
Just for a little while...

515
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,500
Just endure this for a little while.

516
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,620
♫ Embrace me in your arms ♫

517
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,800
Just a little while.

518
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,710
♫ I stand alone in the darkness ♫

519
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:58,730
♫ Like a lost child ♫

520
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:03,960
♫ My heart is frozen with fear ♫

521
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,740
Why isn't a single magistrate here?

522
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,390
It is past the promised date.

523
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:18,950
At the very least, soldiers from the nearest province should have been here.

524
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,820
This is strange.

525
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,920
What is strange?

526
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,790
General!

527
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,540
I've returned.

528
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,990
What's going on in Liaoyang?

529
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,100
I don't see any soldiers.

530
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,440
You don't see any soldiers?

531
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,540
Just a flag left behind.

532
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,690
Gather my men, I must go there myself.

533
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,820
Yes, General.

534
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,180
It doesn't seem like anyone is here.

535
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:11,030
General! Here.

536
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:18,140
You can have Liaoyang.

537
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,160
This Bayan will take the world.

538
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:28,580
We were deceived. They are going to Daedo.

539
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,860
Then... the magistrates...

540
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,610
Gathering them for an attack will take time.

541
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,680
Send a message to Father right away.

542
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,640
Yes, General.

543
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,040
You just wait, Bayan.

544
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,790
I am on my way to cut your head off.

545
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:55,010
Thank you for making your way here.

546
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:59,250
We were able to form our armies without raising any suspicion thanks to your secret plan.

547
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:06,810
Is that all? Since Tanqishi took his private army, all El Temur has left is the Capital Defense Force.

548
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:08,850
It's a very surprising strategy.

549
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,750
It didn't come from my brain. It's all thanks to Toqto'a.

550
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,360
We don't have much time.

551
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:21,960
Tanqishi will return to Daedo with his private army, that will take three days. During those three days,

552
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,280
we have to defeat the Capital Defense Force and catch El Temur.

553
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,090
Let's begin with our next plan.

554
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,250
There are eight gates to enter the palace in Daedo.

555
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:38,430
North, South, East and West Gates. There are smaller gates in between each of them.

556
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,800
North Gate is the most important, and General Bayan will be in charge of that.

557
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,370
Each magistrate should take charge of the other seven gates.

558
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,380
We will do that.

559
00:52:58,590 --> 00:52:59,810
Hurry and open up.

560
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,170
General Tanqishi has an urgent message for Prime Minister.

561
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,330
What is the message?

562
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:08,590
Bayan and the magistrates are headed this way.

563
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,410
Go give that message to El Temur, just as that man said.

564
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:24,870
Yes, General.

565
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:31,050
Everyone, have a drink.

566
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:35,400
Only the Capital Defense Force remains to protect us.

567
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:43,120
We shouldn't drink in the afternoon.

568
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,790
What are you afraid of?

569
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:51,390
Afraid Bayan would defeat the counter-insurgents and come here?

570
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,760
Father, a message has arrived.

571
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,190
So what happened?

572
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:02,460
A great victory.

573
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,170
Brother has captured Bayan alive and he is on his way here.

574
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:13,120
You guys go and greet Tanqishi and the magistrates.

575
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,290
Yes, Sir.

576
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,850
I will visit His Imperial Majesty.

577
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:36,100
General, please hurry and close the palace gates.

578
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,080
What's wrong?

579
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,410
Bayan's troops are coming, not General Tanqishi.

580
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,100
What?

581
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:49,040
Close the palace gates and summon General Wang Yoo.

582
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,860
Hurry!

583
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,830
Close the door!

584
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:15,590
In there, there is the "Great Tiger."

585
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:21,650
And if we only catch that Great Tiger, the world is yours, Uncle.

586
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:24,370
Move!

587
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,560
Everything depends on us now.

588
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:49,940
If we can open the palace gates, the rebellion will succeed.

589
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:53,180
If we can't, the rebellion will fail.

590
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:57,200
Won Jin may have thousands of men,

591
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,160
but their hearts are also going in a thousand directions.

592
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:10,180
Although we are only about 100 men, our hearts are one.

593
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,570
That is why we are not afraid of even an army that is a million strong.

594
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:20,500
Tanqishi has sent a message of victory.

595
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:31,020
Bayan will be dragged here soon.

596
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,210
That's great news.

597
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:38,470
How can we pass up celebrating on a day like today? How about a drink with me?

598
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:42,510
Sounds good. No reason to refuse.

599
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,430
That is strange.

600
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:55,170
The Women's Pavilion is so quiet today.

601
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,470
Indeed, it is.

602
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:00,850
Your Highness, where are you going so late at night?

603
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,910
I thought I'd have a cup of tea with the concubines.

604
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,590
Where have they all gone?

605
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,750
They are probably in the study room.

606
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,010
Why would they be there?

607
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:15,740
Once he finds out that the palace gate is breached,

608
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:23,780
El Temur will try to kill everyone in the palace.

609
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,910
Imperial guards, private army soldiers,

610
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:33,630
all armed military in here serve El Temur.

611
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:38,680
So the only people who can protect His Majesty

612
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,680
are everyone in here and the servants.

613
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:52,640
So another war will begin here.

614
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,270
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

615
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:09,890
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

616
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:15,310
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫
