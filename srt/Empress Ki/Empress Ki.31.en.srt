1
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,330
Why did you ask to see me?

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,190
How is the emperor?

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,210
After the magistrates revolted to El Temur's side, he's been feeling devastated.

4
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,470
Open it up.

5
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,810
A secret plan to stop the abdication is in it.

6
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,090
A secret plan?

7
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,540
What is listed in this book?

8
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,810
They're the spies that the leader of Hawk House has planted in each province.

9
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,690
How can we win over the magistrates with this?

10
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,960
Your Majesty, listen carefully to what I have to say.

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,080
Even if someone wields the sword of the whole world,

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,510
if the person holding it is unskilled, it's useless.

13
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,470
This can become a weapon to stop the abdication,

14
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:20,430
but I'm telling you that it's up to you to move the magistrates' hearts.

15
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,050
Your Majesty!

16
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,060
Welcome.

17
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,000
Your Majesty! You can speak again?

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,050
Don't be surprised.

19
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,510
In order to fool the prime minister, I've been keeping quiet.

20
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:03,840
The prime minister has installed three different emperors.

21
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,360
Now he's trying to do it for the fourth time, but...

22
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,540
I think he chose the wrong opponent this time.

23
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,380
I'm not going to give in so easily like those who came before me.

24
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,030
I need your strength.

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,700
Will you please help me?

26
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,730
Your Majesty, I believe it's reckless to go against Prime Minister over this abdication matter.

27
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,050
Reckless?

28
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,890
That's right, Your Majesty. For the sake of peace in the palace and the stability of the county,

29
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,000
this time, I think you should follow Prime Minister's—

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,270
When my father passed away,

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,430
were you this cowardly then, too?

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,780
You are already perpetual traitors who turned away from the emperor's death.

33
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,790
I am trying to give you an opportunity to mend your disloyal ways right now.

34
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,780
As you've stated, we were incompetent and unable to protect the late Emperor Mingzong.

35
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,190
Therefore, we don't want to lose you this time.

36
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,070
What did you say?

37
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,730
Abdication is the way to protect your life.

38
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,590
Please accept our meaning.

39
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,020
Please accept our meaning, Your Majesty.

40
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,640
Accept?

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,740
Many years ago, you might remember that your provinces ran out of money because of counterfeit banknotes going around.

42
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,950
Because of that, in order to save your provinces, you came beholden to Prime Minister for a great debt.

43
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,810
Were you aware that the one who spread rumors around about

44
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,070
counterfeit money was Hawk House?

45
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,000
That's news to us.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,050
Then you must also be unaware that Hawk House is Prime Minister's primary source of funds.

47
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,910
Is that.... true?

48
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,620
Prime Minister places spies in your provinces

49
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,000
and took everything that was worth anything!

50
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,070
Loaning all of you money and then taking it away;

51
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,020
and in return for erasing your debt, you now pledged your loyalty!

52
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,110
You've all been well played by Prime Minister.

53
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,430
Who exactly are those spies?

54
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,750
Do you want to know?

55
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,130
Please tell us, Your Majesty. Who are they?

56
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,440
Before that, think about what you need to do for me.

57
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
How could this be?

58
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,400
Were you aware Prime Minister was involved with Hawk House?

59
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,450
We're the ones who uncovered that fact by invading the Liaoyang division of Hawk House.

60
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,920
What do we do?

61
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
What do you mean?

62
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,320
Approving the abdication is like me wringing my own neck.

63
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,960
You are right. Now that we know the truth,

64
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,070
we will not go along with Prime Minister El Temur.

65
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,570
In order to stop Prime Minister, all ten (appointed) magistrates must unanimously disapprove.

66
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,380
Do you think you can convince the rest of the magistrates?

67
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,340
We can't promise anything, but we will try our best.

68
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,630
You must keep it a secret that His Majesty can speak.

69
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,440
I will arrest Hawk House's spies on the same day the Kurultai meeting happens.

70
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,650
Leave right away. We don't have much time.

71
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,330
You will have to arrest only those who are in the closest provinces.

72
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,260
Yes, Uncle.

73
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,480
Since we've decided to help stop the abdication,

74
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,720
we can't avoid an all-out war with El Temur.

75
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,050
What do you plan to do next?

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,830
What did you want to say?

77
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:30,380
Your Majesty, during Kurultai, please retrieve the seal that El Temur took from you.

78
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,940
It's the perfect opportunity to recover your imperial authority and take control of the government.

79
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,100
Now you need to rule this country yourself.

80
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,710
Will that be... possible?

81
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:52,280
Once the abdication is stopped and the magistrates have unanimously voted against it, it's entirely possible.

82
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,790
He's right, Your Majesty.

83
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,580
Retrieving the seal and recovering your control of the government,

84
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,060
is the only way to stop El Temur's retaliation.

85
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,340
Your Majesty, greetings.

86
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,100
Why are you training these soldiers all of a sudden?

87
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,500
Prime Minister ordered for us to be prepared for any possible unfortunate events.

88
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,660
What sort of... unfortunate event will happen?

89
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,510
I am only obeying the command.

90
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,550
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

91
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,260
Prime Minister is trying to threaten the magistrates.

92
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,940
Maybe we can't even stop the abdication now.

93
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:39,070
Prime Minister is not the only one preparing for any possible unfortunate events.

94
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:44,010
Toqto'a is capturing the Hawk House spies from each province right now.

95
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,540
Is that true?

96
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:54,140
Yes, Your Majesty. If we bring those spies here, we will be able to prevent the magistrates from leaving our side.

97
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,050
You've shown your strong determination by using the military.

98
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,390
The magistrates would not dare to go against you now.

99
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:14,010
My lifelong wish will come true the day Maha becomes the emperor.

100
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:20,630
You have the imperial seal already. How about if you take the throne yourself?

101
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,390
At this age, what more wealth do I need?

102
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,340
Laying the groundwork for our family to live on for a thousand years,

103
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,270
that is my final task while alive.

104
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,950
Father, Hawk House has sent someone.

105
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,450
I offer my greetings to Prime Minister.

106
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,450
So, what's going on?

107
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,650
This is a letter from the leader of the Yeongyeong division of Hawk House.

108
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,570
What does the letter say?

109
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:17,110
The Hawk House leader seems to have misunderstood that I killed Heuksoo.

110
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,940
Now, what is this?

111
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,550
The spies of Hawk House in each province are being captured?

112
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,600
Wasn't that your order as well, Prime Minister?

113
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,670
Toqto'a, this guy.

114
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,870
He killed Heuksoo. This is his doing as well.

115
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,260
He's the one capturing the Hawk House spies.

116
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,600
I will take care of this. I will write a response,

117
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,480
so give it to your leader.

118
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,190
Yes, Sir.

119
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,440
The meat looks good.

120
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,090
I chewed this raw when I was young.

121
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,160
I like the fat, so please slice us a piece of the fatty part.

122
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,920
What are you saying? Pork is all about the flesh. Please give us the meaty part.

123
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,770
What are you saying? Pork is about the fat.

124
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,260
You eat only meat, that is why you are bald.

125
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,540
- Give us the fatty part.
- Meaty part.

126
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,620
Fat.

127
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,100
- Meat.
- Fat.

128
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,470
- Meat.
- Give us the fat.

129
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,700
- Meat.
- Fat, even if you kill me.

130
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,670
- Meat.
- Fat.
- Meat.
- Fat.

131
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,810
Oh, darn it!

132
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,810
Well, give us whatever.

133
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,510
Meat.

134
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,630
That is the point of contact in Yeongyeong for Hawk House.

135
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,520
You don't know where their base is?

136
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,100
They change locations as needed.

137
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,550
They don't have a base like in Liaoyang.

138
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,350
Do you know the leader of Yeongyeong division?

139
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,030
I've never met him.

140
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,140
But one thing I know is that among the Hawk House division leaders,

141
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,720
only the leader of the Yeongyeong division knows the leader of Hawk House.

142
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,920
We will keep a watch on this place for now. Let's leave for today.

143
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,020
Better not do anything.

145
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,210
You were alive. What happened?

146
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,080
These people saved me.

147
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,890
He is a fellow Turk. We can trust him.

148
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,380
I will lead the way. Follow me from a distance.

149
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,360
What did El Temür write?

150
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,190
That he will wait for Toqto'a by the North Gate and kill him.

151
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:29,150
You give this letter to Hawk House and don't cause any suspicion.

152
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,950
Shin Woo, you go to North Gate with Maksaeng and observe the activity of the military troops.

153
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,010
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

154
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,400
How many bandits are here?

155
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,490
There are only about ten of them.

156
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,500
Ask them to be on guard.

157
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,420
I understand.

158
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,500
Thank you.

159
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,060
Welcome, General. Please come this way.

160
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,690
[Soldiers]

161
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,050
Oh, thank you.

162
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,910
Their military power is formidable.

163
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,850
It will be a struggle for us to face them alone.

164
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,490
I think Toqto'a only has a few men as well.

165
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,590
I heard you gave the document I deciphered to Toqto'a.

166
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,380
What is your reason for helping him?

167
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,580
Oh, the reason is Toqto'a is helping Seung Nya—

168
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,910
I am just fighting Hawk House and El Temür.

169
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,210
There is no other reason.

170
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,150
Try to obtain some fuel for a fire.

171
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,360
You want me to set a fire?

172
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,400
It's the best way to fight when you have too few men.

173
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,870
Court Lady Yeon.

174
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,330
What are you doing right now?

175
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,890
You keep quiet.

176
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,000
Are you two having a romantic relationship?

177
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,050
Keep guard well.

178
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,080
Yes, they are definitely romantically involved.

179
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,880
How much you must be suffering in the Cold Palace.

180
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,730
Oh, look at how damaged your face is.

181
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,160
Please help me.

182
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,660
Huh? Of course, I must. Just say the word.

183
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,670
Her Majesty the Empress has fallen ill because she misses the imperial prince.

184
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,270
Yes? And?

185
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:00,980
She commanded us to bring him to the Cold Palace secretly.

186
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,110
But if you get caught, you're the one who will be flogged.

187
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:10,840
So when I bring him out, please escort me to the Cold Palace.

188
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,150
You're doing all the dangerous things yourself.

189
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:23,430
What if you get flogged again? Right here?

190
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,630
This naughty hand of mine.

191
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,030
I'll see you in front of the Empress Dowager's palace at sul-si.  (7:00p.m. - 9:00 p.m.)

192
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,980
It doesn't even hurt when she pinches it.

193
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,550
No matter how much I look at him, he does not resemble his parents at all.

194
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,410
Not the emperor, not the empress.

195
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,250
Your Highness, Lord Jang has arrived.

196
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,040
Ask him in.

197
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:36,580
Your Highness, finally, tomorrow is the meeting of the Kurultai.

198
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,640
You must bring him back before dawn.

199
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,580
Don't worry.

200
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,310
Hurry and go.

201
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,750
You will be here at myo-si tomorrow, right? (5:00 a.m. - 7:00 a.m.)

202
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,050
I will, I said.

203
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,260
- What is your plan? How can you do this?
- What?

204
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:37,600
If you become romantic with a palace maid, you will be beheaded. Don't you know that?

205
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,810
How dare you say that?

206
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,410
If we don't help the empress, who will?

207
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,630
Maybe something's happened. Why isn't he here yet?

208
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,280
Your Majesty, if anyone finds out...

209
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,290
I am just trying to see my own son!

210
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:07,660
- Your Majesty, you're on probation right now.
- Silence.

211
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,240
If he can't be brought,

212
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,560
I will go and see Maha on my own.

213
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,540
I brought the imperial prince.

214
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,750
Baby...

215
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,970
I...

216
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,620
missed you.

217
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,410
- I missed you, Maha.
- Your Majesty...

218
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,480
Practice like it's a real fight!

219
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,560
Stop!

220
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,960
Shooters, forward!

221
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,720
Shoot!

222
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,780
Redirect!

223
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,870
Oh!

224
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,020
To your places!

225
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,100
Prime Minister is waiting.

226
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,130
It doesn't feel good.

227
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,760
They're threatening us right now.

228
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,560
Welcome!

229
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,150
Everyone, please sit.

230
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,190
There are no soldiers or pedestrians.

231
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,490
Something is off.

232
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,420
What are you doing right now?

233
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,330
This is General Toqto'a of Liaoyang Province!

234
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,090
It's Prime Minister's order to kill the traitorous Toqto'a!

235
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:44,090
Put down your swords! If not, you won't be spared from death!

236
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,960
Now!

237
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,830
What is this?

238
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,840
- It's oil!
- What? Oil?

239
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,230
Who are they?!

240
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,630
♫ Carried on the wind, you are heard ♫

241
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,830
♫ Even if I wander and am lost,  ♫

242
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,470
Stop them!

243
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,640
Take the arrested that way.

244
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,510
Are you nervous?

245
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,890
Do you see...

246
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,630
fear on my face?

247
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,160
Do I look that way still?

248
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,890
You look imposing

249
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,650
and trustworthy.

250
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,410
Your Majesty!

251
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,030
It's time to go!

252
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,270
Please go.

253
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,000
Just wait a little while.

254
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,060
I will be sure to

255
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,860
bring good news to you.

256
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,180
His Majesty hasn't arrived yet.

257
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,280
The abdication is done already!

258
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,340
This document has his seal on it!

259
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,080
What today's Kurultai is for

260
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,150
is to discuss the ascension of the imperial prince to the throne.

261
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,060
We are going to take a vote, so every magistrate should—

262
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,020
His Imperial Majesty!

263
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,870
Apologies for my tardiness. I was bringing His Majesty.

264
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,200
Why would you bring someone who can't even speak?

265
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,510
The Royal Notification of abdication is

266
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,340
supposed to be announced by the emperor!

267
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,510
You can speak now?

268
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,100
Now, everyone please sit.

269
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,490
Give me the imperial notification.

270
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,040
What play do you think you're putting on?

271
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,560
You're going to pretend to read now?

272
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,340
His Majesty can't read or write.

273
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,210
"I hereby declare that

274
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,240
I wish to give up my full authority as the emperor.

275
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,520
The Imperial Prince Maha will succeed me,

276
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,190
and until he is old enough to handle the state affairs, I wish for the empress to be his regent."

277
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,370
This imperial notification is not my wish.

278
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,190
So I will...

279
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,430
withdraw this abdication.

280
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,000
Therefore,

281
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,170
I will not be handing over the emperor's authority to the imperial prince!

282
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,670
Who are these men?

283
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,040
Move aside.

284
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,470
Without Prime Minister's orders, I cannot let anyone in.

285
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,520
I said move aside.

286
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,170
Do you want to...

287
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,320
- try and make your own way in?
- I guess you really...

288
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,900
wish to die.

289
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,170
What are you doing?

290
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,790
- Tell the Imperial Guard to step aside.
- Your Highness,

291
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,180
- during Kurultai, no one should be—
- You!

292
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,190
Do you now know who I am?!

293
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,950
Step aside right now!

294
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,170
What does the law say about situations like these?

295
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,660
According to Kurultai law, in order to process the imperial notification that holds the seal,

296
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,160
we need unanimous consent.

297
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,750
Then...

298
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,990
try and get consent.

299
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,650
Those magistrates who agree with His Majesty's will, please stand up.

300
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,260
Liaoyang Province's magistrate is against the abdication.

301
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,810
Will you not stand?!

302
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,020
I do not believe Prime Minister

303
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,000
planted a Hawk House spy in our province.

304
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,540
I don't want to suspect anything without solid proof.

305
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:48,170
Is everyone who opposes the abdication all standing?

306
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,560
Your Majesty,

307
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:01,730
I think you've failed to get unanimous consent.

308
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,770
Not quite yet!

309
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,590
That's...

310
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,710
You-You are...

311
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,790
Your Majesty, I've rounded up the spies of Hawk House who

312
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:37,420
distributed the counterfeit currency in each province.

313
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,120
Every time the counterfeit currency was going around in each province,

314
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,230
Prime Minister here drew up a scheme to increase the value of the banknotes.

315
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,580
Do you believe this is a coincidence?

316
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,250
Your Majesty, how could you scorn my father with something that's untrue?!

317
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,130
He has nothing to do with Hawk House!

318
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:07,040
Jiāngxī Province's Magistrate, Joo Ga Suh.

319
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,870
I oppose the abdication.

320
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:14,250
I, Jiangzhe Pronvince's Magistrate, Lee Gi Suk, also opposes!

321
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,390
I oppose the abdication.

322
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:34,700
Your Majesty, congratulations! The abdication has been withdrawn!

323
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,070
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

324
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,330
Since the magistrates all feel this way, I, too—

325
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,220
Hold on a second.

326
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,670
I'm not done yet.

327
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,620
All this time, you have been handling all the political affairs as the prime minister,

328
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,830
in order to take the weight off my shoulders. But...

329
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,240
I'm now thinking about

330
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,160
getting back the power of authority that I had entrusted you with.

331
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,180
Your Majesty will lead the country?

332
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,890
All this time,

333
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,240
you've worked very hard.

334
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,920
Please hand me back the imperial seal.

335
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,930
This also will need unanimous consent according to Kurultai law.

336
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,340
You are quite right.

337
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,480
Please make your decision, Your Majesty!

338
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,230
Please make your decision, Your Majesty!

339
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,470
- What happened?
- Take the soldiers inside right away.

340
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,230
- Pardon?
- Kill all the magistrates inside!

341
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,560
- Ge-General.
- Please be calm.

342
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,890
I don't think this is right.

343
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,460
What do you mean? Do you know what will happen if he takes away my father's authority?

344
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,840
My father is in serious trouble right now!

345
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,400
What will you do about His Imperial Majesty?!

346
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,000
Do you want to kill

347
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,830
the emperor and the empress dowager? Is that what you want?

348
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,140
Prime Minister won't be able to handle the aftermath.

349
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:53,630
This is... asking for us all to die together, General!

350
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,090
Right now, I need to...

351
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,860
stop the Kurultai.

352
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,640
The imperial prince...

353
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,290
He is still in the Cold Palace.

354
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,460
What are you talking about?

355
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,320
I wish to recover my authority as the emperor and retrieve the imperial seal.

356
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,610
Those who agree, please stand up.

357
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:52,140
Your Majesty, I have news! The imperial prince has gone

358
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,870
missing right now!

359
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,010
- What do you mean?
- The imperial prince has disappeared?

360
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:04,210
He hasn't been seen since last night!

361
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,730
It's an emergency, Your Majesty!

362
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,890
The crown prince?

363
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:39,060
Let's end the Kurultai for now. We'll discuss the consent of handing over full authority once we find the imperial prince.

364
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,610
Something is strange.

365
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,870
Why would he be missing at this very moment?

366
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:59,050
Your Majesty, even if you delay the meeting, our stance will not change!

367
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:03,060
That is right. Please do not worry, Your Majesty!

368
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,660
Please do not worry, Your Majesty!

369
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,720
- The imperial prince has disappeared?
- Yes, Your Highness.

370
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,220
I just went and asked the nurse.

371
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:32,700
Where is the imperial prince right now?

372
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,290
- He's at the Cold Palace.
- The Cold Palace?

373
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,970
Do you mean the empress took him?

374
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,880
Maha, you're so cute.

375
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:01,960
- What are you doing here?
- Empress Dowager ordered me to bring back the imperial prince.

376
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:08,070
Never mind. Tell her that I will keep him with me.

377
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:12,280
What are you doing? Take the imperial prince.

378
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,400
Don't you dare lay a finger on me or I will bite my tongue and kill myself.

379
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,480
Your Majesty.

380
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,050
If I die, do you think you will be safe?

381
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,220
Get out of here right now!

382
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,820
Try biting your tongue then.

383
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:40,320
- What did you say?
- You don't yet know what it's like to be in so much pain

384
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,290
that you want to bite your tongue and kill yourself.

385
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:49,130
But I am sure there will come a day when you will know.

386
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,750
Maybe at that time, but you cannot kill yourself right now.

387
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:59,490
What is that wench saying right now?

388
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,660
Eunuch Dok Man.

389
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,560
Yes, My Lady.

390
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:09,150
From today on, don't allow any water or food into the Cold Palace.

391
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:14,140
- How dare you—
- It's not my doing but Empress Dowager's wish.

392
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,910
Your Majesty, please return the imperial prince.

393
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,980
You cannot raise him here anyway.

394
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,160
Your Majesty.

395
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:28,650
Baby! My baby! Maha! Give me my baby back!

396
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:32,380
- Maha! Maha!
- Please be calm, Your Majesty.

397
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,110
Take the imperial prince!

398
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,680
Maha! Maha!

399
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,000
Your Majesty.

400
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,710
Maha! Bring me back my baby!

401
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,480
Your Majesty!

402
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:55,220
I am the emperor's lawful wife and the mother of this country.

403
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,360
Once I am back in the Imperial Palace,

404
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,940
a horrific hell will be awaiting you,

405
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,030
so just wait for it.

406
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:13,500
You will need to come back as soon as possible. Leaving a house empty

407
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,860
allows for a new owner to occupy it.

408
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,800
What did you say? A new owner?

409
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:35,750
That wench acts like she's the empress!

410
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,690
We heard the imperial prince was found, so the Kurultai will be held tomorrow again.

411
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,990
Why did you betray me?

412
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:02,960
Do you not realize to whom you owe thanks for being installed as a magistrate?

413
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,480
The late Emperor Mingzong is the one who made me walk down the path of a soldier.

414
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,630
What am I doing wrong by being loyal to his son?

415
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,820
Silence!

416
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,560
During my youth, you were my hero.

417
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,290
You gained your reputation by fighting many wars out in the stormy desert.

418
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:28,720
I remember clearly how you teared up as you gave your

419
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,460
military jacket to a dying soldier.

420
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:39,000
But the man who stands in front of me now, is not the hero who made my heart race back then.

421
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,920
Instead of someone who rules the world, you've become a coward who is being ruled by the sweetness of power.

422
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,800
How dare you!

423
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:54,650
- Keep talking.
- This country is rotten to the core.

424
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,180
You made it that way.

425
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:04,450
It is only right that the emperor reigns and it's up to the vassals to show him our loyalty.

426
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,900
I am only trying to follow that reasoning.

427
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,700
I followed the will of the heavens, not the will of the emperor.

428
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,940
Me ruling this country is the correct reasoning!

429
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,200
Your betrayal will never be forgotten.

430
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,400
I will not.

431
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,960
Toqto'a.

432
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,090
Yes, Uncle.

433
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:45,690
If I turn into a man like the prime minister,

434
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,460
please kill me.

435
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,240
Rather than age hideously while blinded by power,

436
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:01,730
wouldn't it be better to die as an upright soldier?

437
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:15,040
I thought too little of the emperor. To think the biggest idiot could put on such an act!

438
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,060
Exactly, what made him change so much?

439
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,690
Lady Ki is to blame.

440
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,750
The empress being locked up in the Cold Palace, how General Bayan changed his allegiance, and how the emperor was transformed.

441
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,980
They all started happening when Lady Ki arrived.

442
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,980
I've become laughable.

443
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:40,230
El Temur who put the fear in the heavens has become a fool because of a mere royal concubine!

444
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:47,940
We have no time, Father. Before the Kurultai is held tomorrow, we must figure out a way to hold onto the imperial seal!

445
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,650
Father!

446
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,740
Yeom Byeong Soo.

447
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,720
Yes, Sir!

448
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:01,230
How many prisoners are awaiting death?

449
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:07,310
There are three. Why do you ask?

450
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:11,050
I need to see them.

451
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,210
Do you have family?

452
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,310
I have... an old mother who's alone at home.

453
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,360
I have a young child.

454
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,090
I have no one.

455
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,960
Kill him.

456
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,500
Please, Sir!

457
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:39,140
It'll be hard for you to avoid death. But if you fulfill my order,

458
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:43,180
I will make sure your families live on comfortably.

459
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,360
How about it? Will you do as I ask?

460
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,320
If-If you will keep your promise,

461
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,020
I will do whatever it takes.

462
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,010
Clean them up well and shave off their mustaches. Dress them up in eunuch clothing.

463
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,760
Pardon?

464
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,510
Yes, Prime Minister.

465
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:11,460
You will secretly go into the imperial quarters with the help from the Imperial Guard.

466
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:15,460
Father, what will you make them do?

467
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,760
They will hide out in the imperial prince's room with daggers.

468
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,720
Father!

469
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,190
You will become assassins tonight!

470
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,560
I will make them fail at assassinating the imperial prince.

471
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,200
If they get arrested and tortured,

472
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,970
they will admit who hired them to kill the imperial prince.

473
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:53,620
- That will be one of the magistrates.
-That's right.

474
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:59,840
There's a saying. Strike the grass to surprise the snakes.

475
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:06,900
If we use one of the magistrates, the rest of them will crawl to us on their own.

476
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:12,740
If we manage to get it done this time, there won't be any more issues about holding onto the imperial seal.

477
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,830
The room that the imperial prince is should be free of people.

478
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:31,090
Do not worry. I've put in a word.

479
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,370
Don't forget to get caught at an opportune moment

480
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:42,250
after pretending to be assassins.

481
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,960
Lady Ki especially told me to forgive you,

482
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:00,960
so don't take the imperial prince to the Cold Palace ever again!

483
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,610
Yes, Sir.

484
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,310
Wait.

485
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,760
Stop right there.

486
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,690
To whom do you belong?

487
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:36,140
There are no eunuchs in this palace whom I don't know. Tell me who you are!

488
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:53,070
They're assassins!

489
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,300
Don't kill them but take them alive!

490
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,160
Yes, Sir!

491
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,480
Is the imperial prince safe?

492
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,850
I was just coming from there.

493
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,820
How dare they try to harm the imperial prince?

494
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,010
Without any fear, how could they...

495
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,700
Drag them away.

496
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,330
Yes, Sir!

497
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,000
Wait!

498
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:44,050
No!

499
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,560
I'll go to Empress Dowager. You go and tell His Majesty.

500
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,360
Yes, Sir.

501
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,860
I was very moved by you today.

502
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:10,180
Other magistrates are also praising you endlessly.

503
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,420
This is all thanks to...

504
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,590
all of you.

505
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:25,590
But, Your Majesty, when will you reveal the bloodletter of the late Emperor Mingzong?

506
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:34,730
I will use it to behead the prime minister.

507
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,700
Every time I see the bloodletter,

508
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,650
I can hear my father's voice full of deep resentment.

509
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:48,070
Once I become a true emperor,

510
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,040
I will follow up on his intentions first.

511
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:58,880
That day is drawing near.

512
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,870
Your Majesty!

513
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,670
An assassin entered the imperial prince's quarters and tried to get close to him.

514
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:30,310
What? An assassin? Whom did he try to kill?

515
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,860
I apologize for this,

516
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,410
but it was the imperial prince.

517
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:42,200
The imperial prince? He tried to kill my son?

518
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

519
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:50,590
Exactly who dared to...

520
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:56,660
Oh, Your Majesty, please come to your senses.

521
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:59,820
Your Majesty. Go and tell someone she has fainted.

522
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:02,090
Yes, Ma'am.

523
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,420
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

524
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,960
Your Majesty.

525
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,780
I am asking you. Please kill me quickly.

526
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,050
Did you forget what your task was?

527
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,420
You are to stay quiet and then...

528
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,850
Empress Dowager is coming.

529
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,220
- Start.
- Yes.

530
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,820
Stop!

531
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:39,150
You're here, Your Highness.

532
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,520
- Is this him?
- Yes.

533
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,180
Who told you to kill the imperial prince?

534
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,890
Hurry up and tell me the truth!

535
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:50,350
You're here?

536
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:05,320
He dared to try killing my grandson. I will question him myself, so please return to your quarters.

537
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,560
There is no Kurultai tomorrow.

538
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:16,090
We will hold it after we find out the truth about this matter first.

539
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,920
Something's strange?

540
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,400
What is strange exactly?

541
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:33,580
I subdued the assassin, but he didn't know any martial arts.

542
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:37,680
Since Eunuch Park used to be an instructor of martial arts, I trust his judgment.

543
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,880
An assassin not knowing how to fight?

544
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,330
Gahwawooin.

545
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:50,470
El Temur is scheming to make up an offense and blame someone else for it.

546
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:54,930
Who will he place the blame on?

547
00:54:54,930 --> 00:55:00,290
There's a real wicked thing named Ki. That wench bothers me to no end.

548
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:04,430
Wang Yoo has also been betrayed by that wench.

549
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:08,890
The assassin will name her as the one who asked him to kill the imperial prince.

550
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:15,500
Bayan, Toqto'a, and that wench Ki will be revealed as masterminds of this incident.

551
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,100
El Temur will try to protect the imperial seal over this matter.

552
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:27,000
In order to do that, he will need to make one of the magistrates the offender.

553
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,360
We will become the first prey.

554
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,680
We can no longer be made to suffer.

555
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,260
Hurry up and find a way.

556
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,250
If Toqto'a is right,

557
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,430
we have no way out of this right now.

558
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:49,680
I will... meet with Prime Minister.

559
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:55,700
Then... do you have a way to save ourselves from trouble?

560
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:01,580
In order to cool the boiling water, we must first remove firewood from the fire.

561
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:09,210
If El Temur is going to attack by making up a crime, we must also pretend to have something and face him.

562
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:14,100
Are you saying you will face El Temur's force with force?

563
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,440
Right now, this is the only solution we have.

564
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:20,810
I will go with you.

565
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:24,980
Please leave it to me, Your Majesty.

566
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,970
I will take my leave.

567
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:42,270
Don't worry about me. The abdication didn't happen, but I will not lose the imperial seal.

568
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:48,630
Father, Lady Ki is outside.

569
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:51,870
What? Lady Ki?

570
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,820
I will send her away right now.

571
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,720
Let her in.

572
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:01,880
Why would you deal with the likes of that girl?

573
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,850
How dare you come here?

574
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,890
I didn't come to see you, General Tanqishi.

575
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,760
I came to see Prime Minister.

576
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:40,220
You're quite brave. Coming into the tiger's den as a mere imperial concubine.

577
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:47,510
Why would someone who's tiger-like come up with a scheme that is not even expected of a cat?

578
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:49,310
What did you say?

579
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:08,470
♫ Love is such a sad word to me that it's maddening ♫

580
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:14,340
♫ Even if my heart aches some words must be endured ♫

581
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:19,520
♫  Even if dawn breaks with tears and my heart falls apart ♫
