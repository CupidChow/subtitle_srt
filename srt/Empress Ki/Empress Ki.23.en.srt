1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,820
My baby...

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,160
Don't worry.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,090
Like my mother protected me,

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,020
I'll...

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,290
I'll protect you.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,590
Don't worry, Baby.

7
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,330
Your Majesty!

8
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,560
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,540
Why are you acting up all of a sudden?

10
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,530
You need to go to Yuan for me, Jeom Bak.

11
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,090
Why all of a sudden?

12
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,040
There's been no correspondence, and I can't get in touch with Bang Shin Woo either.

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,230
I think something has happened.

14
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,990
Do not worry, Sire. I will get going.

15
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,740
Look here! Come on!

16
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,030
Come on, wake up!

17
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,580
You're still awake!

18
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,610
You can't die like this!

19
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,770
Just bear with it for a little while longer.

20
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,410
Now, come on. You've become so heavy!

21
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,340
You have a...

22
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,830
star-shaped birthmark.

23
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,380
Baby.

24
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,430
Until your father comes

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,050
and gives you a name,

26
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,030
I'll call you Star.

27
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,590
Star.

28
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,770
Thank you for being born healthy.

29
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,060
Thank you, my baby...

30
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,740
Thank you, my baby...

31
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,820
She hasn't been able to escape the hills.

32
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,190
Seach for her thoroughly!

33
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,740
Don't cry, my baby.

34
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,790
Don't cry. Please!

35
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,690
Please don't cry! You can't cry!

36
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,530
We won't die!

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,870
I will...

38
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,110
Your mother... Your mother will protect you, don't worry.

39
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,860
That wench! Stop right there!

40
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,850
Wench! You'll die today!

41
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,170
Get rid of her.

42
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,070
No!

43
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,500
Over that way!

44
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,140
Captain!

45
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,920
A court lady got away and made it back to the palace!

46
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,860
- What?
- General Talahai gave orders to take care of Lady Park's body.

47
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,670
Damn it.

48
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,770
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

49
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,340
We're ready. Let's go.

50
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,410
I think we need to take care of Seung Nyang's body, too.

51
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,910
Pardon? She fell over the cliff after being shot with an arrow.

52
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,550
How are we to find her?

53
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,400
General Tanqishi will be happy if he sees her dead body.

54
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,160
We're late. We have to quickly give this news to Her Majesty as well.

55
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,220
What's the matter?

56
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,980
Now, cut me.

57
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:20,000
We need a story to tell when we get back! If you want to stay alive, do it now.

58
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,290
Yes, Sir.

59
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,050
- Then I'll do it.
- Hold on!

60
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,150
With this, no one will suspect us.

61
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,980
Your Majesty!

62
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,890
Wh-Who... Who...

63
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,850
- Who is she?
- Your Majesty,

64
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,360
Lady Park was...

65
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,610
attacked by bandits and lost her life!

66
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,520
T- Tell me slowly. What happened exactly?

67
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,340
Lady Park... lost her life...

68
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,300
and all the servants...

69
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,270
died as well.

70
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,170
I-I heard that...

71
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,390
Ya-Yang was there, too.

72
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,080
W-What happened to her? Did she die, too?

73
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,820
She ran away with me,

74
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,260
so she probably didn't die.

75
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,860
Your Majesty!

76
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,760
Lady Park's body has...

77
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,120
arrived.

78
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,840
Your Majesty! Please kill us!

79
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,870
Please kill us, Your Majesty!

80
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,670
Where are all the other bodies?

81
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,390
Because of the bandits, we barely managed to retrieve Lady Park's body.

82
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,680
Why didn't you do your job?!

83
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,700
I apologize.

84
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,760
Lady Park needed to relieve herself

85
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,430
and told us to move away from the area, so...

86
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,190
Gather the soldiers. We're going to go after those who killed Lady Park.

87
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,290
I'll go with you.

88
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,090
You will need Father's permission to leave the palace.

89
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,820
Then, are you telling me to stay holed up in the palace?

90
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,580
Leave this matter to us, Your Majesty.

91
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,030
Yes, General.

92
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,680
Look for Yang.

93
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,170
I'm certain she knows who is responsible for this.

94
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

95
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm sorry.

96
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,080
Sorry...

97
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,760
I'm sorry...

98
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,670
Where are the bandits right now?

99
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,790
They're gathered at a place far away from here.

100
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,350
Mobilize the soldiers.

101
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,280
If we're to shut them up, we mustn't leave any of them alive.

102
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,260
Understood, Brother.

103
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,020
But, General...

104
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:16,110
Seung Nyang has been caught in the trap set to catch the fox.

105
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,270
What do you mean?

106
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,530
That Seung Nyang wench you've been desperately looking for...

107
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,540
Where is she?

108
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,120
She's dead.

109
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,020
What?

110
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,920
I... pierced the wench's heart.

111
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,080
Her body fell down the cliff and...

112
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,030
I told you to bring her alive! I'm the one who should have killed her!

113
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,150
Why did you kill her? Why?!

114
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,620
Ge-Ge-General!

115
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,740
Please stop, Brother.

116
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,170
We would have killed the wench anyway, even if she was captured alive.

117
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,050
- Captain Yeom did his best.
- Why!

118
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,540
Who's there?

119
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,380
Dok Man!

120
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,690
It's me. Bang Shin Woo.

121
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,980
What are you doing here?

122
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,700
I'm on my way to look for Yang's body.

123
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,440
Yang has... died?

124
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,960
Yeom Byeong Soo, that disease of a guy,

125
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,330
that wicked person killed her.

126
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,410
The captain of the Kheshigs...

127
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:49,990
Then... was Lady Park not killed by bandits?

128
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,490
The empress bribed them.

129
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:58,550
I heard them clearly with my own ears.

130
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,880
How could this happen?

131
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,390
What? The empress did it?

132
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:10,200
She hated Lady Park so much. She finally committed a grave sin, Your Highness.

133
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,880
You can't do that if you're a human being.

134
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,340
How could she so brutally kill her when she was carrying the royal heir?

135
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,610
The torment is too great

136
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,740
for His Majesty to deal with alone.

137
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,090
What can we do about this?

138
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,720
Go tell His Majesty.

139
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,800
His torment should never result in a display of rage.

140
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,280
Until he's gained power, he should never act rashly.

141
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,330
I understand, Your Highness.

142
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,440
Luckily, he's over the hump,

143
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,960
but he sustained a huge injury to his reproductive organs.

144
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,740
Then he can't live as a normal male?

145
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,500
Just being alive is thanks to the Buddha's blessings.

146
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,870
You're up.

147
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:39,210
If it wasn't for this mirror, the arrow would have pierced your heart.

148
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,970
But... why is there a piece of cloth in here?

149
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,510
What about the baby?

150
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:54,150
Huh? The bundle on your back was a baby?

151
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,370
If he fell from that height, he would have died.

152
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,250
Where are you going in that state?

153
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,050
Stop!

154
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,690
Seung Nyang.

155
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,840
Seung Nyang, the baby's dead!

156
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,720
No.

157
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,910
He couldn't have died like this.

158
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm sure... he's somewhere here.

159
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,540
- Seung Nyang.
- Star! Star!

160
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,740
Seung Nyang, it's no use!

161
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,300
He's alive!

162
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,100
My baby... He's alive!

163
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,430
He's alive.

164
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,920
Come to your senses!

165
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,390
Star! Star!

166
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,600
He's not dead!

167
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,470
My baby! My baby!

168
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:17,060
Seung Nyang, please!

169
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,600
My baby! No!

170
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,080
My baby hasn't died!

171
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,030
He's not dead!

172
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,500
Star!

173
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,830
Star!

174
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,470
Your Majesty, it's Head Eunuch Dok Man!

175
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,340
Let him in!

176
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,700
All right, what's happened to Yang?

177
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,200
You haven't found her yet?

178
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,240
Yang is...

179
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,930
Yang is no longer...

180
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,850
with us.

181
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,080
N-Not... Not...

182
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Not wi-with... us anymore?

183
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,540
Then... do you mean Yang...

184
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,780
Yang has... d- died?

185
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

186
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,440
Her body...

187
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:03,140
Have you found her body?

188
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,020
She was hit by an arrow shot by a Kheshig

189
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,210
and fell over the cliff.

190
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:18,120
Kheshig? Wasn't it b-because of bandits?

191
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,720
Exactly...

192
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,310
Exactly... who's doing was this?

193
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,850
Exactly...

194
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,560
Exactly whose doing is this...

195
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,360
Tell... Tell me in detail.

196
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:42,470
Exactly whose doing is this. Tell me in detail.

197
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,840
Whose doing is this...

198
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,540
Ttell me.... Tell me in detail...

199
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,650
Those bastards...

200
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,470
How could they work with bandits and do this?

201
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,550
I saw it all.

202
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:25,430
I saw the Kheshigs killing all the servants who were running away.

203
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,730
Now,

204
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,620
let's head down.

205
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,240
Come on, you're not even well.

206
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,530
I'll dig the grave, so you get some rest.

207
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,090
They died because of me.

208
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,320
In order to save me and my baby...

209
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,150
they came outside the palace and...

210
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,040
You must raise the baby well.

211
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,860
Hurry up. Run away.

212
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,680
You must... You must save the baby.

213
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:17,100
I have... a request to make of you.

214
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,320
Please tell me.

215
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,840
Can you kill me?

216
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,500
Your Majesty.

217
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,850
I have no reason to live anymore.

218
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,550
Rather than live this foolishly and incompetently,

219
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,990
I'd rather die by your hands.

220
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,390
You must be strong now more than ever.

221
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,630
Golta,

222
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:58,130
all the people who I cared about have all left.

223
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,020
Father, too,

224
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,850
and Yang.

225
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,050
I'd rather die, too...

226
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,300
and break away from this hellish palace.

227
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,800
I don't care if it's the nether world.

228
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,980
With Yang... With Yang, I want to talk with her as much as I wish.

229
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,430
Your Majesty.

230
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,090
So please kill me.

231
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,570
End this tiresome life of mine.

232
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,830
You must not say such things!

233
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,320
I can't live and I can't die!

234
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,630
Exactly what can I do?

235
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,950
I'm so frustrated!

236
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:55,510
It's so frustrated that I... I feel like I'll go insane.

237
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:02,580
My heart feels like... it's going to stop.

238
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,030
Your Majesty!

239
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,190
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Please get a hold of yourself, Your Majesty!

240
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,940
Anyone there! Get the physician!

241
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,510
Your Majesty!

242
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,000
How is he?

243
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,840
It's aphasia.
 (T/N: Losing the ability to express speech)

244
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,070
Aphasia? You mean, he can't speak?

245
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,130
Yes, Prime Minister. His mind has grown dim, too,

246
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:44,040
so he won't be able to express himself properly.

247
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,060
Until when!

248
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:51,060
I cannot... guarantee anything at the moment.

249
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,270
Everyone out.

250
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,810
Yes, Sir.

251
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,360
Your Majesty...

252
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:14,990
Well, I give the imperial order anyway,

253
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,230
since your mouth is useless anyway.

254
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:23,020
Enjoy your delusions while taking care of your royal body, Your Majesty.

255
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,480
Just a little more.

256
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:01,550
Your Majesty, how about returning to the palace?

257
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:08,550
What did the physician say?

258
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,500
In your current state, even in the best of conditions,

259
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,940
pregnancy is impossible.

260
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,020
So please gather up your strength as soon as possible and—

261
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,670
Find a newborn somewhere.

262
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,280
- Pardon?
- Get me a newborn even if you have to steal one!

263
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,320
Your Majesty, we can resolve this simply by having the physician go back and say that you lost the baby.

264
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,390
His Majesty is going to bring in Royal Concubines soon.

265
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,980
If one of those wenches becomes pregnant...

266
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,770
are you telling me to kill them all just like Lady Park?

267
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,960
But, Your Majesty...

268
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:58,420
I've already... come too far.

269
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,340
With the past events already having taken place,

270
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,650
there's no other way but to take it as far as I can.

271
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,690
Am I... Am I hearing things?

272
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,350
It sounds like a baby crying.

273
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,180
Your Majesty.

274
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,210
Greetings, Your Majesty.

275
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,770
Whose baby is this?

276
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,370
The baby's father was found dead in the mountains holding the baby.

277
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,620
Here, give him to me.

278
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,250
Yes.

279
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,520
Your Majesty, he smiled at you.

280
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,500
B-But... why is he so small?

281
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,730
It seems like he was born prematurely.

282
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:20,100
How sad... He must be hungry for his mother's milk.

283
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,710
I'll take care of the baby for the time being.

284
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,340
Pardon?

285
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:31,970
Oh, I think she's taken a liking to the baby with her due date approaching.

286
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,080
Then please, Your Majesty.

287
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,100
You're so cute!

288
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,400
Your Majesty.

289
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,110
Your Majesty.

290
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,280
I'll take this baby.

291
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,630
We don't even know who he belongs to. We don't know how he'll be when he grows up.

292
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:04,020
Don't you dare speak so harshly. Buddha pitied me and sent me this baby.

293
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,640
I'm... this baby's mother.

294
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:17,310
But... all the nuns at this hermitage already know the baby's identity.

295
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:23,840
Dead people... don't speak.

296
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,890
Your Majesty...

297
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:30,080
There are only three nuns at this hermitage.

298
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,270
Poison them.

299
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,430
Your Majesty.

300
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:40,400
Why? Are you scared?

301
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,040
If you can't do it, then I'll have to.

302
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:55,130
How could I let you... put blood on your hands, Your Majesty?

303
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,780
I'll do it.

304
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:07,090
My baby, from now on, you're my son.

305
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:12,970
The empress of this country is your mother, my baby.

306
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,390
Over here. Hurry.

307
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,550
Those men are merchants.

308
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:05,430
They're peddlers who wander around and travel all the way to the government offices in the west.

309
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:11,680
They're evil people who capture those without relatives and sell them as slaves.

310
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,400
It'll be trouble if we get caught, so let's get away. Hurry.

311
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:43,250
By the looks of them, I'm certain they're on the run after committing a crime.

312
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,070
This guy will fetch us a good amount of money.

313
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,380
And this girl... Her features are...

314
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,290
Move them!

315
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,790
Burn the fake currency.

316
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,720
Your Majesty, there's a problem.

317
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,790
It became known that the Yuan currency in the state coffers was counterfeit.

318
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:31,180
All the marketplaces in not only the capital but Hwangju and Byeongnando are in turmoil.

319
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,610
What?

320
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,350
Please stop!

321
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,370
The price of Yuan currency fell by a third

322
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:49,250
and all those who were in possession of it are unable to pay back their loans and are being thrown out into the streets.

323
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,590
At this rate, it's only a matter of time before the whole treasury system collapses.

324
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,160
Who's been spreading the rumor about the counterfeit currency?

325
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,920
It smells like a conspiracy.

326
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:07,140
Maybe... those who made the counterfeits have already infiltrated Goryeo.

327
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:13,470
If that's true, what is it that they're after?

328
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,030
They're all fighting to sell Yuan currency that used to be worth two taels of silver.

329
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,140
The breakdown of Goryeo's commercial authority is already in my hands.

330
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,470
Soon, the price of Yuan currency will go up by multiple values, so buy them up as much as you can.

331
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,340
How will you raise the price of Yuan currency?

332
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,610
Those in Yeongyeong should be working on it right now,

333
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,440
so you don't need to worry.

334
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,230
I understand.

335
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,420
The one going up against me here is Wang Yoo...

336
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,090
What a peculiar fate.

337
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,240
Isn't this El Temür's house?

338
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,820
It looks like we're going to be sold off as slaves to this household.

339
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,370
It's been a while, Sir.

340
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,490
Father is waiting. Go on in.

341
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,680
Yes, General.

342
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,850
Who is that strange fellow with a limp?

343
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,200
He's a tradesman who's a puppet for the Hawk House.

344
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,940
He usually peddles slaves.

345
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,830
Is the chief well?

346
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,510
He was in Tibet for a moment but now is staying in Ilkhanate.

347
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,170
Thanks to his price fluctuations with gold, it helped me greatly.

348
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,570
Thank him from me.

349
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,450
Yes, Prime Minister.

350
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:14,410
But our chief has a request of you.

351
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,710
Request? Tell me.

352
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,510
Because of the counterfeits in Goryeo, the value of banknotes has gone down quite a lot.

353
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:26,400
He wonders if you could raise the value of one banknote to three taels of silver.

354
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,890
One banknote for three taels? It's usually two.

355
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,120
What if you make a petition to the emperor and have His Majesty send an imperial sanction to Goryeo?

356
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,770
I am the one who holds the seal.

357
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:44,870
It's a request from the Chief of Hawk House. How could I refuse?

358
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,850
Thank you, Sir.

359
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:52,600
I also have a request to make of you, too.

360
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:58,490
Soon, I'm going to marry off my niece. Do you have anything special?

361
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,610
I have many rare and precious items, but who is she marrying?

362
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:11,370
A man named Wang Yoo from Goryeo's Royal family.

363
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:24,820
Her Majesty has bestowed this tea in return for your gracious hospitality.

364
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,890
Please have a drink.

365
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,530
Thank you for the tea.

366
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:57,300
After we leave, set fire to this place.

367
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,300
I understand.

368
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,880
I am a little late.

369
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,190
It's fine.

370
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,950
Let's go.

371
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,410
Be careful since she's due to give birth very soon!

372
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,710
Let's go!

373
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,310
Let's go!

374
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:01,790
If you hide the baby on your stomach, no one will know.

375
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,120
He might cry during the trip.

376
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:10,480
If you give him sleeping medicine, there shouldn't be any problems entering the palace.

377
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,260
How is the preparation going?

378
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,220
The umbilical cord and the placenta have already been placed inside the palace.

379
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:22,130
Once we get through this safely, I will reward you greatly.

380
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,580
Your grace overflows, Your Majesty.

381
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,710
Once we get into the palace, you'll become my son.

382
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,500
You're going to be the Crown Prince of this country, my baby.

383
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,170
Move aside, it's Her Majesty the Empress!

384
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,880
Whoa.

385
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,360
There's a saying you meet your enemy on a single log bridge.

386
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,830
We meet that wicked woman here.

387
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:34,270
Danashiri, you just wait.

388
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:40,300
I'll rip your body to shreds to avenge the death of

389
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,630
my baby and my friends.

390
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:57,010
Your Majesty! Her Majesty is about to give birth!

391
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,830
You need to go and at least have a look at your baby, Your Majesty.

392
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,900
Father, he seems to be in a state of confusion still.

393
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:12,160
You never were a proper husband. Now the same goes for being a father.

394
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,150
Really!

395
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:43,010
I can't see and I can't hear.

396
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,590
Just...

397
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,080
Just lean back comfortably.

398
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,050
Just a little bit more, Your Majesty!

399
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,760
A little... A little more, Your Majesty!

400
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,020
Push a little more, Your Majesty.

401
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,640
Your Majesty!

402
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,700
Little more!

403
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,920
The baby is coming, Your Majesty!

404
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,590
A little more, Your Majesty!

405
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:08,870
Your Majesty, it's a son!

406
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,370
It's a son, Your Majesty!

407
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,590
A son, Your Majesty!

408
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,690
Congratulations!

409
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,520
Yes.

410
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,130
Your Majesty!

411
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:45,220
Good job, Your Majesty.

412
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,530
But... has there been any change in His Majesty's condition?

413
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:54,530
It doesn't affect his life, so no need to worry.

414
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,120
It's a great occasion for the country. How about a banquet?

415
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:04,890
I have invited all the magistrates of each province to be here, Your Majesty.

416
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,000
Well done.

417
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,040
But we need to give the crown prince a name.

418
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,060
Father, please give him one. Is there a name you've had in mind?

419
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:18,940
How is Maha?

420
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,090
Maha?

421
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:26,170
It means big and great in Buddism.

422
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,220
I like it, Father.

423
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,020
Maha.

424
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,440
Grow healthy and become a great emperor like your name

425
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,400
Understand?

426
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,720
My goodness.

427
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,610
You mustn't issue an royal edict, Father.

428
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,510
The merchants...

429
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:02,160
are barely maintaining the economy by selling off the banknotes for cheap.

430
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,460
If the rate of one banknote becomes equal to three taels of silver,

431
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,390
they will all be unable to recover and will be ruined.

432
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:11,880
Yuan sent an order for us to do so.

433
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,900
Many years ago, we had a counterfeit issue which caused the depreciation of banknote.

434
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,670
Yuan raised the banknote's value then too, and it was detrimental to our state treasury.

435
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,990
Then, are you saying they're controlling this?

436
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:32,050
I'm tailing those who bought the banknotes.

437
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,480
So please delay issuing the royal edict.

438
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,550
I can't wait too long.

439
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,750
I understand, Father.

440
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,220
No need to worry.

441
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:50,920
The imperial decree from Yuan has arrived, so it'll be announced soon.

442
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,320
The rate of banknotes we've bought up has gone up threefold!

443
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,600
As soon as the notice is given, use the banknotes and buy up all the ginseng in Goryeo.

444
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,570
Yes, Chief.

445
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,130
Wang Yoo...

446
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:12,820
Last time at the border, I was defeated.

447
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,520
But this time, it'll be different.

448
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:25,060
Your Majesty.

449
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,820
Eunuch Bang, what are you doing here?

450
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:34,590
We met... while on my way to Yuan.

451
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,470
What about Seung Nyang?

452
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,150
Your Majesty...

453
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,790
Didn't Seung Nyang come with you?

454
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,420
Please...

455
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:52,220
Please kill me, Your Majesty...

456
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,500
Where is Seung Nyang?

457
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,760
Why did you come alone?

458
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,720
She has...

459
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,540
died...

460
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,700
Your Majesty.

461
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,590
Your Majesty.

462
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,990
That's impossible.

463
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:24,680
Seung Nyang died?

464
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,760
You are wrong.

465
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,970
She was shot with an arrow

466
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:38,270
and fell off a cliff.

467
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,570
Who did that to her?

468
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:47,870
The empress...

469
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,230
The empress...

470
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:53,090
made her brothers...

471
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,090
carry it out.

472
00:49:56,090 --> 00:50:00,360
The empress!

473
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:10,030
Your Majesty.

474
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,460
Your Majesty.

475
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:19,690
Please kill me, Your Majesty. Please kill me.

476
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:28,040
♫ Disappearing like something blowing and caught in my hand ♫

477
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:38,050
♫ You are as distant as a harsh wind ♫

478
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:44,000
♫ At night when I clutched my chest and held my breath ♫

479
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,660
♫ At night when I clutched my chest and held my breath ♫

480
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,730
What did you wish for?

481
00:50:54,990 --> 00:51:01,280
That you would be restored to the throne as soon as possible.

482
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,810
Was that all?

483
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,590
I'll tell you when you return.

484
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:13,630
But... what did you wish for?

485
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:23,970
That we are together forever.

486
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:31,860
That when we die, we'll die on the same day at the same time. And even in death,

487
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:37,060
that I can be by your side. That was my wish.

488
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:43,680
I also made the same wish.

489
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,050
Is that so?

490
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,150
Yes.

491
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:57,100
Whether alive or dead,

492
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:00,280
that I'll be by your side,

493
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,050
that's what I wished for.

494
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,770
♫ I will wish for you ♫

495
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:11,980
♫ Once again ♫

496
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,250
♫ Just once ♫

497
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:19,490
♫ My plaintive words mixed with tears asking for you ♫

498
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:23,970
♫ Even though they were hard to erase  ♫

499
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:28,070
♫ and erase the painful memories ♫

500
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:30,720
♫ which are imagined again make our sad love sadder ♫

501
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:37,370
♫ which are imagined again make our sad love sadder ♫

502
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:41,540
♫ No matter how I try and try to conceal them  ♫

503
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,680
♫ the tears keep filling my eyes ♫

504
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:50,220
Seung Nyang!

505
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,700
♫ What can I do about the longing  ♫

506
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,150
♫ which runs and overflows like tears? ♫

507
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,310
Seung Nyang...

508
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:03,170
Seung Nyang...

509
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,480
Seung Nyang...

510
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,720
Seung Nyang...

511
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,650
I caught a very strange fellow.

512
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,560
Then does that mean you used to be...

513
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:31,420
a eunuch? If not, were you injured?

514
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,810
Since I was born, I was crippled.

515
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,230
Like you.

516
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:47,340
I'm certain you know martial arts. You're 20 nyang.

517
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:07,430
You are quite beautiful.

518
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:13,590
Your features are very rare. Turn once for me.

519
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,390
I'm from Goryeo.

520
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:19,180
You have no right to capture and sell just anyone.

521
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:24,550
Not just anyone. We only sell those who have committed a crime and are on the run.

522
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:27,020
Stop treating me like a criminal!

523
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:32,090
Most of those who were captured and brought here along with me are innocent.

524
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:39,730
The fact that no one is looking for you is your sin.

525
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:46,220
Aside from that,

526
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:52,530
meeting the wrong people and having been born in such a country

527
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:56,050
that casts you aside,

528
00:54:56,050 --> 00:55:00,820
is the scariest sin of all.

529
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,180
You being useless to anyone in this world, that sin.

530
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:16,170
You're from Goryeo? If you weren't so useless, why else would your country

531
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:21,390
throw you away like a husk of grain?

532
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:31,170
If you want money in exchange for me, I'll give it to you.

533
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,890
I'll send a word to my house.

534
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:38,600
Give it to me right now.

535
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,480
Why? You don't have it?

536
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:49,000
I don't trust anything other than the money I see in front of me.

537
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,720
Take her away.

538
00:55:55,750 --> 00:56:00,590
I'll never forget that dirty face of yours.

539
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,360
How should we price her?

540
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,640
Leave it blank.

541
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,190
Pardon?

542
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:17,860
If she meets the rightful owner, there's no limit to how much she'll be sold for.

543
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,390
Bloodletter...

544
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,180
It's the bloodletter.

545
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,430
♫ Even though they were hard to erase  ♫

546
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:07,530
♫ and erase the painful memories ♫

547
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:16,000
♫ which are imagined again make our sad love sadder ♫
