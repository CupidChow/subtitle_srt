1
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,150
Why are you standing there?

2
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,380
Get back to your place right now.

3
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,470
The expression in His Majesty's eyes have become vicious, like a wild animal.

4
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,000
It's a good thing I brought Wang Yoo. Just look at him getting jealous now because of me.

5
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,190
I am giving you an imperial order which you must obey from now on.

6
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,030
If you don't abide by it,

7
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,530
I will behead you.

8
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,830
You must never speak to Wang Yoo.

9
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,390
You can't look at him or look at him and smile.

10
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,850
And never...

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
cry over him in front of me.

12
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,710
Why are you doing this?

13
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,880
Are you talking back to me after my order?

14
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,080
- His Majesty only—
- His Majesty. His Majesty! His Majesty!

15
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,870
I can't even listen to that word any longer.

16
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,900
Get out.

17
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,400
Follow me.

18
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,700
Would you like to... come back to Goryeo with me?

19
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,100
Let's return together, Seung Nyang.

20
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

21
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,680
I will go.

22
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,500
I will follow you

23
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,840
and return.

24
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,520
It will be a very difficult journey.

25
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,670
I am prepared for it.

26
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,620
I don't know when it will happen.

27
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,530
Whether it's 1,000 or 10,000 years,

28
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,360
I will wait.

29
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,960
Promise me one thing.

30
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,080
Don't think about helping me.

31
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,940
Your being in danger causes me...

32
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,430
more pain than dying.

33
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,070
I understand.

35
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:15,270
♫ Love is such a sad word to me that it's maddening ♫

36
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,380
♫ Even if my heart aches some words must be endured ♫

37
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,910
♫ Even if dawn breaks with tears ♫

38
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,230
♫ and my heart falls apart ♫

39
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:38,050
♫ 'I love you' are the words I couldn't say ♫

40
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,170
♫ How much more ♫

41
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,170
♫ do I have to cry before you will know how I feel? ♫

42
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,540
♫ I can't do without you ♫

43
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:59,040
♫ I can't last even a day without you ♫

44
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,970
Maybe I shouldn't have sent her away.

45
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,190
I should have asked her to read to me some more.

46
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,020
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

47
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,250
R-Rat! Rat, rat!

48
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,500
Catch it!

49
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,150
Oh, seriously.

50
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,380
Do you need your swords to catch a rat?

51
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,830
Put up your swords.

52
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,320
Really... trying to guard me when you all are not even as good as Yang.

53
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,030
Get out.

54
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,570
Get out. Get out!

55
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,670
Have you come to see Empress Dowager?

56
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:53,060
Yes. I think she wants to talk about marriage again.

57
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,510
She is really tenacious.

58
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,290
You said you're not interested, why is she pushing the issue?

59
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,290
Oh, Your Majesty! Be careful! Rats!

60
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,250
Oh no!

61
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,930
Over there!

62
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,930
Please let go of me now.

63
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,030
Th-Thank you, Wang Yoo.

64
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,250
But why are there so many rats in the palace?

65
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,780
I have never seen so many at once.

66
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,390
Anyway, I owe you for today.

67
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,470
I will take my leave now.

68
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,220
Did I... look too unsightly just a moment ago?

69
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,170
Yes!

70
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,900
Not at all, Your Majesty.

71
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,820
Why all the fuss?

72
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,830
Rats! There are rats everywhere!

73
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,070
What? Rats?

74
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,900
You've got a long way to go. You just cannot read the board.

75
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,040
Prime Minister, there's a disaster.

76
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,430
What disaster now?

77
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,560
The palace is overrun with rats.

78
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,750
What? Rats?

79
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,970
It's not as if enemy soldiers have invaded. What's the big deal about some rats?

80
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,970
They are not just rats. There is a large swarm of them.

81
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,550
A large swarm of rats?

82
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,970
How have you managed this palace?

83
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:59,690
I am sorry, Your Highness. No matter how many we catch, they just keep coming.

84
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:05,390
That is not all. There was even a rat in His Majesty's bedroom.

85
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,420
Isn't it strange that this place is suddenly crawling with rats?

86
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,600
I am sorry to tell you this

87
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,750
but there is a strange rumor in the palace.

88
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,340
Strange rumor?

89
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,280
His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Mingzong's

90
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,000
Curse has begun, they say.

91
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,810
The curse has begun?

92
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,450
Why am I undressed when it is so cold? People like us

93
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,750
are full even when we don't eat, and we don't feel the cold. How?

94
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,880
Because we cultivate ourselves morally and religiously.

95
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,810
Yes, cultivate ourselves morally and religiously.

96
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,950
I thought we'd talk about our kingdom today.

97
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,650
The twelve animals of the sky circle. Heaven and Earth.

98
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,890
Rat, cow, tiger, rabbit. What is the rat?

99
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,820
Yes, it's a rat but what are we to rats?

100
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,190
Among the twelve animals, the rat is the first. Why?

101
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:15,740
When there is trouble in Heaven and Earth, the first thing to run away is the rat, I heard.

102
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,700
Oh, he sounds smart.

103
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,270
But why are those rats

104
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,670
only causing trouble in the Imperial Palace where the emperor lives?

105
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,980
The Imperial Palace?

106
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,700
- Then the curse of Emperor MingZong—
- Shhh!

107
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,260
Lower your voice. It means the heavens have become angry.

108
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,420
It's an evil omen for sure.

109
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,690
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

110
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,990
I heard in some villages, wild dogs killed all the villagers.

111
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,360
In my wife's hometown, a large dragon fell down and died.

112
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,160
A dragon fell and died!

113
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,770
A dragon fell and died. No more needs to be said.

114
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,210
What is a dragon? What is a dragon?

115
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,210
The emperor is a dragon.

116
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,560
Oh, hey, hey!

117
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,890
Then did Prime Minister... to Emperor Mingzong,

118
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,520
kill him— Oh!

119
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,630
To sum it up, the prime minister killed the late emperor.

120
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,170
The heavens became angry so rats and dogs are running wild.

121
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,920
What can we do?

122
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,960
What do we do? Any ideas?

123
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,770
We have to pray. Save us, merciful Buddha.

124
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,810
- Save us.
- Save us.

125
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,410
Make sure to secretly let people know this truth.

126
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,990
What do we have to do?

127
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,950
Save us, merciful Buddha.

128
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,610
Save us, merciful Buddha.

129
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,930
No matter what, we have to acknowledge Eunuch Bang's speaking skill.

130
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,420
The unease of the people is turning a ridiculous rumor into truth.

131
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,600
- Save us, Buddha.
- Save us, Buddha.

132
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,780
Have you looked into it?

133
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,760
The rumors of rats swarming into the palace have spread

134
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,070
and everyone is talking about Emperor Mingzong's Curse.

135
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,830
Unease will become resentment

136
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,160
and resentment will soon change into rage.

137
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,650
Then the people's rage will be directed at El Temür.

138
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:26,150
Every last one of them is rotten.

139
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,590
Today, there are no appeals for you to put your imperial seal on.

140
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,070
I understand things a bit, too.

141
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,350
That my father's curse has begun, so strange events are happening in this kingdom—

142
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,470
Who said such things to you, Your Majesty?

143
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,990
I have eyes and ears.

144
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,910
And corpses have ears, eyes, mouths, and noses, too.

145
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,800
Did you forget that I told you to live like a living corpse?

146
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,830
Why are you afraid?

147
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,800
What did you say?

148
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,920
My father's curse,

149
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,190
- why would you—
- Your Majesty!

150
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,290
I can become a living corpse, but the people cannot.

151
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,490
How can you block that many eyes and ears?

152
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,740
The people are foolish beings.

153
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,440
Fear is the wisest way to rule over such foolish people.

154
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,920
Seeing your loose mouth,

155
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,030
it seems you have not yet seen true fear.

156
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,990
Prime Minister!

157
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,330
Please go to the Buddhist temple immediately.

158
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,390
What is it now?

159
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,210
You'll see when you arrive.

160
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,340
I guess it's still too early

161
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,310
for me to properly face Prime Minister El Temür.

162
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,320
Prime Minister El Temür is afraid as well.

163
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,080
Your fear can be seen

164
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,100
and Prime Minister El Temür hides his fear, that is all.

165
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,940
To me,

166
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,090
you made Prime Minister El Temür feel fear.

167
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,030
Did it really seem that way to you?

168
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,040
What happened?

169
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,630
Empress Dowager came to offer a Buddhist prayer

170
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,200
and it was like that, she said.

171
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,350
Bayan, make sure that anyone who saw this does not talk about it.

172
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,820
Not a single word or I will kill all of you.

173
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,960
Yes, Prime Minister.

174
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,410
Empress Dowager, you better not tell anyone either.

175
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,340
You've made Buddha cry tears of blood!

176
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,920
You sure are something!

177
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,870
I told you to be careful of what you say!

178
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,800
Everything has become crystal clear now.

179
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,750
The curse. The curse has begun.

180
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,540
Curse, you say? Someone just put some blood on the statue of the Buddha.

181
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,470
Can you really say that after having seen this yourself?

182
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,990
Those years of famine and disasters, they are all due to your sins, Prime Minister.

183
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,270
Shut your mouth!

184
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,850
Do you not fear Buddha?

185
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,390
What's the big deal about a statue of Buddha?

186
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,570
Have you gone mad!

187
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,500
In this kingdom, do you know how many temples I burned down while out conquering?

188
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,750
I can cut down a statue like that with one blow.

189
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,930
You are not in your right mind. You have gone insane!

190
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,950
Father, please stop now.

191
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:11,010
I am the one who will bring down curses now. On you and on the emperor!

192
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,150
I would prefer it if you didn't receive my curse due to such useless rumors.

193
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,760
Empress Dowager, are you all right?

194
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,620
I am all right.

195
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:43,140
Merciful Buddha, please look upon kindly on your poor people...

196
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,410
Have I gotten old already? Or

197
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,510
did I just encounter a strong foe, unlike any I've faced before?

198
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,540
I'm certain this foe is on a different level than any enemy I've met before.

199
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:08,650
To push me this far? Just who is this enemy?

200
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,540
The Buddha was crying tears of blood?

201
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:28,060
Yes, Head Eunuch Dok Man said El Temür is making sure everyone keeps their mouths shut about it.

202
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,620
The real Buddha obviously didn't cry tears of blood.

203
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,940
So who did it?

204
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,350
Whoever it was,

205
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,300
El Temür must feel like he's been driven to the extreme.

206
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,770
So now he will need someone.

207
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,430
Need someone?

208
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,020
Someone who accurately understands his feelings

209
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,500
and can become his strength.

210
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,050
And who is that?

211
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,280
Why is Wang Yoo with Prime Minister El Temür?

212
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,870
If I put this stone down, it'll cut off the breath of your entire group of stones.

213
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,900
Try it then.

214
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,870
It's too late for a defense.

215
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,250
Oh...

216
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,930
I was only concentrating on the offensive and didn't think about the defensive.

217
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,980
I lost. Tell me then.

218
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,620
I'm sure you didn't take away my time just for a game of baduk (Go).

219
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,840
I've already told you many things through this game.

220
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,690
The reason you lost this game is because you only thought about a vigorous offensive.

221
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,460
I lost because I only thought of offensive tactics?

222
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,860
Do you think I'm in such a dire situation that I need your help?

223
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,840
Is that not true?

224
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,140
To me, this is all just like a passing rain shower.

225
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,190
If you are playing tricks in order to approach me in the pursuit of being restored to the throne, you can forget it.

226
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,780
I heard that the power you have now is thanks to the grandfather of the emperor,

227
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,620
Emperor Wuzong, whom you betrayed.

228
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:36,400
How unrelenting and tough the passion of surviving with absolute power is.

229
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,690
Aren't you the one who knows best about that?

230
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,580
Do you want to die?

231
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,590
Please don't make the same mistake as Emperor Wuzong.

232
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,730
Sometimes the passing rain brings typhoons.

233
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,150
You haven't gone to bed yet?

234
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:23,200
Wang Yoo made me realize three big things.

235
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,830
What do you mean?

236
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:32,190
First, because of the enemies in front of me, I overlooked the enemies that are unseen.

237
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:39,660
Second, forcing an attack isn't the only way to win against the enemy. And third...

238
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,930
What's the third?

239
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:47,440
Right now, the person I need the most is Wang Yoo.

240
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
You trust him?

241
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,970
I never had anyone who gave me these realizations.

242
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,020
Don't trust him. You cannot!

243
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,360
I know him well. He will never be loyal to you.

244
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,340
Are you jealous of his abilities?

245
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,890
What do you mean? Absolutely not.

246
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,720
Your eyes are full of foolish envy.

247
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,940
Is that why you went against my command and sent Wang Yoo to the border in order to kill him?

248
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,030
An incompetent son who prostrates before me isn't whom I need right now.

249
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:27,540
Exactly, what do you do for me?!

250
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,860
Father...

251
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,170
You still have such a long way to go.

252
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:37,820
You have to learn a lot in order to be anywhere near as capable as Wang Yoo!

253
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,950
This time... you are wrong, Father.

254
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,240
Just wait and see. I will unmask Wang Yoo

255
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,830
and show you for certain

256
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,510
what kind of a son I really am.

257
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,430
Seung Nyang. Seung Nyang!

258
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,330
What are you doing here?

259
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,880
Your Majesty.

260
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,560
Oh right, Seung Nyang.

261
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,050
The guards patrol this area frequently.

262
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,630
Oh... I'll be leaving soon.

263
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,390
Seung Nyang,

264
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,030
by chance, the one who put the blood on the Buddha statue was...

265
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,960
Wasn't that your doing?

266
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,490
Right.

267
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,790
I did that, so don't believe in strange rumors.

268
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

269
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,970
Please hurry and leave.

270
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,330
Right, I'll get going.

271
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,490
Watching you work so hard all alone...

272
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,110
I just couldn't stand by and watch.

273
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,430
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

274
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,550
My Lady, let me wash you.

275
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,160
You're Yang?

276
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,120
You share a room with me?

277
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,100
Is your mind back to normal?

278
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,860
Wench!

279
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,770
How dare a mere palace maid to ask about a court lady's state of mind?

280
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,950
I apologize.

281
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,350
Massage my legs.

282
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,930
- Pardon?
- What are you doing?

283
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,220
Do I have to give you lashings in order for you to come to your senses?!

284
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,250
I understand.

285
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,410
Are you from Goryeo?

286
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,300
Yes.

287
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,520
All the stubborn useless ones are from Goryeo.

288
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,010
Don't frown. I'm also from Goryeo.

289
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,700
You are?

290
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,030
Don't you try to get out of it. Hurry up and massage my legs.

291
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,350
Y-Yes.

292
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,490
You seem very close to Prime Minister El Temür.

293
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,230
Are you trying to line up behind him?

294
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,430
Can I not line up behind him?

295
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,800
I asked you a question first.

296
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,350
I came here after being dethroned.

297
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,990
Anything that can help me,

298
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,420
I will try to hold onto, even if it's grabbing at straws.

299
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:30,560
If you ever attain the power to restore my throne,

300
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:35,130
I will take your hand at any time.

301
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,320
See that?

302
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,620
Wang Yoo is standing with Prime Minister El Temür.

303
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,460
What will you do? I'm asking you about what you will do.

304
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,520
It's a fight where no one can know who will win.

305
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,570
Therefore, I will help you.

306
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,920
What does that mean?

307
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,520
If Prime Minister El Temür will retreat due to my helping you,

308
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,630
please restore His Majesty to his throne.

309
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:22,520
So, you're going to be... on both sides?

310
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,850
You're quite something. You are amazing.

311
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,360
If you don't like it,

312
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,160
I won't blame you if you got rid of me right now.

313
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:39,020
Do you not care at all about how hurt I am by this?

314
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,950
I apologize, Your Imperial Majesty.

315
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,530
You're terrible.

316
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,800
Have you found out the whereabouts of the bloodletter?

317
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,330
Apologies, Your Majesty.

318
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,080
Apologies?

319
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,850
I'm about to go crazy because of that word these days!

320
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,530
Apologies.

321
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,620
You're all so frustrating.

322
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,820
I heard there was a eunuch guard who protected the late Emperor Mingzong until the very end.

323
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,120
Who is that man?

324
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,350
His name is Jeok Ho from Goryeo.

325
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,260
Jeok Ho.

326
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:25,960
But there's no way to find him since we don't know whether he's even alive or not.

327
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,440
I understand. You may leave.

328
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,970
Do you know a eunuch named Jeok Ho?

329
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,440
When I first came to the palace,

330
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,490
I only heard about him through rumors.

331
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,540
I heard he was very skilled with a spear and amazingly loyal.

332
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,160
Can you find Jeok Ho?

333
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,300
I'll send out a trustworthy person and try to find him.

334
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:27,430
I haven't seen any rats in this village in the past couple of days.

335
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,050
Isn't it odd? They all disappeared overnight.

336
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:39,850
I heard that there have been a lot of rats in the palace recently.

337
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,910
Maybe they all moved there.

338
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,070
If you were a rat, wouldn't you?

339
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,130
The palace must be a much better place to live than here.

340
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,690
Even if I was a rat, I wouldn't live here.

341
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,860
Then, why as a human being do you insist on living here?

342
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,130
Pardon?

343
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,180
That's because this Goreyo Village is like my homeland.

344
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,900
May I ask you a question?

345
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,960
Who is the chief here?

346
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,910
Me. What is it about?

347
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,920
Do you know if there's someone named Jeok Ho in this village?

348
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,950
Jeok Ho?

349
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,990
He used to be a eunuch guard at the palace.

350
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:27,750
Seeing that you don't have a mustache, you must be a eunuch there, too.

351
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,620
But why are you looking for Jeok Ho?

352
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,560
We can't help if we don't know why.

353
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,080
Do you know Jeok Ho?

354
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,470
I think I've heard the name somewhere a lot.

355
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,870
I see. Really?

356
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:52,020
- Move aside.
- Where is he?

357
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,960
This way.

358
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,320
Give me some more meat.

359
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,320
You're here. You may leave now.

360
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,780
I had a drink while waiting for you.

361
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,150
Tell me quickly.

362
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,070
What should I tell you first?

363
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,820
Wang Yoo's servants, Jeom Bak and Park Bul Hwa

364
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,830
came by the Goryeo Village.

365
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,520
But for some reason, all those rats at the village

366
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,740
disappeared without a trace.

367
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,800
Rats disappeared?

368
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,850
I heard that the palace is overrun with rats these days.

369
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,350
Did you see them catching and taking the rats?

370
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,490
I didn't see that.

371
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:47,830
But... isn't it suspicious?

372
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,550
Anything else?

373
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,650
Earlier today, a eunuch came by the village.

374
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,630
He was looking for someone named Jeok Ho.

375
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,560
Jeok Ho?

376
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,850
Yes.

377
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,220
There was one body missing.

378
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:13,490
The eunuch guard named Jeok Ho who was protecting Emperor Mingzong.

379
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,550
Right, I'm sure that's him.

380
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,790
He's the eunuch who's one of the emperor's guards.

381
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,070
Then the emperor is the one looking for the bloodletter?

382
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,820
That foolish emperor has that kind of guts?

383
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,660
If someone is controlling him, it's possible.

384
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,850
Are you talking about Empress Dowager?

385
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,760
No. The wolf cub.

386
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,010
Wolf cub?

387
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,150
You mean Seung Nyang?

388
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,450
There are two thorns in my eyes.

389
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,370
Seung Nyang and Wang Yoo. Until I finish them both,

390
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,150
I don't know when my bloody tears will dry up.

391
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,290
Your Majesty.

392
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,310
We've found Jeok Ho.

393
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,020
Does he know anything about the bloodletter?

394
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:28,320
We're going to meet him tonight at Hae-si (between 9:30 p.m.-11:30 p.m.) at a courtesan house called Choowolgan.

395
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,450
I'll go to meet with him myself.

396
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,210
You cannot. You never know,

397
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,640
so Eunuch Baek and I will meet up with him first.

398
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,520
I said I'd go myself.

399
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:41,260
If you are gone, it'll look suspicious.

400
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,920
Don't worry. There was a similar situation in Goryeo before.

401
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:59,630
Strange. El Temür's people should have already sent word requesting us to meet.

402
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,050
Does it mean the trap I set didn't work?

403
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,330
Your Majesty, General Tanqishi is here.

404
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,410
They finally bit.

405
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,770
What brings you here?

406
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:27,090
My father wants to see you.

407
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,810
Really? I'll be there soon.

408
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:35,090
But people are always watching,

409
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,840
so he wants to see you outside the palace.

410
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,140
Where do I need to go?

411
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:44,260
Choowolgan, a courtesan house. Come by Hae-si.

412
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,370
All right.

413
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,640
This looks great on you.

414
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,880
Just stay here and act like the emperor for one night.

415
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,730
Your Majesty.

416
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,660
It's fine. It's fine.

417
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,690
Who would come by this late in the night? Even if they do,

418
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,920
Golta will protect you well from outside.

419
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,730
Will you be all right without me?

420
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,470
Yang and Guk Su are going with me.

421
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,180
Please take some more guards with you.

422
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,790
We might be noticed if there are too many people.

423
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,200
I will go there with His Majesty.

424
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,330
Right. There's no one outside, is there?

425
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:33,000
I've told the court ladies and servants to stay away.

426
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,830
You go to Choowolgan with Father.

427
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,190
Tell him we're heading there to meet with the people who are looking for the bloodletter.

428
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,000
All right.

429
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:05,900
My parents are all right, aren't they?

430
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,980
Don't worry. Thanks to your devotion, they are fine.

431
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,020
I'm going to leave the palace and live with my parents.

432
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,650
Please don't look for me any longer.

433
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,340
Take care of his body.

434
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,360
Yes, Sir.

435
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:44,740
Oh, I feel alive.

436
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,730
It's the same sky. How could it be so different than inside the palace?

437
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:53,130
You will need to walk faster.

438
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,340
It's not that late. Why are you hurrying us along?

439
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:04,160
Shh! It's dangerous outside the palace.

440
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,470
Seriously... Fine, I got it.

441
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:12,480
Seeing you dressed up like a man reminds me of Daecheong Island.

442
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,090
I don't even want to think about that.

443
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,720
Seriously, her temper...

444
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,670
She's just like the Seung Nyang of that time.

445
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,530
Seung Nyang, wait for me!

446
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:30,520
Wait! Hey!

447
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,480
What are you doing?

448
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,490
You're Jo Cham.

449
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,560
What is that body?

450
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,620
Th-That is...

451
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,890
He was the eunuch guard of the late emperor.

452
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,090
Why did he die?

453
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,270
Th-That is...

454
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,720
How dare you!

455
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,380
I don't know anything!

456
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,990
General Tanqishi asked me to take care of the body and—

457
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,790
Tanqishi?

458
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,790
Your Majesty!

459
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,310
What's happening?

460
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,670
You must not do this.

461
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,030
Your Majesty, please wake up!

462
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,120
It's urgent. Please get up, Your Majesty.

463
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,650
You cannot wake him up.

464
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,230
What happened?

465
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,290
His Majesty isn't here right now.

466
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,760
Then, where is he?

467
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,520
What is going on that you are being this way?

468
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,730
A eunuch guard was killed by General Tanqishi.

469
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:05,120
There's no way the bloodletter would be found that easily. Uncle,

470
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,330
I'm certain something is going on.

471
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,970
Tanqishi. What is he up to?

472
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:58,090
There are no customers in the courtesan house. Something seems suspicious.

473
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:02,560
I think we need to get back to the palace.

474
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,010
My father said he would be a little late.

475
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:21,750
Here. Let's have a drink first.

476
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,480
He's not here yet.

477
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,320
Right.

478
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,730
How will you recognize Jeok Ho?

479
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,130
We have a code.

480
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:51,230
When you ask if he's hunting for tigers, he will say

481
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:55,970
he came to hunt for bears.

482
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,600
Guest?

483
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:13,600
Who is Yang?

484
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,480
I am Yang.

485
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,560
Someone named Bear Hunter told me to hand this to you.

486
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,860
Then...

487
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:36,830
I don't want my face to be known, so come to the room at the end of the hall by yourself.

488
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,990
Will you be okay?

489
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:43,390
He seems to be afraid to let his face be known.

490
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:47,730
I think I need to go.

491
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,960
Take Guk Su.

492
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,030
I can't let you be alone.

493
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,840
I'll go get the bloodletter, so please stay here.

494
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,530
Move quietly.

495
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,280
This room?

496
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,550
Yes, Father.

497
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,270
The people looking for the bloodletter are inside this room.

498
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,970
Open the door.

499
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,800
Let go of your sword!

500
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,110
Prime Minister!

501
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:24,820
What are you doing here?

502
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:31,900
The one looking for the bloodletter was you?

503
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,570
Prime Minister is much too late.

504
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:46,710
Actually, the enemy who wrote those mysterious documents is going to come.

505
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,910
What are you talking about?

506
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,740
I think the bastard has finally come.

507
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,200
Who are you?

508
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,900
Is the tiger hunter here?

509
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:24,940
We are bear hunters.

510
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,780
What are you doing here?

511
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,450
Your Majesty!

512
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,060
Get out here!

513
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:17,060
It seems like I caught the tiger and the bear today.

514
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,460
Your Majesty!

515
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,420
Tell me.

516
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,400
I asked if you came to find the bloodletter.

517
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,880
Is that so wrong?

518
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,400
As he died, he wrote it in blood!

519
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,770
His son is looking for his father's dying wishes! What's wrong with that?

520
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,060
Then...

521
00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:00,680
those mysterious documents were also your doing?

522
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,830
That wasn't me.

523
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,090
It wasn't?

524
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:08,800
I only looked for the bloodletter.

525
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,890
Who else is here?

526
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:16,010
Only our people are here. I will go take a look.

527
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,790
Prime Minister.

528
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:38,360
Prime Minister El Temür is here with his armed soldiers.

529
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,510
Then His Majesty?

530
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:43,720
I think the situation is serious.

531
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,720
That's Empress Dowager!

532
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,750
Hurry up and make a decision, Uncle.

533
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:08,680
Do we stop them and stand with El Temür or do we kill him with them?

534
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:19,830
I don't give more than one warning.

535
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:23,960
But since you're the emperor, I gave you two warnings.

536
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,600
Since you ignored them,

537
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,460
now you need to pay!

538
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,580
Please save me, Prime Minister.

539
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:39,270
There will be a lot of people happy to see you when you die.

540
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,550
Father!

541
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:52,450
Empress Dowager is here.

542
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:57,560
What? Empress Dowager?

543
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:17,180
Tell Prime Minister that I'm here!

544
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,050
What brings you here at this hour?

545
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,860
Your Majesty!

546
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,900
Your Highness.

547
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:52,060
He came here looking for the bloodletter.

548
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:58,300
I told him never to do that again, so take him back with you.

549
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,240
I was careless.

550
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:08,260
I was blinded by the bloodletter that doesn't even exist.

551
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,520
Escort His Majesty.

552
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,420
Your Majesty!

553
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:17,080
I don't see Yang. I need to take her with me, too!

554
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,050
Hurry up and leave, Your Majesty!

555
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,320
What are you doing?

556
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,720
- Your Majesty.
- Let me go.

557
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,420
- Your Majesty.
- Yang! Yang! Where are you?

558
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:30,110
- Your Majesty.
- Yang! Yang!

559
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,050
Your Majesty!

560
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,550
Why are you here?

561
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:52,920
We saw Empress Dowager leaving and was trying to stop her.

562
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,830
But where's your brother?

563
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,600
What did you say?

564
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,130
I said you were the culprit who put up all the mysterious notices.

565
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,960
And this wench controlled the emperor by your orders. Am I wrong?

566
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,520
He has nothing to do with this!

567
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,590
Shut up!

568
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,920
Do you have proof?

569
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,760
Proof?

570
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:18,310
Of course, and I can make up plenty if I torture this wench.

571
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:21,690
If you lay a finger on Seung Nyang,

572
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:25,270
I will never forgive you.

573
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,870
Right.

574
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,780
Your feelings of heartbreak are

575
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:38,050
very good prey for me.

576
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,770
What are you doing here?

577
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:58,390
Father, I caught the culprits who wrote the mysterious notices.

578
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:03,040
I was sincere in giving you advice, Prime Minister.

579
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,330
I thought you were a great man who could move Heaven and Earth. Yet you were merely this small a man!

580
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:14,800
Why are you so certain Wang Yoo is the culprit?

581
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:20,920
After his men went to the Goryeo Village, I heard all the rats disappeared.

582
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,890
And so?

583
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,220
What... do you mean, "so"?

584
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:33,710
Rats are rodents that can show up and disappear at any time. Any other proof?

585
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:37,430
This wench has been helping Wang Yoo since the time in Goryeo and—

586
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:46,250
Fool, I told you to stop being jealous!

587
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,150
Please forgive my son's mistake.

588
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,890
Fathe--

589
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:59,600
Shut that mouth and get lost.

590
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,700
Leave Seung Nyang.

591
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,530
Father, this wench helped the emperor.

592
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,340
Take her away.

593
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:40,810
I will make a formal proposal. Can you help me?

594
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:45,350
Will you be my person?

595
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:56,160
Have you thought about it?

596
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,590
Please let go of Court Lady Yang.

597
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,610
That was not my proposal to you.

598
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:08,620
If you let her go, I will do whatever you ask.

599
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:14,020
Becoming my person is worth merely that girl's life?

600
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:18,190
She saved my life in Goryeo.

601
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:21,370
If you think so little of your subordinates' lives,

602
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:24,330
how can I put my life on the line for you?

603
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:27,260
That girl was an informant for the emperor.

604
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:32,890
Then go torture the emperor!

605
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:37,450
It was something she had to do as a court lady.

606
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:41,850
I like things that I can see,

607
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,310
instead of things like swearing your allegiance.

608
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,020
Fine, what will you do in the place of

609
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:50,660
letting that girl live?

610
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:56,360
I am well aware of your worries.

611
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,240
Tell me.

612
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,290
The people who wrote the mysterious notices are

613
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:05,000
definitely among your close associates.

614
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,490
You have a lot of followers, but you can't discriminate the gems from the pebbles,

615
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:13,690
so it must be very frustrating.

616
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:19,800
Then... do you have a way to figure out the good and bad among them?

617
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,660
Let go of Yang first,

618
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:27,870
then I'll tell you the secret plan.

619
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,020
What happened to Yang? Have you found her?

620
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,250
She's locked up in the dungeon jail.

621
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:12,790
Stop!

622
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,720
Everyone out!

623
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,790
If I can't have you,

624
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:44,130
I will make it so that no one else can either.

625
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,290
Even though I can't have your heart,

626
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,360
I will have your life.

627
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:13,790
This isn't a place for you to be! Get out!

628
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,110
You must have gone crazy.

629
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:28,670
I just got permission from your father that I can take Seung Nyang.

630
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:31,130
- What?
- If you want to argue about it,

631
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,940
go argue with your father!

632
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:47,540
Also... if you have the courage, tell him about this, too!

633
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:56,820
Seung Nyang.

634
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,050
Seung Nyang. Seung Nyang!

635
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,620
Let's go.

636
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:34,110
♫  Love is such a sad word to me that it's maddening  ♫

637
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:40,130
♫  Even if my heart aches some words must be endured  ♫

638
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:45,040
♫  Even if dawn breaks with tears and my heart falls apart  ♫
