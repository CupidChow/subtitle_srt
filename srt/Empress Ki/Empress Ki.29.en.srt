1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,850
Drink it.

2
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,720
My Lady! What's the matter?

3
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,500
Please come to your senses, My Lady!

4
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,510
What's going on now?

5
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,490
It's poison! Lady Ki was poisoned!

6
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,920
Hurry up and take her to the physician. Hurry!

7
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,450
Yes, Your Highness.

8
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,000
There's nothing wrong with the tonic.

9
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,200
We already checked it before.

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,010
The imperial concubines are falling one by one after drinking the tonic during the morning meeting.

11
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,230
Don't you feel someone is intentionally going after them?

12
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,060
By "someone," do you mean me?

13
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,970
You're not foolish enough to do something like this.

14
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,440
But that you are doing this out of jealousy towards them,

15
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,750
then someone may have that misunderstanding.

16
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,250
Don't worry about me.

17
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,960
I will be sure to find out myself who is doing such a thing

18
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,580
to cause disorder in the inner court.

19
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,790
Court Lady Yeon,

20
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,310
bring the investigators and the court lady inspectors.

21
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

22
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,370
Put Lord Jang in charge of this case.

23
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,480
That way, we'll be able to quieten down any baseless rumors.

24
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,730
Then... Lord Jang and Court Lady Yeon should both be in charge.

25
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,940
Bring the inspectors and investigators, and then find out how Lady Ki is doing.

26
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,710
Yes, Your Highness.

27
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,500
Hold on just a little longer.

28
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,290
Step aside!

29
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,260
Empress Dowager is trying to frame me for this matter. Her tongue has thorns.

30
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,120
But, Your Majesty, who could have poisoned her this time?

31
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,950
It must be one of the imperial concubine wenches.

32
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,210
Since the emperor only asks for that Ki wench every night.

33
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,060
Then Lady Oh being poisoned last time, too,

34
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,990
that could have been meant for the Ki wench, too.

35
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,380
Who cares who the target was?

36
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,920
It's a good thing for me anyway.

37
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,640
I have a reason to get rid of all those concubine wenches now.

38
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,970
That's true, Your Majesty.

39
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,090
Yang collapsed after being poisoned?

40
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,180
I told you to tell me everything happening around Yang!

41
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,050
It happened so suddenly.

42
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,660
So where is she right now?

43
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,650
She's with the physician.

44
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,670
Your Majesty, just wait a little longer.

45
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,780
Wait?

46
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,880
Yang could die from being poisoned.

47
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,170
Your Majesty, Head Eunuch Dok Man is here.

48
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,060
Empress Dowager told me to tell you this.

49
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,730
I gave it to her. That poison.

50
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:29,310
And the person who's going to take that poison next is me.

51
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,210
You're saying you'll willingly take the poison?

52
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,130
Yes, Your Highness.

53
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,680
If the imperial concubines collapse one by one after being poisoned,

54
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,300
the palace will turn upside down in order to find the culprit.

55
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,910
The more we try to find the culprit, the more the empress will be driven into a corner,

56
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:51,050
In the end, it will come to light that it was her doing.

57
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,900
Why are you gambling with your own life?

58
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,930
Are you daring to go after the empress's seat?!

59
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,120
When Lady Park was killed,

60
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,570
I was also there.

61
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,570
Seeing the palace maids and Lady Park die in front of my eyes...

62
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,410
Their screams asking to be spared...

63
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,130
I can still see them

64
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,350
and I hear them so clearly.

65
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,970
That's enough. I don't want to hear any more.

66
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,360
They're not human.

67
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,510
I can't tolerate those who are less than even animals

68
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,670
rising to power within the palace.

69
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,180
How do you intend on making the empress the culprit?

70
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,990
If it goes according to what she says,

71
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,090
I will be in control of the empress's future.

72
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,360
The inner court will become mine once more.

73
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,210
What's that?

74
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,520
There's a piece of date under her tongue.

75
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,490
Examine it further.

76
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,060
Yes, My Lord.

77
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:52,950
Lady Ki, I chose you, so you must not falter over that mere poison.

78
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:58,310
You must open your eyes and come back to us confidently.

79
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,250
His Imperial Majesty!

80
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,770
You have come, Your Majesty.

81
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,460
His Majesty would like all of you to leave the room.

82
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,820
Was your fight so desperate and heart-breaking

83
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,570
that you'd take poison willingly?

84
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,140
I'm sorry, Yang.

85
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,200
I wasn't able to understand all of your feelings.

86
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,980
Please... forgive this foolish emperor, Yang.

87
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,720
What's the matter?

88
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,530
It's in the date.

89
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,410
The poison is in the date!

90
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,330
Who put the date in the tonic?

91
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,580
The date was given by the herbalist.

92
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,740
Someone must have gotten to it before then.

93
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,560
This matter...

94
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,930
I will finish off.

95
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,000
Please do that. Now that we've found where the poison came from,

96
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,060
we must find the culprit.

97
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,390
Court Lady Inspectors, hear me.

98
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,130
I'm sure the culprit has more hidden away.

99
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:07,170
Not only the imperial concubines' quarters, but we're going to search the quarters of the eunuchs and the court ladies,

100
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,070
- so be aware.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

101
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,260
Wang Yoo, if this is an ill-fated relationship,

102
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,050
it's only right that it should end here.

103
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,640
Don't resent me.

104
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,520
Yeon Bisoo.

105
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,760
What's the reason you're trying to kill me?

106
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,740
You shouldn't have come here.

107
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,750
Are you working for Hawk House?

108
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,940
I was wrong about you.

109
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,300
Have you thrown away your dream to resurrect the Turks?

110
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,920
Stop if you're going to speak nonsense.

111
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,290
Your Majesty, is something the matter?

112
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,090
Come in.

113
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,620
- Your Majesty.
- Were there any other assassins outside?

114
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,650
There wasn't anyone else.

115
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,990
Who's in charge of the province right now?

116
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,530
The vice-premier is in charge while Bayan is away.

117
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,760
There's no safer place. Wake up Moo Song and Jeom Bak.

118
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,160
- We're leaving here right now.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

119
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,570
If you're thinking about keeping me as a hostage, forget it.

120
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,010
We'll both die.

121
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,050
You can't avoid death once you've been marked by Hawk House.

122
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,260
- What happened?
- Boss and Wang Yoo disappeared without a trace.

123
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,790
Captain Yeon could have been taken as hostage.

124
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:33,070
They couldn't have left Liaoyang Province yet, so go after them!

125
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,250
- Hurry up!
- Yes, Sir!

126
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,190
How long will you keep me like this?

127
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,650
Do you think I would care that you're doing this?

128
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,270
Just kill me instead. Hurry up and do it!

129
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,050
Hurry up and kill me!

130
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,920
Hurr--

131
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,150
When it's time, I'll kill you.

132
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,220
How much did you pay for him?

133
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,280
30 nyangs of gold.

134
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,260
30 for the likes of him?

135
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,120
You have too much money!

136
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,940
Since you have 10 nyang left from what I gave you, you can keep it.

137
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,530
10 nyang? Oh, thank you.

138
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,310
Oh, here.

139
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,640
You can go now.

140
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,810
See you again!

141
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,110
Who am I?

142
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,250
Pardon?

143
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,230
Oh! What are you doing here?

144
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,690
You bought me?

145
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,540
When you see His Majesty,

146
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,030
he will ask you a lot about Seung Nyang. About the baby,

147
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,080
- you must never tell him, got it?
- Baby?

148
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,860
The baby she had was His Ma—

149
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,180
He doesn't even know she was pregnant.

150
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,760
If anyone told him, it would be best for her to do so.

151
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,240
Don't worry. I have enough sense about those things.

152
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,740
Your Majesty!

153
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,480
You're back.

154
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,010
I heard that you saved Seung Nyang. Is she okay?

155
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,600
After seeing her friends die,

156
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,620
she was in great shock.

157
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,480
I shouldn't have left her behind.

158
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,390
It's all my fault.

159
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,830
When Bayan comes back, you should be able to see her, Your Majesty.

160
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:24,420
But she's healthy, so you needn't worry.

161
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,310
Thank you for taking care of her.

162
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,930
Then, come this way.

163
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,390
Your Majesty.

164
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:47,070
But what are you going to do about that girl, Yeon Bisoo?

165
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,250
She tried to kill you. You should get rid of her.

166
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,060
If I use her well,

167
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,560
there should be a lot of information I can get on Hawk House.

168
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,610
She's very malicious. It won't be easy.

169
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,710
Lock her up in jail and don't feed her. If my method works,

170
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,630
she will definitely help us.

171
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

172
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,090
Search the room.

173
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,000
Next is Lady Ki's room.

174
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,070
What happened to that wench?

175
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,800
She's not in her room yet, so I think she's still unconscious.

176
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,770
Who cares about her room then? Let's go to the court ladies' rooms.

177
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

178
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,660
Are you awake now?

179
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,050
Why am I...

180
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,150
here?

181
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,580
I brought you over from the physician's quarters.

182
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,930
Please call for Eunuch Park.

183
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,380
I will go back to my place.

184
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,090
I won't disappoint you anymore.

185
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,510
I will put everything on the line

186
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,500
for your sake.

187
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,980
I realized that if you die,

188
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,820
I can't live either.

189
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,750
I don't care if I'm not in your heart.

190
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,430
And I won't resent you,

191
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,760
even if you use me for your revenge.

192
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,350
So please stay by my side.

193
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,670
That's enough for me.

194
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:03,030
♫ Love is such a sad word to me that it's maddening ♫

195
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:09,100
♫ Even if my heart aches some words must be endured ♫

196
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,580
♫ Even if dawn breaks with tears  ♫

197
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,920
♫ And my heart falls ♫

198
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:28,060
♫ I love you are the words I can't say ♫

199
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,170
Stop!

200
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:45,450
Who was it? Who among you put the poisoned date in the tonic?

201
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,380
We swear to the gods that we physicians didn't do such a thing.

202
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,270
You're experts at saving others' lives and yet you're useless at saving your own.

203
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,980
Please spare us, Captain Yeom.

204
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:02,880
What would I get out of killing you?

205
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,560
But the empress isn't in her right mind right now.

206
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,490
So... just give us any name.

207
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,890
Who was it? One of the concubines?

208
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:23,590
If not, Empress Dowager?

209
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,590
No. We know nothing about it!

210
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,210
Burn them!

211
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,110
She's fainted.

212
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,970
Get rid of her.

213
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,220
Tell me the truth. The imperial concubines

214
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,730
told you to do it, right?

215
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,360
We know nothing about the matter.

216
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,770
We are fine along with Lady Oh's servants,

217
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,260
but all the palace maids who serve any of the imperial concubines have been arrested.

218
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,960
All the physicians have been taken in as well.

219
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,800
They're trying to blame the concubines by getting a false testimony.

220
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,770
Tell General Bayan to start mobilizing the magistrates.

221
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,700
Yes, My Lady.

222
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,670
The empress is becoming more and more vicious.

223
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,620
"Falling into a trap set by oneself," they say.

224
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,700
The bigger she makes this out to be, the worse her sins will become.

225
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,630
It's Head Kheshig Guard Captain Yeom.

226
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,550
She's not here yet?

227
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,600
Thanks for coming to see me, Court Lady Yeon.

228
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,380
Why did you want to see me?

229
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,310
I can't bear not knowing about what's happening in the women's quarters.

230
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,170
Please tell me from time to time.

231
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,270
Why do you need to know?

232
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,080
What do you mean?

233
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,790
I need to know in order to figure out what I need to do.

234
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,050
Are you happy being a court lady when someone else has become an imperial concubine?

235
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,790
It's the same for me, too.

236
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:29,550
Since I've come this far, I want to get promoted to an even higher position.

237
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:33,630
So, let's help each other.

238
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,400
How about it?

239
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,660
But... how would we help each other?

240
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,910
How is it going on your side? Are they talking yet?

241
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,940
Nothing is working. How about your side?

242
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,940
They're so inflexible. All they know is how to make tonics.

243
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:59,580
I have a solution, so give me your ear.

244
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,500
Just...

245
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,300
on your lips—

246
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,740
How dare you!

247
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,930
Sorry. That's not what I intended to say!

248
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,700
I never want to see you.

249
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,740
Let's say that a court lady and a physician were working together.

250
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,240
What do you mean?

251
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,760
If they can give similar testimonies, it will be so easy to place the blame on the imperial concubines.

252
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,540
Just get one wench.

253
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,680
I will get just one physician, too.

254
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:07,420
If all the imperial concubines get kicked out of here, who will get the reward?

255
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,360
What brings you here without notice?

256
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,230
We heard that the empress made a mess of the imperial concubines' quarters

257
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,610
and has arrested the palace maids. Is that true?

258
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:45,610
You know full well that something disgraceful happened in the palace.

259
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,260
Are you saying that the imperial concubines are responsible for it?

260
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,060
That happened once before. We can't just stand by and let it happen this time.

261
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,280
Call the prime minister!

262
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,960
Things will only get bigger if you get involved.

263
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,850
At this moment, too, no one knows who will get the poison.

264
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,670
Even for the sake of ridding you of your worries, we need to find who did it as soon as possible.

265
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,860
But why the imperial concubines of all people?

266
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,330
It seems that someone has an ulterior motive.

267
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,320
Please tell them to stop suspecting the imperial concubines.

268
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,330
What if the culprit is among them?

269
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:32,180
If it's treason, it won't end with the inner court.

270
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,280
What I'm saying is that I can't promise that any of you will be safe.

271
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,940
So don't get involved in what the empress is doing.

272
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,750
Then I'll at least have a reason to protect you if the culprit is found among them.

273
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,530
For now, bringing this matter out from the inner court,

274
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,930
I think we've succeeded.

275
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,650
The empress is headed to the empress dowager's quarters with the court lady inspectors.

276
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,080
She's going to search there, too?

277
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,990
Welcome, Your Majesty.

278
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,670
Are... you feeling better?

279
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

280
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:42,620
Fighting off even poison. You really are something.

281
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,830
I heard that you're working hard to find the culprit.

282
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,230
Please find out who is responsible for this.

283
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:55,480
When I do, I will rip them to shreds.

284
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,810
So no need to worry.

285
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,650
What brings you here with the inspectors?

286
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,860
I've searched every corner of the women's quarters.

287
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,120
And?

288
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,530
Now the only place left is

289
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,980
your quarters.

290
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:31,470
In front of all these servants, you're going to search my place?

291
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,780
This is all for your benefit.

292
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:39,850
We need to be thorough in order to free you of suspicion.

293
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,890
Look here, Empress—

294
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:46,010
If you refuse, I will arrest all of your servants

295
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,350
and torture them.

296
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:52,550
You don't want that to happen, do you?

297
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,970
- Search the place.
- Yes.

298
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:23,720
You wench! Be careful. You should be more careful.

299
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,960
Since you're here, I guess they're nervous.

300
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,790
Please step out for a little while.

301
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,160
Search everywhere.

302
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,010
Thank you for your

303
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,420
cooperation, Your Highness.

304
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,170
Thank you for your effort.

305
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,310
But you haven't even found a clue.

306
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:11,330
The court ladies and the physicians are being questioned,

307
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,300
so I'm sure there will be something.

308
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,070
There's one place you haven't searched.

309
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,390
Where is that?

310
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,870
Your quarters have yet to be searched.

311
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,120
How dare you get involved like this?

312
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,410
This is all for your benefit.

313
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,400
You have to be thorough

314
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,600
in order to be free from suspicion.

315
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,480
What?

316
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,090
Lady Ki is right.

317
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,040
Why don't you carry out the search of the empress's place also?

318
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,930
I will search my own place.

319
00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:00,130
It seems that you're full of suspicion. You can watch me if you'd like.

320
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,080
Search everywhere so that there won't be any doubt of my innocence.

321
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

322
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,420
Wait.

323
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,940
Give me that.

324
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,160
These are rare and precious jewels.

325
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,770
Where did you get them?

326
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:23,980
Do I need to tell you every detail about where they came from? Such impudence.

327
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,830
Give me that.

328
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,970
Dates hidden inside the jewelry box...

329
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:58,370
Why do you look at me like that?

330
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,210
The poison that the imperial concubines were given was found inside dates.

331
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,690
So?

332
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:12,540
Please tell me why these dates were in there.

333
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,190
How would I know that?

334
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,040
Then...

335
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,920
would you try one?

336
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,530
Why are you so surprised?

337
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,210
Did you put poison in them?

338
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:44,420
What are you talking about? They're just dates.

339
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,600
So try one.

340
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,840
You wench, how dare you?

341
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,590
It's very sweet and tasty.

342
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,220
See that? It's very sweet and tasty.

343
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:12,600
The people who sent this jewelry box seem to have put the dates inside for the sake of Her Majesty's health.

344
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,320
What impudence.

345
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,350
How dare you treat me... with suspicion and disdai—

346
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,150
Your Majesty...

347
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,110
Court Lady Seo!

348
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,960
Court Lady Seo!

349
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,780
Your Majesty...

350
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:48,050
Using Heuksoo of Hawk House's name

351
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,630
can you get this gifted to the empress?

352
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,630
They're poisoned dates.

353
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:10,870
Heuksoo, the one who sent this has a very close relationship with Father.

354
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,880
Eunuch Park, send these dates to the examiners.

355
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,580
Yes, My Lady.

356
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,350
Your Majesty!

357
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,040
It's not me. It's not me!

358
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,020
There's no need to justify yourself to me.

359
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,590
Your Majesty...

360
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,240
I invited you all here to brighten up your moods,

361
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,600
so please drink freely!

362
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,230
Here. Let's raise our glasses.

363
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,930
Prime Minister!

364
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,650
I have something I need to say in private to the prime minister.

365
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,180
Is it something we can't hear?

366
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,780
It's not that, but...

367
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,290
It's fine, so say it here.

368
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:41,190
Just now... the culprit was caught.

369
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,800
Who was it?

370
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,900
Hurry up and tell me. Who did it?

371
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,540
It was the empress.

372
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,210
Tell me in detail. How did this happen?

373
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:17,620
The jewelry box from Heuksoo had the poisoned dates inside.

374
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:26,490
Hurry up and arrest Heuksoo.

375
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,720
I need to see what happens here, so go to Liaoyang alone.

376
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,030
All right, Uncle.

377
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,930
Heuksoo is not easy to deal with. Be very careful.

378
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,530
Do not worry.

379
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:46,780
And... I couldn't get to them earlier because of El Temur,

380
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,390
but dismantle their group this time once and for all.

381
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:54,020
Confiscate all of their funds is what I'm saying.

382
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,090
Yes, Uncle.

383
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:29,590
Someone used counterfeit banknotes to buy ginseng from Goryeo.

384
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:33,490
Seeing the alleged criminal's drawn face, pale skin, large eyes,

385
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:38,530
high nose, and thin lips. Did you do it, Yeon Bisoo?

386
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,030
How stupid you are. Finally, figured it out?

387
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,290
Hawk House is providing secret funds to El Temür.

388
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,330
Why are you helping El Temür after he exterminated your people?

389
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,210
I don't care who it helps.

390
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:58,440
I just need money to resurrect my people.

391
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,490
My plan is to take a large amount of money from Hawk House, all at once.

392
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,900
You should dream of such foolish dreams while you sleep.

393
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,400
Someone saved me at Suryeong Road by setting off explosives.

394
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,090
Seeing your expression, that was you.

395
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,620
I shouldn't have saved you then.

396
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,610
Your Majesty?

397
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,820
Toqto'a has returned.

398
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,540
Wang Yoo is here?

399
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,000
Yes. But I heard something strange.

400
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,520
Something strange?

401
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,450
That Lady Ki had promised to marry Wang Yoo.

402
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,780
Is that true?

403
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,920
I heard his men speaking about it clearly.

404
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,570
You must never tell anyone about that.

405
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,240
Yes.

406
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,360
It's been a long time.

407
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,780
Where is Seung Nyang right now?

408
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,290
She's in Daedo.

409
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,490
What is she doing in Daedo?

410
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:29,790
There is something more urgent I must do.

411
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:33,570
Let's talk about everything after I finish this task.

412
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,010
Is she well?

413
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:39,250
She is very well.

414
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,950
But what is this urgent thing you need to do?

415
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:51,730
I need to capture Heuksoo tonight and take him to Yeongyeong.

416
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:55,920
I will help you with that.

417
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,440
Heuksoo has some debts that he needs to repay me.

418
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,710
Thank you for your invitation.

419
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,790
But where is Officer?

420
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,700
He is not here right now.

421
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:34,620
This was not an invitation from the Officer?

422
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,500
What do you think you are doing?

423
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,260
I received a command to capture you.

424
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:57,930
Do you not know that Prime Minister El Temür is behind me?

425
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:04,190
The command to capture you was from Prime Minister El Temür.

426
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,360
What?

427
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,900
I'm sure there are counterfeit notes. Search their storage rooms.

428
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,100
I'll go.

429
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,510
- Jeom Bak, you follow him.
- Got it.

430
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,330
Let's go.

431
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,540
Search thoroughly.

432
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,570
- Yes.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

433
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,680
Your Majesty.

434
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,700
What are these strange symbols?

435
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,500
I've never seen such pictures before.

436
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,130
They are not pictures. I think they are a code.

437
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:04,260
If it's a document written in code, it's obviously very important.

438
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:10,800
If we can crack this code, it will be a big help for gaining control over Hawk House.

439
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,520
- Take good care of this.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

440
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,820
Move!

441
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,620
This scoundrel!

442
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,640
I've really waited for this since I was a slave.

443
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,770
Go! Go!

444
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,880
The hidden counterfeit banknotes are endless.

445
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,500
Now all that is left is for you to meet Seung Nyang.

446
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,210
It seems they're being summoned to the main palace.

447
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:15,900
But Your Highness, I'm curious. How did you put the poisoned date in the tonic?

448
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,070
She didn't put the poison in the dates. She put the poison on her skin.

449
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,690
Huh?

450
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:52,770
Please take care of it so no one can see it.

451
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:57,790
But even the smallest mistake can put your life in danger.

452
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,470
If I don't stake my life on this,

453
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,490
I cannot win against such formidable foes.

454
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,400
Her Imperial Majesty the Empress enters!

455
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,500
Your Majesty, not only did the empress try to poison the imperial concubines,

456
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,380
she tried to frame the imperial concubines for her own crimes.

457
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,690
This is an act of oppression against us magistrates.

458
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:17,260
Your Majesty, this evil act by the empress cannot be tolerated.

459
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:21,660
Not only we magistrates but all the civil and military officials

460
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:25,410
are all extremely furious.

461
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:35,950
Your Majesty, I dare request that you command the empress to be dethroned.

462
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:41,590
- Ple- Please honor our request, Your Imperial Majesty!
- Please honor our request, Your Imperial Majesty!

463
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:45,360
Please honor our request, Your Imperial Majesty!

464
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,050
Please honor our request, Your Imperial Majesty!

465
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,810
Please honor our request, Your Imperial Majesty!

466
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:56,820
Please honor our request, Your Imperial Majesty!

467
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:00,940
Please honor our request, Your Imperial Majesty!

468
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,940
Father, how can you just watch this and do nothing?

469
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,780
Even after thinking this over 100 times, Danashiri was reckless.

470
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:18,190
She fell into a trap and you know that too, Father.

471
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,990
And that is why I am furious!

472
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:25,680
She didn't even do this and she allowed herself to be trapped. How foolish can she be?

473
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,200
I think the most urgent thing is to rescue her.

474
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,880
If she is dethroned, it is a fatal wound to our family's honor.

475
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,810
We do not have time, Father.

476
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:44,680
Have the Imperial Guards on standby.

477
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,260
Do you intend to shed blood?

478
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,390
What kind of predicament is this?

479
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:57,080
How many times do I have to say it? I know nothing about this.

480
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,290
This is not the place for you to shout, Empress.

481
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:05,740
Since I did not commit any crimes, I shouldn't have to behave like a criminal.

482
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,970
I cannot stand to hear any more of this.

483
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:13,030
Your Majesty, please command for the empress to be dethroned.

484
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:17,300
- Please command for her dethronement, Your Majesty!
- Please command for her dethronement, Your Majesty!

485
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,030
Are you all finished already?

486
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,760
Just what are you trying to do?

487
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,480
Discussing her dethronement? Yes.

488
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,380
If she really did this, she is worthy of being dethroned 100 times.

489
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,540
But! I believe that she did not do this.

490
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,940
Clear evidence has been found.

491
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,110
Prime Minister, you should not be unreasonable.

492
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:32,200
Prime Minister, you are ignoring the law and society's principles.

493
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:44,890
If we observed all law and principles, do you really think this Imperial Palace would have been preserved until now?

494
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,050
But Prime Minister!

495
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:52,390
There were many moments of crisis. What overcame all those crises was not law and principles,

496
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:55,540
but my faith and conviction.

497
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:08,640
If the empress's innocence is discovered in the future

498
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,140
what do you think will happen to those who voted for her dethronement?

499
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:20,950
Then how would you like to take care of this matter, Prime Minister?

500
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,350
If the empress is sent to the Cold Palace, wouldn't that satisfy you?

501
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,720
Father? The Cold Palace?

502
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,210
That cannot happen, Father.

503
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:47,470
Dethronement or Cold Palace? Please choose one, Empress Dowager.

504
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:58,730
In exchange, all the imperial seals of authority that the empress has, I will take possession of them.

505
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:06,430
Give up the seals and go to the Cold Palace or be dethroned.

506
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:16,260
Please make a choice between those two, Prime Minister.

507
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:42,660
Please tell me now where Seung Nyang is.

508
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,130
Why did Seung Nyang go to Daedo?

509
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,520
She is in the Imperial Palace.

510
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,830
Imperial Palace?

511
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:56,370
She didn't become a palace maid again, I'm sure.

512
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:01,890
She is not a palace maid, she is an Imperial Concubine of the 5th rank.

513
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,890
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

514
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:09,790
She became the emperor's concubine, I am saying.

515
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:17,400
What did you do... to Seung Nyang?

516
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,400
Did you sell her off to the emperor?

517
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,760
- If not—
- Her Highness

518
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,660
did it herself.

519
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:36,360
She begged and pleaded for us to submit her to the concubine selection.

520
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,490
That cannot be true.

521
00:54:55,890 --> 00:55:00,520
All of you must be careful not to speak about this.

522
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:09,730
What kind of disaster is this?

523
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:13,180
That cannot be true. Seung Nyang...

524
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,310
Your Majesty.

525
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,840
I heard you're going to the Cold Palace.

526
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,640
Are you making fun of me now?

527
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,630
I heard it is very cold and lonely there.

528
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:58,990
You wench, how dare you?

529
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:13,380
There are people who are laid down where it's even colder and more lonely than the Cold Palace.

530
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:21,620
Lady Park and the palace maids, the people you've killed, Empress.

531
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:30,630
They are buried in a stone grave deep in the mountains.

532
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:35,700
So it was you, you wench?

533
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:40,630
You planned all of this.

534
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,310
That cannot be true.

535
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:03,960
Seung Nyang would never do that.

536
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:09,080
She said she will take revenge on El Temür and his family.

537
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,730
Is that enough of an answer?

538
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:24,270
She is no longer your subordinate nor your lover.

539
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:29,100
If anyone makes her suffer,

540
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:34,370
I will not forgive that person.

541
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,930
But why? Why did you make that choice?

542
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,630
Seung Nyang? Why?

543
00:57:55,130 --> 00:58:01,320
♫ Carried on the wind, you are heard ♫

544
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:09,200
♫ Ceaselessly falling Drip Drip Drip ♫

545
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:16,170
♫ In the sound of the rain for a long time after ♫
