1
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,030
Your Highness.

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,230
Your Highness!

3
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,150
Your Highness! Your Highness!

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,730
Your Highness! Your Highness!

5
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,840
Your Highness!

6
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,050
Your Highness!

7
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,630
Seung Nyang!

8
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,530
Seung Nyang!

9
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,800
Please save me, Seung Nyang.

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,690
My blood is rushing to my head and I think my face might explode.

11
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:23,570
Please wait. Brutal mountain bandits will come to rescue you.

12
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,920
Seung Nyang! I'm sorry, I was wrong!

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,120
I promise to never run away again.

14
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,560
Please save me. Please save me.

15
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,270
How can you cut the rope so cruelly?

16
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,500
I won't go anywhere. Please untie these ropes.

17
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,570
Are you deaf?

18
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,490
Or do you not trust me?

19
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,340
If we go to Gaegyeong like this, we will both die. Do you trust those words, at least?

20
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,540
No, I cannot.

21
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,410
You frustrating fool. Tanqishi is already waiting for us in Gaegyeong, ready to devour us.

22
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,870
- Isn't it obvious, even without looking?
- The King of Goryeo will protect us.

23
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,150
He already failed to protect me. Didn't you see what happened on Daecheong Island?

24
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,680
The only person I trust is him.

25
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:51,580
- You idiot moron.
- The ones who tried to kill you are not Goryeo soldiers,

26
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:58,160
but Yuan soldiers. When you reveal that, everything will be solved.

27
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,500
I'm hurt. I can't go any further. We haven't eaten or rested properly.

28
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,790
How can I find the strength to continue walking?

29
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,670
Do you know what the weakest animal in these mountains is?

30
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,210
What nonsense are you saying now?

31
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,130
It's you, Your Highness. I have these arrows, at least,

32
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,440
but you don't have the strength or courage to protect your own body.

33
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,730
Yes, you're so great. How nice for you.

34
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,170
So stay here like this.

35
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:41,030
When the sun goes down soon, hungry animals will all gather here.

36
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,730
You call that a threat? What animals are you talking about...

37
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,030
Where were you, not coming sooner? Let's hurry and go.

38
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,310
Before the animals gather.

39
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,240
That is Seung Nyang's face.

40
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:15,170
Wow, you are very skilled.

41
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,690
You've really captured his face.

42
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,960
Your Highness, I, Yeom Byeong Soo is here. May I enter?

43
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,610
Stop. He is in the middle of an important meeting. Come back later.

44
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,430
This is more urgent. I'm going in.

45
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,770
This guy, really.

46
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,170
- How dare you?
- Your Highness.

47
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,750
Please look at this. The portrait of the man who is with the prince.

48
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,490
Wait! Who's this?

49
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,800
- His name is Seung Nyang.
- Seung Nyang?!

50
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,070
Yes.

51
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,490
Post this boy's picture everywhere from Inju to Gaegyeong and put a bounty on his head.

52
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,410
Order the law enforcement and the military to block every road from Inju to Gaegyeong, especially the mountain paths;

53
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,300
they must all be blocked. Do you understand?

54
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,320
I understand!

55
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,900
I will look for them in the mountains. Please lend me some hunting dogs.

56
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,100
How did you hurt your hand?

57
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,650
Ki Ja Oh, he attacked me like a crazy person.

58
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,210
Tie him down with chains so he cannot rampage again.

59
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,990
I understand.

60
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,960
They cannot have gotten far. Search everywhere.

61
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,930
Yes!

62
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,290
It seems the dogs have caught a scent.

63
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,520
Let's go.

64
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,130
The way things are going, it seems they will be caught soon.

65
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:17,560
- It's raining.
- Seeing how the heavens are helping him, it seems it's not His Highness's time to die yet.

66
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,660
The dogs have lost the scent.

67
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,360
Why must it rain now, of all times?

68
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,140
Come on, let's find a shelter from the rain.

69
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:48,210
What if we catch a cold? We will die before we reach Gaegyeong.

70
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,180
You won't get sick just because you got rained on.

71
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,720
- Look at this. I've already caught a cold.
- You won't die.

72
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,930
Oh, really. Let's rest just a little bit.

73
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,380
How can you only think about yourself?

74
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:11,210
Those who were protecting your life are about to be executed.

75
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,610
Well, that doesn't mean you have to yell at me.

76
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,990
We don't have time to rest. Please follow me.

77
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,980
You've got quite the temper.

78
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,860
Father, please endure it for just a little longer.

79
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,740
You really must not die, Father!

80
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,360
Whoa!

81
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,390
Since it's raining, let's rest for now.

82
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,580
Let's do that and find a place to rest.

83
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,500
Once we pass this road, there is a courtesan house.

84
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,720
Your Majesty, King Simyang is on the way.

85
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,130
Don't let him see us.

86
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,940
This is His Highness King Simyang. Get off your horses and make way.

87
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,590
That is Ki Ja Oh.

88
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,550
It's certain that harm has come to the prince, as you said, Jeom Bak.

89
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,470
We will change directions and follow King Simyang.

90
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,270
Yes, Your Majesty!

91
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,830
Have a drink, General Yeom.

92
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,670
Your Highness, you called him General?

93
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,220
I am only a "jin-moo" (rank) in law enforcement.

94
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,070
For your great deeds in this matter, I plan to promote you to general.

95
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,090
I am deeply honored, Your Majesty.

96
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,840
'Your Majesty?'

97
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,780
It appears that you even know how to make my wine taste sweeter.

98
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,380
What is that?

99
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,390
We are a drinking establishment. What else would it be?

100
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,090
Everyone, have a drink.

101
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,080
Everyone, come and have a drink.

102
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,890
Wow, that drug is really powerful.

103
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,940
There is no key.

104
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,430
What?

105
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,580
If anyone comes, I'll make a cuckoo bird sound.

106
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,900
So go look inside.

107
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,230
Commander.

108
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,700
Sir.

109
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,120
We don't have time.

110
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,240
Please listen to me first.

111
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,420
Is that the truth?

112
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,570
Yes. Please tell His Majesty soon.

113
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,530
You must find Seung Nyang and the prince before Tanqishi does.

114
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,840
Hoenggye Mountain, you said?

115
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,050
It's the roughest road to Gaegyeong.

116
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,190
I'm certain that is where they are.

117
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,600
- What is that?
- My lookout's signal.

118
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,990
Please hurry and go.

119
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,230
Don't worry about me, and hurry and save Seung Nyang.

120
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,350
I'm sorry, endure for just a little longer.

121
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,600
Sir!

122
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,710
We don't have time. I swear...

123
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,040
How can... ?

124
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,740
How can their sense of discipline be so lax?

125
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,970
This will never happen again under my command.

126
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,650
Follow me.

127
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,670
Yeom Byeong Soo.

128
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,720
Yes, Your Highness.

129
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,550
You poke his eyes out, pull his tongue out, and puncture his ears and make him into a living corpse.

130
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,780
Make him so that he can no longer see, speak, or hear.

131
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,270
But the prince hasn't been caught yet.

132
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,380
Tanqishi will capture him.

133
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,330
I no longer need this guy.

134
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:10,610
Wouldn't it be better to just kill him, in that case?

135
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,790
He must stay alive.

136
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:20,240
Shouldn't the king see for himself who killed the Prince of Yuan?

137
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,300
It is my eternal regret to have kept you by my side.

138
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,430
Don't resent me.

139
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,220
You are the one who is responsible for all this.

140
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,860
Aren't you ashamed as an officer of Goryeo?

141
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,040
How can you betray your nation?

142
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,260
Nation? Betrayal, you said?

143
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,970
The year that I was born, my father died while fighting Yuan soldiers.

144
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,270
Do you know how my mother died?

145
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,140
To try to feed her small children,

146
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,460
she stole a bag of rice and was beaten to death.

147
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,740
Of four siblings, one of them starved to death.

148
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,060
Another froze to death.

149
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,100
And my older sister committed suicide while being dragged away as a tribute.

150
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,030
And that is...

151
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,520
what happens when this nation makes its men die fighting Yuan, leaving behind mouths to feed.

152
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,690
But you speak of betrayal?

153
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,650
I didn't betray my nation!

154
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:46,910
This nation, Goryeo, has betrayed me, do you understand?

155
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,810
Yuan caused Goryeo to become this way.

156
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,920
Do you really not know where to aim your sword?

157
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,670
Then,

158
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,460
you can die and become an eternal loyal subject of the king.

159
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:21,370
I, Yeom Byeong Soo, if only to soothe the bitter deaths my family has suffered,

160
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,170
I will live in a grand style.

161
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:41,330
Your side will never achieve what you want. Never.

162
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,130
I think you can walk now.

163
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,450
Let's live here while hiding.

164
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,430
We are so deep in the mountains, I'm sure no one will ever find us.

165
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,140
After just one year... no, half a year, I will become the emperor.

166
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,690
And if you want, I will give you a palace as large as Goryeo itself.

167
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,260
If that isn't enough, I will give you the highest political position in Yuan.

168
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,880
Can the King of Goryeo give you more abundance than I can?

169
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,080
Looks like you're finally tempted.

170
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,390
Well, no one would refuse riches.

171
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,630
What are you doing?

172
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,650
Do you think you can do this and still live?

173
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,070
Talking too much will sap your strength.

174
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,920
Hey, you.

175
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,650
I will not forget this indignity. Hey.

176
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,680
Look thoroughly. I'm sure they have left their traces behind.

177
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,650
They are going to Gaegyeong.

178
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,070
How many days has it been? Rather than suffer more, maybe we should give up?

179
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:23,220
Shut that mouth. I, Tanqishi, do not know how to give up.

180
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,910
Tenacious guy.

181
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,770
It's an "aegi-sal" (baby) arrow.

182
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,130
Seung Nyang, you must endure.

183
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,450
I will make sure to save you soon.

184
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,160
Please wait just a little longer.

185
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,600
Seung Nyang?

186
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,620
If you're going to ask me to hide and live here, you can stop.

187
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,330
It's cold. Start a fire.

188
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,830
They can find us.

189
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,060
What did the King of Goryeo do that his men stake their lives?

190
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,680
What did he do that even when I offer riches, you can refuse it?

191
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,040
The law enforcement officers and soldiers died for the King of Goryeo, not for me.

192
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,550
Until now, I've never seen anyone stake their lives for me.

193
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,600
What is different about me and the King of Goryeo, anyway?

194
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,480
You should sleep now. We have to leave before the sun rises.

195
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh, you are tough.

196
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,090
I won't run away, if only because I'm sick of you.

197
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,900
Why don't I have a subordinate like him?

198
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,920
Look closely, Prime Minister El Temür.

199
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,890
You are wrong.

200
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,650
I will become a great emperor.

201
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:43,050
I'll become an emperor and take revenge on you first!

202
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,230
Revenge...

203
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,740
We found traces of the crown prince!

204
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,190
There's evidence that they slept here.

205
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,080
Move aside.

206
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,000
Seung Nyang is definitely hurt.

207
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,670
And the crown prince should be completely weak by now.

208
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:49,460
But Seung Nyang's strides are that of a woman.

209
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,540
And his feet are small, too.

210
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,730
Seeing how the blood has hardened, they can't be far.

211
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,810
Let the dogs loose!

212
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,790
Even though you may have less, Tanqishi can't hold a candle to your skills.

213
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,730
That's the reason he hates me.

214
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,250
He must be jealous of my skills.

215
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:19,060
It'll be dangerous to get involved in trying to save the crown prince.

216
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,820
I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

217
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,050
Is it a mushroom again? Take it away.

218
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,190
I'm sick of mushrooms now.

219
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,550
Why don't you catch a rabbit instead?

220
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,670
I want to eat meat so that—

221
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,400
What's the matter? Is there something you can hunt?

222
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,100
- It's them.
- Have they followed us this far?

223
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,880
Run.

224
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,020
You must never stay far from me.

225
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,820
We're close.

226
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,670
Everyone spread apart and catch them!

227
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,120
Make sure to search everywhere!

228
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:41,440
Seung Nyang... I-I think we're going to die here.

229
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,510
We can't give up. We must never!

230
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,530
Then, what do you think we should do?

231
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,840
Jump over to the other side.

232
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,270
Oh... I.. I can't! If I drop to the bottom of the cliff—

233
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,470
You can do it!

234
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,870
I-I can't do it.

235
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,360
Like Prime Minister El Temür said, I can't do anything!

236
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,670
Before you even try, you're going to give up?

237
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,290
This way! They're by the cliff!

238
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:21,280
What did you do until now to become the emperor?

239
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,630
I-I...

240
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:28,890
You just wanted your younger brother to die. That's why you've come to this point.

241
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,350
If you want to live, if you want to become the emperor,

242
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,040
you must jump.

243
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,550
Crown Prince!

244
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:52,500
Crown Prince, that's dangerous.

245
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,830
Please come this way.

246
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,340
Hurry. Please, quickly come over here, Your Highness.

247
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,310
Count to three.

248
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,240
One.

249
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,070
Two.

250
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,930
Crown Prince.

251
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,550
Three.

252
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,270
Are they crazy?!

253
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,040
Seung Nyang, I don't think I can hold on!

254
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,860
Your Majesty, are you watching?

255
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,610
Crown Prince has matured that much.

256
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,650
What are you doing?! Shoot them!

257
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,230
It's over there, Your Majesty.

258
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,690
I think we're too late.

259
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,180
Get them!

260
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,990
You can't, Seung Nyang. You can't die.

261
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,170
Your Highness!

262
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,280
Reckless bastards.

263
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,350
Get down there and find their bodies!

264
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,010
Yes, Sir!

265
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,540
Do you think they're alive?

266
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,720
It'll be difficult.

267
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,370
Get down there and find their bodies.

268
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,210
Yes, Sire.

269
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,280
Let's go.

270
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,190
Stop!

271
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,100
I-It's the King of Goryeo.

272
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,260
What are you doing on Goryeo's land?!

273
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,460
Damn it.

274
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,490
Our emperor is dead!

275
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,880
Our emperor is dead!

276
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,280
Our emperor is dead!

277
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,390
Your Majesty!

278
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,020
Your Majesty!

279
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,910
Why were you in such a hurry to leave me?

280
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,920
How could you leave this way?

281
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,480
Now the crown prince is the emperor of this country.

282
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,710
Tell Prime Minister El Temür.

283
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,550
I'm told he went to Goryeo.

284
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,040
In order to bring back the crown prince.

285
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,270
He went himself?

286
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

287
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,290
Please wake up! Open your eyes!

288
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,220
Please don't die!

289
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,020
You musn't die!

290
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:11,690
Open your eyes, you idiot!

291
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,620
You're cold as ice.

292
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,850
Don't die.

293
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:18,200
Please. Please, open your eyes.

294
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:25,660
You have to live in order for me to save my father.

295
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,090
Please...

296
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,570
Please. Please open your eyes.

297
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,580
Don't die.

298
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,610
Why is my heart beating so much all of a sudden?

299
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,070
Do I have a terminal illness?

300
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,330
Exactly, what's the matter with me?

301
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,280
He's definitely a boy.

302
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:30,080
His heart is beating. Why isn't he breathing?

303
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,660
Wh-What are you doing, you rascal!

304
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,720
Your Highness!

305
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,540
I'm so relieved.

306
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,480
It's such a relief that you're alive.

307
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,780
P-Please get away from me.

308
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,900
I apologize. I was so happy that I...

309
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:09,020
But... why do you have your chest bandaged up?

310
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,660
N-N-No way! Has the injury from the arrow infected you there, too?

311
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,470
It's nothing. P-Please don't concern yourself.

312
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,090
What do you mean it's nothing?

313
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,410
See? You still feel as hot as fire.

314
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,340
It's not that far from Gaegyeong.

315
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,490
I'll go check the perimeter, so please keep resting.

316
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,060
The heart is...

317
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:48,980
I'm sure there's a problem with my heart.

318
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:54,010
I mean, i-i-it's beating like crazy.

319
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,660
Ouch.

320
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,970
Stop right there!

321
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,040
Has the king seen the crown prince?

322
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,260
Thankfully, he didn't.

323
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,410
We nearly ruined a perfect plan.

324
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,150
This is the man who assassinated the crown prince.

325
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,230
You're saying Ki Ja Ho assassinated the crown prince?

326
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,850
Tell him what happened.

327
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,720
I said, tell him!

328
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,110
It's no use.

329
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:05,010
He got hurt, so he can't see, hear, or speak.

330
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,470
What happened that day,

331
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,310
he will give the eyewitness account.

332
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,650
I'm Yeom Byeong Soo.

333
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,090
Tell him what you know.

334
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:25,430
Ki Ja Ho assassinated the crown prince

335
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,230
and ruined Daecheongdo.

336
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,050
You!

337
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,280
How dare you lie?!

338
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,110
I have not lied one bit!

339
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:39,640
I saw with my own eyes how he assassinated the crown prince!

340
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,390
Who did he say was behind it?

341
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,860
- According to Ki Jaho—
- General Talahai.

342
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,850
Have you met Ki Ja Ho before?

343
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,400
How would I know him?

344
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,940
So you have never met him?

345
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,590
- Moo Song.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

346
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:04,070
Did you tell me that Ki Jaho bit General Talahai's right hand?

347
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:09,630
Yes, Your Majesty. Ki Ja Ho told me that at the courtesan house in Inju.

348
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,380
I think I bit Talahai's hand.

349
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:25,630
That will become evidence that they're the culprits.

350
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:30,870
If Ki Ja Ho is right, there will be a bite mark.

351
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,180
Let me see your hand.

352
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,730
What are you trying to insist?!

353
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,180
Let go!

354
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,790
There's a mark right here!

355
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,870
It's a bite mark.

356
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,550
The people who killed the crown prince are all of you!

357
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,420
Your Majesty!

358
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,030
What are you doing here?

359
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,980
Please step aside.

360
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,650
We received word that Prime Minister El Temür's ship has docked.

361
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,490
Welcome, Prime Minister, Sir.

362
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,850
Welcome, Prime Minister, Sir.

363
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,440
It's been a long time.

364
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,490
You must have had a long journey.

365
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,460
It's been a while since we last saw each other.

366
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,680
I'm glad you're here.

367
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,890
My sons killed the crown prince?

368
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,960
That's right.

369
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:14,080
So, as soon as his body is found, please leave Goryeo.

370
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,670
To me, it doesn't matter who killed the crown prince.

371
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,040
That he has died is what's important.

372
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,290
On this Goryeo land.

373
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,780
If I say he died of an illness, that's what happened;

374
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,380
and if I say you killed him, you will become the sinner.

375
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,290
This is the royal palace of Goryeo.

376
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:47,140
- No matter who you are—
- Threatening me is like threatening Yuan.

377
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:51,160
Do you wish to see Goryeo filled with blood?

378
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,820
I have nothing to fear.

379
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:03,830
You and me... who do you think has more power in this palace?

380
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:12,090
Let go! Do you know who I am?!

381
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,380
Sire, what are you doing?

382
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:27,230
From this moment on, the royal guards will be disbanded.

383
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,850
Your Highness!

384
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,480
As you've ordered, Prime Minister, the royal guards were disbanded.

385
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,380
This is how I rule the large kingdom of Yuan.

386
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,490
- Escort the King of Goryeo with courtesy.
- Yes, Father.

387
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,910
Starting tonight, you must keep strict guard of this place.

388
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,630
The King of Goryeo must never step out of his bedroom.

389
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:12,570
Do not worry. Please head in for some rest.

390
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,430
Even if I think I know him, I do not.

391
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,820
Imagine the Prime Minister coming to Goryeo himself?

392
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:26,210
The emperor has passed away.

393
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,770
My thoughts should be correct.

394
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:36,480
To determine who succeeds the throne, he will need to confirm the prince's death.

395
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,540
Yes. You are correct.

396
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,250
His Majesty has really passed away.

397
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,360
The security is so tight. It's impossible to take a step outside.

398
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,910
Jeom Bak said they never found Seung Nyang or the prince's body.

399
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,600
We must leave the palace somehow and find the prince.

400
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:03,130
I will kill El Temür with my own hands.

401
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,440
Your Majesty.

402
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,930
Not just El Temür, but King Simyang, Tanqishi, Talahai.

403
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,340
I will kill everyone in here with my own hands!

404
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,560
You cannot!

405
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,760
What do you mean I cannot?

406
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,920
I said I will kill the thieves who barged into my home. Why can I not?

407
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,450
If you kill them, then this land will become a bloodbath.

408
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:34,240
The people of Goryeo will resent you!

409
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,270
Shut up!

410
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:44,820
I will kill those vicious people.

411
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,720
Your Majesty, no!

412
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:55,500
- Let go!
- Please come to your senses!

413
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,950
Please kill us first, Your Majesty.

414
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:04,320
What do you want me to do?

415
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,300
What can I do?

416
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,980
Your Majesty.

417
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,050
I resent the heavens.

418
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,760
I am so embittered

419
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,070
than I cannot breathe.

420
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,680
Your Majesty...

421
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,560
Seung Nyang!

422
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,640
Let's go quickly.

423
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,660
Why?

424
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,810
Isn't he a soldier of law enforcement?

425
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,820
That is Chief Yeom.

426
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,340
Wait.

427
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:21,720
What? Aren't those King Simyang's soldiers?

428
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,540
They are traitors.

429
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:28,120
Chief Yeom was the assassin who tried to kill you.

430
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,120
This horrible situation. The paths to the palace are all blocked.

431
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,410
What can we do now?

432
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,620
Follow me.

433
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,080
I don't think we should have come to Gaegyeong.

434
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,190
We should've just hidden in the forest.

435
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,990
But because of your persistence.

436
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:57,560
How much more...

437
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,970
Hey. Seung Nyang?

438
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,750
Why are you like this?

439
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,200
Have you been holding in your pain until now?

440
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:19,060
I will get you some medicine, so wait just a little longer.

441
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:34,490
You got hurt while protecting me.

442
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:38,770
Please do not die. Do not die.

443
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,480
A wound from a weapon?

444
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,600
For that,

445
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,830
there is no better medicine than this.

446
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,910
It is made with honeysuckle and raw mung beans.

447
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,960
I made it myself.

448
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,330
- How much is this?
- How much is that?

449
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,490
No matter how much this is,

450
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:01,630
take this. It is a very precious item.

451
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,250
Go, you crazy man! I will not sell it!

452
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,410
- You are insolent.
- Insolent?

453
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,820
How can you come without any money?

454
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,470
Go! Go you crazy guy!

455
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,870
You came again? Just go!

456
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,360
- What is this?
- Five nyangs of silver.

457
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,570
Five nyangs?

458
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:49,660
Why didn't you say so before?

459
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,000
What? These are rocks!

460
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,870
Hey! Catch him!

461
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,690
Thief!

462
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,500
Catch that thief!

463
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:14,590
Go!

464
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,970
Where is the bathroom?

465
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,060
Did I have something wrong to eat?

466
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,760
Why is my lower belly in such discomfort?

467
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,500
My poop is about to come out.

468
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,750
What is this? They are King Simyang's men.

469
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,120
What is this?

470
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,170
Isn't this Seung Nyang's pyeon-jeon arrows?

471
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,260
Catch him!

472
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,830
Get him!

473
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:50,470
Please.

474
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,380
Oh, they're gone.

475
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,580
You can't take this medicine. Anything but this.

476
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,190
Where did you get this?

477
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:15,210
Why do you have Seung Nyang's pyeon-jeon arrows?

478
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,450
Do you know Seung Nyang?

479
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,380
Are you Your Highness the Prince?

480
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,680
I'm on your side.

481
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,280
Where is Seung Nyang?

482
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,740
How is he?

483
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,880
It could have been a disaster if it were just a little late.

484
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,430
I left some herbal medicine, so mix it well with water and feed it to her, little by little.

485
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,150
Thank you.

486
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:06,910
You must never tell anyone.

487
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,230
Don't worry about that.

488
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:15,450
But how did a mere woman endure such pain?

489
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:19,170
Woman? Who are you calling a woman?

490
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:22,950
That patient lying in there, of course.

491
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:28,910
Seung Nyang was a woman?

492
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,170
You didn't know that?

493
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,830
I'm terrible.

494
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:57,130
I'm such a selfish, horrible person.

495
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,580
Seung Nyang,

496
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:15,120
I know you will say no, but you are my first subordinate.

497
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:19,000
And you are also...

498
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,120
my only friend in the world.

499
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,740
Seung Nyang? You've come to your senses?

500
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,890
What happened?

501
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:59,120
We can take our time explaining things later.

502
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,480
I'm just glad that you are alive.

503
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,250
First, drink this water.

504
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:15,100
Why did you hide that you were a woman?

505
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,620
The doctor who saved your life told only me. That you, Seung Nyang—

506
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,610
Please.

507
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:27,830
Please keep it a secret.

508
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,270
Yes, I'm sure you have your reasons.

509
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,130
What about His Majesty?

510
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:44,340
The palace and Gaegyeong are full of Yuan soldiers

511
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,610
and King Simyang's men.

512
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:53,150
We have to let His Majesty know that the prince is alive, no matter what.

513
00:53:53,150 --> 00:54:00,380
Even if I mobilized all my fellow thugs, there is no way we can enter the palace.

514
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:04,340
What can we do? What if he gets dethroned—

515
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,870
What is this awful smell?

516
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,020
Awful smell?

517
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:18,450
Well, I had a really bad belly ache earlier

518
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:24,040
and I didn't even have time to change my clothes.

519
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,130
Smell.

520
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:29,620
All right, all right! Stop talking about how bad I smell.

521
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,620
I know how we can get into the palace.

522
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:35,030
How? You have a good idea?

523
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:40,430
Yeom Byeong Soo. Use that guy.

524
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:42,830
Before that, there is something I have to do.

525
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,160
Please get in.

526
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:00,470
Seung Nyang, must we really do this?

527
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:03,030
Looks like you have really come back to life.

528
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,630
Seeing how you glare at me

529
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:07,580
all the time... All right,

530
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,620
I'm getting in.

531
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,350
Did you get some?

532
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,520
What is this?

533
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,550
The brine of rotten fish.

534
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:28,980
The smell is terrible.

535
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:34,200
This terrible smell will save your life, Your Highness.

536
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,720
Before that, I will die first from this rotten smell.

537
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,350
Please get into the coffin.

538
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,950
Seung Nyang.

539
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,340
We are fighting to win.

540
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:51,820
You must endure fear and everything else.

541
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,790
Hurry.

542
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,420
The coffin is so small.

543
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:24,790
I think you're finished.

544
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:37,800
This is worse than the smell of poop.

545
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:46,360
When you arrive at the palace, please reveal that

546
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,690
those who tried to kill you were Yuan soldiers and not Goryeo soldiers.

547
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,350
Why won't you answer me?

548
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,260
Don't make me talk.

549
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:04,270
- Miss?
- Yes?

550
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,850
I've enjoyed my meal. I'm giving you one extra.

551
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,200
Please come again.

552
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:17,810
When the king changes, this Yeom Byeong Soo's world will begin.

553
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,550
General, huh?

554
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:24,390
The Great General Yeom Byeong Soo.

555
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,900
You scared me.

556
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,550
Seung Nyang?

557
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,870
You... You... ?

558
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,290
Chief Yeom.

559
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:56,300
♫ Because I’m dangerous, my love ♫

560
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:02,170
♫ The more you love me, ultimately, the more only you may be hurt ♫
