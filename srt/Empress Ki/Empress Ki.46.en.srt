1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,220
Please save Prince Maha.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,730
Save Maha?

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,600
What does that mean?

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,320
Maha...

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,880
is Star.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,600
St-Star?

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,890
The baby that you thought died...

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,170
he is your son.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,610
That cannot be true.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,990
Star... he already...

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,130
Star is alive.

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:42,980
He is the son born between you and His Majesty.

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,980
I told you, that cannot be true!

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,210
On Maha's foot...

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,940
there are three spots shaped like stars.

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,000
I confirmed it with my own eyes, Your Highness.

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,570
Where is Prince Maha right now?

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,870
I heard that he is at a memorial service at Seoneop Temple.

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,150
In order to go to Seoneop Temple, we must hurry.

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,010
[Memorial Tablet of Empress Danashiri of the Yuan Dynasty]

21
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,940
- Who are you?
- Assassins!

22
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,290
Assassins!

23
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,980
Your Highness the Imperial Prince, you must run away. Hurry.

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,540
Where is Maha?

25
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,230
He is not here.

26
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,050
Yes.

27
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,820
This way!

28
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,840
Chase them!

29
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,110
How dare you try to kill the imperial prince?

30
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,360
Your Highness the Imperial Prince!

31
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,940
This ring...?

32
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,900
Prince Maha, come to me. Hurry.

33
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,540
We were sent by General Tanqishi. Hurry.

34
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,150
Hurry, come this way, Your Highness.

35
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:36,060
Don't be deceived by them. They are trying to kill you. Come to me.

36
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,920
Chief Imperial Consort is the one trying to kill you!

37
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,340
Prince Maha!

38
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,360
Your mother...

39
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,070
did you forget who killed her?

40
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,470
Maha...

41
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,790
Maha?

42
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,160
Hurry! Hurry, this way.

43
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,340
Maha.

44
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,170
Good. Yes, Your Highness.

45
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,340
That's the wrong way!

46
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,620
Your Highness the Imperial Prince! They are the assassins.

47
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,860
Hurry and go to Chief Imperial Consort. Hurry!

48
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,670
- Your Highness.
- Maha!

49
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,820
Come to me. Hurry.

50
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,420
That's right, hurry.

51
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,040
Hurry.

52
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,440
Your Highness!

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,750
Maha!

54
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,600
Run away!

55
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,360
Maha...

56
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,150
Look at me clearly, Maha!

57
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,140
Your Highness... the Chief Imperial Consort...

58
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,670
It's all right. You're in my arms now,

59
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,070
so don't worry, Maha.

60
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,450
Why are you...

61
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,290
crying right now?

62
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,430
Maha...

63
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,600
Maha, wake up, please.

64
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,140
Maha!

65
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,130
Wake up, please.

66
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,980
My baby!

67
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,320
Maha! Maha...

68
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,730
No! No!

69
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,400
Yang? Why?

70
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,900
Why are you trying to kill me?

71
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,620
You killed Wang Yoo.

72
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,580
Wang Yoo destroyed my dream of conquest.

73
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,680
And you destroyed my love.

74
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,700
Yang?

75
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:34,800
In my heart, there is just one person, only Wang Yoo.

76
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,390
Then, what am I to you?

77
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,690
In my heart, there is only you, Yang.

78
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,050
You are my mortal enemy who killed Wang Yoo,

79
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,570
I will never forgive you.

80
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,690
No... Yang...

81
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,790
Yang...

82
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,750
You must not.

83
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,800
Your Majesty, did you have another nightmare?

84
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,280
Chief Imperial Consort?

85
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,430
I must go to see Chief Imperial Consort.

86
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,250
Your Majesty.

87
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,030
No, no. The writing implements.

88
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:34,360
Bring me the writing implements. I have to write something, to calm down.

89
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,110
Your Majesty.

90
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,070
It's a poisoned arrow.

91
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,080
So what will happen to the imperial prince?

92
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,940
I think we've escaped danger for now, but we will have to wait and see.

93
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,210
If the poison hasn't been absorbed too deeply,

94
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,870
he will be all right.

95
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,930
Hey!

96
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,180
Why is Chief Imperial Consort acting that way?

97
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,270
What do you mean?

98
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,800
Prince Maha is Prince Ayu's rival for the crown prince position.

99
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,130
So what is her reason for crying and being so sad about this?

100
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,260
Are you hiding something from me?

101
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:59,460
I will tell you later when the time is right. So for now, please don't ask me.

102
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,370
What happened to Yeom Byeong Soo?

103
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,700
Unfortunately, he got away.

104
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,870
How is the imperial prince?

105
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,710
Baby...

106
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,060
Don't worry.

107
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,520
As my mother protected me,

108
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,910
I will...

109
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,370
protect you.

110
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,290
He didn't die!

111
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,060
Star!

112
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,330
I'm sorry.

113
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,070
My Star.

114
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,690
My son, Star.

115
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,870
I am sorry.

116
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,100
Imagine that I didn't recognize you

117
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,430
until you've grown this much.

118
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,010
I've never warmly held you once

119
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,490
and I've done nothing for you.

120
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,860
It's not your fault, Your Highness.

121
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,870
Don't blame yourself.

122
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,120
I hated this child.

123
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:48,580
My son, my Star... I hated him

124
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,400
and ignored him.

125
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,450
Your Highness.

126
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,700
What do I do now?

127
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,550
To protect him,

128
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,330
what must I do?

129
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,950
Star... my son...

130
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,660
Star.

131
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,090
My son, Star.

132
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,390
I am so sorry.

133
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,200
Your Highness.

134
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,380
Your Majesty!

135
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,390
What happened to Maha?

136
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,520
He was hit with a poisoned arrow, so he is not likely to survive.

137
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,280
You did well.

138
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,550
I don't know know how she found out,

139
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,090
but Chief Imperial Consort was there.

140
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,370
She was?

141
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,930
Hurry and spread the rumor that the Goryeo people killed Prince Maha.

142
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,200
Even Chief Imperial Consort was there. Isn't that even better?

143
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,450
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:15,470
Please destroy Chief Imperial Consort viciously.

145
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,910
Thinking about my Yeon Hwa's death, my teeth still gnash

146
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,690
and my blood flows backward from rage.

147
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,070
You still didn't find Wang Yoo's body?

148
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,230
If he is alive by any chance, he probably ran away to Goryeo.

149
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,170
Who helped him?

150
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,960
They tried to kill me,

151
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,270
which makes me wonder if Chief Imperial Consort is involved.

152
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,880
Perhaps Chief Imperial Consort wanted me dead due to the investiture of the crown prince—

153
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,600
That is not possible.

154
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,480
Chief Imperial Consort is the one who saved Wang Yoo from execution.

155
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,540
Never again!

156
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:04,550
Never speak about that again.

157
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,990
Send a secret letter to the new King of Goryeo

158
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:14,160
and order him to behead Wang Yoo the moment he arrives in Goryeo and send me his head.

159
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

160
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,020
Emperor.

161
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,010
A big disaster, Emperor.

162
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,700
What is it now?

163
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,120
Last night, Prince Maha was attacked by Goryeo people.

164
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,020
What?

165
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,460
He went to Seonoep Temple for a memorial service and was hit by a poisoned arrow.

166
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:44,710
That is not all. Chief Imperial Consort was there.

167
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,060
What does that mean? Tell me more.

168
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,760
Chief Imperial Consort got Goryeo people to try to kill Prince Maha?

169
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

170
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,090
How can someone do such a thing, as a human being?

171
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,100
Does His Majesty know about this?

172
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,320
Of course, he does. The palace has been turned upside down.

173
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,100
How can such a terrible thing happen?

174
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,920
Save us, merciful Buddha...

175
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,810
Prince Maha is on his way here, you should go to see him.

176
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,670
Did you see my ring in here?

177
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,750
Ring?

178
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,860
It's the ring that His Majesty gave me at the wedding.

179
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,700
I didn't see it.

180
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,240
Hurry, please.

181
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,410
Stop.

182
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,560
Imperial Prince, just what has happened?

183
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,490
This young body was hit with a poisoned arrow?

184
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,800
Hurry and take him to the doctor.

185
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

186
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,040
Hurry now.

187
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:23,020
Did you see that, Your Majesty? Chief Imperial Consort is such a wicked and scary person.

188
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:29,210
Do you really want to make Ayushiridara the crown prince after seeing that?

189
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,970
We don't know all the facts yet.

190
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,900
So you should watch what you say.

191
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,210
Emperor!

192
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,390
Your Majesty, what is wrong?

193
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,890
I have no memory

194
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,880
of ever holding Maha's hand.

195
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,780
Until this child's hand grew this big...

196
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,930
Your Majesty.

197
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,560
Head Eunuch.

198
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,120
That I came to see him,

199
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,960
please don't tell Maha.

200
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,620
Your Majesty, why hide that?

201
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,780
If he knows that you came to see him, Imperial Prince would be so happy.

202
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,850
False hope would make him suffer more.

203
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,930
Chief Imperial Consort, why didn't you come earlier?

204
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,290
It looks like you are in big trouble now, because of Prince Maha.

205
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,450
I'm sure you've heard the rumors already.

206
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,110
I know you wouldn't do such a thing—

207
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,830
For worrying about me,

208
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,560
I thank you.

209
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,750
Even His Majesty suspects you now.

210
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,640
I am the only one on your side in this palace. So ask me for anything you need.

211
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,040
I will do that.

212
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,420
I have something to give you, Your Highness.

213
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,120
Yeom Byeong Soo dropped this ring.

214
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,840
This... Isn't this the Empress's ring?

215
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,830
So the empress is the one who told Yeom Byeong Soo to do this.

216
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:14,300
That ring is evidence that cannot be refuted, Your Highness.

217
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:30,990
Your Majesty.

218
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,420
Please tell me in detail.

219
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,340
Why were you at Seoneop Temple last night, and why was Prince Maha shot with a poisoned arrow?

220
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,040
Do you also believe that I tried to kill Maha?

221
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,680
You said yourself that there is nothing you won't do for Ayu.

222
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,000
I swear on the heavens that it wasn't me.

223
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,980
Then, who would do such a terrible thing?

224
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,420
- I will reveal the truth in the Great Hall.
- Chief Imperial Consort.

225
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,770
If I find the real culprit,

226
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,890
please give me the authority to decide the punishment.

227
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,510
And if you cannot?

228
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,790
Then do what you want to, Your Majesty.

229
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,410
Her Highness the Chief Imperial Consort enters.

230
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,760
Chief Imperial Consort, explain yourself.

231
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,880
Emperor, why let her explain?

232
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,050
She must answer for her crimes. She must be interrogated.

233
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,600
I am the one who saved Prince Maha.

234
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,640
Are you trying to "hide the sky with your hand?"
(T/N: A futile effort)

235
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,460
When Prince Maha awakens, he will tell you what happened. How could I lie about this?

236
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:28,730
Look at this, Emperor. Chief Imperial Consort is lying, knowing that Maha will not waken.

237
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,000
This ring.

238
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,670
Do you know who this ring belongs to?

239
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,110
This ring... isn't this the Empress's ring?

240
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,660
The assassin who tried to kill the Imperial Prince dropped this.

241
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,980
Goodness.

242
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,590
How did this happen, Empress?

243
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,590
Someone stole my ring.

244
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,510
Now I see that it was Chief Imperial Consort who stole it.

245
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,450
She stole my ring and she is falsely accusing me as the criminal.

246
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,050
I didn't pick up this ring.

247
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,910
It was from Head Eunuch Dok Man.

248
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,090
Head Eunuch Dok Man, please speak. Is Chief Imperial Consort speaking the truth?

249
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,060
Yes, she is, Your Majesty.

250
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,450
I fought with the assassin who tried to kill the imperial prince.

251
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,190
That is when he dropped the ring.

252
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,210
Did you see his face?

253
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:05,010
He is Yeom Byeong Soo, the former captain of the Imperial Guard.

255
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,800
The one who saved the imperial prince from Yeom Byeong Soo

256
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,240
was Chief Imperial Consort.

257
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,120
Head Eunuch Dok Man! You are from Goryeo, are you not?

258
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,460
Your Majesty, do you still not see the truth?

259
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,890
Goryeo people have conspired together to kill Prince Maha, just as the rumors say.

260
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:43,160
And Chief Imperial Consort is the one behind it all.

261
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,400
Yes, now everything has become clear.

262
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,330
Emperor, imprison Chief Imperial Consort right now

263
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,360
and begin to interrogate Head Eunuch Dok Man and the other Goryeo people.

264
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,030
Empress, you are lying to me right now.

265
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,870
Lying? Me?

266
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,810
Yeom Byeong Soo caused Chief Imperial Consort's father to die.

267
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,340
Would Chief Imperial Consort ever join hands with her mortal enemy?

268
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,940
Tell the truth. Did you ever meet with Yeom Byeong Soo?

269
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:26,140
I do not know who Yeom Byeong Soo is.

270
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,430
Your Majesty, if the empress has met with Yeom Byeong Soo,

271
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,030
Court Lady Seo would know.

272
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,120
You've taken care of Prince Maha his whole life.

273
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,330
Have you ever seen the empress meet with Yeom Byeong Soo?

274
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,910
Court Lady Seo, hurry and tell us.

275
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,550
Have you see them meet?

276
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

277
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:59,560
Her Majesty did meet with Yeom Byeong Soo.

278
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:10,410
That they were plotting to kill His Highness the Imperial Prince,

279
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,110
I never dreamed of it.

280
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,910
You bitch! How dare you lie!

281
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,920
- Drag the empress out!
- Yes!

282
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,440
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

283
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,970
Someone is framing me for this crime—

284
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,750
Please help me, Uncle. This is unfair. Uncle!

285
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,580
Uncle! Uncle!

286
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:41,190
This is unfair! Uncle! Uncle!

287
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,880
- Your Majesty.
- Prime Minister, please stay out of this.

288
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:49,150
I granted full authority to the Chief Imperial Consort to decide the punishment for this incident.

289
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,030
Don't worry, Prime Minister. I will decide on a just and fair punishment.

290
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,410
Let go of me. How dare you touch me?

291
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,670
Won't you let go! Let go!

292
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,050
Please come this way.

293
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,720
Your Majesty,

294
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,280
here, right now,

295
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,180
there is one more thing which needs to be revealed.

296
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,760
Prince Maha...

297
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,400
is not Danashiri's true son.

298
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,230
- What?
- Goodness.

299
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,860
Prince Maha is not her son?

300
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,050
What nonsense is that?

301
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,200
Bring her in.

302
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,020
This person knows what happened when Maha was a baby.

303
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,250
Please speak.

304
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:28,280
My fellow Buddhist nun brought an infant she found.

305
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,420
Empress Danashiri took that baby

306
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,450
and set fire to Hwangak Temple.

307
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,670
Empress Dowager, please regain your senses.

308
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,370
Bring her to the doctor, please.

309
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,050
Empress Dowager... Empress Dowager...

310
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:56,550
When this child wakes up, please tell him the truth.

311
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,750
Your Highness, it may be better if he doesn't know.

312
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:05,660
When he is cast out of the palace, he will find out anyway.

313
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,300
Your Highness...

314
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,570
Did you wake up?

315
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,890
What did you just say?

316
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:28,420
I will be cast out of the palace?

317
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:41,100
You are not the child of the emperor and Empress Danashiri.

318
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,380
That's a lie.

319
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,450
Please don't lie.

320
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,500
It is not a lie.

321
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:59,060
You cannot live in the palace anymore.

322
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,900
Then,

323
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,360
who is my father?

324
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,490
Who is my mother?

325
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,590
I must have been born with parents.

326
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,620
So who are...

327
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,190
my parents?

328
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,310
You were abandoned in the mountains as a baby.

329
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,630
Get a hold of yourself.

330
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,400
Stop your tears, I said.

331
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,820
No one...

332
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,090
Not anyone...

333
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,360
will protect your life for you.

334
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,380
So you must become stronger.

335
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,590
And...

336
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,380
don't expect anything

337
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,280
from anyone.

338
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,870
That is how you can survive.

339
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,830
My words...

340
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,710
make sure to remember my words.

341
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,150
Star,

342
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,530
my son...

343
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,430
This is all that

344
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,540
I can do for you.

345
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,510
Just a little longer...

346
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,960
Please endure just a little longer.

347
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,630
Star...

348
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,600
My son...

349
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,740
Cheonsudap Valley is nearby.

350
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,650
His Majesty must be waiting. Let's go.

351
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,790
Try eating this.

352
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,860
Why do you look at me like that?

353
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,790
On your face,

354
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,260
there is ash on it.

355
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,070
I'll go wash it off.

356
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,120
Some bothersome guys have come.

357
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,940
Cheonsudap Valley isn't far from here.

358
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,650
I will block their attacks, so please take the reins of the horse.

359
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,170
I will block from behind.

360
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,840
You cannot shoot any arrows in your condition.

361
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,910
- Bisoo.
- Just this once,

362
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,090
listen to what I tell you.

363
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,940
Whatever happens, you must never look back.

364
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,380
Bisoo! Are you all right?

365
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,550
Do not look back.

366
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,030
What happened?

367
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,600
General? General.

368
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,160
Hurry and chase them!

369
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,670
Bisoo! Are you all right?

370
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,030
Bisoo.

371
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,380
Bisoo? Bisoo?

372
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,280
Wang Yoo...

373
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,010
Bisoo?

374
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,910
Don't die.

375
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,270
Is there still ash on my face?

376
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,520
Thank you.

377
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,980
So much blood...

378
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,530
How could this happen to you

379
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,780
and you not scream even once?

380
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,550
With you, Wang Yoo...

381
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,750
spending time together, just you and I...

382
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,820
I was happy.

383
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,230
My wish...

384
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,760
was to die in your arms.

385
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,890
So...

386
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,930
my wish...

387
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,730
came true.

388
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,270
Bisoo,

389
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,790
just endure for a little longer.

390
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,240
I will save you. So stay just a little longer.

391
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,890
Wang Yoo...

392
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:34,640
sometimes... just once in a while...

393
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,210
will you please

394
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,540
think of me?

395
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,680
Be strong. Just a little bit.

396
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,660
I will save you. Stay with me.

397
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,310
Don't cry, please...

398
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,470
for me...

399
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:59,580
Wang Yoo...

400
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,540
Bisoo?

401
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,130
Wake up. Bisoo!

402
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,910
Bisoo!

403
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,870
Bisoo! Wake up!

404
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,120
Bisoo!!

405
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,200
She was carrying this.

406
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,280
Yeon Bisoo...

407
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,220
was a real woman.

408
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,580
Chief...

409
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,820
was in love with you, Wang Yoo.

410
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,690
Can I live

411
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,660
in Goryeo?

412
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,750
I've been to many places,

413
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,820
but nowhere was quite like the mountains and streams of Goryeo.

414
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,900
You don't need my permission to do that.

415
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,450
Wang Yoo.

416
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,740
If you have something to say, tell me.

417
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,560
When we arrive in Goryeo,

418
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,470
I will tell you.

419
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,900
We are returning to Yeongyeong.

420
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,580
Your Majesty.

421
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,260
Why are we going to Yeongyeong?

422
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,830
Do you have something you want to say to me?

423
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:23,790
I will not block the investiture of Ayu as Crown Prince.

424
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:33,670
So you want to make a deal for the empress's crown?

425
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:42,210
Unfortunately, I don't need your help, Prime Minister.

426
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,810
But I didn't expect you to break your convictions for your family clan.

427
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,140
The empress's dethronement has already been decided.

428
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,900
His Majesty should be writing the decree right about now.

429
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,820
I said previously that I wanted to protect you.

430
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,960
I remember telling you that.

431
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Do you remember it?

432
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:17,670
Now, this Bayan no longer feels that way.

433
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:28,020
The person who now wants to protect you, Prime Minister, is me.

434
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,680
What is going on?

435
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,620
Why haven't I heard from Uncle?

436
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,810
Deposed Empress Bayan, you will now accept the command of His Majesty.

437
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,660
De-Deposed?

438
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,610
Remove her clothes.

439
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,290
These wenches? How dare you?

440
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,560
Deposed?

441
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,500
How dares to depose me?

442
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,560
Won't you stop this?

443
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,770
I am the empress of this kingdom!

444
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,600
Let go of me!

445
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,210
Let go, I said!

446
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,150
Read the decree of dethronement.

447
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:29,830
Uncle, why are you just standing there, watching?

448
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,460
Don't show such a shameful sight.

449
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,210
Shameful?

450
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:37,990
Uncle, you can't win over this mere Chief Imperial Consort?

451
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,850
Bayan Khutugh, your behavior is unlawful and your character is savage.

452
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:50,160
You have harmed the discipline of the inner court and the dignity of the imperial family.

453
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,120
You have also committed an unforgivable wicked deed.

454
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,010
So I command you to be deposed from your throne.

455
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,790
Bayan, you will be exiled to a remote village.

456
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,810
Exiled?

457
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:23,170
Not only will you be forbidden to ever leave your home, but you also will never speak to anyone from the outside.

458
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,710
And you will only be granted one bag of rice per year.

459
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:32,040
So are you trying to starve me to death?

460
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,880
Cast the deposed empress out of this palace.

461
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,620
Yes.

462
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,550
Let go! Let go!

463
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,270
Let go! Let go of me!

464
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,790
Won't you let go?

465
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,810
Uncle! Please avenge me!

466
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:02,100
Please kill that bitch for me!

467
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,030
Uncle!

468
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,960
Brother!

469
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,210
Brother!

470
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,420
What is happening?

471
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,760
The empress was deposed?

472
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,130
Now we have no one we can rely on.

473
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,230
Dammit.

474
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,640
Yeom Byeong Soo, you dared try to kill Maha?

475
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,510
General, it's not like that.

476
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,720
I will kill you right now.

477
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:08,880
Maha! Maha... He is not your nephew, General.

478
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,770
- What?
- Empress Danashiri

479
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:16,800
brought him from somewhere.

480
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,670
What...

481
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,030
That cannot be true.

482
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:26,170
It's true. Please confirm it.

483
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:32,220
Maha is really not the imperial prince?

484
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

485
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,720
He will soon be expelled from the palace.

486
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:47,620
But why did you return to Yeongyeong?

487
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,370
Yeon Bisoo died.

488
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:58,310
Did you say Tanqishi is receiving protection from the Leader of Hawk House?

489
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

490
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,520
Have you looked into who the leader could be?

491
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:08,700
I tried to find out, but I couldn't find anything.

492
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,640
Some say the Leader is a woman.

493
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,940
And some say he is an old man.

494
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:27,290
Someone told me that he is a foreigner with blue eyes.

495
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:32,030
I have no idea which is the truth.

496
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,540
A shadow warrior.

497
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,560
Shadow warrior? What is that?

498
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,810
To hide the real one, a fake leader.

499
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,820
Time has now come.

500
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:55,020
The world will be ours soon, so risk your lives.

501
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,200
We accept your command!

502
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,900
I made tonic with Goryeo ginseng for you.

503
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:11,570
Please recover soon.

504
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:16,590
You are the elder of this palace, aren't you?

505
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:25,880
When did you know Maha was fake?

506
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,610
I thought you would praise me for a job well done.

507
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:36,170
Praise? After you manipulated me,

508
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:37,240
you want praise?

509
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,450
Don't you consider bloodlines important?

510
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:44,310
I blocked you from making a huge mistake.

511
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,020
What? How dare you, you bitch?!

512
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,190
How dare you call me a bitch?

513
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,710
My son will become the crown prince soon.

514
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:56,930
So I will be the mother of the emperor-to-be.

515
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:06,310
So, please observe your manners from now on, Empress Dowager.

516
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,700
Empress Dowager, Maha is outside.

517
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:23,690
He is leaving the palace, so he wanted to say farewell—

518
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:29,050
I don't need it, so tell him to go.

519
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,460
She says she will not accept your greeting, so you should just go.

520
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,180
So she won't accept his final farewell?

521
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,390
Are you leaving now?

522
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,380
Yes, Fath...

523
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,960
Yes, I was just going to see you, Your Majesty.

524
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,430
You have done nothing wrong.

525
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:25,380
All of this is my fault.

526
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,930
Please give my thanks to Empress Dowager

527
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:36,110
for raising me.

528
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,750
You are so cold-hearted.

529
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,750
Cold-hearted?

530
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:20,800
You coddled Maha so much. Now that he is useless to you, you throw him away so quickly.

531
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,950
Please understand how I feel, Emperor.

532
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,780
Even if no one else would,

533
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:31,010
you should have protected Maha until the end, shouldn't you?

534
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:34,280
But we don't even know where he comes from.

535
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,050
I can see your dark heart.

536
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,120
Emperor.

537
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:45,890
When I was exiled to Goryeo and my younger brother became Emperor, you were so cold-hearted then, too.

538
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:46,690
Stop now!

539
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:51,460
But once I returned as the new emperor,

540
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:59,150
you greeted me with a big smile.

541
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,230
And you are exactly the same right now.

542
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:07,010
Emperor, you trusted me like your mother. So why...?

543
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:11,430
Because I was so lonely.

544
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,800
I knew that your smile was fake,

545
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:21,740
but I was so afraid and lonely.

546
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,970
This is all because of Chief Imperial Consort.

547
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,800
Since that wicked thing appeared—

548
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,890
Empress Dowager.

549
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,630
Chief Imperial Consort is different from you.

550
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,940
Chief Imperial Consort, at least to me...

551
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:41,470
Your Majesty, you destroyed my love.

552
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:42,870
Yang.

553
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:45,350
In my heart,

554
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:50,530
there is just one person, only Wang Yoo.

555
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,190
Emperor.

556
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,100
Emperor?

557
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:03,750
What's wrong, Emperor? Emperor?

558
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,610
Emperor?

559
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,400
Maha, from now on,

560
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:22,010
I am responsible for you.

561
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:27,920
So if something goes wrong with you, I will be rebuked.

562
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:34,860
So make effort to make sure your mind and body are healthy and strong.

563
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:38,370
Why won't you answer me?

564
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,970
Yes, Your Highness.

565
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,950
The reason I let you live

566
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:53,380
is due to your loyalty to Maha.

567
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,460
I know that.

568
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:01,440
When Maha recovers his strength, take him to Goryeo.

569
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,230
Why Goryeo?

570
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:09,490
He bothers me, so I want to send him far away, that's why.

571
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,290
Yes, Your Highness.

572
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:16,820
Once you finish that task, you are free to go anywhere.

573
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,570
Thank you, Your Highness.

574
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:27,600
Please speak to your acquaintances in Goryeo and find a place where Maha can live comfortably.

575
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,660
Yes, we will.

576
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:41,290
Chief Imperial Consort is taking care of Maha now?

577
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:44,720
What a good thing that he left the palace.

578
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:51,090
So does Chief Imperial Consort know that Maha is her son?

579
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:55,970
Of course, she knows. That's why she's taking care of him. Keep this a secret from His Majesty.

580
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:59,230
The day he finds out Maha is his son...

581
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,790
What are you talking about?

582
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:09,760
Maha is my son?

583
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,500
Your Majesty.

584
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:18,100
Maha is... my son?

585
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:23,210
His Highness the Crown Prince enters.

586
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,860
I greet you, my imperial father.

587
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:05,380
Here, come here to me.

588
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:26,610
The crown prince who will next ascend the throne of this kingdom...

589
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,760
is Ayushiridara.

590
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:47,510
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

591
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:52,000
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

592
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,620
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

593
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:00,930
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

594
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:05,390
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

595
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:09,520
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

596
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,730
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

597
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:39,620
The crown prince is a lowly Goryeo boy? This kingdom is doomed.

598
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:42,490
We must get rid of Chief Imperial Consort.

599
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:46,630
Even the great El Temür could not kill this girl.

600
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:50,410
If we are not careful, she will devour us all.

601
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,520
Don't worry.

602
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:57,360
I have a plan to chop off the Chief Imperial Consort's neck.

603
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:14,570
Congratulations, Your Highness the Chief Imperial Consort.

604
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:18,600
Congratulations, Your Highness the Chief Imperial Consort.

605
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:22,540
Thank you.

606
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:28,740
But I am not satisfied.

607
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:36,490
There are those in this palace who want to kill me and the crown prince.

608
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:39,370
You are the mother of the emperor-to-be.

609
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:42,430
How dare they?

610
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:47,310
Prime Minister and Empress Dowager, they must be removed.

611
00:57:52,250 --> 00:58:00,410
Prime Minister and Empress Dowager, I will get rid of them.

612
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:06,420
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

613
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:14,110
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

614
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:18,060
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫
