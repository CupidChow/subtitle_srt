1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,680
I will take my leave.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,450
Don't worry about me. The abdication didn't happen,

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,220
but I will not lose the Imperial Seal.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,100
Father, Lady Ki is outside.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,570
What? Lady Ki?

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,010
- I will send her away right now.
- Let her in.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,210
Why would you deal with the likes of that girl?

8
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,890
- How dare you come here?
- I didn't come to see you, General Tanqishi.

9
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,420
I am here to meet with Prime Minister.

10
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,820
You're quite brave.

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,880
Walking into the tiger's den with your own two feet.

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,030
Why would someone who's like a tiger

13
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,710
come up with a plot that's not worthy of such a cat?

14
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,990
What did you say?

15
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,210
- Why did you come to see me?
- Why do you think?

16
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,680
- I have no time to spare on the likes of you.
- I'm sure.

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:31,360
You had no time to waste when you had to come up with an assassin for the imperial prince.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,770
From the mouth of that assassin, these words will be uttered.

19
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,240
"The person who asked me to kill the imperial prince was Lady Ki."

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,720
"She was blinded by jealousy and tried to kill the imperial prince."

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,280
"Liaoyang Province's magistrate, Bayan, is her co-conspirator."

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,520
You're quite intelligent.

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,260
You need to make an example of someone.

24
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,230
Once you get rid of me and Officer Bayan,

25
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,630
you will call in the other magistrates one by one.

26
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,440
Then you will say this...

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,330
"During the Kurultai meeting, object to the handover of power."

28
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,990
"If not, I will get rid of you the same way."

29
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,590
Are my deductions wrong?

30
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,230
So? What do you intend on doing to prepare for it?

31
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,090
Zhuge Liang, Kongming, with 2,500 men,

32
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,370
fought and won against Sima Yi, Zhongda's 15,000 men.

33
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,630
How did he win?

34
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:48,300
Kongming guarded his plan completely.

35
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,240
Since Zhongda couldn't figure out his opponent, he was still fearful even with his 15,000 men.

36
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,110
You couldn't have prepared a plan.

37
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,240
I will make up your crime as I see fit.

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,370
Gahwawooin. It's a very surprising...
(T/N: Gahwawooin - to create a crime to blame someone with)

39
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,340
...and brutal method.

40
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,540
But, Prime Minister, you will never be able to make me or Officer Bayan the criminals.

41
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,910
- Why not?
- If you touch us, that will become proof

42
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,450
that you are the one who is the culprit.

43
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,790
You will suddenly become a grandfather who placed an assassin

44
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,870
in his grandson's room. And the illustrious reputation you've gained

45
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,760
will go up in smoke overnight.

46
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,770
Also, in the history books—

47
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,070
Silence! If you could make me into the culprit,

48
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,410
you wouldn't have had a reason to come see me. How dare you lie to me?

49
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:09,380
Then make me out to be the culprit and see if I'm really lying?

50
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,750
Well then, I will expect your next move, Prime Minister.

51
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,180
What happened? Did he believe you?

52
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,930
The look in his eyes... it faltered.

53
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,600
It must mean he feels uncertain, does he not?

54
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,320
You did a great thing.

55
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,460
We don't know what decision El Temür will make.

56
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:24,500
You are right. Now, all we can do is wait.

57
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:41,070
Facing off against an opponent who has everything while having nothing... Isn't that amazing?

58
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,690
Father, you must not be bewildered by what Lady Ki said.

59
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,620
I agree.

60
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,910
What do you think? That wench used to be your subordinate, so you would know.

61
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,220
Do you also think it was just some cunning wordplay?

62
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,960
If it were me, I would not choose Lady Ki as the criminal.

63
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,800
One mistake is more fatal than a hundred successes.

64
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,840
There's no need to walk on thin ice when you're checking every stone before crossing a stone bridge.

65
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,080
What? The empress left the Cold Palace?

66
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,390
She fainted after hearing the news about the imperial prince,

67
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,020
but she's not showing any signs of waking up, so she's been taken to her quarters.

68
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,250
- Is she still not awake?
- Thankfully she is awake,

69
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,310
but she is refusing to go back to the Cold Palace while not eating.

70
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:57,600
- Not eating?
- Yes, Your Highness. She'd rather die from not eating.

71
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,730
What if something happens to her? You will be blamed for it.

72
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:11,060
Still, we must follow the law.

73
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,700
I feel like I can live again now that I'm eating sweets after so long.

74
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,480
What are you doing?

75
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:36,150
Your Majesty, you could die this way.

76
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:42,990
Your Imperial Majesty, please eat something!

77
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,720
More! Louder if we want the gossip to spread it in the palace.

78
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,350
Your Majesty, how could you stop eating!

79
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,740
Your Imperial Majesty!

80
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,510
The Empress Dowager has come!

81
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,350
Greetings, Your Highness.

82
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,960
What are you doing not taking her back to the Cold Palace?

83
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,790
She is not getting better.

84
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,070
She is refusing water as well as the tonic.

85
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:35,210
I will tell them to get the palanquin ready. If you can't walk—

86
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,320
I will not go alone.

87
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,890
Empress, this is not something you can refuse.

88
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,440
I will prostrate myself on a straw mat instead. I will die while making a petition to the emperor.

89
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,010
You're being punished right now for the poisoning incident. Have you forgotten?

90
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,280
I must protect my son from you.

91
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,950
- What are you talking about?
- The assassin getting into the prince's quarters

92
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,680
isn't something that can happen without your help.

93
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,050
You want to avoid the Cold Palace even if you have to be unreasonable?

94
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:20,940
Unreasonable? It's a mother's instinct to jump into the fire if her child is in danger.

95
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:27,920
From what I see, you're only using your child for your benefit.

96
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,870
I am just not cold like you and only trying to protect my son.

97
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:44,280
Your Majesty, the assassin who tried to harm the imperial prince has made a confession.

98
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,690
Who was the one who conspired with him?

99
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,080
I don't think it will be long until the emperor will reign again.

100
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,390
I agree.

101
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,880
How dare you do this?

102
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,530
How can you bring the Imperial Guard in here?

103
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,690
Are you crazy?

104
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,640
Arrest Jeop Gong, the Magistrate of Shaanxi Province!

105
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,450
Yes, Sir!

106
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,920
Let me go! What do you think you're doing?

107
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,940
Let me go! How dare you?!

108
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,300
Let me go! Let me go I said!

109
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,290
Don't be shocked. The assassin told us who the conspirator was.

110
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,530
Wh-What? The conspirator?

111
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,430
You mean Jeop Gong tried to harm the imperial prince?

112
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,200
Where are you taking me?

113
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,070
Let me go!

114
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,940
What is this Bayan? Please save me. These men are—

115
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,800
- Take him away.
- Take him away!

116
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,990
Bayan! Bayan!

117
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:15,430
You're quite amazing. Fooling the prime minister with your tongue.

118
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:21,410
It brings tears to my eyes to see him making such an effort to hold onto the Imperial Seal.

119
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,000
What can he do? When the emperor of this country lacks the ability to take care of the affairs of state.

120
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,320
He's not the emperor you used to know.

121
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,880
Did you not realize it after being told off during the Kurultai?

122
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,910
Right. I was very scared.

123
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:43,650
Because you made him into an emperor when he used to only look the part, I thought my heart would stop.

124
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,660
Now stop being wicked and trying to train the emperor.

125
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:59,190
An imperial concubine is only just that. If you step out of bounds, it will only cause disaster for yourself.

126
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,100
And a vassal is only just a vassal.

127
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,710
Shaking up the affairs of the state is something only the disloyal vassals do.

128
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:14,490
Bayan, just know that your life was saved thanks to Lady Ki.

129
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,800
We managed to avoid an immediate disaster,

130
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,200
but there will soon be a black cloud over this palace.

131
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,770
- The weather is so nice.
- I know.

132
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,260
What's the matter?

133
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,540
Why? What are you doing? Lady Oh!

134
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,820
- Tell us what happened.
- A secret feud in the inner court is scary indeed.

135
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,740
How dare she try to harm the imperial prince?

136
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,650
No matter how jealous,

137
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:13,500
an imperial concubine should not behave that way.

138
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,860
Stop!

139
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,530
Pour it on them.

140
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,780
Confess the truth. Who else is involved?

141
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,960
I... don't know anything.

142
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,290
You don't? Listen here, Jeop Gong.

143
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,800
Do you know how I killed a man who committed a similar sin?

144
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,890
I boiled him alive.

145
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,520
I boiled him in a cauldron of oil while he was still alive.

146
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,360
Do you want to die like that, too?

147
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,390
Please let me live, Prime Minister.

148
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,980
So confess the truth already.

149
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,800
Who did you conspire with among those men?

150
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:50,850
His Imperial Majesty enters!

151
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,570
Didn't you receive my message for you to not come here?

152
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,820
Stop this immediately.

153
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,340
How can I stop? They tried to assassinate the imperial prince.

154
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,160
You haven't even found out what happened. How can you do this after just hearing what the assassin said?

155
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,220
So I am investigating right now whether other magistrates are involved in this incident.

156
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:29,940
This man will soon tell us. Would you like to watch?

157
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,100
Prepare the cauldron and pour the oil.

158
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,920
Yes, Prime Minister. Prepare the cauldron.

159
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,990
Your Majesty, this is not fair.

160
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,620
I did not do this, Your Majesty.

161
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,400
Please save us, Your Majesty.

162
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,030
I did this.

163
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,250
I ordered the imperial prince to be killed.

164
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,010
Your Majesty!

165
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:23,010
These people have done nothing wrong. If you want to punish the criminal, boil me in oil and kill me!

166
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,840
Your Majesty!

167
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,250
Did Lady Ki tell you to say this?

168
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,840
That the magistrates would be so touched by what you did that they will stand with you?

169
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,100
Come to your senses, Your Majesty. He is your son.

170
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,610
You can't even distinguish Heaven and Earth, how can you rule the world?

171
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,950
I am someone who sheds tears of blood when thinking about our kingdom.

172
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:05,970
I will never give up the Imperial Seal to you, understand?

173
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,680
I will call a Kurultai meeting tomorrow.

174
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,630
This isn't something you can decide on your own. You will need the cooperation of the political and military councils.

175
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,590
Yes, do that. Please do that, Your Majesty.

176
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,110
Please release Magistrate Jeop Gong.

177
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:43,170
- If I let him live, what will you do for me?
- This is not something we can negotiate, is it?

178
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,750
We all know that Magistrate Jeop Gong is not the criminal who tried to assassinate the imperial prince.

179
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,010
You must not kill him, Prime Minister.

180
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,980
Bring it.

181
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,480
What is this box?

182
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,610
My response is inside.

183
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:40,590
I have nine more boxes, just like this.

184
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,340
So I can put nine more heads inside.

185
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:50,450
But if you think I only have nine ways to kill my enemies, that's a big mistake.

186
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:56,490
I have hundreds of ways. Jeop Gong

187
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:02,190
was killed using the easiest way, so you can figure it out easily.

188
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,770
Do you know who the most foolish man is during a battle?

189
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:19,520
The one who babbles about "the cause" and "pride" and keeps fighting knowing he will die.

190
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,840
I wish you will not make the same mistake.

191
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:40,310
Loyalty to the emperor? Duty as a vassal? Does Jeop Gong's head look honorable to you right now?

192
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:50,480
Just a common death, like a dog. So consider well what you should do.

193
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,540
Please take your seat.

194
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,580
There is no reason for delay, is there?

195
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,960
- Begin.
- Yes.

196
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,760
Before that,

197
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,970
I have something to say.

198
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,510
I would like to

199
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,910
ask for your forgiveness from all of you.

200
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,250
To speak honestly,

201
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,930
I am not much of an emperor. I am foolish, incompetent, and cowardly.

202
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,440
And I am selfish.

203
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,560
What you are all thinking is

204
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,640
what difficulties the people are suffering

205
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,660
I am a pathetic person who cares nothing for those things.

206
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,250
Your Majesty.

207
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,290
But...

208
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,230
I no longer want to be a useless emperor.

209
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,040
I no longer want to run away because I am scared of Prime Minister.

210
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,880
So...

211
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,250
I know it's shameless, but I ask for your loyalty.

212
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,350
If you give me a chance, I will no longer waste it.

213
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,620
So...

214
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,000
trust in me, just this once.

215
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,960
Begin.

216
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,160
According to the rules of Kurultai,

217
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,930
unanimous approval is required.

218
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,220
Magistrates who wish for the Imperial Seal to be restored to the emperor

219
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,660
come forward, please.

220
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,770
Bayan, Magistrate of Liaoyang,

221
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,590
as for the Imperial Seal being restored to the emperor,

222
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,970
I am in favor.

223
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,640
Are there any more?

224
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,080
What happened?

225
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,310
We failed.

226
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,340
Aside from Officer Bayan,

227
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,740
no one else stood with Our Majesty.

228
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,490
So this is as far as we can go?

229
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,890
Going against El Temür

230
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,430
can we really not go any further?

231
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:10,640
Your Majesty, do you understand the wishes of the magistrates now?

232
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,380
I will become even more devoted to my service to you, Your Majesty.

233
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,460
So please don't say you will conduct the affairs of the state ever again.

234
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,990
Let's go.

235
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,740
I am grateful to you, Prime Minister.

236
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,090
Grateful? You have gone mad.

237
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,380
Your Majesty, please forgive our disloyalty!

238
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,980
Please forgive us, Your Majesty!

239
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,620
Please forgive us, Your Majesty...

240
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,890
Thanks to you, Prime Minister,

241
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,470
the magistrates have accepted His Majesty as their true emperor.

242
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,610
Do you think he is capable of handling them?

243
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,940
Lions are said to

244
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,460
throw their own young off a cliff.

245
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,550
Your severity is making His Majesty stronger.

246
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,480
Lady Ki,

247
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,060
you were a tribute from Goryeo?

248
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,290
I've...

249
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,550
got my eye on you now.

250
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:08,000
Do you know what that means? It won't take long

251
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,690
before you will know what I mean by it.

252
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,450
Your Majesty, please return to the Great Hall.

253
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,350
In the end, everything returned to how they were.

254
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,480
What do you mean?

255
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,950
That is not true.

256
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,230
In the end, I gained nothing.

257
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,190
All I did was maintain my title as emperor.

258
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:06,180
They said that the person who gains people has gained the whole world.

259
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,660
El Temür retained the Imperial Seal, but he lost people.

260
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:16,670
And you've gained nine magistrates.

261
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,670
You've won this fight.

262
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,830
As the tree gains its rings while suffering the winter cold,

263
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,480
you are...

264
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,360
preparing to be reborn as a true emperor

265
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,120
and suffering for it.

266
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:41,750
So you may hurt, but don't lose your resolve.

267
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,160
Because I have you,

268
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,230
I will endure until the end.

269
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,350
Thank you, Yang.

270
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,750
Her Majesty the Empress enters!

271
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,180
We welcome your return to the palace.

272
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,980
We welcome your return, Your Majesty.

273
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,900
You welcome me?

274
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,910
I know your true feelings, you tramp.

275
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,810
And yet you lie without even blinking.

276
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,170
You eagerly waited for me to freeze to death in the Cold Palace.

277
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,970
You think I don't know that?

278
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,810
You dare to smile?

279
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,810
Then, should I cry?

280
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:45,460
You are pouring oil on my fiery temperament.

281
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,410
- Head Eunuch Dok Man.
- Yes, Your Majesty?

282
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:54,070
I will call an assembly in the afternoon, so prepare for it.

283
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,190
Yes, I understand.

284
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,790
You will experience my return quite severely.

285
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,440
Assembly? Who dares to call an assembly?

286
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,240
Her Majesty...

287
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,330
wants to deal with the concubines.

288
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,810
They say you can't break one's habits.

289
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,890
She is causing trouble as soon as she returns from the Cold Palace?

290
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,010
Lady Ki.

291
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,440
Yes, Your Highness.

292
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,510
You take charge of today's assembly.

293
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,180
Your Highness, how can I...

294
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,050
I have all the empress's seals.

295
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:43,530
I will briefly give that authority to you.

296
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,000
I am much obliged, Your Highness.

297
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,860
Head Eunuch Dok Man,

298
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,090
tell all the concubines and their maids

299
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,050
that Lady Ki's command is my command.

300
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,550
I understand, Your Highness.

301
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,570
You are the empress during this assembly.

302
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,230
That Danashiri is nothing but a shell with no authority;

303
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,750
make sure to show that to everyone clearly.

304
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,190
Yes, Your Highness.

305
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,860
In 15 days, a large hunting tournament will be organized by our kingdom.

306
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,940
Does anyone know the meaning behind this tournament?

307
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,890
I've heard that it is to wish for the safety of our kingdom and a good harvest this year.

308
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:32,520
We will sacrifice the animals that were hunted to the heavens, I've heard.

309
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,710
Everyone has done well in your studies.

310
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:40,500
Not only the civil and military functionaries, but we concubines will participate as well.

311
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,460
So everyone prepare well, please.

312
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,240
- Yes, Lady Ki.
- Yes, Lady Ki.

313
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,840
What do you all think you are doing?

314
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,530
I just asked you, what are you doing?

315
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,520
I was conducting the assembly.

316
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,940
How dare you act like the empress now? You've really gone mad, haven't you?

317
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,940
Undress Lady Ki and get her down on her knees now.

318
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,320
Have you wenches all lost your hearing?

319
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,290
I told you to pull Lady Ki down on her knees!

320
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,710
Can't you hear Her Majesty speaking to you?

321
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:27,040
Are you disobeying my command right now?

322
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,350
Everyone,

323
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,800
turn around.

324
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:45,040
How dare you? Won't you turn back around right now?

325
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,090
Head Eunuch Dok Man.

326
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,030
You tell me, what is going on?

327
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,260
- Empress Dowager—
- With the Empress Seals she took from you,

328
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,220
she gave me all of her authority.

329
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,780
Please leave now.

330
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,570
I cannot. Why should I leave here?

331
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:19,280
Everyone, turn back around.

332
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,970
If you will not leave,

333
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,190
I will command the servants to kick you out of here.

334
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,970
Must you experience such a disgrace?

335
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,430
Your Majesty, don't be too upset, please.

336
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,400
The day you retrieve the seals—

337
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,140
Your Majesty?

338
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,760
Are you all right?

339
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,890
I am fine.

340
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,960
Of course, I am fine.

341
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,370
That wench will be gone soon.

342
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,000
So this is nothing.

343
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,350
You should attend the hunting tournament.

344
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,270
Do you need my hunting skills?

345
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,400
There will be a fun sight to see.

346
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,230
Because I plan on catching a very grand animal, you see.

347
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,560
If you mean a tiger, I've caught a few myself.

348
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,590
Not all tigers are the same. You must catch the big one.

349
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,250
A tremendous one, so big no one can ever imagine it.

350
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,210
Big tiger?

351
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:55,240
Are there such large tigers in the hunting grounds?

352
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,070
Only tigers? There is a fox with nine tails, too.
(T/N: Fox spirit who shapeshifts as a beautiful woman.)

353
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:06,810
Fox with nine tails? I've never heard of that before.

354
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,480
On the last day of the hunting tournament,

355
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,370
we will kill the emperor and the Ki wench.

356
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,200
General, is this a plot for treason?

357
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,240
Be careful of what you say. What do you mean, treason?

358
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:35,020
It's just hunting. We just happen to be hunting the emperor and the Ki bitch.

359
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,710
If you help us succeed, you will have accomplished a great deed toward helping us crown a new emperor.

360
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,030
Do you know how large your prize will be?

361
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,860
You could have any position you want.

362
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,240
You could even become a minister of this kingdom.

363
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,280
A minister, huh?

364
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,250
This Yeom Byeong Soo will become a minister of Yuan?

365
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,470
Minister of Military and Intelligence... no, wait.

366
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,760
While I'm at it, why not a whole province for myself—

367
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,310
What are you doing?

368
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,030
Oh, you startled me.

369
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,600
How about making some noise while you walk?

370
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,840
Why would I do that? So I could get caught?

371
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,730
Have you heard anything from the empress?

372
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,300
Well,

373
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,180
what do you mean?

374
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,770
At the upcoming hunting tournament—

375
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,850
How could you? There could be trouble.

376
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,580
I've assumed an important mission.

377
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,410
Huh?

378
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:51,820
I will kill the emperor and the Ki wench.

379
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,620
I will pretend I didn't hear that. I did not hear that.

380
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,970
If I finish this task well,

381
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,770
I will be given a high office.

382
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,070
When that happens, I intend to take you as my wife.

383
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,640
How about it? Are you interested?

384
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,900
I am a palace maid. How can I?

385
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,020
A new emperor will be enthroned. Why can I not do it?

386
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,350
How about you and me both

387
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,970
begin living a new life, huh?

388
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,200
This is the letter that the leader of Hawk House sent to El Temür.

389
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,810
What's wrong?

390
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,350
Hawk House is requesting funds from El Temür.

391
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,560
How can that be true? Hawk House must have a lot more money.

392
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,440
Can El Temür have more money than Hawk House?

393
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,120
The guy with more money does the lending. How could it be the other way around?

394
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,470
What is certain is that

395
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,670
El Temür will not collapse if we cut off his source of funds.

396
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,080
El Temür was

397
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,950
never someone we could fight.

398
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,780
I think it's best if we give up.

399
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,980
Is giving up that easy for you to say?

400
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:32,320
Why did my tribe all die?

401
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,110
Because we were foolish and we didn't know how to give up, that's why.

402
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,020
Pick up your sword.

403
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,410
Attack me.

404
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,720
Your wooden sword cannot win over my real sword.

405
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,500
If you don't attack me for real, I will kill you.

406
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,990
Do you want to die by my sword?

407
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,390
Did you say that this was a losing fight?

408
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,970
Do not show your fear.

409
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,850
Even if you don't know the way, you must pretend that you do.

410
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,340
So is that what you did?

411
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,950
Why must you do that?

412
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,100
Because the moment I give up,

413
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,160
I am abandoning my country...

414
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,500
and you are abandoning your tribe.

415
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,560
Even if it's lonely and difficult,

416
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,980
to not give up is courtesy for those who trusted you and followed you.

417
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,940
Your Majesty.

418
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,440
It is time to leave now.

419
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,960
Hold on a moment.

420
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,840
It may be a hunting tournament,

421
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,950
but you are my concubine.

422
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,920
You should look pretty.

423
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,150
There, we are ready now.

424
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:30,250
Have you figured out how to kill that Ki tramp?

425
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:35,680
Don't worry. We will feign a coincidence and make her disappear without a trace.

426
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,030
I dreamed again last night that she was strangling me.

427
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,100
If we don't kill that witch, I will dry up like a twig and die—

428
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,820
Your Majesty, your hunting outfit suits you so well.

429
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,900
Will you participate also, Empress?

430
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,340
How can the official empress not participate in such a big event for our kingdom?

431
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,410
Hunting is not like sightseeing. If you make a mistake—

432
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,840
What kind of family did I come from,

433
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,430
have you forgotten?

434
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,030
We've been a military family for generations, along with our father.

435
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,980
I don't know about anything else, but when it comes to handling weapons,

436
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,060
among all the women in this palace,

437
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,660
I am sure I am the most skilled.

438
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,840
Set up the blockades on this mountain.

439
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,980
Hurry up!

440
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,570
The winning hunter

441
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:01,390
is given a promotion and 10,000 nyangs of gold.

442
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,540
Of course, we should win that prize.

443
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,650
Your Majesty, show off your skills. It's been a while.

444
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,470
Wang Yoo.

445
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,980
It's that evil thing who looks like a dried-up snail.

446
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:20,140
I was looking for you after hearing you were coming.

447
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,970
Did you have a good trip to Goryeo?

448
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,960
Thanks to you.

449
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,150
Belated congratulations on your marriage.

450
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,140
Thank you.

451
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,930
Well...

452
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:35,260
It's been a long time, so how about a cup of tea together in the temporary palace?

453
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,940
Why is Wang Yoo acting that way toward me?

454
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,950
Troubles at home, it seems.

455
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,130
Your Majesty.

456
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,950
Have you been well?

457
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,130
It's been a long time.

458
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,330
Deputy Commander Park.

459
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,390
Deputy Commander Park? Look at his face.

460
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,820
He's Eunuch Park now.

461
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,340
You've gotten younger since you became a eunuch.

462
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,690
I think you could become about 20 years younger, too.

463
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,280
How about it?

464
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,180
Shall I do it for you?

465
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,110
No, thanks. It's fine. It's fine.

466
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:34,730
His Imperial Majesty comes!

467
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,430
Begin the tournament now.

468
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,330
It's a quail. Shoot it.

469
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,570
You got it!

470
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,230
Congratulations.

471
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,070
Congratulations.

472
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,990
Look at that.

473
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,970
Catch it!

474
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,870
This way!

475
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:40,770
How about a horse race? It's been a long time.

476
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:47,400
Whoever reaches that big tree first wins.

477
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,980
What are we betting?

478
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:55,080
The loser fulfills the winner's wish. How about it?

479
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:00,190
If you plan on tricking me like on Daecheong Island, I quit.

480
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,190
Come on.

481
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,840
I am not the same as I was back then.

482
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,930
Your Majesty.

483
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,530
There is a deer.

484
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:19,830
Your Majesty, not that way.

485
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,680
What are you waiting for? Support His Majesty.

486
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,420
Your Majesty!

487
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,460
Your Majesty!

488
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:37,130
♫ On that day the wind was blowing ♫

489
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:45,870
♫ On that day when the weather was so warm, in your arms ♫

490
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:52,000
♫ I was embraced, and my image ♫

491
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,470
♫ remains there, still ♫

492
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:04,610
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

493
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:07,890
♫ That day when we were happy ♫

494
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:12,170
♫ Can't I return to that day? ♫

495
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:20,170
♫ You can return to me at any time ♫

496
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:27,190
♫ Because I will always remain there ♫

497
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:33,300
There are three of you and this one is all you've got?

498
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,620
Don't worry. We will catch more tomorrow.

499
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,630
Their Ladyships...

500
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,640
Just one little rabbit.

501
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,010
- No one is catching much today.
- Yeah.

502
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:50,130
Everyone out of our way!

503
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:53,020
Please move that way.

504
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,800
Please move.

505
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:04,110
Hurry and begin writing.

506
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:08,020
Wang Yoo caught a large boar.

507
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,330
Wang Yoo... large boar.

508
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:20,760
Something is wrong with Wang Yoo. The way he's treating me is so different from before.

509
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,320
How did he treat you before?

510
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,720
I can barely bring myself to say how flirty he was.

511
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,980
Your Majesty, I wasn't going to say this, but...

512
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:38,600
I heard that Wang Yoo has romantic feelings for Lady Ki.

513
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,800
What are you saying?

514
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:45,540
I heard clearly what General Tanqishi said to Captain Yeom.

515
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:47,940
That cannot be true.

516
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,220
If that Ki wench tried to seduce Wang Yoo, that I could believe.

517
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,460
Wait. A concubine dares to associate with an outside man?

518
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,020
But that was in the past.

519
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,480
Is it easy for things to really end for a man and a woman?

520
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:04,110
A four-way meeting would reveal it.

521
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:06,990
I don't think they will agree to such a meeting.

522
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:11,690
I will request His Majesty to bring Lady Ki with him for a discussion.

523
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,700
And you tell Wang Yoo that His Majesty summoned him.

524
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,170
We understand, Your Majesty.

525
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,030
I arranged this gathering,

526
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,060
but everyone seems uncomfortable for some reason.

527
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,480
What is there to be uncomfortable about?

528
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:41,990
Here, accept a cup of wine from me.

529
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,750
Why don't you accept a cup of wine from me, as well?

530
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:57,000
So, take a drink.

531
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:03,190
Why won't you drink that?

532
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,840
Are you afraid you'll get drunk and make a mistake?

533
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,980
What do you mean, a mistake?

534
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,030
Saying things you shouldn't say, for example.

535
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:19,070
I'm just asking because you seem so nervous as if you have something to hide.

536
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,990
It's not as if you don't know Wang Yoo. What reason do you have to refuse a drink?

537
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,910
Isn't that true, Wang Yoo?

538
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,300
Not everyone enjoys wine like you do.

539
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,040
What would I have to hide?

540
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,320
Why don't you drink, Your Majesty?

541
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:51,720
So vulgar...

542
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,950
So wicked...

543
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,900
Please accept a drink from me, Your Majesty.

544
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,600
Lady Ki.

545
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,820
You drink much better than I thought you would.

546
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,130
Could you drink more?

547
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,850
I don't refuse when offered wine.

548
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:48,320
Tomorrow, the emperor's hunting grounds are near Dragon Rock, Yukgong Valley, and Cheon Maru.

549
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,770
Set things up tonight.

550
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:54,440
Then the day we get rid of the emperor and Lady Ki...

551
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,510
It's tomorrow.

552
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:00,940
Tomorrow, on the hunting grounds, the emperor

553
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,350
and Lady Ki will be gotten rid of.

554
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:18,590
What's with those bastards? Where are they going so late at night?

555
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,880
I know, they're going to the mountains.

556
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,160
Let's follow them.

557
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,970
Yes.

558
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,230
That's enough drinking now. You are drunk.

559
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:41,020
Let's be honest, shall we?

560
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,940
Admit that you're worried about Lady Ki.

561
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,990
How can you pretend you're looking out for me?

562
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,410
Oh right, Wang Yoo.

563
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:56,540
I got a letter from your wife, my cousin.

564
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,130
But...

565
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:02,790
you said the woman you love is in Yeongyeong, didn't you?

566
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,470
Empress!

567
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:13,320
I'm sure Lady Ki knows about it.

568
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:17,490
You were, after all, his treasured subordinate.

569
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:23,050
So answer me, who is the woman Wang Yoo loves?

570
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,130
She died.

571
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,930
She died?

572
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,000
I think I answered your question.

573
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,860
I will take my leave now.

574
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,050
Hold on. I'll help her.

575
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,880
I can go by myself.

576
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,130
You drank a lot of wine.

577
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,930
Just lean on me.

578
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:40,820
His gaze was so ardent when he looked at that Ki wench.

579
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,120
Were you thinking about Wang Yoo all this time?

580
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,370
In what way is that tramp prettier than I am?

581
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:51,950
How can you even compare yourself to her? Eyes, nose, mouth...

582
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:56,160
No part of her can be compared to even your elbow.

583
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,250
Then why? His Majesty and Wang Yoo, why do they all belong to that vulgar tribute girl?

584
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:04,320
Why not me? Why?

585
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,630
That is not your fault, Your Majesty.

586
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,330
It's the fault of the men who are blind.

587
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,390
Wang Yoo, he insulted me.

588
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,100
That gaze he gave to me in the past,

589
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,100
I now realize that he was mocking me.

590
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,050
Your Majesty...

591
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,450
I cannot forgive him.

592
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,970
How dare he do this to me?

593
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,940
More than that Ki wench...

594
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,910
Wang Yoo...

595
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,990
I want to kill him more.

596
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,830
Have you sobered up a little?

597
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,030
Yes.

598
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:02,030
Don't pay any attention to the empress. She's just babbling while drunk.

599
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,920
I will return to my quarters now.

600
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,830
Sleep here for tonight.

601
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:26,290
How long will you make me lonely?

602
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:30,040
- Your Majesty...
- How long will you avoid me?

603
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,180
I want you.

604
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:48,900
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

605
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:56,570
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

606
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:04,370
♫ Even if I hurt, even if it was my last moment ♫

607
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:08,640
♫ I wish you'd embrace me in your arms ♫
