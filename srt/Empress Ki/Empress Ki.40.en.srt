1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:14,020
General, do you know who just exited the palace?

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,010
The soldiers just sent word that

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,950
Seung Nyang, that bitch who deserves to be beaten to death, just stepped out of the palace.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,710
Get the soldiers ready.

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,950
Yes, General.

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,040
Your Majesty, we just got word from Yeon Bisoo.

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,360
Chief Imperial Consort Ki is in danger right now.

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,410
Protect Her Highness.

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,050
Who are you?

10
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,370
Who sent you?

11
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,640
Finally. Finally the heavens

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,560
have heard my desperate pleas.

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,930
Tanqishi.

14
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,810
I will make sure to spray your blood and flesh on the graves

15
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,160
of my father, Danashiri, and Talahai.

16
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,630
That's what I want to say to you, my mother's murderer.

17
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,000
Today, my mother's blood-soaked grudge

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,300
will be avenged by me.

19
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,430
Your Highness, we will take care of this. Please escape now.

20
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,490
That bitch is mine.

21
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,750
No one move.

22
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:04,710
It is my eternal regret that I didn't kill you back when I first dragged you here as a tribute.

23
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,490
All right.

24
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,030
Then try killing me now.

25
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,030
All right.

26
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,820
I shall kill you mercilessly.

27
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,650
Retreat.

28
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,280
Chief Imperial Consort Ki is in danger.

29
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,710
Let's leave. Wang Yoo...

30
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,550
Your Majesty!

31
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,190
Are you hurt anywhere?

32
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,520
I'm fine.

33
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
Hurry.

34
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,990
After them!

35
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,770
You bastards.

36
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,150
Come to your senses, please.

37
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,380
General.

38
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,090
You must stay awake, General.

39
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,880
Come to your senses, General.

40
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,170
We better get out of here first.

41
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,880
Yes.

42
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,760
You lost Tanqishi?

43
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,810
We searched all the spots Yeon Bisoo told us about but he wasn't anywhere.

44
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,700
As long as he's in the capital, he's like a rat in a jar.

45
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,630
Tell the detached forces to search thoroughly.

46
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

47
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,950
How is the search for the secret fund going?

48
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,540
It's not at the tin mines.

49
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,650
It's not there?

50
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,360
I think it was a decoy to fool others.

51
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,440
Seeing that Tanqishi is in Yeongyeong, we are not mistaken about that.

52
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,480
Prime Minister Bayan is stepping up their search as well.

53
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,430
So you don't have any clue about the secret fund?

54
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,780
We heard a strange song in the village near the mines.

55
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,060
A strange song?

56
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,290
♪ Eight, Eight King disappeared, they say. ♪

57
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,590
♪ He took one step to the swallow's house to catch the swallow ♪

58
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,130
♪ but he just pooped and came home ♪

59
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,740
They said the song was passed down for a long time.

60
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,420
And it's a song they sing only at that village. Something is strange about that.

61
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,830
Can you write down the lyrics of that song?

62
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,490
I will write it down for you, Your Highness.

63
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,620
Bayan, my niece, on the night before you entered the palace,

64
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,790
do you remember what I requested of you?

65
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,350
I do remember it.

66
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,020
So, why did I make you the empress?

67
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,350
So I can dominate the imperial family and lend you strength as you create the world you dream of, Uncle.

68
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,790
And what is the world that I dream of?

69
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:13,570
To make the Kingdom of Yuan the strongest in the world, so that all of Heaven and Earth will come into the embrace of the Mongols.

70
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,800
I heard that nothing happened during your wedding night with the emperor.

71
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,580
It appears Chief Imperial Consort Ki's hold over him is stronger than I thought.

72
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,650
Not just the emperor,

73
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,160
but all the authority of the inner court is in the palm of Chief Imperial Consort Ki's hands.

74
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,470
I know that.

75
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,940
First, take over the finance office which funds the imperial family.

76
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,840
I've heard that there isn't much money left after funding the military.

77
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,190
I will fill those coffers.

78
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,070
I understand, Uncle.

79
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:56,040
Your opponent is Chief Imperial Consort Ki who even drove Danashiri out. Can you handle it?

80
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,110
I have already thought of a plan.

81
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,460
"Eight, Eight King..."

82
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,550
"Swallow's house..."

83
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,290
"Eight, eight?"

84
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,030
This life and the afterlife...

85
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,260
What does all this mean?

86
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,140
Rather than a clue about the secret fund,

87
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,920
it just sounds like a lamentation.

88
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,230
Your Highness, Her Majesty the Empress is calling an assembly.

89
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,400
An assembly? Why suddenly?

90
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,050
Do you have something to say to me?

91
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,770
What is the reason for your interest in the secret fund?

92
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,160
Someone invaded my offices by force

93
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,500
and happened to only touch my documents which were related to El Temür's secret fund.

94
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,130
What is your reason to think it was me?

95
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,560
Because no one else would be interested besides you.

96
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,780
Then there is no way you cannot know why I am interested in that.

97
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,220
But I want to hear it from you directly.

98
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,520
I'm still taking care of the finance office affairs.

99
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,000
Since the secret fund belongs in the state coffers, of course I'm interested in it.

100
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,710
If you are interested in my documents, please make an official request for them.

101
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,900
If that's your reason, I am happy to cooperate with you.

102
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,190
I will do so.

103
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,790
It doesn't seem like she has any other intentions.

104
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,680
It's too early to conclude that.

105
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:12,400
She is the one person whose mind I cannot read.

106
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,760
I don't think he's suspected anything yet.

107
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,940
He could even read the heart of a stone Buddha

108
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,150
so always be careful with him.

109
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,270
Yes, Your Highness.

110
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,970
I'm not very particular, so please just observe two things.

111
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,660
To observe good manners, and to not violate what we agreed on during our assemblies.

112
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,070
Do you all understand?

113
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,750
Why don't you respond?

114
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,020
Chief Imperial Consort enters.

115
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,300
We greet you, Chief Imperial Consort.

116
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,280
- We greet you, Chief Imperial Consort.
- We greet you, Chief Imperial Consort.

117
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,860
I'd like to introduce myself. I am Chief Imperial Consort Ki.

118
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,640
I've heard much praise for you, so I was curious to meet you.

119
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,470
And indeed, you appear to be beautiful and clever.

120
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,480
I am not worthy of such praise.

121
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,900
These are not empty words. The reason the other concubines here have not received the emperor's favors,

122
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,080
there was a reason for it.

123
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:41,440
Since you monopolize the emperor's love for yourself, who could interfere?

124
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,170
I hear that you also took charge of this inner court as well.

125
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,190
And you also took care of the finance office well.

126
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,850
I am very blessed

127
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,030
to have someone like you by my side.

128
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,810
Please keep leading the empress's assemblies.

129
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,100
Your... Maje...

130
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,810
That is in violation of the law.

131
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,850
You must do it yourself as Empress—

132
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,510
I am making an earnest request to you.

133
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,320
I'm not confident, so how could I do it?

134
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,500
But Your Majesty...

135
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,790
Have you all heard? From now on, the inner court

136
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,710
will be under Chief Imperial Consort Ki's command.

137
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,520
So, everyone, please cooperate and assist the Chief Imperial Consort.

138
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,260
Your Majesty, why would you make such a decision?

139
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,400
Chief Imperial Consort is bound to run wild even more.

140
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,730
Did you see the way she glowered at me?

141
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,070
She glowered at you?

142
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,280
You didn't see how she silently threatened me.

143
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,480
Threatened you?

144
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,060
It seems none of the concubines and the servants acknowledge me as the empress.

145
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,560
They've all already conspired to turn against me, what else could it mean?

146
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,720
Chief Imperial Consort Ki is more than capable of doing such a thing.

147
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,440
I am afraid of Chief Imperial Consort Ki. I might as well give up being the empress.

148
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,130
I don't have the confidence to fight against Chief Imperial Consort Ki.

149
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,280
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

150
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,370
Your Majesty!

151
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,970
She is so tender-hearted.

152
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,930
This is good.

153
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,990
Good? How?

154
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,260
Go tell Empress Dowager exactly what just happened.

155
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,320
Yes, I understand.

156
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,940
Do you think I don't know that you are doing Empress Dowager's bidding?

157
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,700
When the stork and the clams fight each other, the fisherman benefits.

158
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,610
So have a good fight with that Ki bitch, Empress Dowager.

♪ This world is scarier than the afterworld ♪

163
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,230
♪ This world is scarier than the afterworld ♪

164
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,830
Are you getting any clues?

165
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,940
I will sing it for you again.

166
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,020
Never mind.

167
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,280
I feel like this is wasted effort.

168
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,690
Shouldn't we spend this time looking for the leader of Hawk House, or capture Tanqishi and find out from him—

169
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,770
Why don't we see Yeon Bisoo lately?

170
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:46,470
Once she found out that we're working with Chief Imperial Consort Ki, her attitude has changed.

171
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,340
And Tanqishi?

172
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:53,330
We are turning the capital upside down looking for him, but there is no trace of him at all.

173
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,270
Search everyone, don't miss a single person.

174
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,020
Yes, Sir!

175
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,520
Listen well. He hurt his eye.

176
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,920
Got it?
- Yes, Sir!

177
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,000
Do not let one person pass.

178
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,180
This is a big headache because of Tanqishi.

179
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,730
We should get rid of him and leave this place.

180
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,210
If we don't even have Tanqishi,

181
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,530
then we will never find the secret fund.

182
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:49,030
Would the Hawk House Leader help Tanqishi, when he is useless now?

183
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:54,740
It's one or the other, they will abandon him or take him in.

184
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,860
It doesn't hurt to wait and see.

185
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,030
What?

186
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,590
The leader is here?

187
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,790
He gave special permission for you to meet him, so follow quietly.

188
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,710
She is Chief Yeon Bisoo.

189
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,360
It is a great honor to meet you, Leader.

190
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:15,840
Tanqishi is looking for the secret fund that El Temür hid.

191
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,400
We are asking if Leader knows where it is.

192
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,760
He said he does not know.

193
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,350
Then, how would you like to take care of Tanqishi?

194
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,990
If you command us to, we will get rid of him.

195
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,750
[Live]

196
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,930
He said to let him live.

197
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,620
We understand, Leader.

198
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,500
It hurts so much. I can't stand it.

199
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,340
Please endure it, General.

200
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,370
The leader of Hawk House.

201
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,430
We haven't heard from him yet?

202
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,890
We will hear from him today.

203
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,700
We are about to leave for battle now.

204
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,120
Once you return, I will tell you where I hid the secret fund.

205
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,010
From now on, you are in command of the fund and the military.

206
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,460
Father...

207
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,850
You will become Prime Minister of this kingdom.

208
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,350
Do you trust me?

209
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,330
I have never not trusted my son.

210
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,530
You are the first born of our clan, aren't you?

211
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,880
If I don't trust you, who will?

212
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,770
Father.

213
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,020
You can go now.

214
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,660
Kill El Temür's daughter!

215
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,240
Kill El Temür's daughter! Kill her!

216
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,810
Kill her!

217
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,390
Kill El Temur's daughter!

218
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,600
Sister, please forgive your brother for failing you.

219
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,610
I'm sorry.

220
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,320
Father...

221
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,590
Brother...

222
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,430
Where are you?

223
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,380
I am scared.

224
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,400
Seung Nyang...

225
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,670
It wouldn't be enough to kill her. But she took one of my eyes, too.

226
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:45,190
This bitterness... this hell...

227
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:50,860
hurts more than pulling out an eyeball...

228
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,540
General.

229
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,010
I can't believe this. Now she won't come near my chambers?

230
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,500
Of course, I did make a big deal saying I would make her the empress,

231
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,180
and I failed to keep that promise.

232
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,830
Is Golta outside?

233
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,670
Golta?

234
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,070
Are you looking for us?

235
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,400
Where is Golta?

236
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,300
He said he had something to do, so he will be a little late.

237
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,130
Your Majesty.

238
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,810
I've come.

239
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,610
My elderly mother is ill.

240
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,250
This boy, I've been too easy on you lately.

241
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,190
Looks like you've gotten much lazier.

242
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,220
Lazy? Absolutely not, Your Majesty.

243
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,460
Prepare a shadow play.

244
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,640
Yes?

245
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,260
Why suddenly a shadow play?

246
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,340
After thinking about it, Chief Imperial Consort must be sadder than me.

247
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,050
I must make her happy.

248
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:30,250
Your Majesty, you've done all you can for her already.

249
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,660
This is the time to show her your dignity as the emperor—

250
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,550
Just do what I tell you. What's with all this nagging?

251
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:43,090
I just wanted to help you with your frustrations—

252
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,190
Golta.

253
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,310
I will do what you told me to do.

255
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:18,160
No matter how much we look over El Temür's asset records, there is no clue regarding "Eight, Eight King."

256
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,780
There could be a code that we don't know.

257
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,410
Please look it over again.

258
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,550
Your Highness, Empress Dowager is on her way here.

259
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,730
Welcome, Your Highness.

260
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,920
What do I value most in the inner court?

261
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,450
You regard law and procedure—

262
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:54,900
Since you know that so well, how can you cast out the empress and try to take over the assemblies?

263
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,090
Is that what the empress told you?

264
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,490
And if she did?

265
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,890
Will you summon her and punish her or something?

266
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,220
You seem to be misunderstanding something, Empress Dowager.

267
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,990
I—

268
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,980
You've become Chief Imperial Consort and now occupy Heungdeok Palace.

269
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,230
Even children know that you are quite grand.

270
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,780
So what misunderstanding could I have?

271
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:31,110
I will give the authority I gave you previously to the empress.

272
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,340
So turn over the ledgers and seal for the finance office.

273
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,760
Please bring them to her.

274
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,020
You will now obey the empress's commands

275
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,790
and loyally follow her orders. Got it?

276
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,710
Yes, Your Highness.

277
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,770
I will do so.

278
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,630
Looks like the empress's tricks worked.

279
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,430
Seeing how skilled she is at acting innocent and stabbing you in the back,

280
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,170
She is not to be taken lightly.

281
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,860
Right now, I don't have time to pay attention to the likes of her.

282
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,680
But you lost the control of the finance office.

283
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,140
Who cares about an empty storage room?

284
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,020
Give her the finance office, which is nothing but a shell.

285
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:42,880
And I will keep the real funds in my secret room.

286
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,800
Your Highness? Eunuch Baek has come.

287
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,880
Ask him in.

288
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,310
What brings you here?

289
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:59,780
His Majesty asks you to attend a shadow play.

290
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,100
Tell him I cannot, as I do not feel well.

291
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,500
He went through a lot to prepare this.

292
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,280
Please make your decision with care.

293
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,430
I think it will be best for you to agree to go.

294
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,630
I was just visiting with Empress Dowager.

295
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:42,690
I didn't mean it, but it seems you've had some trouble because of me. So my heart is heavy.

296
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,640
I'm all right, so please don't worry.

297
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,810
My judgment of you was correct, you are indeed someone with a very open mind.

298
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,370
I knew it with one look at you.

299
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,840
So here you were.

300
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,600
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

301
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,570
I was afraid you might not come, so I came to get you.

302
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,070
I was on my way.

303
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,200
Um, Your Majesty?

304
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,900
It's all prepared now, so let's go.

305
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,600
Is something happening today?

306
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,020
It's not for you to know, Empress.

307
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,150
Her Majesty the Empress will enjoy the shadow play, too. Please ask her to come.

308
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,130
Your Majesty, I also enjoy shadow plays—

309
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,160
I've prepared it especially for you, Yang.

310
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:53,030
I will ask them to perform it twice. So you can watch it after we're done.

311
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,500
If you are angry or envious, you lose.

312
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,730
The truth is that I don't enjoy shadow plays.

313
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,230
Is that so?

314
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:21,100
That is good to hear—

315
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,150
I'm tired, I better take a nap.

316
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,630
Whether her character is benevolent or dumb,

317
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,230
I just can't figure it out.

318
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,730
If it was the previous empress, fire and lightning would strike.

319
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,340
Our Majesty the former Empress...

320
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:49,040
Let's see how long His Majesty coddles that Ki bitch.

321
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,470
I've got my eye on you.

322
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,830
What are you so deep in thought about?

323
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,970
It's nothing.

324
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,980
Do you have some worry that you can't tell me about?

325
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,880
It's starting.

326
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,840
Eight, Eight King... swallow's nest...

327
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,830
This life and the afterworld...

328
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,370
Those are not words of a simple song.

329
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,100
But what does it mean?

330
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,400
Many people are looking.

331
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,770
Please just look ahead.

332
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,650
I enjoy looking at your face more than the shadow play.

333
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,110
Your Majesty...

334
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,240
Concentrate on the play. I will concentrate on you.

335
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,660
They gather then scatter, and their shapes change.

336
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,090
Then they scatter and gather again

337
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,000
and form yet another shape.

338
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,370
This is it.

339
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:53,980
The secret of the Eight, Eight King song. This is it.

340
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,380
We still don't know the location of the secret fund?

341
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,810
We are trying to track Hawk House, but they cannot be detected, so it's hard to find.

342
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,370
Jadan, capture El Temür's soldiers.

343
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,140
They will know the location of the secret fund.

344
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,290
Yes, Prime Minister.

345
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,080
Where is His Majesty right now?

346
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,110
I heard that he watched a shadow play with Chief Imperial Consort Ki.

347
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:43,130
Looks like he has not escaped the grasp of Chief Imperial Consort Ki yet.

348
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,210
Request a private meeting with him at the imperial palace right now.

349
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,810
Yes, Sir.

350
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,060
Toqto'a,

351
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,590
time has come for me to take up arms to realize my long-held dream.

352
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,590
Is it this boring for you to spend time with me?

353
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,200
We watched a shadow play together, ate together, and drank tea together.

354
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,020
But during all of that, I was never in your mind, not even once.

355
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,640
Am I a phantom to you right now?

356
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,440
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

357
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,530
I'm not feeling well, so I better return to my chambers.

358
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,860
Do you dislike me now?

359
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,220
If not, are you still angry because you didn't become the empress?

360
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,640
It's not like that.

361
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:52,440
If not, then at least tell me what's going on.

362
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,630
Your Majesty!

363
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,850
Prime Minister is requesting a private meeting with you.

364
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,460
You can leave now.

365
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,850
Your Majesty...

366
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,950
Where did he ask to see me?

367
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,480
At the imperial palace.

368
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,410
Why did you ask to see me?

369
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,260
I, Bayan, dare to offer you advice.

370
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,850
So tell me.

371
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:13,180
I would like to support you to become a greater emperor than

372
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,100
Genghis Khan or Kublai Khan.

373
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,290
How can I be compared to them?

374
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,990
Your Majesty, El Temür is watching us in the afterworld.

375
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,280
Please leave the Chief Imperial Consort Ki's skirts and become the grand emperor you were meant to be.

376
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,360
- Skirts? Your words are excessive.
- Your Majesty.

377
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,820
Your attitude right now is no different from El Temür.

378
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,120
Please recognize my sincerity.

379
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:49,650
My long-held dream is to conquer Ilkhanate and Chagatai Khanate for you
(Ilkhanate - present-day Iran / Chagatai Khanate - Tibet and northern part of India)

380
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,350
and to annex Goryeo into our kingdom.

381
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,410
Do you mean a war for conquest?

382
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

383
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,320
A war for conquest would require an enormous amount of funds for the military.

384
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,610
Our people are starving right outside the walls of the capital. How can you justify such a thing?

385
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:15,760
El Temür had an enormous secret fund that he gathered for his personal use.

386
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,870
I did not aspire to become Prime Minister for my personal riches and comfort.

387
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:27,490
I will give my life to you, a son of the heavens.

388
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:36,450
I will raise up the dignity and glory of our Great Kingdom to the world once again.

389
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,810
Please allow me to do this for you.

390
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,730
Please see this Bayan's sincerity, Your Majesty.

391
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,330
Prime Minister, you are truly a loyal subject and warrior of this kingdom.

392
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:06,500
I am an emperor of many flaws, but I am with you all the way.

393
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,440
And I swear it to the gods of Heaven and Earth.

394
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,070
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty!

395
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,720
What is Prime Minister Bayan's plan?

396
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:38,290
If the secret fund falls into Bayan's hands, Goryeo will be in danger.

397
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,600
Your Highness, what do you mean?

398
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,170
Bring me the writing implements.

399
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,040
Yes, Your Highness.

400
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,440
Eight, Eight King...
(T/N: she combines the characters for 'eight' and 'king' - 八 + 王)

401
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,770
Isn't that the character 'jeon?' (全)

402
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,850
Eight, Eight King, so there is one more "eight."

403
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,760
(T/N: she adds "eight" - 八, upside down)

404
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,940
That is the character for "gold," Your Highness. (金)

405
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,470
Your Highness, the location of El Temür's secret fund...

406
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:54,290
We found where the secret fund is, but it won't be easy to retrieve it.

407
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,810
I heard that a branch leader of Hawk House is among Wang Yoo's subordinates.

408
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,580
Do you know about that person?

409
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,980
She is a woman.

410
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,630
- A woman?
- Yes.

411
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:10,230
Her name is Yeon Bisoo. She helped Wang Yoo many times before.

412
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,460
Your Highness.

413
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,730
I am Yeon Bisoo.

414
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,730
Thank you for coming when I asked to see you.

415
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,390
Please tell me the reason you wanted to see me.

416
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,490
Sir.

417
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,580
She is waiting inside.

418
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,360
I asked to see her.

419
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,960
Did anyone follow you on your way here?

420
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,740
You don't have to worry about that.

421
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,960
But you urgently asked to see me—

422
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,200
Yes, I found out the location of the secret fund.

423
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,140
Where is it?

424
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:56,940
As you suspected, the secret was hidden in the Eight, Eight King song.

425
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,970
So what is written there?

426
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,440
Imagine that the secret fund was hidden here?

427
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,730
It's like "layers and layers below a mountain."

428
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,120
Prime Minister intends to find this secret fund

429
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,000
for a war conquest.

430
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,500
He also intends to annex Goryeo into Yuan.

431
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,490
What?

432
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,820
He may be Prime Minister

433
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,490
but he can't do that without the emperor's consent.

434
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,020
But...

435
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,790
His Majesty is in agreement.

436
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,300
Then we must make sure they do not find it.

437
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,800
But...

438
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,650
why did you ask to see Yeon Bisoo?

439
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,650
That you and I are working together,

440
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,710
I heard that she was opposed to it.

441
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,930
Of course, I would be.

442
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,310
My share will be smaller.

443
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,470
Why include someone who doesn't deserve it?

444
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,170
She discovered the hidden code of the secret fund.

445
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,940
Is that enough for her to deserve it?

446
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Chief Imperial Consort figured that out.

447
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,710
She is pretty amazing.

448
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,020
So, where is the secret fund?

449
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,590
Please tell me.

450
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,700
If you're curious,

451
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,440
you should study your letters, too.

452
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:09,050
You guys are so mean. A bandit like me only needs strong fists.

453
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,960
Is Seung Nyang that person?

454
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,940
You told me before

455
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,050
that you had someone you longed for.

456
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,940
It's so long ago

457
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,480
that I forgot it all.

458
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,450
Your gaze didn't seem as if you forgot about her.

459
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,280
At the hunting grounds—

460
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,170
It's late,

461
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,610
so you should turn in and rest.

462
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,280
Bring Prime Minister here.

463
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,330
If you want to know where El Temür's secret fund is

464
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:28,670
come to Mansu-jang about two hours later.

465
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,600
But you must come alone.

466
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:38,770
I will go.

467
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:42,040
He knows what my face looks like, so I must go.

468
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,460
But we don't know who this could be.

469
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,810
- If he is after your life—
- Then this arrow would have aimed for my neck.

470
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:51,680
So don't worry, Toqto'a.

471
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,460
It's right to betray Wang Yoo, but if the leader of Hawk House finds out that you betrayed him—

472
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,280
Don't worry.

473
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,800
I have a plan.

474
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,550
Please leave your sword with me.

475
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,230
I am Yeon Bisoo of Hawk House.

476
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,900
You seem familiar to me.

477
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,850
Have you seen me before?

478
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,580
I've seen you many times, here and there.

479
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,160
If you know the location of the secret fund,

480
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,290
- you shouldn't have a reason to tell me.
- Prime Minister,

481
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,650
I want to negotiate with you.

482
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,880
So, what is it that you want?

483
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,160
All of Hawk House.

484
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,760
I want to possess all of it.

485
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,370
First,

486
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,720
please get rid of the Yeongyeong Branch of Hawk House.

487
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,230
- Is that all?
- After that,

488
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,250
all the goods used in the imperial palace

489
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,830
please give my merchant association the exclusive rights to supply them.

490
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,540
Please provide a written agreement that confirms that.

491
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,750
And the agreement must have the imperial seal on it.

492
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,710
Where is the secret fund?

493
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:39,100
If you provide the two things I requested,

494
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,330
then I will tell you.

495
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:46,610
How can I trust that you are telling the truth?

496
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,120
Even if it wasn't you,

497
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:55,350
there are plenty of people in the palace trying to get the secret fund.

498
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,320
I can give you the agreement with the imperial seal on it,

499
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:05,140
but it's not easy to infiltrate the Yeongyeong Branch of Hawk House.

500
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,110
This document

501
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:13,250
contains everything about Hawk House.

502
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,250
In one of the locations written in here,

503
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:22,180
that is where Tanqishi will be hiding.

504
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,670
Once the Hawk House branch collapses

505
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:31,030
and you bring me the agreement with the imperial seal,

506
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:34,690
then I will tell you the location of the secret fund.

507
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,740
You've come, Prime Minister?

508
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,660
Prime Minister.

509
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,500
Prime Minister, why do you come without notice?

510
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,680
Chief Imperial Consort, can you excuse us?

511
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,970
Look here, Prime Minister.

512
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:12,600
- I am spending time with Chief Imperial Consort after a long while—
- This is an urgent and important matter.

513
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,980
I will excuse myself.

514
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,050
- Please take the imperial prince.
- Yes, Your Highness.

515
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:31,070
Thank you, Your Highness, Chief Imperial Consort.

516
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,760
It won't take long,

517
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,430
so please wait outside for just a bit.

518
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:50,580
What is the matter?

519
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,040
Someone who claims to know where El Temür's secret fund is, contacted me.

520
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,290
Everyone...

521
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,340
leave now.

522
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,860
Your Highness.

523
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,940
I told you to leave now.

524
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:25,250
Her name is Yeon Bisoo.

525
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,440
She wants Yeongyeong Branch of Hawk House destroyed

526
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,530
and to exclusively supply the imperial palace with goods. Those were her conditions for negotiation.

527
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:35,400
Are you certain about her information?

528
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,280
Yeon Bisoo has approached Bayan.

529
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:52,080
Please let Wang Yoo know immediately.

530
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,640
Yes, Your Highness.

531
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,460
What is going on? You said it was urgent.

532
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,310
How would I know? They won't tell me because I don't know how to read.

533
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,900
I'm so sad I could die.

534
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,390
Yes, it's a sad thing to be ignorant.

535
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,700
Do people learn for no reason?

536
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,940
Thank you for coming.

537
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:26,050
But what is the matter

538
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,420
that you asked me to run here so quickly?

539
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,150
You will know when you come in.

540
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:33,790
It's a good thing, right? You are smiling.

541
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,710
What is this?

542
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,710
Open it.

543
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,150
Wow.

544
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,320
These boxes are full of money?

545
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,560
- How much money is this?
- No need to be surprised.

546
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,240
- They're all counterfeit.
- Counterfeit? Fake money?

547
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,910
We stole them before from Hawk House in Liaoyang.

548
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:07,230
So what will you do with these?

549
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:10,590
Bring these to the tin mines.

550
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,190
Huh?

551
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:18,000
Why bother bringing them to the mines when they are useless?

552
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,150
Don't ask me.

553
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,680
I'm illiterate, so I know nothing.

554
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,740
Your Majesty, Chief Imperial Consort sent a message.

555
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:32,220
Yeon Bisoo told Bayan about the location of the secret fund.

556
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:37,060
What? Yeon Bisoo has betrayed us?

557
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,070
- Moo Song.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

558
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:44,010
Take Jeom Bak and our men and capture the Hawk House members.

559
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,810
Yes, Sir.

560
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,610
Let's go.

561
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:51,270
I will kill this girl with one blow.

562
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,090
What is going on? I just got here.

563
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,360
Yeon Bisoo betrayed us?

564
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:21,260
Who are you?

565
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,910
Who are you to dare do this to us?

566
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,570
You bastards!

567
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,330
You're a Hawk House member.

568
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,510
This bastard.

569
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,260
Who are you?

570
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,570
Take that!

571
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,810
Drag everyone away.

572
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:23,390
What brings you here?

573
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,050
Tanqishi was seen in the capital.

574
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,420
He was receiving protection from Hawk House.

575
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:33,470
I just commanded my men to catch him.

576
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,020
How did you find that out?

577
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,460
My subordinate found out the information.

578
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,710
[Junan Province - Kim Dongmin
Henan Province - Song Ha Young, Lee Da Young
Yunhe Province - Choi Chun Ho, Song Dae Won
Gansu Province - Kim Ji Sung , Choi Won Il
Jinzhou Province - Lee Nam Rye, Kim Nam Hyun]

579
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,620
It's the same as what you received, Prime Minister.

580
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:51,820
We were about to leave to catch them as well.

581
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,970
Thanks to you, our work has become easier.

582
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:58,390
I will get the agreement with the imperial seal. You take care of Hawk House.

583
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,080
Yes, I understand.

584
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:27,670
The capital gates are already closed.

585
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:30,680
We will have to wait until dawn until we can leave.

586
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,820
What is going on at Hawk House right now?

587
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,600
Isn't it obvious?

588
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,790
They're being punished for hiding a traitor.

589
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,780
What? Traitor?

590
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:46,390
How dare you say that?

591
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,310
What? Am I wrong?

592
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,770
- This is all because of you.
- This bastard...

593
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,830
General, please calm down.

594
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,080
Hide.

595
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,400
Over there, isn't that Yeon Bisoo?

596
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,240
Something is wrong.

597
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,340
All the Hawk House members have been caught. Why is she safe?

598
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:20,080
Stay here. I will follow her.

599
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,950
I will go, too.

600
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,130
Here is the agreement you wanted.

601
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,200
[Agreement: From today onwards, the merchant association will be responsible for the Yuan dynasty’s goods, and will also be the only merchant association with this authority.]

602
00:54:55,390 --> 00:55:00,000
Now only your merchant association can supply the imperial palace with goods.

603
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:05,020
If the leader of Hawk House finds out I betrayed him,

604
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,840
I will not avoid death.

605
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,420
I will keep your secret, so you can tell me without worry.

606
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,880
Where is El Temür's secret fund?

607
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,950
Tin mines?

608
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:32,680
Yes. In the town by the mines, there is a forge that extracts the tin.

609
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:36,150
F... Forge...

610
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,350
The secret fund is inside the storage room of that forge.

611
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,790
Forge...

612
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,430
Forge?

613
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,360
What?

614
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:56,360
The secret fund is at the tin-mining town?

615
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,000
It was "darkest beneath the lamp."

616
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,270
We didn't see the gold that was right below our noses.

617
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,270
We only looked in the mines.

618
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,460
We never imagined it could be in the mining town.

619
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:13,770
We must get to it first before Bayan finds it.

620
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,710
Hurry and find out how we can leave the capital.

621
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,350
Yes, General.

622
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:37,670
It's not at the forge, you said?

623
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:42,190
So the secret fund is elsewhere?

624
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:54,580
This plan depends on you acting like a traitor.

625
00:56:54,580 --> 00:57:04,200
In exchange for sharing the secret fund with you, Yeongyeong Branch of Hawk House is destroyed and I get exclusive rights to supply the Imperial Palace.

626
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,200
That's not a bad deal for me.

627
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,000
Will you accept my terms?

628
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,370
Your Highness.

629
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:20,630
So then... ?

630
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,180
The secret fund...

631
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,670
is here.

632
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:50,010
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

633
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:53,300
♫ That day when we were happy ♫

634
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:57,610
♫ Can't I return to that day? ♫

635
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:04,740
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫
