1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,920
I still had hoped you, ruffian that you are, would be different.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,290
But to just be a dog of King Simyang's,

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,130
you dared to approach me?!

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,010
Where is the place you arranged to meet the Yuan merchants?

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,870
Why are you treating us this way when we are all salt thieves?

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,530
You stole our salt, isn't that enough?

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,220
Who are you calling a salt thief?

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,320
This person is...

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,490
an auditor from the Office of Auditing.

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,880
If you answer my question, you shall be spared.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,110
But if you do not, your head will immediately be decapitated.

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,890
Kill me then.

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,200
What?

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,040
You said I'd be spared if I answer?

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,340
Did you think I'd believe you?

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,680
Kill me. Hurry up and kill me!

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,810
- Do you think I wouldn't be able to kill you if you ask for it?
- Spare him!

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,250
Our leader has done no wrong.

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,370
He smuggles salt because of us.

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,360
With the money we receive from salt deliveries,

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,170
we redeem our sisters who were sold off to Yuan.

22
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,820
So please, do not kill our leader.

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,750
Hang this ruffian outside and do not grant him even a sip of water.

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,060
Yes.

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,850
Please come inside, Your Royal Highness.

26
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,410
What happened that Seung Nyang was caught?

27
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,000
The crown prince knows our plans as if they were on the palm of his own hand! (in detail).

28
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,880
The only ones who know the location of the exchange are just me and Seung Nyang.

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,730
It has been clearly revealed the traitor is Seung Nyang.

30
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,590
No, that can't be true. He grew up under my knee.
 (T/N: From my tutelage)

31
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,660
If I tell him to die, he would at least play dead.

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,230
Then, if it's not him, who exactly would it be?

33
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,300
Whether Seung Nyang has betrayed me or not

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,840
will be confirmed if it is tested.

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,730
A test?

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,250
This guy is a spy for King Simyang?

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,550
Look at your appearance.

38
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,690
Since you're going to give up the secrets, don't waste both our energy and easily tell them.

39
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,630
If you die like this, won't your death be worth no more than a dogged one? (T/N: worthless)

40
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,100
He's not the spy.

41
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,200
Ah... this brat is totally stubborn! Aren't you?

42
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,130
I can't beat him to death either!

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,590
King Simyang is

44
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,730
worrying about you.

45
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,410
He's the spy.

46
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,280
Eliminate him.

47
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,660
It is the command of King Simyang.

48
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,760
Come.

49
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,900
Everyone, leave.

50
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,800
Would you like some tea?

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,150
It has cooled sufficiently.

52
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,890
Have a sip.

53
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,280
Keep it.

54
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,230
For someone who said you'd reclaim your sisters sold off to Yuan,

55
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,670
you're helping King Simyang, the source of the tributary girl problem?

56
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:28,010
I received the command of the crown prince to reveal the wrongs of those officials leaning on Yuan.

57
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,560
If you tell me the location of the exchange, even now,

58
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,310
I will not ask you all for a reckoning of your crimes.

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,980
Now, how is...

60
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,360
Shh!

61
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,800
There's a spy for King Simyang in this camp.

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,780
Who is it?

63
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,910
We must first catch him.

64
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,870
Tell them to hang me back up on the cross beam.

65
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,660
Hit me once.

66
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,660
Is anyone outside?

67
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,560
You jerk!

68
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,960
Hang him outside once again!

69
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,260
I will execute him in the morning.

70
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,090
I understand.

71
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,040
Come.

72
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,070
Are you all right?

73
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,420
Something terrible was about to happen.

74
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,050
It says that Seung Nyang will soon be executed.

75
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,250
I cannot let that child die like that.

76
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,550
Tell Seung Nyang to reveal the location of the exchange.

77
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,500
Your Royal Highness, what do you plan on doing?

78
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,110
You must move the troops.

79
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,300
- Your Royal Highness!
- If it is the official guards and not my private militia,

80
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,380
even the spy probably won't catch their notice.

81
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,180
I understand Your Royal Highness.

82
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,270
But even if it's not Seung Nyang, then who is the crown prince's spy?

83
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,790
It shall soon be revealed.

84
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,860
I will be sure to get to the bottom of this. Surely.

85
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,930
His Royal Highness said to let him know the location of the exchange.

86
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,470
There will be soldiers hidden there in ambush.

87
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,820
If you just let them know the location of the exchange, your work is finished.

88
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,760
What about the Yuan merchants there?

89
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,690
We hid them at a tavern called Haewoljang in Byeokrando.
(Blue Fast River Crossing; a pier)

90
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,240
If we succeed this time, His Royal Highness

91
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,720
shall give us a great prize. So work hard.

92
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,870
Th-That... That...

93
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,230
The spy has finally revealed himself!

94
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,670
I will go and immediately kill that thorn in our eye.

95
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,900
You cannot kill him yet.

96
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,730
Pardon?

97
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,690
You will tell me the location of the exchange?

98
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,800
Before that, you must promise me something.

99
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,090
Tell me.

100
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,640
Release all my subordinates and do not call for them to account for their crimes.

101
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,880
I shall. Tell me. Where is the exchange location?

102
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,630
There is an abandoned village near Byeokrando.

103
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,930
An abandoned village?

104
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,100
If you leave now, you should be able to reach there by tomorrow at the hour of the rabbit. (T/N: Modern time 5:00-7:00 a.m.)

105
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,410
He's a hoodlum that tried to kill you, Cooperative Elder.

106
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,290
Do not believe all of what this brat says.

107
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,970
If you take me along and find it is false, you can kill me right there.

108
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,970
I shall divide my troops into two.

109
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,460
Jeom Bak, pick ten agile men.

110
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,390
Understood.

111
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,150
You remain here and monitor this brat's subordinates.

112
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,280
Will it be suitable with just that troop number?

113
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,390
Our opponents are Yuan merchants.

114
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,830
If we have too many men, we will catch their notice.

115
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,010
There is no time. Hurry.

116
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,670
Sheesh, you son of a bitch.

117
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,560
You must be careful!

118
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,630
Go.

119
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,510
You betrayed us!

120
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,890
You shut up, you son of a bitch!

121
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,820
You dare betray us!

122
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,920
There is a tavern called Haewoljang in Byeokrando.

123
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,000
Hurry and catch those Yuan merchant hoodlums.

124
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,660
What's your reason?

125
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,500
Giving information to the Royal Office of Auditing

126
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,470
and helping me while putting your life at risk?

127
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,930
I only did what I had to.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,250
Will you stay by my side?

129
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,980
Help me while staying by my side. Then...

130
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,050
I don't want to.

131
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,520
Seung Nyang!

132
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,300
What secret message did you write?

133
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,440
It's a plan to take them down without lifting a finger.

134
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,410
What? Deploy more men?

135
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,630
The crown prince is gathering up other gangs in the area.

136
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,110
With the number of soldiers we currently have lying in ambush, we could lose.

137
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,190
Take all the private militia we brought and head there.

138
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,530
- You must arrive before the crown prince.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

139
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,780
- Let's go.
- Yes, Sir!

140
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,040
Hurry!

141
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,520
Hurry!

142
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,550
- We have no time! Hurry up!
- Yes!

143
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,290
Isn't it strange for it to be so quiet?

144
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,600
- Find out where they are.
- Yes, Sir.

145
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,380
The crown prince is already here!

146
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,120
Fight! Fight!

147
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:11,750
They're salt thieves! Don't leave any one of them alive!

148
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,710
Don't let any of them live!

149
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,240
Everything is... going the way you imagined.

150
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,490
Then I'll take my leave.

151
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,490
No.

152
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,130
Let me ask for one more favor.

153
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:01,230
It will be dangerous, but there's something I would like for you to bring me.

154
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,200
- Seung Nyang, what happened?
- It was total annihilation.

155
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,730
Everyone died!

156
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,620
What do you mean annihilation? How could that happen?

157
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,270
Mak Son,

158
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,780
he was the traitor.

159
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,190
- Mak Son?
- The Royal Office of Auditing is headed this way.

160
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,130
You have to destroy the account books first.

161
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,240
Mak Son...

162
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,340
that bastard!

163
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,320
Seung Nyang...

164
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,900
How did you come back alive?

165
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,930
Please kill me.

166
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,320
Even if I died, I wanted to die by your hands, Your Highness.

167
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,250
Burn them.

168
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,960
We can't leave anything behind.

169
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,520
Yes, Your Highness.

170
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,990
Please escape before the Royal Auditors get here.

171
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,320
Escape?

172
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,430
You're telling me, King Simyang, to run away?!

173
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,530
Your Highness.

174
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,060
I will go to the palace.

175
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,520
Tell all the Royal Ministers to come to the royal palace now.

176
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,500
I have to gather all the soldiers alive and prevent the crown prince from entering the palace.

177
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,620
Even if they all die, we need to buy time!

178
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,770
Yes, Your Highness.

179
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,210
Crown Prince.

180
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,240
Crown Prince!

181
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,860
I am King Simyang!

182
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,620
I will not die like this.

183
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,030
I will never!

184
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,020
Whoa!

185
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,240
Did you bring them?

186
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,540
What happened to the traders from Yuan?

187
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,370
They're being rounded up and brought here.

188
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,630
(Account books)

189
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,450
Seung Nyang,

190
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,900
you've done a great thing for the nation.

191
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,420
Is there anything you want?

192
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,280
There will be a big reward over this. Tell me anything you want.

193
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,760
By chance... does the Royal Office of Auditing find people, too?

194
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,210
Who? Is there someone you're searching for?

195
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,220
No.

196
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,850
Never mind.

197
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,290
This is disrespectful.

198
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,770
Your Majesty, the crown prince

199
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,190
has passed away.

200
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,380
How in the world?

201
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,900
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean he has passed away?

202
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,500
He was smuggling salt and fought with the soldiers who were regulating it.

203
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,440
Oh my...

204
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,530
- Your Majesty.
- There's no way.

205
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,440
The crown prince is dead?

206
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,410
The royal ministers are all at the royal palace requesting your presence.

207
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,310
You must reestablish the dignity of the royal family at once.

208
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:06,170
This can't be. How could this happen to the crown prince?

209
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,600
Your Majesty, please hand over the throne to King Simyang.

210
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,180
I cannot see you in pain any longer.

211
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,010
Crown Prince...

212
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,400
Crown Prince...

213
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,470
Stand your ground! Soon

214
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,810
King Simyang will become the King of Goryeo.

215
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,860
That bastard, what did he just say?

216
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,550
Abdication. My father, the king, intends to abdicate his throne to King Simyang.

217
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,710
We must get to the palace!

218
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,200
Make way!

219
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,730
Let's go!

220
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,990
Your Highness, due to the crown prince's virtueless actions,

221
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,470
the dignity of the palace and your governors have fallen to the ground!

222
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:43,180
If our people find out, there will be turmoil.

223
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:49,770
The only way to avert this crisis is to hand over the throne to King Simyang!

224
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,230
Your Majesty, please understand our meaning!

225
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,180
Please understand our meaning, Your Majesty!

226
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,590
Listen well.

227
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,330
At this moment,

228
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,790
I plan on giving up my sovereign authority as king.

229
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:17,390
From now on, the one who will rule over Goryeo... after me is—

230
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,190
How did that happen?

231
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,410
Why are you all so surprised?

232
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,520
Did you see a ghost?

233
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,790
Crown Prince! You were alive?

234
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,940
I apologize for making you worry, Father.

235
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:54,640
King Simyang told you I died while smuggling salt, didn't he?

236
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,530
The one who stole the salt and illegally traded it with Yuan,

237
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:04,180
and who tried to kill me while setting me up... why don't you tell everyone, King Simyang?

238
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,330
What are you talking about?

239
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:12,420
The one who illegally traded in salt wasn't me,

240
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,340
it was King Simyang! You!

241
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,590
Do you have proof?

242
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,830
If you do, let's see it.

243
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,390
If you wait a little,

244
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,470
the traders from Yuan will arrive.

245
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,850
Your Majesty, with proof that he doesn't have,

246
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,940
he's trifling with me.

247
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,430
Please immediately proclaim your abdication.

248
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,810
- Please proclaim your abdication!
- Please proclaim your abdication!

249
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,470
Please proclaim your abdication, Your Majesty!

250
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,610
We have the proof right here.

251
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,580
What is an official doing in the royal palace?

252
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,920
Do you know what these are?

253
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,670
They're the records of the salt smuggling trade that King Simyang himself has done.

254
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,570
Was it you, Seung Nyang?!

255
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,950
Goryeo's salt is more precious than gold to the Imperial Family of Yuan.

256
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,860
If they find out about this, we will no longer have their protection.

257
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,460
Tell me what this is all about.

258
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,680
Why can't you tell me?

259
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,600
Is the crown prince right?

260
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,930
Yes.

261
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,630
I did it.

262
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,440
Do you know what I did with all that money?

263
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,830
In place of the incompetent crown prince, to preserve His Majesty's throne,

264
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,780
I spent the money on the Imperial Family of Yuan.

265
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,010
Call it high treason, if you must.

266
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,220
So as the law requires, please take this Wang Go's head.

267
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,990
What did you say?

268
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,930
Even as I violated the law, I did not hesitate for a moment.

269
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,270
Because I believed that my actions were correct.

270
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,800
So please order for my head to be decapitated, Your Majesty.

271
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,180
Please, also, behead me, Prime Minister Tae Pyeong Rok!

272
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,940
Please, behead me first, Minister Kim Yeong!

273
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,370
Please, behead me first, Minister Park Hak Ki!

274
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,000
Please, also, behead me!

275
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,760
Please, also, behead me, Your Majesty!

276
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,390
I will proclaim my abdication.

277
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,970
The crown prince will now... be the ruler of Goryeo.

278
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,340
He is the king now.

279
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,610
In addition, in my last moment on the royal throne,

280
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:25,310
I will pardon King Simyang's error.

281
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,770
Royal Father!

282
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,890
We cannot allow public opinion to become divided.

283
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,140
Please abide by my will, Crown Prince.

284
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,580
I give you my thanks and congratulations, Your Majesty.

285
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,840
Thanks and congratulations, Your Majesty!

286
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,830
Was it Seung Nyang? King Simyang's ledgers.

287
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,510
Did Seung Nyang bring the ledgers?

288
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,710
Indeed, he did.

289
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,410
Where is he right now?

290
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,130
I believe he went to Inju.
(T/N: Current day Incheon)

291
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,020
Seung Nyang probably still believes that I am a Royal Secret Inspector, doesn't he?

292
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,640
It appears so.

293
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,380
Bring him to me. I will keep him by my side.

294
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,810
Nyang is dead, you say?

295
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:36,060
A palace maid, who was dragged away with Ok Bun, sent this letter from the Yuan Kingdom.

296
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,260
It says that she died over 10 years ago.

297
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,800
So that's what happened.

298
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,950
Commander,

299
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,650
this is a report from the merchants.

300
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,960
Commander?

301
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,530
It says that there is a recent increase in bandits.

302
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,290
These scoundrels.

303
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,570
Seung Nyang's gang?

304
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,110
They usually operate among the peddlers.

305
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,080
So, investigate this Seung Nyang gang and bring them in if necessary.

306
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,730
Yes, Sir.

307
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,450
What's wrong with Commander?

308
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,260
Boss, run away!

309
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,340
Boss, get away!

310
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,350
Out of the way.

311
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,240
So you are Seung Nyang, huh?

312
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,200
What are you doing?

313
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,880
Our commander ordered us to capture bandits like you.

314
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,400
So, who is Seung Nyang?

315
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,430
This guy, Sir.

316
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,590
Do you understand your crimes?

317
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,970
Please tell us

318
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,540
why you arrested us.

319
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,320
Five!

320
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,000
Six!

321
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,380
Seven!

322
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,680
Eight!

323
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,180
- Nine! 
- My goodness.

324
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,350
Just as the rumors say, this Seung Nyang is a real vicious one.

325
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,540
Let him be as vicious as he wants.

326
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,070
As long as I, Yeom Byeong Soo, serves in this law enforcement office,

327
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,030
I will make sure that we pull all these ruffians out by the roots in Inju.

328
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,800
Follow me.

329
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,470
Yes!

330
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:10,230
Do you understand what you did wrong now?

331
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,360
I do.

332
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,530
Then say it with your own mouth.

333
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:22,800
The crime of having been born poor.

334
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,380
The crime of having been born a citizen of a weak nation

335
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,280
and protecting myself without help from anyone.

336
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,560
The crime of having met a wicked commander of law enforcement.

337
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,450
Wh-What...? You shut your mouth.

338
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,310
Let him go.

339
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,200
Commander?

340
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,970
The next time I catch you, it won't end with just a beating.

341
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,690
What's wrong?

342
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:08,620
They hid their daughters to prevent them from being offered as tribute. (T/N: To be maids and concubines)

343
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,060
Are you doing this with the commander's permission?

344
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,560
Chief, our office has won disfavor with headquarters.

345
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,580
If we keep coddling these kinds of people, we will be in trouble, too, not only the commander.

346
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,690
But why did you bring them out?

347
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,200
Where did you get this?

348
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,950
From the home of that wicked commander.

349
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,780
How dare you? I said stealing is not allowed.

350
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,230
I'm sorry, Boss. I was upset at having been beaten.

351
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,170
All you guys, leave.

352
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,930
Ki Ja Oh.

353
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,010
Your father...

354
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,020
is alive.

355
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,640
Go to Gaegyeong...

356
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,570
He has the last name Ki

357
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:03,610
and the same exact ring.

358
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,690
Mother, don't die!

359
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,150
Mother!

360
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,510
Father...

361
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,110
It's me, Nyang.

362
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,600
Father...

363
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,510
It's me, Father...

364
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,380
Father...

365
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,590
For five days starting today, there will be a rigorous test.

366
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,970
Those who can pass the test

367
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,210
will join the ranks of our honorable law enforcement force.

368
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,200
Show us your vigor to your heart's content.

369
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,110
Commander? That guy...

370
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,570
Commander, we found ourselves a good one.

371
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,530
Congratulations, boy.

372
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,010
I will have you serve as a messenger.

373
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,800
You must not let this out of your sight for even a moment.

374
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,550
Thank you, Commander.

375
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,630
A messenger?

376
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,060
You're giving this boy a position already?

377
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:15,310
Based on his skills, he could even serve in a higher position. Isn't that right?

378
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,180
Yes, that's what we should do.

379
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,840
His Majesty is entering.

380
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,700
Your Majesty.

381
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,770
Our thanks and congratulations on your ascension to the royal throne.

382
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:56,660
Our thanks and congratulations, Your Majesty!

383
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,700
Please lift your cup to toast in celebration.

384
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,460
Everyone is waiting.

385
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,010
Before the toast, I will proclaim 11 Articles of Prohibition.

386
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,820
Your Majesty, did you say 11 Articles of Prohibition?

387
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,880
So, what do you intend to prohibit?

388
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,750
Present them.

389
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,160
"Hear ye, hear ye, all civil and military officials. I will create a strong Goryeo

390
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,980
so these are the 11 things that must be avoided by all nobles and all other citizens.

391
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,410
There will be no more corruption in money transactions.

392
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:39,750
Any assets of nobles that are increased through corruption must be returned to the state.

393
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:46,380
Private armies will be decreased by half and if you refuse, you will be considered a traitor.

394
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,760
The law that allows for political positions to be inherited by sons will be eliminated."

395
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,650
Your Majesty, what exactly are you doing?

396
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,500
Please retract these 11 prohibitions immediately!

397
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,660
They are unjustified!

398
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,070
- They are unjustified!
- They are unjustified!

399
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,470
Everyone, shut your mouths!

400
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,410
While I spent time with those bandits,

401
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,110
I learned all about your wickedness and corruption.

402
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:34,370
The prime minister gave the county magistrate positions in exchange for bribes.

403
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:42,300
Also, Minister Kim Yeong made the daughter of a middle-class home his mistress and then killed her husband.

404
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,400
Minister Park Hak Ki profited from manipulating the currency.

405
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,420
The Minister of the Military protected soldiers who embezzled arms and collected profit as well.

406
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:00,520
Judges at all three levels of the courts and the governor-general as well,

407
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:07,130
all your evil deeds and corruption are contained in here!

408
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,930
That is unfair, Your Majesty. I'd rather that you kill me!

409
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,550
What did you say?

410
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,590
Then I shall.

411
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,410
So I dare anyone else to ask to be killed.

412
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:31,690
I will behead you myself.

413
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,270
So heed my words.

414
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:42,620
As long as I have this record of your corruption and wickedness in my hands,

415
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:48,790
I will reveal your crime at any time and you will be punished by the national law.

416
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,290
What happened? Have we received word from Yuan?

417
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,830
Prime Minister El Temür sent a personally handwritten letter.

418
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:07,010
Prime Minister El Temür personally wrote a letter?

419
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,220
What is written there?

420
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:25,310
The Emperor of Yuan's brother has been exiled to Goryeo.

421
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,970
But how is that good news?

422
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,730
A way for us to drag that arrogant bastard off the throne.

423
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,610
It's in here.

424
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:06,410
Your Majesty, the law enforcement commander is prepared to meet you.

425
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,660
Not together?

426
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,740
I am Ki Ja Oh, the law enforcement commander.

427
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:26,920
In a short while, the Emperor of Yuan's brother will arrive in Inju.

428
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,020
The Emperor of Yuan's brother, did you say?

429
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,390
Please escort him and bring him to Gaegyeong.

430
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,090
If by any chance there is any harm to the brother of the Emperor of Yuan,

431
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,260
those who are responsible will not avoid execution.

432
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,190
I accept your royal command, Your Majesty.

433
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,040
The exile boat carrying the brother of the emperor will arrive soon in Inju in Goryeo.

434
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,700
Did you say it was Myobang Mountain?

435
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,620
Yes, it is a mountain between Inju and Gaegyeong.

436
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,280
Myobang Mountain, huh?

437
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,730
So the brother of the emperor

438
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,860
will be buried there, huh?

439
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,370
They are expected to arrive in three days... no, in two days if they are fast.

440
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,910
If the brother of the emperor dies on Goryeo's soil, for that crime,

441
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,030
I can make the nation of Goryeo disappear completely.

442
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:55,670
To get rid of the prince, who is a thorn in our eye, and to also put an end to Goryeo as well,

443
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,730
your marvelous planning ability is endless, Father.

444
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,550
What kind of nation is Goryeo?

445
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,240
While occupying such a small piece of land,

446
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,400
they are a toxic people who have tormented us for 30 years.

447
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,500
If we leave them alone, they will surely become a great danger to our nation of Yuan.

448
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,320
Your words are wise, Father.

449
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:19,110
The idiot brother of the emperor,

450
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,770
as it turns out, his life has value after all.

451
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:42,100
Gosh, can you believe we are here to greet some exile from Yuan?

452
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,910
I know, right? There are so many ports, why did they have to come to the one in our jurisdiction?

453
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,850
You said he was the brother of the emperor?

454
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,510
The emperor's older brother, I hear.

455
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,250
What kind of a loser is he that he would be exiled from such a position of privilege?

456
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,050
Let's go.

457
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,790
Your Highness, are you uncomfortable?

458
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,050
Are you General Bayan?
 (T/N: Bayan of the Merkid Clan)

459
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,360
Yes, I am Bayan.

460
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:39,760
I am Commander Ki Ja Oh of Inju's law enforcement. You've come a long way.

461
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,610
Law enforcement, huh?

462
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:46,560
The brother of the emperor is coming and they dared to only send local law enforcement?

463
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,000
Lead the way.

464
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,650
Yes, Sir.

465
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,140
Let's go.

466
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:57,410
Stop. Everyone stop.

467
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,660
Tonight, this is where we will stay.

468
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,400
We will stay here tonight.

469
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Prepare the camp.

470
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,050
Lord Jang?

471
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:21,290
The sun is still in the middle of the sky and we have a long way to go. Why stop here?

472
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:25,470
His Highness says that he is uncomfortable with traveling any farther.

473
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,630
How weak he is. What has he done on the way here, anyway?

474
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,990
Something feels off.

475
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,550
What do you mean?

476
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:41,850
Remember how he refused to get off the boat yesterday, saying he was in pain?

477
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,570
Perhaps he senses something?

478
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,860
There's no way.

479
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:54,430
If he was smart enough to figure that out, would he have gotten himself exiled, instead of succeeding the emperor's reign?

480
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,940
If you go farther down that way, our government office is there.

481
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,980
I think it would be better to host the prince there.

482
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,140
There's no need.

483
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:11,530
Since you've entered onto Goryeo land, we in Goryeo must be responsible for His Highness's comfort and safety.

484
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,230
Feel free to take responsibility. We will make the decisions.

485
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,060
It is strange that they insist on camping outside here when the government office is so nearby.

486
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:27,710
I've heard that among the Yuan soldiers, there is no one who knows the face of the brother of the emperor.

487
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,730
Is that true?

488
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,350
I heard it directly.

489
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,970
We must stay alert now.

490
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:40,350
If there is any harm to the prince, none of us will survive.

491
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,760
This is Myobang Mountain.

492
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,360
If we leave tomorrow morning, we will arrive there before sundown.

493
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,550
What about the band of robbers?

494
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,440
They're already waiting there.

495
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,880
I should not have accepted this assignment.

496
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,020
How can anyone disobey the order of Prime Minister El Temür?

497
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,420
Our late emperor was so good to me.

498
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,650
Imagine that I have to kill one of his children with my own hands.

499
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,420
Even if it's not here, as long as he has won disfavor with Prime Minister El Temür,

500
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,140
the prince will not live out his full lifespan.

501
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,740
General Bayan, are you inside?

502
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,030
What are you doing here?

503
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:33,270
I think it will be difficult for us to begin traveling tomorrow morning.

504
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,620
What do you mean?

505
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,850
His Highness's illness is worrisome.

506
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:37,720
Look here, Lord Jang...

507
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,080
I will go and check his pulse myself.

508
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,270
Will it be too difficult for you to move?

509
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:55,030
My insides are rumbling and my head is spinning.

510
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:59,470
I just cannot ride in that carriage.

511
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,420
Are you kidding me?

512
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:11,790
General Bayan, I have one request.

513
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,670
Of me?

514
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,430
Go ahead and tell me.

515
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:23,700
My Imperial father came in my dreams last night.

516
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,640
His Majesty did?

517
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:31,730
He told me to ask you, General Bayan, for help, whenever I had any difficulties.

518
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:42,540
So will you heed my request?

519
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:46,210
Please tell us.

520
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,410
I want to eat dried persimmons like crazy.

521
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,130
What?

522
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,330
Dried persimmons?

523
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:04,930
I cannot forget the taste of the dried persimmons from Goryeo that I ate at the imperial palace.

524
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,440
So could you go find me some dried persimmons somewhere?

525
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,430
Your Highness!

526
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,950
We are not here to sightsee.

527
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,830
Please find some for me. If I eat dried persimmons,

528
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:21,780
I will get up and begin traveling again.

529
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,550
I will go to find some.

530
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,430
Will you do that?

531
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,020
Thank you so much.

532
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,970
Make sure they are dried well

533
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:37,080
so they are really chewy, please.

534
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:48,460
Seeing as how his pulse was weak and slow, I don't think that he is faking his illness.

535
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,060
With a brain that seeks dried persimmons at a time like this, how could he figure out what is really going on?

536
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:59,100
Uncle, I don't think we will reach Myobang Mountain by tomorrow night.

537
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,550
So tell the band of robbers that we will arrive a day late.

538
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,260
I understand.

539
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,790
Dried persimmons? He asks for dried persimmons at a time like this?

540
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,710
It's safe to eat.

541
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,980
Please eat.

542
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,260
You eat it all.

543
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,330
You haven't let food touch your lips for several days already.

544
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,330
What if you really get sick—

545
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:42,520
Whatever food is left over, please put it in the chamber pot and throw it away.

546
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,990
What's wrong?

547
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,120
Are you... from Goryeo?

548
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,290
Yes, I am.

549
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,050
My name is Seung Nyang. How about you?

550
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:05,050
I am Kkweo Bo.

551
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:08,590
Kkweo Bo? What a funny name.

552
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,760
Seung Nyang is quite a funny name, too.

553
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,550
I have something to ask you.

554
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,630
Is the prince seriously ill?

555
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,350
Tell me what is going on in the temporary palace.

556
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:31,430
I'd rather not be punished for speaking out of turn.

557
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,860
Please exit to the east tomorrow night.

558
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:45,330
I will prepare a safe place for you and wait.

559
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,140
Then.

560
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:50,440
Wait a minute.

561
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,250
I am afraid.

562
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,690
I am so scared... that I cannot even breathe.

563
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,740
In order to preserve your life, this is the only way.

564
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:32,990
Go to greet him? He was exiled from Yuan.

565
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,500
And you're telling me that I need to go to greet him?

566
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,630
But he is the older brother of the Emperor of Yuan.

567
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:40,690
And he is next in line to succeed the throne.

568
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,290
You must go to greet him. You must observe manners when dealing with a great nation.

569
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:48,530
Before talking about manners to a great nation, first observe your manners to Goryeo.

570
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,780
They are not the vassals of Goryeo.

571
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,150
However, Your Majesty—

572
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,610
Let's hear from you, King Simyang.

573
00:49:54,610 --> 00:50:00,190
Must the King of Goryeo go to greet an exiled barbarian?

574
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:03,330
There is no need for you to do that.

575
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:11,910
He may be a brother of the Emperor of Yuan. But he is foolish and weak-willed beyond compare.

576
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:17,110
You must not carelessly waste your time with him, Your Majesty.

577
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:24,040
Only King Simyang has the capacity to think on the scale that matches mine.

578
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:28,430
If there was a need to behead him, I would take my sword to go see him.

579
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:35,040
But I will not be going to greet him. Everyone be so informed.

580
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,340
What? He dares to compare himself to me?

581
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:51,370
He may soon roll off his royal throne and break his neck. How dare he?

582
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,910
So you will assassinate the brother of the Yuan Emperor as planned—

583
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,860
Watch your mouth!

584
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,860
It won't be long now.

585
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,380
That young boy's arrogance and impudence

586
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,460
will soon be finished, too.

587
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,820
I will go to greet the brother of the emperor. Hurry and prepare the men and my armor.

588
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,790
Your Majesty, what are you saying suddenly?

589
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:25,280
King Simyang opposed my going to greet him. What do you think that means?

590
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,290
So the spy report that was sent from China

591
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:31,160
is true after all?

592
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,030
I am certain.

593
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,250
They exiled the brother of the emperor and will now kill him.

594
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:40,460
And they will accuse Goryeo and make us pay for that crime.

595
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,660
Make us pay for that crime...

596
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,510
They will try to dethrone me since I am a thorn in their eye.

597
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,450
What are you doing? We have no time.

598
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,760
Congratulations. You are finally achieving your goals.

599
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,490
The royal throne must be sat on by a dragon to be worthy.

600
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:05,010
But a common snake is occupying it, does that make sense?

601
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,440
Your words are wise.

602
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,390
Your Highness!

603
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,630
His Majesty just left leading a cavalry.

604
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,620
What are you saying?

605
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:22,250
I don't know but he was wearing his battle armor.

606
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,510
Battle armor?

607
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:26,290
So he left wearing his sword?

608
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,700
Yes, Your Highness.

609
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,910
He's not on his way to behead the brother of the Yuan Emperor, of course.

610
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,860
Perhaps that snake figured out our plan?

611
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,700
But he is already too late.

612
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,530
Unless his horse sprouts wings on its back,

613
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,080
he will not arrive by tonight, no matter what.

614
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,490
Is tonight when it will happen?

615
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,230
He may have shown how clever he is,

616
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,890
but the heavens have chosen this Wang Go.

617
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:02,480
Pitiful boy.

618
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,870
You must get up now.

619
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,940
It's already been two days.

620
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,060
How long will you stay in bed like this?

621
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,510
The dried persimmons have not yet arrived.

622
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,190
How far did Lord Jang go to get some dried persimmons?

623
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:38,480
Until I eat dried permissions, I will not step one foot out of here.

624
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,380
Your Highness, this is not the time to throw a childish fit.

625
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,270
Then bring me some dried persimmons.

626
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:52,480
I want to eat tender and chewy dried persimmons from Goryeo.

627
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:56,210
Oh, seriously.

628
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:09,430
Kkweo Bo, you go and bring me my battle armor right now.

629
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:13,130
- What?
- You must bring it without anyone knowing. Hurry.

630
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,320
Yes, Your Highness.

631
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:28,760
I think we have to change our plans.

632
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,690
Bring the band of robbers here.

633
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,880
Then, the big event...

634
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,630
Tonight. Let's finish this tonight.

635
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,770
I understand, Uncle.

636
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:54,280
That suits you well.

637
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,410
So get into my bed.

638
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:57,610
Your Highness.

639
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:59,860
Hurry. We have no time.

640
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,530
Yes, Your Highness.

641
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,960
Don't move and stay like this until morning.

642
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,900
When the sun rises, change your clothes and run away.

643
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,460
Your Highness...

644
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:10,720
Wha—

645
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,350
Who are you?

646
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,820
I... I am...

647
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,990
♫ Because I’m dangerous, my love ♫

648
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,280
♫ The more you love me ultimately the more
only you may be hurt ♫
