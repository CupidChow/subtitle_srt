1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,860
Greetings, Sire!

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,200
Greetings, Sire!

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,740
Your Majesty, the empress said not to let any—

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,770
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,360
If he could speak and told me to kill you,

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,250
you would have lost your head.

7
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,500
Yangyang? Yangyang!

8
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,310
What? The emperor went over to the library?

9
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,690
Yes, Your Majesty. He's with Lady Ki right now.

10
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,140
What if he brings her out?

11
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,920
Lead the way. I will stop him.

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

13
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,680
Yangyang. Yangyang, are you coming to your senses?

14
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,520
I fainted for a short time.

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,490
Here, get up. Leave with me.

16
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,760
I only have a few more books left to write.

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,480
I'll leave once I'm done.

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,450
You didn't even drink any water for three days.

19
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,330
You could die.

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,200
Yangyang,

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,940
what can I do to help you?

22
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,480
Tell me. I'll do whatever it takes to help—

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,400
What can you do?

24
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,240
Are you going to read the Naehun Doctrines for me? If not,
(T/N: Naehun Doctrines - Confucian morality guide for women)

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,610
will you write it in my stead while I read it out loud?

26
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,900
If it isn't that either, will you get rid of all those people with your authority as the emperor?

27
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,360
Using fear as your excuse, the emperor's image, the one thing you have left to you,

28
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,120
and you're trying to give that up.

29
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:40,160
Now... there's nothing you can do for me.

30
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,590
I also... will not do anything for you.

31
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,370
So...

32
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,370
please leave.

33
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,920
Your Majesty, what are you doing in there?

34
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,770
Lady Ki disobeyed the inner court's regulations and disrespected me.

35
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,600
Punishment is also a valid form of education, why are you getting involved in the inner court's matters?

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,890
You are being utterly unreasonable.

37
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:33,160
Please come outside and keep your dignity as the emperor!

38
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,250
Your Majesty, can you not hear me? Your Majesty!

39
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,000
- Golta.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,860
My intention to throw everything away for Yang's sake seems to have been wrong.

41
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,930
Your Majesty.

42
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,910
I will start studying again tonight.

43
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,230
My Lady!

44
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,100
My Lady!

45
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,070
My Lady Ki!

46
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,150
100 books of Naehun Doctrines have been written.

47
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:06,150
Do you now realize how strict the inner court's regulations are?

48
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:15,060
All of this is due to your immense mercy.

49
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,390
I favor you,

50
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,580
so I will continue to be greatly merciful to you.

51
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,730
So don't you dare challenge my authority again.

52
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,130
Woon-deung-chi-woo... (雲騰致雨)

53
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,390
Woon-deung-chi-woo... (雲騰致雨)

54
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,100
Your Majesty!

55
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Your Majesty, Lady Ki has just returned to her room.

56
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,250
Don't tell Yang that I'm studying.

57
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,840
Why not?

58
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,610
I want to show her that I can do it, too.

59
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,820
I want to make her happier by doing so.

60
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,000
I understand.

61
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,800
But... how long will you act as though you're mute?

62
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,490
When Prime Minister announces my abdication,

63
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,780
I will shout out that I do not permit it.

64
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,280
Yes, Your Majesty. Please do so.

65
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,960
Woon-deung-chi-woo. (雲騰致雨)

66
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,120
Seung Nyang, where are you right now?

67
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,870
I miss you.

68
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,710
You have someone in your heart.

69
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,670
Please flip it over.

70
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,970
You must like her a lot.

71
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,290
But the woman is such a rare and big gem

72
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,260
that you won't be able to hide her wherever you go.

73
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,760
If you wish to be with her,

74
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,540
you must go somewhere far away together.

75
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,630
She's a sham. Let's go.

76
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,580
I'll be right back after finding out what the trouble is.

77
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,030
Until then, please stay safe.

78
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:27,530
♫ Carried on the wind, you are heard ♫

79
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:35,500
♫ Ceaselessly falling Drip Drip Drip ♫

80
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,640
♫ in the sound of the rain for a long time after ♫

81
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:51,560
♫ Even if I wander and am lost, it is you, it is you again  ♫

82
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:59,710
♫ This heart which is sending you away  ♫

83
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:05,910
♫ day by day feels like ♫

84
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,960
♫ it's burning in hell  ♫

85
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,270
I'm back.

86
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,870
Any news on Moo Song?

87
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,110
Eunuch Bang is getting help from the village chief,

88
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,000
so there should be some news soon.

89
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,790
Stop.

90
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
Now tell me.

91
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,660
Who is your master?

92
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,090
You have only

93
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,220
until the end of today.

94
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,020
I will ask again.

95
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,870
Who is your

96
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,760
master?

97
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,410
My master is...

98
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,950
Yes?

99
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,510
Your mother.

100
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,340
This bastard wants to die.

101
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,840
If you don't open your mouth,

102
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,960
you will lose all your flesh before even dying

103
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,570
and be left as a skeleton.

104
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,470
Unless you want to die miserably,

105
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,020
hurry up and tell us.

106
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,150
Who are you?

107
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,940
I guess this isn't the right place.

108
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,850
Where am I supposed to put this dirty water?

109
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,230
- Get out right now!
- Sir!

110
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,090
I am leaving.

111
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,030
Chief! Chief!

112
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,910
Why are you so late, you bum?

113
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,580
Bum or whatever... I need that rice ball.

114
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,850
I didn't eat anything trying to come here and I'm spinning and can't breathe from hunger.

115
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,740
You'd even take food from a slave?

116
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,040
Did you find out?

117
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,590
He's tall and has a big nose, right?

118
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,690
That's him. Did you see him?

119
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,250
He's being

120
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,690
tortured right now.

121
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,130
If you don't save him now, he will die.

122
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,100
Oh, Moo Song...

123
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,980
Our Moo Song...

124
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,210
Hey! Give me that back before you go!

125
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,720
Thinking about it won't help. Let's just blast in there.

126
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,370
Think about Seung Nyang later. We must save Moo Song first.

127
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,790
If we're late, he could die!

128
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,090
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

129
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,050
It's going to be a frontal attack.

130
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,630
We're going to their stronghold.

131
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,340
Right now?

132
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,740
Your Majesty, it's still daylight.

133
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,500
We should wait for at least a little bit of darkness for an ambush.

134
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,440
Even if you kill him 10 times,

135
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,710
he will never open his mouth.

136
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,660
We can kill him at any time,

137
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,840
but I'm most bothered by someone else.

138
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,950
The one who shot the fire arrow.

139
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:36,960
Since the gunpowder exploded inside the wine barrel, it means he's infiltrated our group.

140
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,190
Are you saying there's a traitor in our midst?

141
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,720
If not,

142
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,170
it can't be explained.

143
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,140
My Lord!

144
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,590
There's someone looking for you.

145
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,100
- Who is it?
- Wang Yoo from Goryeo.

146
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,780
Wang Yoo?

147
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,010
I don't know him.

148
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,460
If you don't, I will chase him away.

149
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,600
Wait.

150
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,700
Wang Yoo from Goryeo is...

151
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,370
He was the King of Goryeo who was dethroned.

152
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,220
I've fought against him over the counterfeits.

153
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,380
If he's here, then it means he knows about

154
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,720
what we did in Goryeo.

155
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,510
I'm the one in charge of the group.

156
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,200
You said you're Wang Yoo?

157
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,330
Are you Heuksoo?

158
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,590
I've heard about you already.

159
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,820
But what brings you here?

160
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,530
I came to retrieve my subordinate who is locked up here.

161
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,840
Subordinate?

162
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,780
Then... the one who stole the banknotes is—

163
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,660
You mean counterfeits, not real banknotes.

164
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,030
Wang Yoo.

165
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,090
He's making a mistake.

166
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,870
If you leave him alone, he'll die.

167
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,920
Are you going to save him again?

168
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,620
Showing compassion once was enough.

169
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,900
Jumping into hell in order to save a subordinate...

170
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,230
You're quite magnanimous.

171
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,950
I don't want to speak with you anymore. Give me back my subordinate.

172
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,070
Anyone out there?

173
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,780
Does a king of Goryeo have 10 lives?

174
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,630
Do you think you can kill me?

175
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,040
We make deals over people's lives in this place.

176
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,050
Do you think that I would let live those who

177
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,370
killed my men and stole our counterfeit currency?

178
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,340
You won't be able to kill me.

179
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,230
I guess you can't wait to die.

180
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,490
Kill them all!

181
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,170
Hold on!

182
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,780
Do you know who this is?

183
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,290
- What are you doing? Kill him at once!
- This person is

184
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,630
Prime Minister El Temür's

185
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,880
niece's husband!

186
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,410
What?

187
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,300
- Prime Minister El Temür?
- Just try touching

188
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,990
even a hair on his head, you bastards!

189
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,980
If you do, this place will go up in flames!

190
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,440
Forgive me. I did not recognize you,

191
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,140
Wang Yoo.

192
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,710
You're very quick with your calculations.

193
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,200
- Let him have his man back.
- Yes, sir.

194
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,510
Since the boring introductions have been made,

195
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,050
let's get to the point.

196
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,390
I heard you suffered greatly in the hands of the empress.

197
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,610
I was able to think many thoughts thanks to her.

198
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,340
As long as you are in the palace, the empress's cruel and wicked deeds will continue.

199
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,080
Therefore,

200
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,510
I am thinking about starting the fight this time around.

201
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,600
In Sun Tzu 's Art of War, there's a principle called Itawigwa.
(T/N: Cause your enemy to commit a crime and use it against him)

202
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,360
You're going to make the Empress commit a crime?

203
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,440
I'll make her commit such a grave crime, that as her punishment,

204
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,030
I will take away her empress seal.

205
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,730
The seal is the symbol of the empress's authority and power.

206
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,140
I'm going to make her lose

207
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,990
all of her wicked power.

208
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,840
I don't think a frontal attack is suitable right now.

209
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,150
You should prepare a little bit longer if you want to win.

210
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,630
You can be prepared to fight but not to win.

211
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,760
Fights should be done like Lady Ki wants. When you're in the most infuriated state.

212
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,420
When you truly want to fight, that's when warriors have their deciding matches.

213
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,260
- But Uncle...
- There's nothing in this palace that's not dangerous.

214
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,630
If you've made a declaration of war, you must win.

215
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,590
No excuse will work if you lose.

216
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,480
I also...

217
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,420
will never put an arrow down once I've put it on the bow.

218
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,390
Given Lady Ki's position,

219
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,840
it could put her in great danger.

220
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,190
If I had doubts about her abilities, I wouldn't have chosen her.

221
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,060
Since we've already chosen her, we need to trust her.

222
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,890
Did you see that?

223
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,440
Yang despises me.

224
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,560
How about telling her that you're studying again?

225
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,070
Once I learn all 1,000 characters in the Baeksumun, I will tell her then.

226
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,980
Aren't you being too cold-hearted toward the emperor?

227
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,980
My cold-heartedness will become good medicine to him.

228
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,460
I won't be impatient and I'll wait for him.

229
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,090
My Lady.

230
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,590
All the imperial concubines headed over to the empress's hall.

231
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,990
Why so suddenly?

232
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,210
They're giving gifts to the empress that were sent by their families.

233
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,050
Gifts?

234
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,010
This is silk from Lady Oh.

235
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,850
How beautiful.

236
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,110
I'm glad to hear that it's to your liking.

237
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:44,600
This will make perfect diapers for Maha.

238
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,920
This is from Lady Bu.

239
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,470
A celadon vase.

240
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,110
Celadon vase?

241
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,740
This looks valuable. It would be

242
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,030
perfect for Maha's potty.

243
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:11,100
But... what came over you that you're suddenly giving me these gifts?

244
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,470
To be honest, we have a request to make of you.

245
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,580
Tell me.

246
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,300
The tonic that you give us every morning...

247
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,980
we would like to stop taking it.

248
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,470
Please hear our request, Your Majesty the Empress.

249
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,710
These girls...

250
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,390
How dare you try to gain my favor with this trash?!

251
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,780
Your Majesty, we only wanted to—

252
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,530
I don't need them so take them away!

253
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,970
I think we did a useless thing.

254
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,550
I know. She just became angrier instead.

255
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,360
There's...

256
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,570
one other method.

257
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:09,110
Court Lady Yeon makes the tonic, so if we can win her over and have her switch it...

258
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,010
You're all very naive.

259
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:17,060
Did you think her heart could be moved by a few presents?

260
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,980
We don't need your advice.

261
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,270
I have something to tell you.

262
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,110
I have nothing I need to hear from you.

263
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,420
They seem to think that you stole the emperor from them.

264
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,230
When they gather, they always speak poorly of you.

265
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,990
Watch them carefully.

266
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,800
Yes, My Lady.

267
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,540
Please do me this favor, Court Lady Yeon.

268
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,650
I heard too much of that tonic can cause infertility.

269
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,110
You're the one who's in charge of the tonic.

270
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:38,010
How would the empress know if you changed it to something healthier?

271
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,490
That's true.

272
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:45,490
If you help us, I'll give you another box just like it.

273
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,640
Really?

274
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,270
If the empress finds out, she will be furious.

275
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,080
And she wants me to switch the tonic?

276
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,560
There's no way.

277
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,170
You made a huge mistake.

278
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:39,890
Why... did you decide to bribe a court lady?

279
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:07,030
Court Lady Yeon knows too well whom she should fear.

280
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,240
Switching out the tonic in order to keep her promise with the imperial concubines

281
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:17,740
will never happen since it will also bring about her death.

282
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,180
Court Lady Yeon has already accepted our bribe.

283
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,430
Of course, she wouldn't refuse.

284
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:28,970
Even if it becomes a problem later when it's revealed that the imperial concubines offered her bribes,

285
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,200
she will be greatly rewarded instead.

286
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,390
And none of the imperial concubines will be able to avoid expulsion from the palace.

287
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,780
This is how the palace is.

288
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:49,140
One mistake can cost you everything.

289
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,430
Then... what do you think we should do?

290
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,290
I'm sure you know what we must do.

291
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,540
Please tell me what to do.

292
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,340
What are you doing?

293
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,340
I just told you what you must do.

294
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,940
What do you have there?

295
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,180
Hawk House wishes to gift this to the empress.

296
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,460
Hawk House? Why?

297
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,060
Heuksoo sent over this letter.

298
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:48,380
- What is the letter about?
- He is asking to send some essential items to the inner court.

299
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,130
Seeing how it was sent to the empress and not the empress dowager,

300
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:56,770
they too seem to be very quick at grasping the general currents.

301
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,210
I will take it to the empress.

302
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,220
Yes, Sir.

303
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,000
There are many other merchants in Hawk House. Why Heuksoo?

304
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,100
Heuksoo is the one who sold Lady Ki as a slave.

305
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,190
I think she wants to use this opportunity to take care of him, too.

306
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,620
We don't know how it will play out,

307
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:29,560
but I'm quite looking forward to Lady Ki's plan.

308
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,030
These are all from the countries bordering on the west?

309
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:39,700
Yes. This merchant's reach extends all the way to Ilkhanate.

310
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,840
I can have all these?

311
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,850
The man named Heuksoo who sent these has a very special relationship with Father.

312
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,960
Is that so? That's good.

313
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,370
Your Majesty, there's a problem in the royal concubines' quarters.

314
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,590
What do you mean?

315
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:04,240
The imperial concubines are having a huge fight.

316
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,220
Who is fighting with whom?

317
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,190
Did you just hit me?

318
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,240
You're the one who hit me first!

319
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,290
I'm the daughter of Yunnan Province's Magistrate.

320
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,800
I have a vastly different origin than a mere tribute from Goryeo like you!

321
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,650
You and I are both imperial concubines of the 5th rank.

322
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,510
Is it such a big deal that you met better parents?

323
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,270
This thing! How dare you—

324
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,610
All of you listen up as well.

325
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,800
If you keep mocking me for having been a tribute,

326
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,270
I will break your wrists!

327
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,000
What is all the fuss about?

328
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,090
Are you wenches crazy? How dare you fight in here?

329
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,480
I feel wronged, Your Majesty.

330
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,970
She's the one who started the fight, not—

331
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:15,090
Silence. Just know that

332
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,050
there will be an assembly tonight.

333
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,320
Court Lady Yeon, don't forget to prepare the tonic.

334
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

335
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,600
That wench Ki is going to

336
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,570
refuse the tonic tonight, too.

337
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,370
I really hope she refuses.

338
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,610
Pardon?

339
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:54,920
If she refuses, I'm going to punish her by twisting her limbs and rendering them useless.

340
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,530
She even fought with another concubine,

341
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,390
so there's no better opportunity.

342
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,800
Empress Dowager won't be able to show

343
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,910
favoritism to that wench this time around.

344
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,860
Prepare it well.

345
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,820
She's really something.

346
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,280
Don't let it slide this time.

347
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,470
We must tell our fathers and teach her a lesson.

348
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,640
What are you doing here?

349
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,040
Lady Ki sent over some dried persimmons as an apology for earlier.

350
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,390
We don't need them, so take them away.

351
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,860
If I don't give them to you, I will get in trouble.

352
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,230
That thing!

353
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,810
What good is an apology now? She's so shameless.

354
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:12,360
How can you eat that right now?

355
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,760
I haven't eaten anything today.

356
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,570
Are you still giving that tonic to the imperial concubines?

357
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,590
It's Her Majesty's orders, so...

358
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,050
She's very determined to prevent all pregnancies.

359
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,910
So lacking... Why are you wearing so much makeup?

360
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,790
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

361
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:11,750
Starting today, you're not to draw in your eyebrows.

362
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,530
Why aren't you answering?

363
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,670
We will obey your orders.

364
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,280
How could you fight in front of servants?

365
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,710
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

366
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,770
And you? Why aren't you apologizing for it?

367
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,670
It wasn't my fault.

368
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,790
How arrogant.

369
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,390
Do you think the emperor will protect you inside these walls of the inner court, too?

370
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,800
I've always protected myself.

371
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,420
Is that so?

372
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,860
Then let's see

373
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,690
how well you protect yourself.

374
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,850
Why are you getting nervous?

375
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,810
Take the tonic.

376
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,730
Please don't take it.

377
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,160
The moment you refuse,

378
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,490
you're dead.

379
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,040
I said don't drink it.

380
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,020
Shrewd wench...

381
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,460
Please come to your senses, My Lady!

382
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,810
What's going on?

383
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,810
What happened?

384
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,000
Lady Oh, after drinking the tonic...

385
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,660
If anyone has a silver hairpin, please give it to me.

386
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,240
It's poison.

387
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,030
She's been poisoned!

388
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,810
Poisoned?

389
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,520
What happened, Your Majesty?

390
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,800
There's no way.

391
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,300
Hurry up and call for the physician.

392
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,760
Please help me.

393
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,910
Take Lady Oh's tonic bowl.

394
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,130
I'll get involved in this matter myself.

395
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:31,150
I will have the court lady inspectors carry out a thorough investigation.

396
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,670
What happened?

397
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,680
I asked what happened.

398
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,370
I don't know what happened.

399
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,450
This foolish girl. How were you managing the tonic?

400
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,110
Your Majesty, please be calm.

401
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,880
What? Lady Oh took poisoned tonic?

402
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,630
Yes, Your Majesty. The palace has been turned upside down.

403
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,800
What about Yang? Is she safe?

404
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,830
Lady Oh collapsed before she could take it.

405
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,340
Your Highness!

406
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,670
What is going on?

407
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,910
The empress finally caused a huge problem.

408
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,740
Then... the poison in the tonic was...

409
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,320
Who else would have done it?

410
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,630
You need to go and spread the word.

411
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:41,150
In front of everyone, I will reveal her sins.

412
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,370
Yes, Your Highness.

413
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,320
Father.

414
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,060
Did you do this?

415
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,990
I swear to the heavens, I did not.

416
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:06,180
Court Lady Yeon who manages the tonic said she wasn't aware of it either.

417
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:11,030
You... fell into a trap.

418
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,380
Do you know who could have done it?

419
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,240
Who else would dare do to such a thing?

420
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,100
Empress Dowager?

421
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,940
Yes.

422
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,580
I'm certain it's her.

423
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,470
Father!

424
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,740
All the magistrates have arrived.

425
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,660
They already found out?

426
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,540
So they want a fight, huh?

427
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,770
What should I do, Father?

428
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,420
Please be calm.

429
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,060
There's no proof that you're guilty,

430
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,110
but there is also no proof that you aren't either.

431
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,960
You must be confident until the end.

432
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,940
If you get pushed to the edge, I will get involved.

433
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,570
How is she?

434
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,800
Fortunately, the poison she swallowed is not deadly and she took a very small amount.

435
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,790
But do you know what she ate for her meal?

436
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:40,050
I heard she didn't eat anything all day.

437
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:46,570
Wait. She ate one dried persimmon given to her by Lady Ki.

438
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,210
That's right.

439
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:59,340
No need to worry. It's not life-threatening.

440
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,120
What are you doing here?

441
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,980
Empress Dowager is asking everyone to gather in the Great Hall.

442
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,810
Your Majesty, the captain of the investigators has arrived.

443
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,560
Receive our greetings, Your Majesty.

444
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,940
Everyone is waiting for the result. Proceed.

445
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,710
Can you test the poison with that amount?

446
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,900
It's enough.

447
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,330
Did you get the result?

448
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,660
Yes, Your Highness.

449
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,310
Tell me.

450
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,370
In this tonic...

451
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,670
no poison is present.

452
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:29,070
Are you positive?

453
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:33,820
None of the silver balls have tarnished.

454
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,430
Do you still suspect me?

455
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:48,660
I never said I suspected you.

456
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,650
Of course.

457
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,900
Empress, though this is an inner palace matter,

458
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,570
each of the magistrates has a direct interest in this matter.

459
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,700
You must find the real culprit soon.

460
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,270
I will.

461
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,530
From now on, I will investigate this case.

462
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:23,020
Head Eunuch Dok Man, make sure to control the servants' access to the women's pavilion

463
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,220
and put together a new group of court lady inspectors.

464
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,580
Yes, Empress.

465
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,910
What happened?

466
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,710
It was a great chance to blow away the empress. Just how did you use the poison...

467
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:04,920
Just because the poison is found in the tonic, that doesn't prove it was ordered by the empress.

468
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,580
But we have the item that was sent to the empress under the Hawk House name from before.

469
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,940
Who would dare to search the empress's quarters in this palace?

470
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,910
There's a saying, "Nakjeong ha seok."
(T/N: Dropping one stone - to kick someone when they are down)

471
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,140
We'd have to put her in a well first and then strike her with a stone.

472
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:24,310
Then, what do you have in mind?

473
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,790
I'm going to use the tactic Goyookjigye.
(T/N:To harm oneself to deceive the enemy)

474
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:36,040
Are you saying you are going to sacrifice yourself?

475
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,420
The empress will surely point her finger at me.

476
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,470
If I can be the bait,

477
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:47,000
I can take the empress's seal.

478
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,870
Is that true?

479
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:56,730
Yes, Your Highness. Lady Oh only ate the dried persimmon that Lady Ki gave her that day.

480
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:01,480
Since the tonic didn't have poison, that means the persimmon had the poison.

481
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,420
I am sure of it.

482
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,730
Do you have any of that dried persimmon?

483
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,390
That is...

484
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,650
What's wrong?

485
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:14,390
I heard the palace maids ate what was left.

486
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:16,750
What happened to the palace maids?

487
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,680
They are fine.

488
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,680
What? They are fine?

489
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:28,110
Then the persimmon didn't have the poison either.

490
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,040
Sin is something one commits.

491
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,800
But the sinner can be created.

492
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,510
Pardon?

493
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,880
It's something that my father says.

494
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,420
Isn't it great that the persimmons are gone?

495
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,520
You are saying...

496
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:50,780
I am going to make the Ki wench into the culprit.

497
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:56,690
That day Ki and Lady Oh had a fight.

498
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,020
There are multiple witnesses.

499
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:04,110
She didn't eat anything else other than the persimmon given by Ki.

500
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:07,250
Yet she almost died of a stomach ache.

501
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:11,410
What can be more clear evidence?

502
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:17,710
Yes, Your Highness. Wench Ki is the culprit.

503
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,840
You spread the rumor in the palace.

504
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:27,460
If many people believe it, then the rumor becomes the truth.

505
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,060
Are you saying the persimmon was poisoned?

506
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,210
Where else could it come from?

507
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:45,290
Lady Ki seemed like she'd kill Lady Oh when they were fighting.

508
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,430
I heard they hated each other very much.

509
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,860
But still, how could she poison—

510
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,620
Emperor!

511
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,950
The emperor is very angry right now.

512
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,680
How could you be so careless?

513
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,540
- I am sorry, Your Imperial Majesty!
- I am sorry, Your Imperial Majesty!

514
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,800
At this rate, Yang will become the culprit.

515
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,680
Make sure to keep a close eye on all the goings-on of the palace and report to me everything that happens around Yang.

516
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,530
Yes, Emperor.

517
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:43,050
- I told you it's her!
- She used to be a tribute after all!

518
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,060
So...

519
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,600
what did you want to see me about?

520
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:06,000
Are you aware of the rumors going around the palace?

521
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,160
That you tried to kill Lady Oh.

522
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,760
Don't get bothered about false rumors. I don't listen to them either.

523
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,140
It's not a false rumor.

524
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,460
What do you mean?

525
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,850
The poison that Lady Oh drank,

526
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,230
I made happen.

527
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,650
What are you... telling me right now?

528
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:39,010
I gave it to her. That poison.

529
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:57,410
Your Highness, Lord Jang is here.

530
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,300
Your Highness.

531
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,150
Your Highness?

532
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:25,030
Your Highness the Empress Dowager.

533
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,550
Did something happen with Lady Ki just now?

534
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,260
Why...

535
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,940
Why are you laughing?

536
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,700
Welcome.

537
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,830
Let me introduce you. He is the boss of Hawk House—

538
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,920
I'm Heuksoo.

539
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,400
I'm Yeon Bisoo.

540
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,120
He's a very special guest, so treat him well.

541
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,240
I have the table ready, so please come in.

542
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,990
Show them in.

543
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,890
Is it true that he's working with our faction?

544
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:49,020
Things are becoming strange.

545
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:56,320
About causing grave harm to Goryeo with the counterfeit currency,

546
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,160
I apologize once more.

547
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:04,240
Thanks to you, I am now working with Hawk House.

548
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,810
Our chief is also very happy about that.

549
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,540
When can I meet your chief?

550
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:18,000
You cannot meet him.

551
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:25,570
There's a rumor no one has seen his face, even in Hawk House.

552
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,740
Is that true?

553
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,780
I also have never met him.

554
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,980
Now, let's drink freely tonight.

555
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,770
Boss.

556
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,290
It's Heuksoo.

557
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,960
Let him in.

558
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,370
Are you done with Wang Yoo?

559
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,920
Yes.

560
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,970
Why did you let Wang Yoo into Hawk House?

561
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:24,950
I'll tell you what happened in detail later.

562
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,900
This is a secret order from our chief to you.

563
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:50,780
He wants me to...

564
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:55,000
kill Wang Yoo?

565
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:00,760
He knows too many of our secrets.

566
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,970
It's an obvious order.

567
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,950
I will take my leave.

568
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,120
The light just went out in Wang Yoo's room.

569
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:39,480
Wang Yoo... if ours is an ill-fated relationship,

570
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,200
ending it here is proper.

571
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,830
Don't blame me.

572
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,400
I think she's made up her mind that the Empress Dowager and Lady Ki are the culprits.

573
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,810
Once the morning assembly is over, we'll see who falls.

574
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,610
Once the morning assembly is over, you'll be arrested as the

575
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,330
person who is responsible for the poisoning.

576
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:10,980
Drink it.

577
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:30,750
♫ No matter how much I try to erase them ♫

578
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:34,770
♫ They still appear ♫

579
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:44,210
♫ Those painful memories make our sad love even sadder ♫

580
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:49,450
♫ No matter how I try and try to conceal them, the tears ♫
