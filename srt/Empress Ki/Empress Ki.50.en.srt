1
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,970
Maha, do you know whose son he was?

2
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,750
- Let go of me.
- He was Wang Yoo

3
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,270
and Seung Nyang's child.

4
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,200
That cannot be possible.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,990
Court Lady Seo knows the truth.

6
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,250
For the rest of your life, you will live

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,460
with only the shell of Seung Nyang.

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,270
How pitiful you are.

9
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,950
No! No!

10
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,590
No! No! No!

11
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,170
No...

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,600
Your Majesty!

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,750
Wang Yoo...

14
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,090
Seung Nyang, you...

15
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,040
will be killed by the emperor's own hands.

16
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,550
The emperor

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,190
knows the secret between you and Wang Yoo—

18
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,020
Have you returned?

19
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,340
I want to be alone today, so don't let anyone in.

20
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,860
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,000
I have something to tell you.

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm very tired today.

23
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,100
If this is because of Wang Yoo...

24
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,530
Wang Yoo...

25
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,720
saved our lives.

26
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,940
I will never forget the great deed he did for us.

27
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,490
More than that,

28
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,920
I am so grateful that you are all right.

29
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,090
Go back to your chambers and rest.

30
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,500
Maha...

31
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,860
was Wang Yoo and Yang's child?

32
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,010
No, that can't be true.

33
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,980
That can't be true.

34
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,960
Your Majesty,

35
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,430
has something happened?

36
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,380
I told you that I wanted to be alone.

37
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,730
Your face doesn't look good right now. I will call the doctor—

38
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,120
I told you to leave.

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

40
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,840
Wait, Golta.

41
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,120
Ask around...

42
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,480
and find Court Lady Seo.

43
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,130
- I will bring her right away.
- No.

44
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,280
I will meet her outside the palace.

45
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,500
And no one must know that I am meeting with her, understand?

46
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

47
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,240
If that is true,

48
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,310
then I must prevent anyone from finding out

49
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,810
... no matter what.

50
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,420
Then you, Prime Minister,

51
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,100
you knew that Wang Yoo was alive?

52
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,580
I am...

53
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,270
the one who let him live.

54
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,240
So Wang Yoo's reason

55
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,180
for helping Yuan—
- He wants to regain his throne as King of Goryeo.

56
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,560
He even saved the emperor and you from being killed by Tanqishi.

57
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,380
So based on his good deed and other justifications,

58
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,530
he is worthy of being enthroned again, in my opinion.

59
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,190
Your Majesty,

60
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,630
Court Lady Seo has arrived.

61
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,870
Golta,

62
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,750
you should leave now.

63
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,970
You must not even be nearby.

64
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,130
Go very far away...

65
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,340
and stay there.

66
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,600
I have something I wanted to ask you.

68
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,870
Is Maha really the child born between Wang Yoo and Chief Imperial Consort?

69
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,080
Did you meet General Tanqishi?

70
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,580
Just answer what I asked you.

71
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

72
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,610
That is correct.

73
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,890
Wang Yoo himself only found out recently

74
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,550
and he was very sad about it.

75
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,890
Your Majesty?

76
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,100
So how did Danashiri bring Maha?

77
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,000
Well...

78
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,050
the day Lady Park died,

79
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,410
she found Maha and took him.

80
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,670
Do you know why I returned to this palace?

81
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,430
Having survived alone

82
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,260
felt so shameless.

83
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,870
The people who died because of me

84
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,410
to apologize to them,

85
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,460
that is why I returned.

86
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,750
So that's what happened.

87
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,750
She came back with a broken heart after losing her child.

88
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,850
Your Majesty?

89
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,290
Who knows about this?

90
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,280
You and Tanqishi, Wang Yoo and his subordinates.

91
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,860
Anyone else?

92
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,760
- That is everyone who knows.
- Really?

93
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,670
No one else knows.

94
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,010
I have something to tell you,

95
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,730
so come closer.

96
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,870
Yes.

97
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,070
Closer.

98
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,970
No one must know

99
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,180
about this.

100
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

101
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,750
Even if...

102
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,990
that person is in the afterworld or this world.

103
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,420
Your Majesty?

104
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,450
Why... are you doing this to me...?

105
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,660
Not just you.

106
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,920
Anyone who knows about this,

107
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,640
must all die.

108
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,180
Even if he is Wang Yoo.

109
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,380
Who sent all this?

110
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,440
Everyone leave now.

111
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,490
These gifts...

112
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,210
are from the leader of Hawk House.

113
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,260
Leader of Hawk House?

114
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,010
Why would he?

115
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,500
He also sent you a secret letter.

116
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,770
There is a way we can get rid of

117
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,450
the wicked Chief Imperial Consort from this nation.

118
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,970
If you go to Seoneop Temple, you will find out how.

119
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,400
Your Highness, have you been well?

120
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,330
Are you the leader of Hawk House?

121
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,850
The leader of Hawk House sent me here.

122
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,260
Get to the point. How do we get rid of Chief Imperial Consort?

123
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,430
It's simple.

124
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,590
If you get rid of the emperor,

125
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,860
then Chief Imperial Consort will become a "kite without its string."

126
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,140
Are you suggesting an insurrection?

127
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,740
- Tell me more in detail.
- The late Tanqishi

128
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,610
was thinking about enthroning a new emperor.

129
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,980
Please carry on his plan, Empress Dowager.

130
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,310
A new emperor? Who?

131
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,120
Bolod Temür.

132
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,570
- Bolod Temür?
- Yes, if you will permit us to,

133
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,790
we will take care of persuading him.

134
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,160
His Majesty the Emperor is alive.

135
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,880
So you will commit treason?
- You don't have to worry about the emperor.

136
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,000
Like a wick on a lamp that's burned out,

137
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,030
he will get sick and slowly die.

138
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,650
What does that mean?

139
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,070
Just trust in us. Everything will turn out the way we want,

140
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,950
and the way you want, Empress Dowager.

141
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,960
I brewed this tonic myself after learning a secret method.

142
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,900
Please have some and sleep comfortably.

143
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,690
Golta, the tonic you give me

144
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,130
really works for my body.

145
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,570
Now your mind will become clear and you will sleep well.

146
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,640
At last, you've become addicted to my tonic.

147
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,910
The leader of Hawk House is definitely nearby. We must find out his identity soon.

148
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,690
We have spies in Hawk House. They should find out soon.

149
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,340
Your Majesty! Your Majesty...

150
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,140
You must return to the palace.

151
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,590
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

152
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:13,110
Since you have regained your throne, it's a very good thing.

153
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,610
Your Majesty!

154
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,410
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

155
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,910
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

156
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,650
(Imperial edict saying Wang Yoo is restored to the throne.)

157
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,050
Your Majesty.

158
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,310
Wang Yoo has arrived.

159
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,760
Give this edict to Wang Yoo.

160
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,330
Shall I call an assembly?

161
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,400
The wedding ceremony is tomorrow, so I'd rather not make it complicated.

162
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,480
Why didn't you tell me about Maha's death?

163
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,610
Wang Yoo's plan was to take Maha to Goryeo.

164
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:37,250
Wang Yoo found out that Maha was his son?

165
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,220
Yes.

166
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,690
He told us to not let you feel pain regarding this matter.

167
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:06,040
This is His Majesty's edict permitting your enthronement.

168
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:21,830
Before you return to Goryeo, I request that you promise me one thing.

169
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,870
Please speak.

170
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,770
Please,

171
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,370
never let the people of Goryeo become pitiful like us.

172
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:39,560
I learned the truth after being dragged here.

173
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,140
A nation that cannot protect its own people...

174
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:51,660
A mother country that ignores its people even after sending them away...

175
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,680
how useless and irresponsible that is.

176
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,510
Everything...

177
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,910
is due to my incompetence.

178
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,650
It's not any one person's fault.

179
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:18,720
And restoring a nation that is bent in the wrong direction cannot be accomplished by one person alone.

180
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:27,230
There will always be officials here trying to annex Goryeo into a Yuan state.

181
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:35,500
And there will always be demands for tributes.

182
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,230
I will block them from here.

183
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:48,270
So please make Goryeo strong.

184
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,330
That is the reason I helped restore you to your throne.

185
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,860
Wang Yoo, you are someone who can do this.

186
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,560
I believe in that.

187
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,660
I've returned, Your Majesty.

188
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,330
Did you send my secret letter to the Commander of the Military?

189
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

190
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,190
But why are you mobilizing the military?

191
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,850
When the wedding is over,

192
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,670
I will go and kill Wang Yoo.

193
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,400
You must not let anyone know.

194
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

195
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,960
The King of Goryeo has left Yeongyeong.

196
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,490
Her Imperial Majesty the Empress enters!

197
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,150
10,000 years! 10,000 years!

198
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,700
10,000 years!

199
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,010
10,000 years! 10,000 years!

200
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,340
10,000 years! 10,000 years!

201
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,920
10,000 years!

202
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,540
10,000 years!

203
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,850
10,000 years! 10,000 years!

204
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,820
10,000 years! 10,000 years!

205
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,130
10,000 years! 10,000 years!

206
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,320
10,000 years! 10,000 years!

207
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,770
10,000 years!

208
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,220
Stay outside.

209
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,040
Please calm down, Empress Dowager.

210
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,320
How can I calm down?

211
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,820
That trashy Goryeo bitch finally became empress.

212
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,000
The kingdom is doomed! Even if I vomited blood,

213
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,930
it wouldn't relieve this pit in my stomach!

214
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,920
Your Highness.

215
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,210
Emperor.

216
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,940
You will pay dearly for this.

217
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,450
And don't blame me when it happens.

218
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:30,000
This is all because you let yourself become bewitched by that wicked Goryeo bitch.

219
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,230
You brought this on yourself.

220
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,680
We will go ahead, so please take care of things here.

221
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,130
So when you return to Goryeo,

222
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,620
will Jeom Bak really be the captain of the Royal Guard?

223
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,850
Imagine, an ignoramus former bandit like me will be the captain of the Royal Guard.

224
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,710
I'm a credit to my family name.

225
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,270
What about Moo Song?

226
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:08,130
In Goryeo, he will become the Minister of the Military.

227
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,380
Minister of the Military? So you're the commander?

228
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,350
Yes, that is correct.

229
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,510
You two also finish your work and come back.

230
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

231
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,720
As soon as we find out who leader of Hawk House is, we will tell Chief Imperial Consort...

232
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,670
I mean, Her Majesty the Empress. Then we will return.

233
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,160
You've all worked hard, all this time.

234
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,090
You'll be late, Your Majesty.

235
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:32,360
♫ On that day the wind was blowing ♫

236
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:38,150
I feel like I'm dreaming.

237
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,650
It's not a dream.

238
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,590
You are the official empress of this kingdom now.

239
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,940
♫ And my image remains there, just like that ♫

240
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,530
And I have been waiting

241
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,090
for this day for a long time.

242
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,280
To us two,

243
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,450
it is the happiest day of our lives.

244
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:08,170
Your Majesty.

245
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:16,020
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫

246
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,160
♫ Embrace me in your arms ♫

247
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,230
♫ I stand alone in the darkness ♫

248
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,650
♫ Like a lost child ♫

249
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,370
♫ My heart is frozen with fear ♫

250
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,860
Don't blame me.

251
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,170
This is for your sake.

252
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,130
I must protect you.

253
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:01,150
♫ You can return to me at any time ♫

254
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:07,300
♫ Because I will always remain there ♫

255
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,090
Did you send a message to Liaoyang Province?

256
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

257
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,520
We have no time to lose.

258
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,130
We will ride all night, so be informed.

259
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,210
Yes!

260
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,660
Your Majesty?

261
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,310
Why are you mobilizing the military?

262
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,160
Pretend you didn't see this.

263
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,560
The emperor himself is leading a dispatch of troops. How can I pretend to not know?

264
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,770
Prime Minister!

265
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:48,390
Are you going to kill Wang Yoo?

266
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,860
You must not, Your Majesty.

267
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,680
Out of my way.

268
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,730
You already issued an edict for him to be the king of Goryeo again.

269
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,030
If you kill him—

270
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,490
If I don't kill him,

271
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,550
the empress will die.

272
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,310
What does that mean?

273
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:17,550
Wang Yoo's mouth must be shut for the empress to live.

274
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,890
Please tell me so that I can understand.

275
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:30,060
Just know that this is for the empress's sake, Prime Minister.

276
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,640
We greet the leader.

277
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,620
- We greet the leader.
- We greet the leader.

278
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,470
Wang Yoo, who has been pretending to be the fake Leader, will soon be killed by the emperor.

279
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,130
Are you sure Wang Yoo was the fake leader?

280
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,490
Where could he have gotten so much grain?

281
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:15,830
Wang Yoo dared to steal assets from Hawk House.

282
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:22,130
Since the emperor is taking vengeance for us, that's a good thing.

283
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,960
Hurry and wake up.

284
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,600
This is no time to be sleeping.

285
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,240
Why not?

286
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,090
I got a message from Soori

287
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:41,730
and he said the emperor took his army to kill His Majesty.

288
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:46,460
- Your Majesty!
- We have to go and tell him right now.

289
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,060
Come on.

290
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,740
Star?

291
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,950
Star.

292
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,730
Your Majesty.

293
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,330
Seung Nyang.

294
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,090
Mother.

295
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,820
Father promised to teach me martial arts and go horse riding with me, too.

296
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:41,160
I will take care of my son, who I couldn't care for while I was alive.

297
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,070
Your Majesty.

298
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,220
Do you still blame me?

299
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:04,860
If it wasn't for you, I would not be here.

300
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,780
Now, even if I'm not here,

301
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,460
you can withstand all hardships.

302
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,220
My relationship with you ends here,

303
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,150
but I have no regrets.

304
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:32,410
Because I truly loved you.

305
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,220
These...

306
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,060
are my final words to you.

307
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,680
Why? Why do you say that?

308
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,010
What do you mean, final words?

309
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,350
Your Majesty...

310
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,170
Your Majesty?

311
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,990
Your Majesty!

312
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,220
Your Majesty, Wang Yoo's life is in danger.

313
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,780
Your Majesty, you must not kill Wang Yoo.

314
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,440
Wang Yoo, please get away.

315
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,480
You must leave Yuan.

316
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,070
It seems suspicious that no one is at the gate.

317
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,570
Hey! Open the gate!

318
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:01,040
This man is the king of Goryeo! Open the gate!

319
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,350
Your Majesty.

320
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,630
The emperor.

321
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,210
What are you doing?

322
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,720
You will have to die.

323
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,770
We will have to break through from the front. There is no other way.

324
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:52,880
I will block those soldier bastards.

325
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,220
We will break through together.

326
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,020
Your Majesty, don't worry and just leave it to me.

327
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:04,260
Once Jeom Bak blocks the soldiers, I will clear a path.

328
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,130
I cannot let you two be sacrificed.

329
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:13,610
Your Majesty, you must survive and return.

330
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,670
Don't die. It's a command.

331
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,960
Your Majesty, you took this lowly man

332
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,630
and used me well. I thank you.

333
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,620
Jeom Bak.

334
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,720
Good luck.

335
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,060
Hey, you bastards!

336
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:49,760
I am Jeom Bak, the captain of the Royal Guard of Goryeo!

337
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,710
You just wait, you are all dead!

338
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,880
Jeom Bak!

339
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,680
That's all?

340
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,440
It doesn't hurt at all!

341
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,300
Now is the time! Be prepared, Your Majesty!

342
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,600
I'm the captain of the Royal Guard of Goryeo!

343
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,220
Jeom Bak!

344
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,590
Jeom Bak!!

345
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,490
Mother...

346
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,410
Your Majesty!

347
00:33:59,150 --> 00:33:59,990
Moo Song.

348
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,960
Your Majesty...

349
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,020
Don't die.

350
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,420
You must not die.

351
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,580
I'm sorry.

352
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,970
I couldn't...

353
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,420
protect you...

354
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,670
until the end...

355
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:34,370
Moo Song? Moo Song!

356
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,240
What is your reason for killing me?

357
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,100
I know whose child...

358
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,980
Maha is.

359
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:39,620
If I don't kill you, Yang will die.

360
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:47,600
I must kill you so Yang can live.

361
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,020
Raise your sword.

362
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,490
Just kill me.

363
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,720
Raise your sword

364
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,770
and fight until the end.

365
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:15,170
Seung Nyang saved your life many times.

366
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:20,660
But what have you ever done for her?

367
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,990
Shut your mouth.

368
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,990
You love Seung Nyang?

369
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:33,360
Then kill me and prove it—

370
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,650
And I...

371
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,660
I will die for you.

372
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:57,800
So never hurt Seung Nyang again.

373
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,540
Was that how much you loved her?

374
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,890
Enough to sacrifice your own life?

375
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,620
Was she so important to you?

376
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,750
Even after I die,

377
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:32,630
I will protect her, until the end.

378
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,130
Seung Nyang...

379
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,870
Seung Nyang...

380
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,890
Seung Nyang—

381
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,780
Your Majesty.

382
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,370
How can this happen?

383
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,320
Moo Song.

384
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,170
You pitiful thing.

385
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,420
How can you leave us like this?

386
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,330
How am I supposed to live now?

387
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:55,760
How can you leave us like this, Your Majesty?

388
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:07,400
Your Highness! Your Highness!

389
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,870
We are so embittered, Your Highness.

390
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,780
Your Majesty?

391
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,600
Your Majesty...

392
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:45,690
Anyone who could blame or hate you...

393
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:51,170
including myself, there is no one.

394
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,190
So don't feel sorry

395
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,070
and don't cry,

396
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,670
and just walk on your path confidently.

397
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,150
I will do the same.

398
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,650
I won't look back, I won't feel hurt,

399
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:20,380
and I won't regret. That is how I will walk my path.

400
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:27,490
This is all my fault...

401
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,590
all my fault...

402
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,650
How can this happen to you?

403
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,330
Your Majesty...

404
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,150
Don't linger on your ill fate with me.

405
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:00,480
Please be free now.

406
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,850
Even in your next life...

407
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,260
please don't remember the likes of me.

408
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,130
But I will remember.

409
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:24,250
Even in my next life, and my life after that...

410
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:34,230
for the blessings you gave me, I will continue to repay you.

411
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,670
Your Majesty...

412
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,570
Your Majesty...

413
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,060
Your Majesty!

414
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,410
Please speak with me for a moment.

415
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,980
Please leave us.

416
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,240
Where are you going right now?

417
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,580
I was going to see His Majesty.

418
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,640
Do not go.

419
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,400
What is your reason for stopping me?

420
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,210
I do not want any cracks in your relationship with him.

421
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:49,030
An insurrection will cause the nation to fall into chaos.

422
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:54,370
If you have a conflict with His Majesty, it is tantamount to a schism of the state.

423
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,180
Then I must at least know why he killed Wang Yoo.

424
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:04,090
His Majesty said it was so that you could live.

425
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:07,840
So that I could live?

426
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,100
I want to ask you the same question.

427
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,390
Why must Wang Yoo die so that you can live?

428
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:22,900
Is there a secret that no one must know?

429
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:30,960
Seung Nyang, you will die by the emperor's hands.

430
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:39,030
The emperor knows the secret between you and Wang Yoo—

431
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,770
So His Majesty knows the secret of Maha.

432
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:01,450
If it's difficult, you don't have to say anything.

433
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:05,820
But please know this one thing.

434
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,680
His Majesty did it to protect you.

435
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,210
So please don't make an enemy out of His Majesty.

436
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:23,090
That is my ardent request to you as this nation's Prime Minister.

437
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,020
Why...

438
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:54,270
did you have to do that?

439
00:44:54,270 --> 00:45:00,780
Why didn't you say even one word to me?

440
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:07,040
You must have been heartbroken.

441
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:14,890
Why did you bear the pain by yourself?

442
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,790
Yang...

443
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,060
Yang...

444
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,140
Yang...

445
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,980
Your Majesty.

446
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:40,420
Yang?

447
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,380
Yang.

448
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,620
What are you so tortured by

449
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,870
that you cannot even sleep?

450
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,230
Just...

451
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:06,100
these days... I'm not feeling well.

452
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,170
You called my name.

453
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,690
Yes.

454
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:23,360
Even in my dreams, I missed you very much.

455
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,200
Why are you doing this, all of a sudden?

456
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,380
Just for a moment,

457
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,030
I want to be like this with you.

458
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:59,440
Yes. Do you have something to say to me?

459
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,740
Very far in the future,

460
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,300
once we are old and our hair turns white,

461
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,240
then I will tell you.

462
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:24,730
So you want me to live for a very long time, huh?

463
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:27,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

464
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,220
Yes.

465
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,960
Golta.

466
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,400
When he gets a headache, he cannot live for even one day without the tonic I give him.

467
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,670
His mind will become clouded

468
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:04,580
and he will begin to lose chunks of his memories.

469
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,690
That's complicated.

470
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:10,640
How about just poisoning him all at once?

471
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,970
Before that, I have a lot of things I need to borrow the emperor's power for.

472
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:20,200
So you will control the emperor?

473
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:27,230
He's addicted to my drug. So he has no choice but to trust me.

474
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:33,280
And when the poison builds up in his body, he will slowly lose his life.

475
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,570
So you will kill him by sickness instead of poison.

476
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:40,980
Well, I can't let myself be suspected, can I?

477
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,470
Once the emperor dies and the emperor you select becomes enthroned

478
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:49,390
the world will belong to Hawk House.

479
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,950
It's been a long time, Empress Dowager.

480
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,720
Have you been well, Bolod Temür?

481
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,570
Yes, Your Highness.

482
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:14,020
I never expected you would lend me support, Empress Dowager.

483
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:19,230
Don't be mistaken. Once you become the emperor, you will be my puppet.

484
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:24,720
We hear that you were close to the late Prime Minister Bayan.

485
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,660
Yes, we were very like-minded in many ways.

486
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:33,280
Among our nation's key posts, there are many who still follow Bayan.

487
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,150
Begin meeting with them tomorrow.

488
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:39,590
Are you telling me to get them on my side?

489
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:43,640
Hawk House will provide all funds as you need them.

490
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,530
Don't worry about the money and persuade them to join us.

491
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:53,020
Once you determine that they are on our side, send the emperor a petition based on my instructions.

492
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,560
A petition? There's no reason the emperor would put his seal on it.

493
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:02,940
Don't worry about the emperor, we will take of it.

494
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:09,390
Now I can see that we complement each other quite well, Empress Dowager.

495
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,860
Your Majesty.

496
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,850
These are the petitions you asked me to bring you.

497
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,410
Sure.

498
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:43,940
Your Majesty, do you have a headache again?

499
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,020
You seem to have exerted yourself lately. You should rest—

500
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,870
No, I'm fine.

501
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:54,040
I shouldn't put off what I should do today.

502
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,070
Your Majesty.

503
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,950
Why are you so late? Hurry now.

504
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,060
Hurry, bring it to me.

505
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,740
Head Eunuch, you can leave now.

506
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

507
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,880
Please drink it, Your Majesty.

508
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,360
How do you like it?

509
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,370
Your Majesty?

510
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:48,860
And this is how one of our people gets seated in a major public office.

511
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:53,610
Won't His Majesty think it is strange later?

512
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:57,360
I told you, he is losing his memories.

513
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,800
Whether he was sleeping or whether he put his seal on it...

514
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:10,190
Golta?

515
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,380
Yes, Your Majesty!

516
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,580
Did you ask for me?

517
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:25,890
Golta, where did all the petitions go?

518
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:31,170
You took care of all of them and said they should be sent to each department.

519
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,970
Shall we prepare for the hunt?

520
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,390
Hunting?

521
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,750
You said you were going hunting, Your Majesty.

522
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,410
Oh, right. Never mind that.

523
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:54,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

524
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:59,990
Golta, I'm feeling so strange lately. My memory comes and goes so much.

525
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:03,840
You've been taking care of the affairs of state lately without rest.

526
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,540
It must be because you must be very tired.

527
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:23,970
This is the mask of the leader of Hawk House?

528
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:30,530
His Majesty put this on and disrupted their activities.

529
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:37,000
But why are you interested in Hawk House, Your Majesty the Empress?

530
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,870
I plan on confiscating their assets which were obtained in violation of the national law.

531
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:46,010
It should be a great help to the state treasury.

532
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:54,600
But how did you hear that Wang Yoo was in danger?

533
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:59,610
One of our spies among the Hawk House members heard it from the leader.

534
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:03,550
The leader said that?

535
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

536
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,600
But why does that surprise you?

537
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:16,570
That guy is right beneath our chins. (close by)

538
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:19,630
What do you mean?

539
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:23,900
The emperor's plan to kill Wang Yoo,

540
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,140
how many people would know about that?

541
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:32,770
You are right, so someone who would know about that...

542
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,770
What do you think this is about?

543
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,030
We greet the leader.

544
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:12,760
- We greet the leader.
- We greet the leader.

545
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:21,790
Leader, why suddenly...

546
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,200
Who are you?

547
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,420
Who is the fake?

548
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,060
Who are you?

549
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,870
This is the true leader!

550
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:49,760
Didn't I ask who you were?

551
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:07,160
Empress...

552
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,640
You called me the empress?

553
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:22,760
So you know me very well.

554
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:27,040
So who are you?

555
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:36,490
♫ Because I’m dangerous, my love ♫

556
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:42,160
♫ The more you love me ultimately the more
only you may be hurt ♫

557
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:48,160
♫ Don't test me or my love ♫

558
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,520
♫ I can’t ever, ever, ever, ever, ever ♫
