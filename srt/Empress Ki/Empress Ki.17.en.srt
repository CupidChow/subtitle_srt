1
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,780
My eyes are shut

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,650
and my ears are closed.

3
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,430
I can't see anything...

4
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,340
and I can't hear anything.

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,310
Please... Please lean on me comfortably.

6
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,840
Just a lousy back of yours?

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,660
It would have been nice had you given me a hug.

8
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,080
I think even my back is too good for you.

9
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,100
What are you doing?

10
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,110
Oh, you're such... a fool.

11
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,340
Can you hear me?

12
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,260
I... will try and fight the prime minister.

13
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:58,360
Because I don't want you to see me being weak anymore.

14
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,330
So I'm going to become courageous.

15
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,070
What are you saying?

16
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,430
This is so frustrating.

17
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,550
Please stand by me and watch

18
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,200
how I act as the emperor.

19
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,930
Aren't you going to move your hands?

20
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,240
What did you say?

21
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,790
I made fun of you.

22
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,710
Read the book there.

23
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,960
"The courier leaves tomorrow, she's told. She sews a warrior's frock all night.

24
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,960
The needle is cold to the touch."

25
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,520
Let's go.

26
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,490
Onward!

27
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,460
They enter the palace with armed guards without any hesitation now.

28
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:59,150
I'm the Captain of the Imperial Guards, yet they lack any respect.

29
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,690
Prime Minister El Temür is furious beyond words.

30
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,640
You will need to watch out for yourself more.

31
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,800
I am ashamed to see His Majesty.

32
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,380
She's praying to Buddha.

33
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,190
She has asked not to let anyone—

34
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,500
She'll find me more extraordinary than a prayer to Buddha.

35
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,490
If you want to pray, you should pray to me.

36
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,000
If I pray to you, will you listen to my prayer?

37
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,640
As long as you don't test my patience with the bloodletter that doesn't even exist,

38
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,730
what can't I grant you?

39
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,730
Do you believe I'm the author of that slanderous document?

40
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,170
I'm warning you not to look for the bloodletter!

41
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,870
The winds have changed already.

42
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,190
Trends generally follow the direction of the flag.

43
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,490
Why would I put myself in danger by striking gunflint?

44
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,350
The tree that bends never breaks.

45
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,030
Prostrate yourself even more.

46
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:40,600
In my eyes, you're still not in the clear yet.

47
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,810
I prayed that you will live for a very long time.

48
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,600
You need to live a long time in order to pay for all of your sins.

49
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,170
A hundred years. No, if you are to pay back all your wrongdoings,

50
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,970
you will need to live several hundred years!

51
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,720
No flowers last more than ten days and no power lasts more than ten years.

52
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,450
But... I'm different.

53
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,250
If it was for a mere ten days, I wouldn't have given off any fragrance;

54
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,510
and if it was just for ten years of power, I wouldn't have even drawn my sword.

55
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,340
I'm sure of that.

56
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,690
What do you think is the reason I'm letting you live?

57
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,580
I'm sure you don't have any reason to hurry.

58
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,220
Killing me is nothing when you even replaced the emperor.

59
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,790
If I was scared to die, I would have gone to the nunnery.

60
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,010
It's too late now.

61
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,950
If you attempt to leave now, do you think I would let you go?

62
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,250
If you want to criticize me, do it internally so I can't hear it.

63
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,570
The differences between Buddha and I are that I'm not merciful or unafraid to get revenge.

64
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,610
Do you understand, Your Imperial Highness?

65
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,270
It's time. Who can we trust among the ministers?

66
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:29,680
The Minister of Law and the Minister of Affairs resent Prime Minister El Temür.

67
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,470
Quietly find out whether they're on the same page as us.

68
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,040
Find out whether anyone among the extended members of the Imperial Family will fight against the Prime Minister.

69
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,660
I understand, Your Highness.

70
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,820
As expected, it wasn't Empress Dowager.

71
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,170
How can you be so certain?

72
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,750
She is well aware of what would happen if she provoked me without the bloodletter.

73
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,590
Then, she doesn't have it?

74
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,930
If she did, she would have used it already.

75
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,120
Who exactly is it then?

76
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,100
Have you heard about the slanderous document?

77
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,690
I'm staying in the guest pavilion. Of course, I have.

78
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,300
But where are you going?

79
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,610
Empress Dowager invited me.

80
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,840
If you don't want to be misunderstood, you'll have to watch how you act.

81
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,540
Thank you for your advice.

82
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,110
Prime Minister El Temür doesn't seem to realize you're the one who wrote the document.

83
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,010
What's the matter, Your Majesty?

84
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,690
I think I have something in my eye.

85
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,530
I'll take a look.

86
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,160
Your Majesty.

87
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,660
It's not going to work with you.

88
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,910
Never mind. Yang, you do it.

89
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,250
What are you doing? He needs help.

90
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,030
Did it work?

91
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,790
Well... i-it didn't work.

92
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,270
Can you gently blow here again?

93
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,670
It's Wang Yoo.

94
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,410
What brings you here?

95
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,170
I'm on my way to see Empress Dowager.

96
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,300
I was on my way there, too.

97
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,770
Yang.

98
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,290
I told you to stay no more than three steps away from me.

99
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,090
I get brutal when I meet an enemy on the battlefield.

100
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:18,360
And my heart races when I see a beauty at the drinking table.

101
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,420
Get a hold of yourself.

102
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,820
What insolence! How dare he approach me thusly?

103
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,770
As if I would even care.

104
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,410
Empress!

105
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,640
Empress, at the Empress Dowager's quarters—

106
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,290
Fine, I got it.

107
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,280
Why is greeting Empress Dowager coming so quickly?

108
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,830
We just got word that you don't have to come today.

109
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,790
Why so suddenly?

110
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,190
You know the palace is chaotic these days.

111
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,370
I smell something suspicious.

112
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,280
Then I can't miss out on being there.

113
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,520
- Get ready.
- Yes, Your Highness.

114
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,820
Long time no see, Empress.

115
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,060
It embarrasses me to hear you say "long time no see" between husband and wife.

116
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,010
Well... you do look well.

117
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,530
Is that how I look?

118
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,580
I guess I am at peace since you are not visiting me.

119
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,290
What are you doing? Announce me.

120
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,350
Welcome.

121
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,000
Did you not hear my message not to come, Empress?

122
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,190
I shouldn't skip my greetings.

123
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,760
Let's all sit then.

124
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,850
Is the tea not ready yet?

125
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,030
It's almost done, Your Highness.

126
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,480
Is Yang out there?

127
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

128
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,360
You come in and make the tea.

129
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:19,010
Tea tastes all the same. What's the use of asking her to make it?

130
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:24,210
Unless she makes it, I don't like the taste.

131
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,890
Bring the tea.

132
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,390
But why call Wang Yoo here?

133
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:44,890
I am thinking about suggesting to him to marry Princess Seo Hwa.

134
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,740
That kind of matter you should have discussed it with me first.

135
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,190
How about it, Wang Yoo?

136
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,960
I appreciate your offer... but I decline.

137
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,600
Wang Yoo, what do you mean decline?

138
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,240
I think the same as Empress Dowager.

139
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,530
The moment you become a member of the imperial family, your status will change as well.

140
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,690
Not only that,

141
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:19,060
the relationship between Goryeo and Yuan will improve. So, it's something to celebrate for both countries.

142
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,090
It's a good suggestion,

143
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,800
but I don't wish to do so.

144
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,340
Perhaps you have someone in your heart?

145
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,190
Unless that's why,

146
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,540
I don't think there's any reason to decline.

147
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:47,660
I am... embarrassed to receive... such interest.

148
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,260
I'll just drink my tea and take my leave.

149
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,870
Are you all right?

150
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,170
Yes. I am fine.

151
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,070
How can you be so careless? Drag her out right now—

152
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,960
It's nothing.

153
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,870
What do you mean nothing? You probably got burned by the hot tea.

154
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,760
It wasn't that hot.

155
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,300
Please forgive her.

156
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,800
Go get your burn treated.

157
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,960
Yes, Your Highness.

158
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,610
I am really all right, so don't worry about it.

159
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,970
Your Majesty.

160
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,890
Why aren't you cleaning up already?

161
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:15,100
Turning pale and crying over a mere wound.

162
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,950
I am sorry.

163
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,410
I didn't know you were passing—

164
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,030
Yang.

165
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,710
Forgive me.

166
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,420
I was wrong.

167
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,350
You do this once more.

168
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,580
Watch... what will happen.

169
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,540
She didn't even care when I got hurt playing kickball.

170
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,400
Why? Why didn't you wail then?

171
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,400
But... I can't get angry given my pride as the emperor.

172
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,790
Where is Yang right now?

173
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,630
She went outside for an urgent matter.

174
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,680
She probably went to the guest quarters. Hurry and bring her back.

175
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,490
- Hurry!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

176
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,830
You dare... dare without my permission.

177
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,890
It must be hurting a lot.

178
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,890
Your Majesty!

179
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,110
I told you to leave.

180
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,500
Please let me at least treat your wound.

181
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,290
I think it's best for you to leave.

182
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,390
Your Majesty!

183
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,450
I will do it.

184
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,340
Seung Nyang...

185
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,820
Let her be.

186
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,410
I told you not to set a foot in the guest quarters.

187
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:37,460
You got hurt because of me, so I'll leave after I treat your wound.

188
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,420
♫ Can't you gaze upon me?  ♫

189
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,460
♫ Can't you love me?  ♫

190
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,270
♫ The day you came to me  ♫

191
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:09,400
♫ My heart stopped and my eyes went blind  ♫

192
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:18,230
♫ Love is crazily sad word to me  ♫

193
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:24,340
♫ The word I'd have to swallow with my heartache  ♫

194
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:32,150
♫ Even crying all night and my heart collapses  ♫

195
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:40,950
♫ The word I still haven't spoke. I love you ♫

196
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:49,600
You got hurt in place of a lowly person like me.

197
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,210
Who told you you were lowly?

198
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,390
Did the emperor say that?

199
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,870
No.

200
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,370
Don't ever call yourself lowly in front of me.

201
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,580
Seung Nyang, Eunuch Baek came to get you.

202
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,610
You should go.

203
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,910
I'll come back tonight.

204
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,450
Don't bother.

205
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,680
Burns hurt more at night.

206
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,870
So, how was Wang Yoo?

207
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,350
Why do you look at me like that?

208
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,820
Right. You must have thought I'd scold you.

209
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,010
You still don't know me?

210
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,630
I am a generous man.

211
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,210
His wound is serious.

212
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,900
He might be... feverish tonight.

213
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,360
You must be worried about him.

214
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,090
So I am asking,

215
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:40,630
please permit me to nurse him tonight.

216
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,440
Then, what about me? What will become of me?

217
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,300
I couldn't sleep for the past few days because you didn't read to me.

218
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,150
Tonight, stay with me until l fall asleep.

219
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,130
Then I can leave... after you fall asleep?

220
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,740
See if I'll fall asleep.

221
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,430
"Cheong Cheon Yoo Wol Rae Gi Si.

222
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,950
Since when has that moon hung in the night sky?

223
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:25,270
Now I stop my drink to ask."

224
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,280
Hurry up and recite the poem.

225
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,570
"In Ban Myeong Wol Bul Ga Deuk.

226
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,710
Wol Heng Gak Yeo In Sang Su.

227
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,200
People can't catch that bright moon.

228
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,560
Rather, the moon follows."

229
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,450
"Gyo Yeo Bi Kyeong Im Dan Yeol.

230
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,570
- I can never...
- Nok Yeon...

231
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,950
- send you to Wang Yoo.

232
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,320
Pushing aside the blue fog,

233
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,320
that sparkling light."

234
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,120
You're not sleeping yet, Sire?

235
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,920
I was going to.

236
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,290
This tonic is good for burns. You can drink it in the morning.

237
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,310
Bayan! What have you been doing?

238
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,400
You still haven't caught any clues as to who sent that slanderous document?!

239
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,190
I apologize, Prime Minister!

240
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,660
What about the bloodletter!

241
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,280
Sorry, Father!

242
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,420
You bastards must not want to live.

243
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,450
Sorry, Sir!

244
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,030
Bayan! Kill all the magicians that were brought in

245
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,960
and throw their bodies outside the palace!

246
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,800
I've been too nice. The enemy is trying to fight me.

247
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,380
Now... I will do things my way.

248
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,360
Kill them!

249
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,490
These magicians were charged with creating the slanderous document and were killed.

250
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,730
Also, whoever reports those who talk about the bloodletter will be given 100 pieces of gold.

251
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:35,430
Anyone saying negative things will have three generations ruined.

252
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,430
El Temür's response got rougher as you predicted.

253
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,680
Time has come for the next phase.

254
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,430
What are you thinking about?

255
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:06,420
A believer of religion vows allegiance and worships the leader.

256
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,720
The leader declares himself Lord of All.

257
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,160
He blesses the believers and curses the nonbelievers.

258
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,530
He brings chaos to the world and deceives the people.

259
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:22,180
Please grant permission to start regulating them.

260
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,190
What does it say?

261
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,010
It's criticizing the religion that's popular these days.

262
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:33,390
So, these letters will change in the rain like last time?

263
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,160
Did you say it'll rain tomorrow?

264
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,460
Yes. Seeing that my joints are aching, I am sure it will rain.

265
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,770
The sky is very cloudy, so I think he is right.

266
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:54,560
Tonight, we'll get ready.

267
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,830
Post them where people can see it well.

268
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,470
Moo Song and Eunuch Bang, put them by the gate where El Temür enters the palace.

269
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:30,970
Seeing things are quiet these days, they must've been scared by your tactics.

270
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,070
They must've accepted my warning.

271
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,920
Still, you can't relax.

272
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,290
I think it's a passing shower.

273
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,540
Let's take shelter.

274
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,270
"Emperor... Mingzong's...

275
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:15,390
curse...

276
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,160
begins!"

277
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,190
It's him!

278
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,110
They made a move again.

279
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,050
I saw it!

280
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,600
Come on.

281
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,390
What's happening? My imperial father's curse?

282
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,240
The palace and every street

283
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,450
had this so-called "Emperor Mingzong Curse" posted.

284
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,990
It's the same people as before.

285
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,170
They've started to shake El Temür again.

286
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,710
What about the people?

287
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,740
The past four years of bad harvests and natural disasters

288
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,120
have them believing it's a curse by the late Emperor Mingzong.

289
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,000
Perhaps, it is really is my father's curse.

290
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,570
But the posting is a magician's trick...

291
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,370
That is how I will believe it.

292
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,350
Your Majesty.

293
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,850
That's how I must believe.

294
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,870
My father is deeply sorrowed by his untimely death.

295
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,280
He has mercy on me so he is cursing El Temür.

296
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,410
I have to believe this way to help me to gain some strength. Don't you think?

297
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,590
Yes, you are right.

298
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:49,190
I will believe Emperor Mingzong is looking after us.

299
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,900
The time we've been waiting so long for will come soon.

300
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,550
Until then, you must not irritate El Temür.

301
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:00,940
Rather, you must thoroughly play at being his puppet.

302
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,240
Do you understand?

303
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,730
No. I am going to change now.

304
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:14,250
I won't be El Temür's puppet ever again.

305
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,150
Just how are you taking care of our business?!

306
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,810
Since they said the curse will begin again, I am sure they'll make a move again.

307
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:28,300
That's right, Prime Minister. They got us this time, but

308
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,050
the next time, we'll catch their tails.

309
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:36,470
Fine. I'll wait and see the curse they speak of.

310
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,100
Emperor Mingzong's curse?

311
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,140
I am not afraid of a dead person's curse.

312
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:49,070
I will show them what my curse as a living man is.

313
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,460
We have to show them.

314
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,080
How can we not show them when the curse has now started?

315
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,470
How are we going to show them?

316
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:04,320
Do you know what animal senses first when Heaven and Earth change?

317
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,530
The rat.

318
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:12,230
Do you mean those noisy ones?

319
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,920
From now on, Bul Hwa and Jeom Bak

320
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,640
go outside the palace and catch mice.

321
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,420
It must be at least a few hundred live ones.

322
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,280
But mice are so shrewd. It'll be hard to catch them alive...

323
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,100
I'll tell you a method. You just need to follow it.

324
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,640
Thank you.

325
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,780
Did you get it?

326
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,840
This is dried toads skin. He said this will become a strong anesthetic if I boil this down.

327
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,180
We can put this on grain and catch the mice.

328
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:47,280
He said the mice will be asleep for about 2 days, so we just have to gather them up.

329
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,350
Let's hurry.

330
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,490
What's up? You must be feeling better.

331
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,280
I feel so much better after I had some Goryeo bean stew.

332
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,650
Why bring firewood?

333
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,090
I should earn my keep.

334
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:08,470
I know enough to pay back favors.

335
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,900
There are households with only kids after the adults died.

336
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,780
Take this firewood to them.

337
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:18,150
I'll gather up more. I'll unload this over there and gather some more.

338
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,690
He's not so bad, unlike his looks.

339
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,970
Chief!

340
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,750
Have you been well?

341
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,970
Why are they here again?

342
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,230
What is it?

343
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,870
We came to discuss something with you, Chief.

344
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,960
Discuss? I don't like that sort of thing.

345
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,190
Please give us a little time.

346
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,440
Come on in for now.

347
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,850
Right. My senses were correct.

348
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,080
That chief is suspicious and

349
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,880
there must be something in this Goryeo Village.

350
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,120
Please promise first that you'll keep the secret.

351
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,560
A secret and promise? Forget it.

352
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,600
If it's problematic, don't even open your mouth and just leave!

353
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,120
It's not problematic.

354
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:42,660
You only need to ignore what we are doing.

355
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,260
Hold on a second.

356
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,810
Huh?

357
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,820
All right.

358
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:15,090
He won't come back now.

359
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,580
Someone was out there?

360
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,920
Don't worry about it.

361
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,120
What is it? What do I need to ignore?

362
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,010
Ah, I should've heard what they were talking about.

363
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:33,360
For now, I've caught their tail, so I'll get their body slowly.

364
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,280
Oh...

365
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,080
That old gizzard is something.

366
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,700
You are going to catch the mice? What will you do with all the mice?

367
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,540
We have a plan for their use.

368
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,940
No matter how hungry we are, we don't eat mice.

369
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,760
We aren't cats! We don't eat them either.

370
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,230
We'll catch and take all the mice from here,

371
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,090
so just don't tell anyone about it.

372
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,290
Your master ordered this?

373
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,450
Please help us, Chief.

374
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:13,820
If you want to keep it quiet, you need to spray at night and collect them early in the morning.

375
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,520
Thanks, Chief.

376
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,700
Don't mention it.

377
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,090
You may all leave.

378
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,030
By chance, have you heard the emperor talking about a bloodletter?

379
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,070
Tell me if you hear the emperor talking about a bloodletter.

380
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:55,040
Then I'll not only spare your life but also give you everything you want.

381
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,000
You dare sneer at me?

382
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,900
I heard the prime minister will be charged with treason if a bloodletter is found.

383
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:12,800
Perhaps I'll get a chance to get my revenge.

384
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,460
I'll pay attention from now on.

385
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,800
You are brazen with the emperor's support.

386
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,300
Do you know what happens to a rabbit in the field when caught by a hawk's eye?

387
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:38,360
No matter how fast it runs, it'll get its flesh ripped to shreds by the hawk in the end.

388
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:44,460
Now that you are on the wrong side of me, your fate is like that rabbit.

389
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,800
What took you so long?

390
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,370
Why did you get up so early today?

391
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:12,270
I am going to get up before sunrise every day. So be here early.

392
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,200
Tell me my schedule today.

393
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,990
Ten o'clock hour, exercise. Two o'clock hour, reading and calligraphy.

394
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,820
I am going to study letters.

395
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,160
Your Majesty, if El Temür finds out about this...

396
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,720
He'll try to kill me.

397
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,130
So you must help me in secret, Yang.

398
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,130
And also call in General Bayan tonight.

399
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,090
Be sure no one sees him.

400
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

401
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,820
You've called for me, Your Majesty?

402
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,740
I have never personally ordered anything from this seat until now.

403
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:08,570
But I am going to give you an imperial command tonight.

404
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,040
Command us anything.

405
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,790
Please command us, Your Majesty.

406
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:22,360
Find the bloodletter.

407
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,860
Your Majesty, the bloodletter is a rumor. How can we when it doesn't exist---

408
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,950
Then, why is El Temür looking for a non-existent bloodletter?

409
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:39,550
If the prime minister finds out you are looking for the bloodletter,

410
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:43,450
then no one in this palace will protect you.

411
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,200
Are you threatening me, too?

412
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,720
Not a threat, but advice.

413
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,550
Then you two can protect me.

414
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,090
Why? Can't do it?

415
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,570
How can you trust us?

416
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,660
We've been following the prime minister's orders up to now.

417
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,150
So, how will you trust us?

418
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,380
You two saved my life on Daecheong Island already.

419
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:13,220
If El Temür finds out about that, you two won't be safe either.

420
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,550
There are no excuses against an imperial command!

421
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,820
Find my father's bloodletter and bring it to me.

422
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,990
As you command, Your Majesty.

423
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,400
Come out.

424
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,650
How was I?

425
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,140
Pardon?

426
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,740
I am asking if I looked like a strong emperor?

427
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,450
Are you thinking about...

428
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,890
standing up to the prime minister?

429
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,460
I am going to give it a try,

430
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,600
even if my body is ripped to shreds.

431
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:18,180
Whether for the emperor or for His Majesty, there is only one enemy.

432
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,510
The quickest and the surest way to bring down El Temür is...

433
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,980
is finding the bloodletter.

434
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,490
I'll help you, too, Your Majesty.

435
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,830
You said you'll do nothing for me.

436
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,330
I also have a debt to

437
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,010
demand from El Temür.

438
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,200
If you'll help me,

439
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,670
I'll be even more courageous.

440
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:05,520
The look in the emperor's eyes has changed and he seems to have matured, too.

441
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,740
People don't change that easily.

442
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,750
You saw him, too.

443
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,440
Until just recently, he was someone who shook in fear

444
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,140
whenever he was in front of El Temür. Something is off.

445
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,520
Are you saying someone is controlling him?

446
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:31,670
Anyway, it's getting complicated since we are getting commands from Prime Minister and the emperor at the same time.

447
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:36,620
It won't be complicated if we get the bloodletter, Uncle.

448
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,920
Bloodletter... We only need to find it.

449
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,090
Court Lady Noh, please get a hold yourself!

450
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,150
Don't come close.

451
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,100
This is my room.

452
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,250
Please get a hold yourself.

453
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,110
Don't come! Don't come!

454
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,830
I told you not to come.

455
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,270
It's good you are here.

456
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,890
Please do something.

457
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:03,090
She was fine just a while ago, but she turned on us so suddenly.

458
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:08,970
I saw it. I am the only one who saw the bloodletter.

459
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:13,060
There you go again. I told you we'd all die if you utter anything about a bloodletter.

460
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,900
I know where it is.

461
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,390
I served the emperor, so I know. Only me.

462
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,080
Sir, is that true?

463
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,040
Do you believe an insane person's word?

464
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,130
Don't come!

465
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,920
This is my room. No! I won't let you take it!

466
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,650
Yes, Madam.

467
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:38,030
This is your room.

468
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:42,940
So live together here with me.

469
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,620
Please trust me.

470
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,650
This...

471
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,140
Please give it to me.

472
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:08,150
I won't leave here. I want to live here.

473
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,670
All right, Madam.

474
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,630
She's like a child with Nyang.

475
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,060
I'll take care of her, so you all can leave.

476
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,430
Will you be all right?

477
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,590
Yes, Sir.

478
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:33,690
Ah, right. Don't listen to any talk about a bloodletter. It's all nonsense.

479
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,840
Did you really see... that bloodletter?

480
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:01,460
Emperor Mingzong. I served him until the end.

481
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,830
Where did you see it?

482
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,610
What was written there?

483
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:15,010
On that bloodletter,

484
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,360
the emperor wrote that he loved me.

485
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:29,540
It's true. He told me I was the prettiest and that I was the only one for him.

486
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Yes, Madam.

487
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,810
It's late. You should get some sleep.

488
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,130
Are you awake, Emperor?

489
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,950
Is the puppet show ready?

490
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,490
Yes, Emperor.

491
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:06,890
They came in last night and they are standing by right now.

492
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,060
But, Emperor,

493
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,520
must you put on a shadow play to deceive the prime minister?

494
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,720
What do you mean?

495
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,640
I have to make sure he believes that I'm not interested in the bloodletter and only want to have fun.

496
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,630
But don't breathe a word about the shadow play to Yang.

497
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:28,800
Pardon?

498
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,020
Yes.

499
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,240
I hope Yang likes it.

500
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,290
Your Majesty, the water to wash your face is ready.

501
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:40,500
I told you not to breathe a word.

502
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,960
Yes.

503
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:53,130
Hold on.

504
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,540
You do it, Yang.

505
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,840
Washing your face is not the job of court ladies but of maids.

506
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,350
Ah, I don't care. I don't know anything about that.

507
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:12,410
You all leave, and, Yang, you come and wash me.

508
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:17,890
Softly. Do your utmost.

509
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,240
Ah, right. Right.

510
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:48,150
Your touch has become much softer.

511
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:52,810
Ah. Ah, ah! Do it gently!

512
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,370
Before I punish you...

513
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,190
Punish me instead.

514
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,020
Ah, gently! Ah, ah... It hurts!

515
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,970
I can't control myself.

516
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,370
What am I supposed to do?

517
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,710
Find a maid to do it unless you want this to happen every morning.

518
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,510
Um, no.

519
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,070
Why not?

520
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:21,670
Other than you, I don't like another woman touching me.

521
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,370
Your Majesty.

522
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,690
Your Majesty, have you heard the news?

523
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,940
What's with all the fuss so early in the morning?

524
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:50,880
The emperor is putting on a shadow play.

525
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,260
A shadow play?

526
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,120
By chance... is it because of that wench, Park?

527
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,130
That Park wench is... She's pregnant,

528
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:03,330
she can't go around as she pleases.

529
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,750
Right.

530
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,350
Then, who is it for?

531
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:13,310
Of course, it must be for you.

532
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,190
Me?

533
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,270
I never thought such a day would come!

534
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:26,470
I think... he is trying to make up with you.

535
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,610
Make up?

536
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,990
Call Wang Yoo over, too.

537
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,140
Why him suddenly?

538
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,190
I don't want to watch it alone with His Majesty.

539
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:45,060
I think... he is jealous of Wang Yoo.

540
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,550
Wang Yoo seems to have feelings for me,

541
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:52,590
so I can make him anxious if I use the opportunity well, don't you think?

542
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,620
I understand what you mean.

543
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:02,070
But what do you mean Wang Yoo has feelings for you?

544
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:06,740
How can I describe all the expressions in his eyes toward me?

545
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,000
Anyway, men are such...

546
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,590
It would be odd to invite him for no reason, so have him come to a dinner feast.

547
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,330
Pardon?

548
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:22,970
If you tell him it's to discuss his future marriage, we should be able to invite both him and the emperor.

549
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:26,030
I understand.

550
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,440
I'm pretty.

551
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,340
Your Majesty.

552
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,680
There are easily a few hundred.

553
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,460
Have you taken good care of them?

554
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:49,540
I tied them up well in the rice sacks brought into the guesthouse.

555
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:55,120
Disperse them tonight. You will need to be very careful.

556
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,670
We're already done getting prepared.

557
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:00,730
When the palace is swarming with mice, there will be a huge commotion.

558
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,550
The curse will finally begin.

559
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:09,020
Emperor Mingzong's curse.

560
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,960
Your Majesty, someone is here on Empress' orders.

561
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,280
Show them in.

562
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,580
Why are you tasting the food for the emperor?

563
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,370
I told her to.

564
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:46,690
Wang Yoo, you need to discuss your marriage with me from now on.

565
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:52,420
I would like to stop discussing that matter from now on.

566
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,540
Do you dislike the idea that much?

567
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,920
Since you're not comfortable, I won't bring it up anymore.

568
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,640
Let's all have some.

569
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:08,390
But I heard you've prepared a shadow play tonight.

570
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,110
What? How did she find out?

571
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,580
That's right.

572
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:22,860
Since you're putting it on for me so thoughtfully, I should be there.

573
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,580
Damn it, it's all ruined.

574
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,320
Wang Yoo, you should watch it, too.

575
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,310
Is she nuts? Why him, too?

576
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,530
I'm fine.

577
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:46,390
It's not good manners for a man to turn down an offer from a lady.

578
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:50,340
Eunuch Baek, please make a place for Wang Yoo, too.

579
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

580
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,370
(What?)

581
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:43,060
But... how did you know I like this?

582
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,370
Had I known, would I have prepared this?

583
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,590
You may begin.

584
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,490
What's wrong?

585
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,550
Th-There's a mouse!

586
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,030
It's not uncommon to see one in the storage room.

587
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,900
Move away!

588
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,840
Damn it. Who do they think I put this on for?

589
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:59,560
♫ Love is a crazily sad word to me  ♫

590
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:05,600
♫ The word I'd have to swallow with heartache  ♫

591
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,700
♫ Even if dawn breaks with tears ♫
