1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,180
Where is the body?

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,960
Gaegyeong is full of King Simyang's soldiers. What if they find it first?

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,350
Don't worry. It's in a place that's hard to find.

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,840
What a relief.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,820
Here. Have some more.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,410
But how did you remain unscathed?

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:39,090
That night, I got a strange report from a private residence so I was out observing that area.

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,410
I see.

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,980
It bothered me that I was the only one who made it out alive,

10
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,350
so I came all the way to Gaegyeong to try and save the base commander

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:57,130
Anyway, it's a relief I met you, Deputy Commander Yeom.

12
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,780
I'll go outside and check the surroundings, so stay here for now.

13
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,190
How long do you want me to wait?

14
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,530
I'll catch that rascal and—

15
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,080
Don't act clueless.

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,450
First, we need to find Crown Prince's body, don't we?

17
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,580
"Don't we"?

18
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,030
How dare you speak informally to me?

19
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,540
Shut up and listen well.

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,790
I'll soon go to where Crown Prince's body is hidden with Seung Nyang.

21
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:46,220
Until I confirm it, we mustn't let Seung Nyang catch on. Understand?

22
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,780
This bastard. How dare you?

23
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,420
Look...

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,950
I'll soon become a general.

25
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,980
Thanks to me, we're going to get credited with finding Crown Prince's body.

26
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,200
What? Bastard?

27
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:11,300
Anyway, make sure you don't lose Seung Nyang.

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,340
What will you do now?

29
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,790
What do you mean? Come in!

30
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,320
So you were the traitor!

31
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,500
Traitor? I'm just loyal to someone else.

32
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,200
You to Goryeo and me, to the Great Yuan Empire.

33
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,140
Dog-like bastard.

34
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,360
Dog? Dog-like?

35
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,830
A dog in a distinguished household looks a lot better than the chief of a beggar village.

36
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,580
We have discussed everything already.

37
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,420
What have you discussed and how?

38
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,010
The national sovereignty of Goryeo will be erased and will become a part of Yuan.

39
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,620
None of the lords here could oppose it.

40
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,980
That was because you caused such serious trouble, Your Majesty.

41
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,890
Your path has been set.

42
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,690
You'll be summoned to Yeongyeong and be tried under the Great Empire's laws.

43
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,460
The crown prince looked down on Goryeo.

44
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,730
I couldn't abide by seeing that sight, so I killed him.

45
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,650
Your Majesty!

46
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,500
What are you saying?!

47
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,240
Are you admitting to your crime?

48
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,120
I did it alone.

49
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,400
None of the lords or my people are to blame.

50
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
So don't dethrone me;

51
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,390
instead, rip me to shreds right here.

52
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,430
I'm telling you to let Goryeo be and only kill me!

53
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,230
Your Majesty!

54
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,000
Your Majesty!

55
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,160
Open the gates! Yeom Byeong Soo has

56
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,600
brought the body of the crown prince!

57
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,770
Nyang, it's all up to you now.

58
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,450
I'm telling you to kill me instead.

59
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,120
I'm telling you to judge only me for the crime!

60
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,690
Your Majesty...

61
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,670
It's not a crime that can be atoned for with your life.

62
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,820
Prime Minister El Temür!

63
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,900
I'll take him to our capital.

64
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,140
You and Wang Ko deal with things here.

65
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,060
Yes, Father.

66
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,140
Reporting to the Prime Minister!

67
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,830
I've... brought the body of the crown prince!

68
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,450
So his body is inside that coffin?

69
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,450
Yes, Sire.

70
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,450
If he drowned, his body would be bloated.

71
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,770
It was put in salt, so you could recognize at least his face.

72
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,780
Confirm it.

73
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,750
The smell is too awful.

74
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,440
Still, confirm that it's him!

75
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,420
Bayan, you come and check!

76
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,260
Bodhisattva Mahasattva. I wish you peace, Your Highness.

77
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,160
The smell is so awful that it's causing me to gag!

78
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,390
Your Highness, you're alive?

79
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,340
Your Highness!

80
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,210
Why did you leave us this way?

81
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,550
Your Highness...

82
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,970
Your Highness!

83
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,940
Your Highness!

84
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,860
Your Highness!

85
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,970
Your Majesty, Crown Prince is alive.

86
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,490
What nonsense are you speaking?

87
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,200
He didn't die!

88
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,520
He's alive!

89
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,390
When his body is right here?!

90
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,430
Your Highness...

91
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,080
Pr- Prime Minister El Temür...

92
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,120
Your Highness, you're alive.

93
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,000
Long live the Crown Prince!

94
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,710
Long live His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince!

95
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,020
Your Highness, how did this happen?

96
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,090
So, wh-what happened was... I-I...

97
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,610
Please speak, Your Highness.

98
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:32,560
Reveal the truth that they are the people who tried to kill you on Daecheong Island.

99
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,320
You can't. You can never say it.

100
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,800
Please speak.

101
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,650
Did I try to kill you?

102
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,650
Please reveal it, Your Highness!

103
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:01,420
As soon as you say it, you'll be killed.

104
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,330
It's all right. Please speak.

105
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,590
Who tried to kill whom?

106
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,040
So, what happened was...

107
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,110
Cr-Cr... Crown Prince!

108
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,000
What are you doing? Take him away and bring the doctor.

109
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,510
That's enough.

110
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,820
Your Majesty, we can't let those people take the crown prince.

111
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,320
Since we've confirmed that he's alive, it's enough.

112
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,430
That's right! Who cares if he lives or dies?

113
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,090
Thank you for coming back alive.

114
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,320
Thank you, Seung Nyang.

115
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,880
Why isn't he waking up?

116
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,420
I'm not sure. His energy is fine.

117
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,120
It's my first time experiencing this.

118
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,390
Lord Jang, take the doctor and leave.

119
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,590
Yes, Prime Minister.

120
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,030
Who checked the body last?

121
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,700
He told me to...

122
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,480
check the body... so I told General Bayan to—

123
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,040
These bastards!

124
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,590
Please kill me, Father.

125
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,750
- Please kill us!
- Please kill us!

126
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,000
Fine. I will kill you.

127
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,630
Did you think you could live after making me look like the world's biggest fool?!

128
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,450
Please be calm, Prime Minister.

129
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,950
The problem starts now. Once Crown Prince wakes up,

130
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,950
it will be revealed who tried to kill him.

131
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,340
I will kill him...

132
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,310
right here, right now.

133
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,560
What? Kill him now?

134
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,430
What about the King of Goryeo and his people who witnessed that he's alive? Do you want to kill them all, too?

135
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,470
Th-That... We can take measures later to—

136
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,200
Idiotic bastards. That's why everything you do turns out badly.

137
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,190
I am sorry, Father.

138
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:02,430
Bayan! Until Crown Prince wakes up, don't let anyone near him!

139
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,740
Yes, Prime Minister!

140
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,220
Bastard!

141
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,520
Please open your eyes now.

142
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,420
We're the only ones here.

143
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,400
His Majesty the Emperor has died.

144
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,390
Now you are the master of this world.

145
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,550
You are the Emperor of the Great Yuan Empire.

146
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,220
That's not what Prime Minister El Temür thinks.

147
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,930
There is a way to change his mind.

148
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,030
Can we trust the crown prince?

149
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,680
Don't worry. He made a promise to me.

150
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,880
You accomplished something great this time, too.

151
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,350
You did well.

152
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,400
But... what happened to Commander Ki?

153
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,680
I can't give you long.

154
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,690
Come out quickly.

155
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,760
Commander...

156
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,000
It's me, Seung Nyang.

157
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,590
It's me, I said. Nyang.

158
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,560
Father!

159
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,360
Please... It's me, Nyang!

160
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,600
It's Nyang, Father!

161
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,690
Father...

162
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,260
Father...

163
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,320
Yes, Father. It's me, Nyang.

164
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,850
Father...

165
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,020
Don't cry, my daughter.

166
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,770
I have no more regrets

167
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,340
since I got to meet you again before dying.

168
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,230
Father, please wait a little longer.

169
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,650
When the crown prince wakes up, you can be set free.

170
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:53,520
I will never forgive whoever did this to you!

171
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,510
Nyang...

172
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,390
Father... Father...

173
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,550
Father...

174
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,290
I can't do that!

175
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,600
What do you mean?

176
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,410
I promised Seung Nyang that I would reveal the truth.

177
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,450
What kind of nonsense is that?!

178
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,380
Uncle.

179
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,920
Your Highness, this is about your life

180
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,270
and the fate of the empire.

181
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,650
Who cares about some promise you made to that kid?!

182
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,300
You don't know anything!

183
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,150
In order to protect me, Seung Nyang put his life on the line and—

184
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,020
Seung Nyang, Seung Nyang! Please come to your senses!

185
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:15,510
Your Highness, who do you think... killed the late emperor?

186
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,970
You must become the king in order to avenge your father's death.

187
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:27,330
Are you regaining your senses now? Do you now know

188
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,760
what you need to do and how?

189
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,320
Father...

190
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,750
You bastard!

191
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,230
Die! Die!

192
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,090
Die! Die!

193
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,820
Die!

194
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,330
How could you bring the crown prince back?

195
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,000
You dare spit in my rice bowl and ruined

196
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,610
a perfect plan!

197
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,310
Please save me.

198
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,060
I did something worthy of dying!

199
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,430
Shut up!

200
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,180
This stupid worthless...

201
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,210
Sire!

202
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,650
Crown Prince has woken up.

203
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,620
What?

204
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,390
Does it hurt?

205
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:40,580
If you speak to me informally one more time... I'll kill you.

206
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,260
Seung Nyang, you punk...

207
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,970
I will kill you myself.

208
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,480
This Yeom Byeong Soo will kill you!

209
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,230
Your Highness...

210
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,560
let's go now.

211
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm glad you're fine, Your Highness.

212
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:12,130
Do you know who tried to kill you on Daecheong Island?

213
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,740
I... I do know.

214
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,720
Who was it?

215
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,010
Who tried to kill you!

216
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,350
G-Goryeo's soldiers.

217
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,740
Your Highness.

218
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,690
The soldiers, under the orders of the King of Goryeo,

219
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,170
revolted and tried to kill me.

220
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,710
That's a lie!

221
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,700
How could you lie?!

222
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,790
I saw it with my own eyes.

223
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,220
Ki Ja Oh...

224
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,690
Ki Ja Oh wielded his sword at me and—

225
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,100
Shut that mouth!

226
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,880
Lock him up.

227
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,620
He didn't do anything wrong. Kill me instead!

228
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,440
Your life is already mine.

229
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,610
You will need my permission to die.

230
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,020
Please take him inside.

231
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,750
Please go inside.

232
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,580
Seung Nyang...

233
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,580
Father...

234
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,660
Father!

235
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,730
A... A man is dying!

236
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,250
Someone please help!

237
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,190
A man is dying!

238
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,740
Please, someone help!

239
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,960
Please help!

240
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,890
Father...

241
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,540
I'm sorry, daughter.

242
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,960
My daughter, Seung Nyang...

243
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,860
For not protecting your mother,

244
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,180
your father who wasn't good enough...

245
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,800
Father!

246
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,700
No, Father.

247
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,430
You can't die like this.

248
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,960
Father!

249
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,770
Father!

250
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,760
You can't...

251
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,830
You can't.

252
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,310
Father.

253
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,220
Father!

254
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,490
You can't die! Father...

255
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,880
Look at me, Father!

256
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,310
Let's live together.

257
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,950
Father!

258
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,280
Father! Please...

259
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,060
Father.

260
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,050
Father!

261
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,350
Please look at me!

262
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,300
You were looking for me?

263
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,310
Why did you want to see me alone?

264
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:56,620
P-Please let me live, Prime Minister.

265
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,160
If you want me to be stupid, I will be; if you want me to be a coward, I will be one.

266
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,520
If you want me to a stone, I will be; if you want me to be a puppet,

267
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,790
I will... be a puppet.

268
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,600
So please... don't throw this poor person away.

269
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,920
Prime Minister.

270
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,250
Who is he really?

271
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:28,300
If he's not some rare idiot, he should be a poisonous snake hiding his fangs.

272
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,830
P-Prime Minister.

273
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,570
Please get up now.

274
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,480
The emperor has left this world.

275
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,400
Is... Is that true?

276
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,520
Never show your tears or kneel in front of anyone ever again.

277
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:02,040
Since you are the ruler of the world now...

278
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,740
There can be only one ruler.

279
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,390
No one can be the ruler in front of Prime Minister El Temür.

280
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,350
If you want to please him, make him believe it's so.

281
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,590
Do you understand?

282
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,590
Ruler? Don't speak nonsense!

283
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:22,930
The throne doesn't belong to me, Prime Minister.

284
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,610
You're so lacking...

285
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,390
Give him everything.

286
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,360
Why don't you...

287
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,130
take the throne instead?

288
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,470
I'll give you everything I can.

289
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,090
Only you should be the ruler.

290
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,290
Maybe he's the emperor I've been looking for.

291
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,680
I've taken such a long way round when he was right here in front of me.

292
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,500
And ask him to save you no matter what.

293
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,900
Please don't throw me away. Please let me at least live.

294
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,730
I just want to live a comfortable life, that's all.

295
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:12,520
Now you will be... under my protection.

296
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,350
Prime Minister.

297
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:17,530
But in turn, you must make a promise.

298
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:22,360
Tell me. I'll do anything you say.

299
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,690
You must take my daughter Danashiri as your empress.

300
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,690
Then... you will become my father-in-law?

301
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,680
Do you not want to?

302
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,250
Of course not! Of course not!

303
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,900
It would be a blessing I don't deserve!

304
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,610
The emperor is chosen by the heavens.

305
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,730
The heavens... also need your permission.

306
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:09,700
I gave my permission to the heavens just now.

307
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,690
So ascend to the throne comfortably.

308
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,240
Th-Thank you, Prime Minister.

309
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,680
Thank you. Thank you, Prime Minister.

310
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,000
Thank you, Prime Minister!

311
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:36,460
Seung Nyang, I can't die here. I will live no matter what and get my revenge.

312
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:43,980
The promise I couldn't keep, I will be sure to make it up to you.

313
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,500
Crown Prince... I will kill you.

314
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:59,670
I will kill you myself for being the enemy of Goryeo and for my father's death.

315
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,500
- Lords of Goryeo, listen to my words!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

316
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:17,410
The King of Goryeo tried to assassinate me and schemed in order to hide this fact.

317
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,530
So I will...

318
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:33,500
pass judgment on his crime. Dethrone him and have him transferred to Daedo.

319
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,250
And those who took part in the rebellion,

320
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,110
they will be sent to Daedo and become slaves of the Great Yuan Empire.

321
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:45,740
Also, in honor of my coronation,

322
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:52,740
Goryeo will provide 200 virgins and 100 boys as concubines and eunuchs.

323
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:03,470
Also, every year, 120 pounds of gold, 7500 pounds of silver, and 100 stallions

324
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:10,200
and... and...

325
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,820
3,000 bolts of silk...

326
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,970
Oh yes! 3,000 bolts of silk and 100,000 sheets of parchment...

327
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,950
1,000 inkstones, and...

328
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,340
and o-o-otter... otter skins...

329
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,890
10,000.

330
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,050
Right, 10,000... 10,000?

331
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:35,070
Are there that many otters in Goryeo?

332
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:39,940
- Sire.
- I mean, it will be hard to catch them.

333
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:46,210
- And even if you do, then you have to skin that many otters and how hard—
- Sire.

334
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,920
You can just make your decree, Goryeo must provide it.

335
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,220
I mean, can I really do that? You should have told me sooner.

336
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,790
My head nearly split trying to memorize all this!

337
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,310
Why didn't you write it down for him at least?

338
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:16,030
- He's illiterate.
- Illiterate? He can't read?

339
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,360
Prime Minister!

340
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:32,650
Why didn't you speak about the next King of Goryeo?

341
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,740
Once in Daedo, the emperor will make his decree.

342
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,380
I will await your orders.

343
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,800
Please don't forget me, Your Majesty.

344
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,970
Come closer.

345
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,960
I remember very clearly.

346
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,690
Your face that told me you would kill me.

347
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,950
I have etched it deep into my bones,

348
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,640
so how could I forget you?

349
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,680
What's the matter, Sire?

350
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,590
I will transfer the concubines myself this time.

351
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,280
You're going to Yuan?

352
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,380
By decree or whatever, I will go and be chosen as the King of Goryeo.

353
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,990
If not, I will become no better than a dog chasing a chicken.

354
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,700
Get up!

355
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,040
Come here!

356
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,470
Don't leave any one of them behind!

357
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,640
This is all because you have a fool for a king.

358
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,340
All this happened because he tried to kill the crown prince.

359
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,330
Now, innocent people are being taken as slaves of the Great Empire!

360
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,880
If you want to blame someone, blame your foolish king!

361
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:48,510
- Put him on the list of eunuchs to be transferred.
- Yes, Sire.

362
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,250
See how harsh the price is for betraying me.

363
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:59,050
Feel in your bones what it's like to become a slave that's no better than a dog or a pig.

364
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,550
This trip to Yuan will become the road to hell for you.

365
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,180
Your Majesty!

366
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,890
Your Majesty, we'll come with you.

367
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:34,010
- I said you cannot.
- How can you tell us to send you away alone?

368
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,800
This is my last command as your king.

369
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:43,130
I don't want you to suffer... on my account.

370
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:47,550
Your Majesty!

371
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:56,900
By taking care of this fool... you suffered so much all these years.

372
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,890
Get in line!

373
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,060
Hurry!

374
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:43,970
Whoever runs away will be punished! Be sure to remember!

375
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,600
Please exempt Seung Nyang from this journey.

376
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:56,300
He's the one who saved the crown prince. There is no reason for him to be taken.

377
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,410
- Your Majesty!
- Brother!

378
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,260
Did you forget what Father said?

379
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:08,800
Remember. You must bring him here, all the while showing him the courtesy toward a king.

380
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,060
Father, he deserves to die!

381
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,560
Since when do you go against me?

382
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,000
Sorry.

383
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,370
But why are you being lenient with him?

384
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:26,850
I've met many brave men during many wars, but I've never seen anyone with more passion.

385
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:30,490
In front of death, how could he be so dignified?

386
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,490
He's too good to keep as just an enemy.

387
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,420
I'm not so merciful.

388
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,430
Shut up and follow.

389
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,300
Your Majesty, I'm fine.

390
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,940
What's the matter?

391
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,560
Why the big sigh?

392
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,000
He's probably blaming me to death.

393
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,860
Are you thinking about that Seung Nyang again?

394
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:26,370
It's because he saved my life that I've become the emperor.

395
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,040
It wouldn't have been good enough had I paid him back generously...

396
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,460
You have already commanded that he be spared.

397
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,940
He's probably living well in his homeland by now.

398
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,730
By the way, Your Majesty, I have a niece.

399
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,880
You will probably like her very much.

400
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,800
I'm very picky when it comes to women.

401
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,600
Well, it's strange for me to say this, but she can make any man smile with her incomparable beauty.

402
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,070
Is that right?

403
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:03,350
Then bring her to the imperial palace some time.

404
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,000
Hurry up! Move it along!

405
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,900
We don't have time! Hurry up!

406
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,410
Quickly!

407
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,220
We'll kill anyone who lags behind!

408
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,340
Stand up!

409
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,310
Hurry!

410
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,890
Quick!

411
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,130
Move it along!

412
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,860
Please order them some rest time.

413
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,880
There are so many who are injured. If we keep going like this, at least half will die before we reach Daedo.

414
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,220
Shut up! How dare you?

415
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,950
Let's take a short break.

416
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,760
Brother!

417
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,810
The King of Goryeo is commanding that we rest.

418
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,160
Signal them!

419
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,080
Here's water.

420
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,290
Give them water.

421
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,780
This is leftover food. Share it amongst yourselves.

422
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,080
Everyone, let's go out!

423
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,350
Why are you doing this?

424
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,210
Do you not know? Whose fault is it that we're being dragged away?

425
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,410
If you're incompetent, you shouldn't have started anything at all.

426
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,380
Why did you try to kill the Crown Prince of Yuan?

427
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,980
He brought food that he purposely didn't eat. How can you be so cruel?

428
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,420
Everyone, let's leave! Let's go!

429
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,980
Listen!

430
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,510
Let them be.

431
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,160
They aren't wrong.

432
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,040
Your Majesty.

433
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,060
Bring out all the women from inside!

434
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,170
- Yes!
- Yes!

435
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,390
What's the matter?

436
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:21,600
My brother ordered that all the women who are disrupting the march to be killed.

437
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,010
What are you doing? Drag them out here!

438
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,280
- Yes!
-- Yes!

439
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,010
Let's go.

440
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,620
No one lays a finger on my people.

441
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,600
Do you want to die that badly?

442
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,510
From here on out, this is Yuan's territory.

443
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,620
Whoever disobeys will die.

444
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,850
Call back the soldiers.

445
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,340
I will forgo all courtesy toward you from now on.

446
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,710
Get rid of him!

447
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:15,940
Whoever enters this tent, I will kill.

448
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,400
Do you think you're the only one who wants to kill?

449
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,160
I also feel sick whenever I see you.

450
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:29,060
This is the last time.

451
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,000
Stand aside.

452
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,010
Your Majesty.

453
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,790
Don't shoot!

454
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,530
You must want to die along with him.

455
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,640
- Fine.
- Move away.

456
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,620
I will not.

457
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:59,290
Wang Yoo, I can't stand your arrogance!

458
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,780
That's enough.

459
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,720
- King Simyang.
- You'll receive the wrath of the Prime Minister if you kill him here.

460
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,590
That's right. He is not worth getting punished over.

461
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,310
Y-Your Majesty.

462
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:34,740
He's still alive.

463
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,720
Let's speed up!

464
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,900
Including that bastard, if anyone disrupts this march, kill them!

465
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,830
Yes, Sire!

466
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:46,990
He's not dead yet! I will take him.

467
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:47,880
You will?

468
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,230
I will make sure that I do not fall behind the group.

469
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:58,060
If you do fall behind, you must kill him yourself in order for you to live.

470
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,480
Will you still do it?

471
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,030
Just get me a stretcher.

472
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,760
Brother, just watch me.

473
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,000
I, Park Bul Hwa, will save Seung Nyang.

474
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,820
The emperor is entering!

475
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,960
Your Majesty!

476
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,920
Your Majesty, you're finally here.

477
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,870
Empress Dowager...

478
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:31,100
You've been through a lot. You've endured it well.

479
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,820
Please go into the Imperial Palace.

480
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,420
Your people are waiting.

481
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,090
Your Majesty, please take the throne.

482
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,940
Please sit comfortably.

483
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,720
You own that throne now.

484
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,330
Everyone, hark his words!

485
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:49,450
We have a new emperor in this Great Empire.

486
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,260
Your Majesty, please live a long and healthy life!

487
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,060
- Please live a long and healthy life, Your Majesty!
- Please live a long and healthy life, Your Majesty!

488
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,780
Long live the emperor! All hail!

489
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,240
Long live the Great Empire! All Hail!

490
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,090
- Long live the emperor! All Hail!
- Long live the emperor! All Hail!

491
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,750
- Long live the Great Empire! All Hail!
- Long live the emperor! All Hail!

492
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,320
- Long live the emperor! All Hail!
- Long live the emperor! All Hail!

493
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,060
- Long live the Great Empire! All Hail!
- - Long live the Great Empire! All Hail!

494
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,380
-- Long live the emperor! All Hail!
- Long live the emperor! All Hail!

495
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,160
- Long live the Great Empire! All Hail!
- Long live the Great Empire! All Hail!

496
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,650
- Long live the emperor! All Hail!
- Long live the emperor! All Hail!

497
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,660
- Long live the Great Empire! All Hail!
- Long live the Great Empire! All Hail!

498
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,910
- Long live the emperor! All Hail!
- Long live the emperor! All Hail!

499
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:32,270
- Long live the Great Empire! All Hail!
- Long live the Great Empire! All Hail!

500
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:36,370
The coronation will happen soon. Please be ready for it without fail.

501
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:37,380
Yes, Empress Dowager.

502
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:42,570
Before that... we must have a wedding.

503
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,180
Wedding?

504
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:49,590
His Majesty wants to have my daughter, Danashiri, as his empress.

505
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,990
Your Majesty, is this true?

506
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:57,470
I heard she was very pretty.

507
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:01,160
And... I will become Prime Minister's son-in-law,

508
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,070
so it's a way to have my cake and eat it. too.

509
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:06,490
That kind of matter falls under the Inner Court's jurisdiction.

510
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,790
You've decided on an empress without any discussion with me?

511
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:09,830
I just—

512
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:14,150
Your Majesty, I've never seen Danashiri's face.

513
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,270
You're disrespecting me with your decision.

514
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:21,130
Are you rejecting my daughter?

515
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,620
That is a way of disrespecting me, too.

516
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,700
Are you?

517
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,450
There are customs the imperial family has to follow.

518
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:34,000
Those customs, I will follow for you one by one.

519
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,110
Let's go, Your Majesty.

520
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,310
Prime Minister has finally shown his claws.

521
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:48,100
Even if I die, I will never let it happen.

522
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,810
But it's Prime Minister you're going up against who has the court and the military in his hands.

523
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:55,420
I also was the favorite of the late emperor!

524
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,000
I will not stand by and watch.

525
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:09,360
Why didn't you tell us you were getting married to Prime Minister's daughter?

526
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,750
Why didn't you ask me?

527
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,130
I'm the one who saved your life.

528
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:16,420
You should have discussed it with me!

529
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,500
Well, I will do that from now on.

530
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:25,040
- Oh, right. When are you bringing your incomparably beautiful niece?
- Never mind!

531
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,920
What do you mean? Royal concubines will be needed in the future, too.

532
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,590
I can't let my niece die from Danashiri's meddling.

533
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:36,480
Do you know anything about Danashiri?

534
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,490
What is she like since you're saying that?

535
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:42,410
Her personality is totally vicious.

536
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,280
Vicious?

537
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,940
She is known for her extreme jealousy, too.

538
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:50,580
On top of that, because she has her father's power behind her, she's like a bull in a china shop.

539
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,700
Vicious as well as a bull in a china shop...

540
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:59,020
During the day you'll have Prime Minister to tend with, at night, it's Danashiri. I don't know how you will manage.

541
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:03,370
It's my ill-luck. Who can I blame?

542
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:05,630
Your Highness, please be strong.

543
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,110
You're the emperor of the Great Empire now!

544
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:12,580
My time spent on Daecheong Island with Seung Nyang was better.

545
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:18,610
I was trying to become in-laws with the imperial family, and it became pointless.

546
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:22,640
You've barely made your first step. Don't feel hurried.

547
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,760
What a fool! What a fool! Who knew he would be such a fool?

548
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,200
Follow me.

549
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:47,270
Bayan, the Turks are causing trouble on the western border.

550
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,870
Why don't you go and help get rid of them?

551
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:56,840
The border area all of a sudden? Is it because you don't trust me?

552
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:01,110
To me, half of politics is suspicion.

553
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:05,160
The rest is getting rid of that suspicion.

554
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,850
We promise to the heavens that we never betrayed you!

555
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,840
Please believe us, Prime Minister!

556
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,990
Until you destroy the Turks and their entire clan,

557
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:19,010
you must never return.

558
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,720
It's strange. Very strange.

559
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,960
What do you mean?

560
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,300
That Seung Nyang. He has the scent of a woman.

561
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,270
Brother, how can you say that? Is it because you haven't been with a woman in a long time?

562
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,270
But look at him.

563
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,790
He looks prettier than most women.

564
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,810
Let's take a break!

565
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,720
We are taking a break!

566
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,850
Stop!

567
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,230
Seung Nyang.

568
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,370
Seung Nyang.

569
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,940
I have a request.

570
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:21,710
His Majesty is having a hard time due to the heat.

571
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:23,850
Please give me some water.

572
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,470
Are you thirsty?

573
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:36,220
I'm taking it to His Majesty. Give it to me.

574
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,210
I'll give it to you, sure.

575
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,750
Here. Try lapping it up like a dog.

576
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,780
Yeom Byeong Soo... I will rip you to shreds.

577
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,620
I will chew on your bones!

578
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,790
You must not die.

579
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:12,890
Just a little longer... Please hold on.

580
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,590
Stay down!

581
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:25,380
Hold it...

582
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,800
Huh? You're...

583
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,460
You know this bastard?

584
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,770
What are you doing here?

585
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,760
Actually, what are you doing here?

586
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,710
Is Danashiri that horrible?

587
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:50,000
There's a state of emergency in the palace with the news that she's coming.

588
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,760
Exactly how bad is her behavior that the rumors are so negative?

589
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,680
Does he even have the basic features?

590
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,270
Would I send you off to marry just anybody?

591
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:02,500
I heard he is the king of idiots.

592
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,590
Watch your mouth.

593
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,860
In a good light, in truth, this position is only "Empress" in name only.

594
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,740
What's the difference between being sold off!

595
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,410
Keep your composure. This is the Imperial Palace.

596
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,860
Even if she's beautiful,

597
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,920
I hate women who are ill-behaved and mean!

598
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,560
A man should be manly in order to be considered one.

599
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:23,050
If I have to marry someone who is foolish and is scared of everything, I'd rather--

600
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:25,320
Stop this already.

601
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,850
Stop.

602
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:48,660
Your Imperial Majesty, you came.

603
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,120
Welcome, Prime Minister.

604
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,370
His Imperial Majesty is here. Come out and say your greetings.

605
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,770
This girl requests to greet you, Your Imperial Majesty.

606
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,750
I heard that your vigor is extraordinary.

607
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:41,070
As I've heard, your eyes are full of grace and virtue.

608
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,980
Is that what you heard?

609
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,110
Get up.

610
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,740
Get up!

611
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,890
What are you doing?

612
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:35,720
I was right. The scent of a woman.

613
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,480
You are... a woman.

614
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,610
Don't be ridiculous.

615
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:56,630
♫ Because I’m dangerous, my love ♫

616
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:59,650
♫ The more you love me ultimately ♫

617
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,950
♫ the more only you may be hurt ♫
