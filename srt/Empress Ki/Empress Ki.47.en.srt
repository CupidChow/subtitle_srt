1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,690
His Majesty is sleeping right now.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,150
Yangyang!

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,320
Why are you doing this to me?

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,010
Why are you... you... why... are you doing this to me?

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,400
Ayu has become the crown prince,

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,010
so I no longer need you, Your Majesty.

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,030
Yangyang, how can you do this to me?

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,960
You are the mortal enemy of my father and Wang Yoo.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,610
It is right for me to avenge their death with my own hands.

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,620
No! No, Yang!

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,590
Look at you now, Emperor.

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,580
Empress Dowager.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,460
What did I tell you?

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,270
That throne you sit at, it makes brothers kill each other, and father and sons kill each other. Didn't I tell you?

15
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,360
Shut your mouth. Please shut your mouth.

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,010
You were too naive, Emperor,

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,980
when you will just end up killed by Chief Imperial Consort in vain.

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,010
Stop, stop... stop, please!

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,880
Stop!

20
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,990
Yang! No, put down that bow.

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,480
Yang! Empress Dowager!

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,140
Yang!

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,810
Your Majesty.

24
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,150
Yang, please, you cannot betray me...

25
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,520
Your Majesty.

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,950
Put your arrow away...

27
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,670
Your Majesty?

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,370
What kind of dreams are you dreaming?

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,070
You tried to kill me! You!

30
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,700
Blinded by power, you pointed your arrow at me!

31
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,870
Your Majesty, it was just a dream.

32
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,480
You had a dream...

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,340
Your Majesty.

34
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,170
Please come to your senses, Your Majesty.

35
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,780
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,260
Did you drink wine before sleeping again?

37
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,660
I didn't drink any wine, not even one cup.

38
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,290
So stop nagging me.

39
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,340
I'm sorry, Yang.

40
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,940
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,820
The vassals are petitioning for the removal of the prime minister.

42
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,490
What?

43
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,260
His Imperial Majesty the Emperor enters!

44
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:14,160
Your Majesty, Empress Bayan tried to frame Chief Imperial Consort for the attempted murder of Prince Maha.

45
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,560
Her plot was an attempt to usurp power. That is no different from treason.

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,620
Her uncle is the prime minister, so he must also answer for the crime. His dismissal is proper—

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,020
Stop this please!

48
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,960
Your Majesty, every vassal in the Imperial Court is in agreement.

49
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,910
Please see our point of view.

50
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,220
Please see our point of view, Your Majesty!

51
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,220
Your Majesty, please dismiss me from my position!

52
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,190
Your Majesty, please dismiss me from my position!

53
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,280
Please dismiss me from my position, Your Majesty!

54
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,720
Prime Minister,

55
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
you said you were not involved with the deposed empress's plot.

56
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,060
But I caused you to worry due to my foolish niece.

57
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,120
How can I wash away my disloyalty?

58
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,430
I do not have the right to this seal.

59
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,490
Have you all seen this?

60
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:42,090
Prime Minister is offering to leave his position out of consideration for my feelings.

61
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,980
He is thinking about my well-being.

62
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,950
Then please take his seal.

63
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,490
But...

64
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:56,340
none of you care about my feelings.

65
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,430
All you do is yell at me, asking me to see your point of view.

66
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,190
Your Majesty, we are thinking about the peace and safety of our kingdom—

67
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,610
My peace and safety is the peace and safety of this kingdom.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,620
And the prime minister is my own pride.

69
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,890
Your Majesty...

70
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,360
If anyone dares to accuse Prime Minister of any crimes,

71
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,490
I will interpret it as disdain towards me and you will be punished accordingly.

72
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,700
So be informed.

73
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:05,100
You moved the Imperial Court vassals like your own hands and feet. Quite Impressive, Your Highness.

74
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,320
No, you are the impressive one.

75
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,380
It would have been proper to take responsibility and step aside, but you managed to earn His Majesty's trust instead.

76
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:24,230
If I step aside, this kingdom will be yours. So I must save this kingdom from ruin.

77
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,160
So you're declaring war against me?

78
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,460
A war is between equals.

79
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,770
Do you really think you are a match for me?

80
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,970
Two sides do not fight simply because they are a match,

81
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,260
they fight because they have no other choice.

82
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,460
It won't end with just you disappearing.

83
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,460
Because I intend to wipe out all foreigners on this land, not just Goryeo people.

84
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,140
I want a peaceful world.

85
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:05,050
But it appears that between you and I, one of us must disappear

86
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,710
for peace to be achieved.

87
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,230
It won't take long

88
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,280
for the day of peace to come.

89
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,810
I will look forward to it, Prime Minister.

90
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,650
You should stop now.

91
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,800
You may become sicker. That will be bad.

92
00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:00,190
He will be here for a few days to offer Buddhist prayers.

93
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,250
Your Majesty, will you meet Maha?

94
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,080
For Chief Imperial Consort's sake, you should never

95
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,770
tell Maha that you are his father.

96
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,560
What are you praying for?

97
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,940
Wang Yoo.

98
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,940
If you are here to take vengeance against me...

99
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,680
I didn't come here to see you.

100
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:17,610
But you seem full of anxiety.

101
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,400
Do you think that just because you are not the emperor's son, you are nothing?

102
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,210
I thought you were better than that.

103
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:36,170
Whether your father is the emperor or a beggar on the street,

104
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,430
Maha, you are you.

105
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:52,140
Even if you are an emperor's son, if you are not worthy, you will cause your nation to be ruined.

106
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:59,930
And even if you are a street beggar's son, if you are worthy, you can raise a nation.

107
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,650
Do you feel pity for me?

108
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,300
Why say such things to me?

109
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,300
If you don't want sympathy

110
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,590
then become strong on your own.

111
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:22,120
I'm sorry, my son. This is the only thing I can do to comfort you right now.

112
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,010
Your Majesty, it's time for you to go now.

113
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,790
Can we meet again?

114
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,430
I will visit you here sometimes.

115
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,950
Now I can see that he resembles me a lot.

116
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,470
Chief Imperial Consort said she would send Maha to Goryeo?

117
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,510
She said she would after he recovers.

118
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,640
I hope that the poison doesn't spread throughout his body.

119
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,660
When the time is right, I will take him.

120
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,470
So tell Park Bul Hwa about that.

121
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,900
Do you intend to tell Maha the secret?

122
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:48,010
I cannot leave that child to be alone, like that.

123
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:53,140
When we arrive in Goryeo, I will reveal to him that he is mine and Chief Imperial Consort's son.

124
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

125
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,220
In Goryeo, even if Maha knows the secret,

126
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,970
it can't hurt him.

127
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,610
What... What did they say?

128
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:18,360
Maha... is Wang Yoo and Chief Imperial Consort...

129
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,450
Chief Imperial Consort Ki's son?

130
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,850
Here I am.

131
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,980
Where are you?

132
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,260
Where are you?

133
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,600
Catch me if you can.

134
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,980
Here I am, Your Majesty.

135
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,820
Catch me if you can.

136
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,040
Catch me if you can, Your Majesty.

137
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,690
Your Majesty, here I am.

138
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,230
Where are you?

139
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,500
What? Why is everyone quiet now?

140
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,170
Oh, you're trying to trick me, huh?

141
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,960
All right, let's see who wins.

142
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,420
Come to me.

143
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,100
That's right. I won.

144
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,580
I caught you.

145
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,340
I...

146
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,080
Chief Imperial Consort.

147
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,400
Chief Imperial Consort was caught. So put this blindfold on.

148
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,150
Your Majesty.

149
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,190
Don't say anything, please.

150
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:38,750
Today, I'm feeling so good.

151
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,800
Why are you feeling good?

152
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,520
All right.

153
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,390
Look. The sky is clear,

154
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,080
the flowers are abundant,

155
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,820
and yes... I caught my Chief Imperial Consort.

156
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:09,630
So now, Chief Imperial Consort, she is "it."

157
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:15,210
I caught her, so how can I not feel good?

158
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,840
Did you forget what the doctor said?

159
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,010
If you keep drinking, you will collapse someday...

160
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:32,430
If I drink, I don't have those nightmares.

161
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,260
Ridiculous nightmares in which you try to kill me.

162
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,330
Your Majesty.

163
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,990
Yangyang,

164
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,210
so please leave me alone.

165
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,090
Your Majesty!

166
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,000
Prime Minister.

167
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,760
Prime Minister... Prime Minister, I'm so glad you came.

168
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,520
I was about to lose my taste for wine.

169
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,180
Let's drink together.

170
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,270
There is something I need your permission for.

171
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,920
Again, again, again?

172
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,760
It's an important matter.

173
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,820
Please examine the document and put your seal on it.

174
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,010
Golta, give Prime Minister the imperial seal.

175
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,930
Won't you even look at the document first?

176
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,480
Prime Minister is me, and I am Prime Minister.

177
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,210
Prime Minister is my alter ego.

178
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,360
But, Your Majesty, you must not give your seal to him carelessly—

179
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,380
What are you waiting for, Golta?

180
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,240
Hurry and give him the seal.

181
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,530
Yes, Your Majesty. Please follow me, Prime Minister.

182
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:00,030
Prime Minister, be on your way, Prime Minister.

183
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,360
Let's have a drink next time.

184
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,830
Everyone, have more to drink.

185
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,160
The weather is so nice today.

186
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,880
Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty

187
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,750
What is this document?

188
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,030
Rearranging some official posts.

189
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,010
Uncle.

190
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,910
Why are you so surprised?

191
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,620
The people who are written here, they have outstanding ability and dignity.

192
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,860
Not to mention, legal, military, affairs of state, and finance—

193
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,240
Yes, they are all on Chief Imperial Consort Ki's side.

194
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,730
You cannot dismiss talented people due to factional strife.

195
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,580
What this kingdom needs are not ability, but loyalty.

196
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,870
You can't tell a talented person apart from a parasite? Just what are you thinking of these days?

197
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,180
But, Uncle, our kingdom is in fast decline.

198
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,100
If you are really thinking about our nation—

199
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,830
My words are the imperial command.

200
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:30,660
Don't you see this imperial seal? My judgment, my decision,

201
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,080
they represent what His Majesty wants.

202
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,810
Not just these guys, the Three Excellencies, and the commanders of the military,

203
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:46,000
anyone who supports Chief Imperial Consort Ki, I will round them all up and get rid of them.

204
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,800
That is what we must do to save our kingdom and raise its dignity.

205
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,620
Our national treasury is nearly depleted.

206
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,070
Figure out a way to add to it.

207
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,320
Stop.

208
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,190
Chief Imperial Consort! Please save us!

209
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,470
Chief Imperial Consort!

210
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,620
Please save us!

211
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,240
Chief Imperial Consort! Please save us!

212
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,610
Help us!

213
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,030
What do you think you're doing?

214
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:49,830
They've embezzled from the national treasury to fulfill their personal greed.

215
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,420
If they've committed such crimes, show me the evidence.

216
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,470
This has His Majesty's imperial seal on it and my seal as well.

217
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:07,790
The legal minister and the military minister. If you try to save them, then you would be violating an imperial command.

218
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,540
They are innocent.

219
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:16,000
If your goal is to remove me, then point your sword directly at me.

220
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,880
They are not innocent, because their acts are contributing to the ruin of our nation.

221
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,700
So are you saying that I am ruining this nation?

222
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,270
Do you disagree?

223
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,700
You are the one ruining this nation.

224
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,070
This type of reign of terror is making this nation sick.

225
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,070
You are mistaken.

226
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:45,180
This nation is not yours, Chief Imperial Consort.

227
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:51,360
This nation belongs to me and my people. It belongs to the Mongols.

228
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,520
I am this nation's Chief Imperial Consort.

229
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,790
But you are a Goryeo person, down to your bones.

230
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,490
Prime Minister!

231
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,120
You can't mistake blood.

232
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,900
Bad blood needs to be extracted before the body gets sick.

233
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,560
That bad blood flows inside

234
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,200
the next emperor as well.

235
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:23,220
It seems you briefly forgot that I am the mother of the future emperor.

236
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:30,110
So whose blood will flow next?

237
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,240
Let's wait and see.

238
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,110
Your Highness!

239
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,410
Your Highness the Chief Imperial Consort!

240
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,780
Crown Prince.

241
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:54,990
You must become a strong and courageous emperor.

242
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,190
You must carry your sword, ride on your horse, and conquer the whole world.

243
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:05,540
Mother told me to rule with virtue and protect the weak.

244
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,140
In order to be virtuous, you must have strength.

245
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,200
How can a weak emperor help anyone or be virtuous?

246
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,610
Nearby countries including Goryeo are always looking for a chance to attack us.

247
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,630
If you are not strong, you get devoured. That is the logic of the world.

248
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,180
But isn't Goryeo my mother's land?

249
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,000
Did your mother tell you that?

250
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,800
The servants said so.

251
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,580
That when I become the emperor, I would do things for Goryeo—

252
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:45,310
Crown Prince! You must never

253
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,810
say the word "Goryeo" in front of me.

254
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,820
You are my child, do you understand?

255
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,160
Father, you frighten me.

256
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,700
Mother!

257
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,970
What's wrong?

258
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,610
Please take Crown Prince away.

259
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

260
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,620
Let's go, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

261
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,750
Your Majesty, please stop Prime Minister's tyranny.

262
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,050
Prime Minister is fixing this nation right now.

263
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:29,720
Is getting rid of talented officials good for the nation?

264
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,880
Chief Imperial Consort, why are you so anxious?

265
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,920
Your Majesty.

266
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:43,100
Does it hurt you so much to see people on your side being removed?

267
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,860
All I want is for you to be a good mother to the crown prince.

268
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:52,630
Telling him about Goryeo or whatever? Stop telling him such strange things.

269
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,400
I see.

270
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:01,690
So even you, Your Majesty, you only ever saw me as a Goryeo person.

271
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,380
It's not like that.

272
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,190
Do you still not know that when you interfere in governing this nation, you are causing disturbance in this palace?

273
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:19,250
If only for Ayu's sake, please just stay quiet.

274
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,760
Prime Minister is not the only one who cares about this nation.

275
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,680
More than anyone, I also care about this nation—

276
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,360
Then!

277
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,030
You should have killed Wang Yoo.

278
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,600
You dared to save Wang Yoo, right in front of me.

279
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,910
Wang Yoo, a criminal guilty of high treason against this nation.

280
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,070
Your Majesty.

281
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,650
I no longer want to hear from you.

282
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,610
Do not interfere in governance anymore.

283
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,650
It is my imperial command, do you understand?

284
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,970
Stop interfering in the affairs of this nation!

285
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,320
Leader,

286
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,620
do you want us to meet with Bayan?

287
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,700
But, Leader,

288
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,630
Bayan will kill us as soon as he sees us.

289
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,500
Give him this document and do exactly what we tell you.

290
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,270
Then you will gain his trust.

291
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,580
So you've decided on Bayan?

292
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,760
The emperor's heart is leaving Chief Imperial Consort.

293
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,470
So Bayan should be the winner, no?

294
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:25,450
Whoever gets the power, we just have to use them to earn money.

295
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:32,960
Then very soon in the future, a world that is only ruled by money will come to us.

296
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,760
Someone from Hawk House came to see me?

297
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,890
Prime Minister, have you been well?

298
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,420
You dare to come and see me?

299
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,770
So you two want to die, huh?

300
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:04,320
My neck... ! Before you strike my neck

301
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,080
please look at this first.

302
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,650
Isn't that a list of immigrant merchants?

303
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:28,600
If you confiscate their shops, the state treasury will be filled.

304
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,140
And you will get rid of annoying immigrants, too.

305
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,320
Isn't this "killing two birds with one stone?"

306
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,460
Hawk House is evil, they helped El Temür in the past.

307
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,990
But now they will help me?

308
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:48,750
Hawk House suffered great losses due to immigrant merchants, especially Goryeo merchants.

309
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,480
If Prime Minister will get rid of them, our leader

310
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,640
will give you a large amount of money that you can use to govern.

311
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,010
Move!

312
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,500
I will kill those bastards...

313
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,870
You must calm down.

314
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:39,860
Bayan destroys the shops and Hawk House takes over them?

315
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,600
Is our merchant association doing well?

316
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,750
Goryeo merchants are suffering the bulk of the harm.

317
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,090
We must find a solution as soon as possible.

318
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:54,140
How can Chief Imperial Consort help us?

319
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,660
Our alliance with Chief Imperial Consort is finished.

320
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,300
What?

321
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,230
Yes, I see.

322
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,160
Moo Song, get in contact with Soori.

323
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,490
He may be able to find out the secrets of Hawk House.

324
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

325
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,430
Look at all these assets.

326
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:22,630
We just hit a few shops, but the amount we confiscated is huge.

327
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,350
Winning Bayan's trust is only a matter of time.

328
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,200
General.

329
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,420
- It's been a long time...
- Oh!

330
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,670
Why are you doing this?

331
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,660
How dare you cloud Prime Minister's judgment with your wicked silver tongue?

332
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,900
General, all these

333
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,180
are assets we confiscated from the merchants.

334
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,260
Even if we only rob the shops in Yeongyeong like this—

335
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,260
Shut your mouth.

336
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,150
I will kill you right now and throw your heads into a pig sty.

337
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,220
No, no, wait! General—

338
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,530
Put your sword away.

339
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:08,860
Uncle, please stop oppressing the merchants immediately.

340
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,390
They are immigrant merchants who are sucking the blood out of the Yuan people.

341
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,490
This nation was built by immigrants.

342
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,600
And that's why it's such a mess right now.

343
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,320
Our nation's economy has already reached a point of a complete breakdown.

344
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,240
If the nation's commerce collapses, it won't be just the merchants,

345
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,540
but all the people of Yuan will starve to death.

346
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,180
The nation must be rich and powerful

347
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,740
for the people to live well.

348
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,490
But if the people are poor, who benefits from a rich and powerful nation?

349
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,460
So you are insisting on interfering with my work?

350
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,660
I can't back off on this issue.

351
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,470
Uncle, you are killing our people claiming to save the nation—

352
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,350
This boy!

353
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,510
How dare you try to lecture me?

354
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:07,080
Prime Minister or not, if you are ignorant, you must learn.

355
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,230
What did you say?

356
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,770
Courage without knowledge brings destruction.

357
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,990
- Shut your mouth!
- Prime Minister, please calm down.

358
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,970
Toqto'a, more than anyone else,

359
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,600
you must not disobey me.

360
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,010
Bring them, one by one.

361
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,230
Please let me live! Please let me live!

362
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,680
We are not going to kill you.

363
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,370
We will brand your face.

364
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,280
Those who are branded cannot be merchants in Yuan again.

365
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,720
Begin.

366
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:09,610
No! No! Please!

367
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,060
What do you think you're doing?

368
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,580
Stop this right now.

369
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,560
You should not be here, Chief Imperial Consort.

370
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,730
How cowardly.

371
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,910
Instead of blocking Prime Minister's tyranny, you are going along with it?

372
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,740
What you want from me, I cannot do it.

373
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,970
It's not that you can't, it's that you won't.

374
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,540
As long as he is under His Majesty's protection,

375
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,760
no one can touch Prime Minister.

376
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,700
So you are giving up?

377
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,950
It's not giving up, it's refusal.

378
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,500
Because this isn't something that I can do.

379
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,120
Teacher.

380
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:33,750
There is only one thing I can do for you, Chief Imperial Consort.

381
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:39,170
Please stop this fight.

382
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,050
Not only is everything you've achieved so far at risk,

383
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,280
but your life will be in danger as well.

384
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,550
I will fight until the end.

385
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,980
I am not a coward like someone I know.

386
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,970
What did you pray for?

387
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:21,230
That if my parents are dead, that they had a gentle and easy death.

388
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:28,080
And if they are alive, I prayed to meet them again.

389
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,240
What did you pray for?

390
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:46,030
I prayed that your prayer can come true.

391
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,460
Why did you smile?

392
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,110
Just...

393
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,040
my smile happened without my realizing it.

394
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,690
You don't look well.

395
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,060
I'm all right. Don't worry.

396
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:57,080
Your Majesty, do you want to go see a fun sight with me outside the palace?

397
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,670
A fun sight?

398
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:29,060
Some food, please. Please.

399
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,650
Someone, please save us!

400
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,740
Chief Imperial Consort.

401
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,690
Is this really a fun sight?

402
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,520
I'm sorry.

403
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,070
If I told you the truth, I didn't think you would come.

404
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,630
So I lied to you.

405
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,120
- Let's go now.
- Your Majesty.

406
00:35:54,590 --> 00:36:00,320
Every day, thousands of your people are dying of hunger.

407
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,610
But Prime Minister is still trapped in the glories of the past

408
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,280
and he is ignoring the suffering of the people.

409
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,740
This is not for you to interfere with, Chief Imperial Consort.

410
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:15,490
I provided grain for the people with the money I received from Wang Yoo.

411
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,350
I was afraid that the people's resentment would be aimed towards you.

412
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,910
Chief Imperial Consort.

413
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,200
It's not too late. Don't chase glory and power,

414
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,740
and take care of the people.

415
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,010
You must save the people from Prime Minister's tyranny.

416
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,060
How can I fear shadows

417
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,630
and expect to achieve a great cause?

418
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,240
Your people are dying.

419
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,510
So who is this great cause for?

420
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,140
I trust in Prime Minister.

421
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:55,540
His loyalty, his methods, and his passion will save this kingdom.

422
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,110
So stop trying to persuade me.

423
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,960
Make way. His Imperial Majesty is coming.

424
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,400
Make way.

425
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,010
Your Majesty, please look at the gaze of your people.

426
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,370
They show their resentment and anger towards you.

427
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,580
You must not ignore public sentiment.

428
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,310
Wang Yoo.

429
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,650
What's wrong now?

430
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,680
Wang Yoo, it's Wang Yoo. Wang Yoo is here.

431
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,200
Are you seeing things again?

432
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,690
It's Wang Yoo for sure.

433
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,130
Wang Yoo is mocking me...

434
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,210
Your Majesty?

435
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,880
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

436
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,160
Please come to your senses, Your Majesty!

437
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,060
Hurry and bring His Majesty to the palace.

438
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,630
Will His Majesty be all right?

439
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:33,800
Due to excessive drinking, his heart is damaged.

440
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,210
Then, what will happen?

441
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,610
Fortunately, he is out of danger.

442
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,540
But I'm not sure when he will wake.

443
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,460
We cannot let him pass away like this.

444
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,650
You must make sure he lives.

445
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:53,200
Yes, Your Highness. I will do all that I can.

446
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,750
Emperor?

447
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,970
Your Majesty, what happened?

448
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,620
You cannot collapse like this so suddenly.

449
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,630
- How long has he been like this?
- Well...

450
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,380
You can leave now.

451
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,490
What?

452
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:32,220
I will make sure to take him to Goryeo.

453
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,050
Y-Yes.

454
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,410
Then I will go.

455
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,030
It's gold.

456
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,070
With that, you can live comfortably anywhere.

457
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,310
Thank you.

458
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,070
Your Highness.

459
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,750
Your Highness?

460
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,420
Please come to your senses, Your Highness.

461
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,810
Your Highness?

462
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,120
Your Highness??

463
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,610
Your Highness...

464
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,380
Your Highness.

465
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,850
Did you prepare a carriage Maha can ride in?

466
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,540
Yes, I prepared a two-horse carriage for him.

467
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,330
But why is it taking so long?

468
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:58,250
Your Majesty, you seem very happy.

469
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:05,290
When we reach Goryeo, I can call him "son." How can I not be happy?

470
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,920
Court Lady Seo just came out.

471
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:15,060
I will go and bring him.

472
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,850
Eunuch Park?

473
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:31,870
His Highness passed away.

474
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,110
No...

475
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,010
No, it's can't be.

476
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,760
His Majesty is outside waiting for him.

477
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,060
Your Highness... Your Highness...

478
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,250
Your Majesty...

479
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,450
What's wrong?

480
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,350
Your Majesty.

481
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,760
What's wrong with Maha?

482
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,950
His Highness went to Heaven.

483
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,710
Maha?

484
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,670
Open your eyes.

485
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,150
Your Majesty.

486
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,630
Your Majesty...

487
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,720
Maha? I am your father.

488
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,760
I am your father who failed you.

489
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,420
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty...

490
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,910
Maha... Maha?

491
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,860
You must not die like this.

492
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,840
Maha? Maha?

493
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,860
Maha?

494
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,360
Maha!

495
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,630
Your Majesty!

496
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,490
Maha? Come to your senses.

497
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,830
No!!

498
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,670
Your Majesty?

499
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:33,150
Someday, you will realize my sincerity.

500
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,220
What I did

501
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:44,930
in order to protect you... you must know it all.

502
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,460
So please don't be sick.

503
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,830
Don't be lonely, Your Majesty.

504
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,340
Your Highness?

505
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,230
I've returned, Your Highness.

506
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:16,000
And Star? How is he?

507
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,770
Don't tell Chief Imperial Consort of Maha's death.

508
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,900
Why do you say that?

509
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,220
Later,

510
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:35,640
tell her that I took him to Goryeo.

511
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,450
She suffered more than enough pain.

512
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:50,010
I don't want her to suffer more pain because of Maha.

513
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,580
He is slowly improving.

514
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,450
Your Highness, Head Eunuch Dok Man sent you a message.

515
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,430
He says that Prime Minister and Empress Dowager's activities are suspicious.

516
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,540
Please ask the vassals to gather in the Great Hall.

517
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,420
Yes, Your Highness.

518
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,630
This is the best chance we have to cast out the Chief Imperial Consort.

519
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,050
What do you mean?

520
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:31,010
The emperor is sick, so the last person who will protect the Chief Imperial Consort is gone.

521
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:35,060
According to the doctor, we don't know when the emperor might awaken.

522
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:40,560
Use this opportunity to get rid of Chief Imperial Consort and anyone she has influence over.

523
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,270
This chance is a gift from the heavens.

524
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,070
But when His Majesty awakens—

525
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:48,600
We can create plenty of crimes to accuse her of until then.

526
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,100
Since we're at it, conspiracy to commit treason will be good.

527
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,730
- Conspiracy to commit treason, huh?
- Yes.

528
00:46:54,730 --> 00:47:01,550
We will tell His Majesty that while he was unconscious, Chief Imperial Consort and her cabal staged a revolt to grab power.

529
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,360
And the traitors were beheaded. How could he object?

530
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,940
Empress Dowager!

531
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,940
A big disaster.

532
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,780
Disaster?

533
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,150
Vassals have gathered in the Great Hall to decide on regency.

534
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,400
Regency?

535
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,230
Chief Imperial Consort will be the regent?

536
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,520
Chief Imperial Consort, why are you sitting there?

537
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,940
What do you mean? His Majesty is ill and cannot see to the affairs of the state.

538
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,990
So Crown Prince is ruling in his stead. Isn't that how things are done?

539
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,210
Since His Highness the Crown Prince is young,

540
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:50,560
we requested his mother to serve as Regent. All the vassals are in agreement.

541
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,640
Chief Imperial Consort will reign over this kingdom? Does that make sense?

542
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:00,380
Prime Minister, this matter was decided according to law and procedure. How can you ignore that?

543
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,740
This is about who will rule this kingdom!

544
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,430
Law and procedure are not what is important here!

545
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:12,640
So you ignore law and procedure? Is that why you are such a tyrant?

546
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,530
Chief Imperial Consort!

547
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,990
The reason I accepted to be Regent

548
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:23,350
is so I can set right this kingdom that you ruined, Prime Minister.

549
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:26,680
That is absurd. How can you sit on the Dragon Throne?

550
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:34,630
Empress Dowager, if you continue to oppose my regency, you will answer for the crime of disobeying an imperial command.

551
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,390
Lords, hear me.

552
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,830
The state coffers are nearly empty.

553
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:46,590
This is due to the incompetence of Empress Dowager who'd been in charge of the finance office.

554
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,640
So we must remove her authority and take her seal.

555
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,380
And I will entrust the finance office to Head Eunuch Dok Man.

556
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,730
The finance office will be entrusted to a eunuch?

557
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:03,900
In addition, the full authority to command the military in the capital and the palace,

558
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,420
I will give it to Park Bul Hwa.

559
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,850
I accept your command.

560
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,830
I accept your command.

561
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,580
So you're giving the key posts in the palace to Goryeo people?

562
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:27,360
And, Prime Minister, you will turn over His Majesty's seal and your seal.

563
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:38,090
Abuse of authority causes the discipline to sour. So you have no right to possess those seals, Prime Minister.

564
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:12,590
The safety of His Majesty the Emperor and Her Highness the Chief Imperial Consort

565
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:16,490
is our priority. Put your lives on the line!

566
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:19,560
We pledge our loyalty!

567
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:56,950
A fight for power is like hunting rabbits.

568
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:02,740
Who finds it first and who pulls the bow first determines victory or defeat.

569
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:10,430
If you were a little late, you would have been removed.

570
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:16,310
Before His Majesty awakens, the hunt must be finished.

571
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:22,800
Do you still refuse to help me?

572
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:29,930
Look for the "Art of War" by Sun Tzu in the library.

573
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,610
My response is in there.

574
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,090
["Art of War" by Sun Tzu]

575
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,700
What's wrong?

576
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:19,510
The corruption of Bayan's advisors is recorded here.

577
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,650
There is no evidence of Bayan's corruption in here.

578
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:42,500
Family always protects its own. It looks like Toqto'a

579
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,540
left out the records of Bayan's corruption.

580
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,510
I don't think Bayan is corrupt.

581
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:52,020
Bayan is violent, but he's not the type to climb up dishonestly.

582
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:55,290
What do we do about the officials written in here?

583
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,870
It will be Ayu's birthday soon.

584
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:02,130
I'm thinking of having a party and only inviting these people.

585
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:05,980
A party? They are Bayan's close advisors.

586
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:10,490
Of course, that is why I must serve them something special.

587
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:18,340
I better have His Majesty stay at Heungdeok Palace starting today.

588
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:24,410
Please ask Court Lady Hong to prepare for that.

589
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

590
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:35,060
Thank you for agreeing to my invitation.

591
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,360
Bring the food.

592
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,170
It is a cool bowl of fresh water.

593
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,170
You are going too far with your joke.

594
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:06,320
When the people are starving, how can we enjoy a feast

595
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,110
just because it's Crown Prince's birthday?

596
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,950
We will take our leave.

597
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,660
I am not finished.

598
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:37,870
Sergeant of Political Affairs. You sold political positions for large amounts of money.

599
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:41,430
Agricultural Minister, you are the same. You falsified documents

600
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:45,870
to extort assets from the people without notice.

601
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:48,690
Cultural Minister. You embezzled from the national tax

602
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:54,170
and used the money to build an enormous house.

603
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,240
These are not all.

604
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,110
Including the Privy Councillor and the Chief of Royal Inspectors,

605
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,730
everyone here

606
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:10,620
climbed the ranks dishonestly. I have the records here.

607
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:17,560
Even plain water is too good for you.

608
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,760
But today is Crown Prince's birthday, after all.

609
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,760
So I put something special in the water.

610
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,270
By something special, do you mean... ?

611
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:33,520
I put poison in it.

612
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:43,260
If you believe that you are innocent, drink that poisoned water.

613
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:50,920
To pay for my crime of having killed an innocent person, I will leave my position.

614
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,430
But if you do not drink that poisoned water

615
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:00,760
that will mean that you are acknowledging the charges written in here

616
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,060
and I will make you pay dearly for your crimes.

617
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:12,120
I will count to three. Before then,

618
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,690
make your decision.

619
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:16,350
One.

620
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:19,030
Two.

621
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,770
Uncle.

622
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,640
Let go of me.

623
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:28,670
You promised to leave your position.

624
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,700
There is no poison in the water.

625
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:51,020
But officials, you have acknowledged your guilt.

626
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:03,870
Except for Prime Minister and Toqto'a,

627
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:08,010
drag everyone out and put them in prison.

628
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,280
Yes!

629
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,110
- Carry out the order.
- Yes!

630
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,930
What brings you here?

631
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:38,850
I have something to tell His Majesty.

632
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,020
His Majesty cannot meet anyone right now.

633
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:45,140
It's a very important matter.

634
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,190
Golta...

635
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:56,910
Your Majesty, have you come to your senses?

636
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:04,760
Your Majesty, can you hear what I have to tell you?

637
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:10,880
Yes. Go ahead.

638
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,190
Your Majesty... Prince Maha...

639
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,760
He is...

640
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:31,340
♫ Because I’m dangerous, my love ♫

641
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:36,960
♫ The more you love me ultimately, the more only you may be hurt ♫

642
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,970
♫ Don't test me or my love ♫

643
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:45,850
♫ I can’t ever, ever, ever, ever, ever ♫

644
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:48,380
♫ I cannot love you ♫
