1
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,080
You...

2
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,840
Yang... You!

3
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,870
You...

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,430
I miss you.

5
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,100
Where are you?

6
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,460
If the person you miss...

7
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,610
is the King of Goryeo...

8
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,820
What brings you here?

9
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,120
The empress is probably in her quarters.

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,580
Fine. I'll pretend to not know you.

11
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,250
Just like you did to me,

12
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,940
I'll also ignore you completely.

13
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,940
I'm certain he's caught onto something...

14
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,980
It's not fun. No matter what I do, it doesn't excite me.

15
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,890
Your Majesty, I got word that Empress Dowager wants you at the inner court.

16
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,660
The inner court?

17
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,770
Tell her I can't come.

18
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,160
She doesn't feel well and is asking for you.

19
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,450
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

20
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,800
Come on, stop it!

21
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,880
I know, so stop nagging!

22
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,040
His Majesty is waiting. Hurry up! Hurry!

23
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,820
I heard you care greatly about her.

24
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,970
Yes... Yes...

25
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,920
Eat slowly, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,130
You should eat, too.

27
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,620
Your Majesty...

28
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,220
By your mouth...

29
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,290
It's nice to see the two of you together.

30
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,090
- Yang...
-Yes, My Lady.

31
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,740
Your Majesty, are you all right?

32
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,860
Hurry up and give him a handkerchief.

33
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,710
What's the matter with me?

34
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,510
I'll call as needed, so everyone leave.

35
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,370
You don't look too well today.

36
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,090
Did something happen?

37
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,640
Let's eat!

38
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,250
Let's!

39
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,530
We nearly starved! His Majesty came so suddenly.

40
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,950
Take your time eating.

41
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,700
Have a lot.

42
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,210
They're only finally getting to eat now?

43
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,490
The servants don't have a set mealtime.

44
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,740
Who cares?

45
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,310
Whether she suffers or not, whether she works all her life as a servant or not...

46
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,060
What! W-What... What are you doing?

47
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,090
Your Highness!

48
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,520
Whoa!

49
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,650
I'm so happy. I'm so happy that you're alive!

50
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,690
To think after all that, she wasn't a boy but a girl...

51
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,680
Your Majesty...

52
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,120
What's with that food the servants are eating?

53
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,450
No side dishes? Even dog food looks better.

54
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,570
What did I do that you're being like this?

55
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,950
Idiot eunuch.

56
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,680
Yang! Yang! Hurry up. Let's go to the pavilion.

57
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
Pavilion? Why?

58
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,530
The emperor gifted us with food for our work.

59
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,160
The other servants are already there.

60
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,080
I'm not going, you go ahead.

61
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,380
But it's from the emperor.

62
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,520
When would we ever eat something like this again?

63
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,990
I said I'm not going.

64
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,500
So, were the servants happy?

65
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,490
They're all touched by your imperial grace.

66
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,040
Of course, they should be. They would never have had a chance to eat such precious food in their lives.

67
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,590
Where are you going?

68
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,440
By chance, is it to see the servants?

69
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,440
Come on now!

70
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,620
Never.

71
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,410
What was it? It's not because I want to see her.

72
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,320
Never.

73
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,460
Delicious!

74
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,090
It's amazing.

75
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,220
Try this, too.

76
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:18,060
But... But.. what happened?

77
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,160
What do you mean?

78
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,140
Ah, Seung Nyang!

79
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,480
Ah... I don't see Seung Nyang.

80
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,060
She said she wasn't eating.

81
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,860
Not eating? Why do you think I sent them the food?

82
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,140
You told me to stop paying attention to Seung Nyang.

83
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,520
Hey, seriously... Hey!

84
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,240
Ah, seriously...

85
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,420
Prepare another feast table.

86
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,610
Pardon?

87
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,930
Bring Seung Nyang again, you eunuch idiot!

88
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,290
My god!

89
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,060
Such an idiot. You have no sense at all!

90
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,130
Seriously, there's nothing you do well.

91
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,990
Idiot.

92
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,010
Now, eat.

93
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,610
I'm all right.

94
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,550
Whatever I give her, even food, she doesn't want it?

95
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,600
It's because you helped Lady Park with her morning sickness.

96
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,170
This is your reward for that, so please eat.

97
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,180
I'm full.

98
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,040
I'll leave then.

99
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,440
Let me go.

100
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,600
Why don't you like it?

101
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,770
Every woman in the palace is dying to be in my embrace.

102
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,010
Your joke goes too far!

103
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,110
How dare you!

104
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,750
How dare a servant call my actions a joke?

105
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,940
Also, the way you look at me...

106
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,210
is impudent.

107
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,390
I'm sorry.

108
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,880
Hurry and eat.

109
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,890
Let go of my hand.

110
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,380
I'm uncomfortable.

111
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,100
When she's done eating,

112
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,820
send her back to her quarters.

113
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

114
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,550
Hurry and eat. What are you doing?

115
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,400
Why is my heart beating so much? No way...

116
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,970
Am I more scared of her than the prime minister?

117
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,630
I'm sure he realized I'm Seung Nyang.

118
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,610
If not, how could he...

119
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,550
Let's go get them!

120
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,500
General, Sir!

121
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,050
The deposed king succeeded in luring away Baghatur!

122
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,070
It's time for you to go into battle.

123
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,320
When I open up their camp, move in with the soldiers.

124
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,900
Yes, Uncle.

125
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,690
Men!

126
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,670
We're going into battle!

127
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,350
Yes!

128
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,270
Hold up!

129
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,600
Before daylight, we have to stop the pursuit and get back to camp.

130
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,820
We have to get back!

131
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,290
Everyone, retreat!

132
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,220
Retreat!

133
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,460
The enemy is retreating.

134
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,660
I think Eunuch Bang won over Baghatur's trust.

135
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,610
Deputy Commander Baek.

136
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,100
You wait here with the soldiers.

137
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,150
Yes, Sir!

138
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,250
Moo Song and Bul Hwa, come with me.

139
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,410
There are still a lot of soldiers left in their basecamp.

140
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,990
How will you open up their gates by yourself?

141
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,850
Then... the secret plan Toqto'a spoke of was...

142
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,910
Get Baghatur!

143
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,670
General Baghatur is being pursued! Hurry up and open the gates!

144
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,560
Open the gates!

145
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,250
Get them!

146
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,420
Let's go!

147
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,090
Kill everyone! Don't leave anyone alive!

148
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,970
They're crazy. Playing the gongs and drums in the midst of this?

149
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,320
Something's wrong with the horses.

150
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,770
What's wrong with them?

151
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,920
The horses. What they were after were the horses that are sensitive to sounds, not the soldiers.

152
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,250
What? Then the reason they made all that noise until now was because...

153
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,720
General! It's Baghatur!

154
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,170
He was chasing the deposed king! Why is he here?

155
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,490
I think we were fooled.

156
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,720
Tell them to retreat.

157
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,710
Retreat! Just one stretch of the arm and we can pull out their hearts!

158
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,420
Kill all of them! Don't leave any one of them alive!

159
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,810
General!

160
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,430
Baghatur is dead!

161
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,810
The enemy has fallen!

162
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,430
They pursued the deposed king. That's the real Baghatur.

163
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:27,400
Fine. Whether a hundred or a thousand, I'll kill you all!

164
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,570
We've been surrounded. We need to make an exit and get out of here.

165
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,090
Please hurry. If we're too late, we'll be annihilated!

166
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,520
- I'm going to die here!
- Uncle!

167
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,270
I'm going to kill these Turk bastards and wipe them out!

168
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,790
General!

169
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:55,720
It's pandemonium. It looks like barley threshing in high heat.

170
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,420
Is that Bayan?

171
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,000
Yes. He's a violent and dangerous person.

172
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,990
He looks like a crazed animal.

173
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,660
He's too good to kill.

174
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,610
Tell them to catch him alive.

175
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,600
Yes, General.

176
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,800
Catch him alive?

177
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,700
A crazy tiger should be caught and killed quickly.

178
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,950
Come fight me, whoever you are!

179
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,010
I'll cut all your heads off!

180
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,320
You bastards!

181
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,350
Put down your swords!

182
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,150
Surrender.

183
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:14,040
Do not surrender! Fight to the death!

184
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,690
Everything worked out the way you planned, Your Majesty.

185
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:44,670
It's too bad. I wanted to rip Yeom Byeong Soo to shreds myself.

186
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,400
We'll use a desperate strategem from here on out.

187
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,370
Desperate stratagem, you mean...?

188
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,140
I have to catch the real Baghatur myself

189
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,440
to end this war.

190
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,580
Our fight begins now.

191
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,130
Pretend to be sick.

192
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,830
That way,

193
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,430
the empress will be completely fooled.

194
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,710
Are you not feeling well?

195
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,200
I'm fine.

196
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,350
Fine? She should have severe lower abdominal pains by now.

197
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,560
May I... take my leave?

198
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,240
Do that.

199
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,010
The drug has finally taken effect.

200
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,370
Since she also took the tonic, she should miscarry soon.

201
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,250
You've done well.

202
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,970
But it's not over yet.

203
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,940
Please give your command, whatever it is.

204
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,840
Now we must spread a rumor quietly within the imperial palace.

205
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,320
Rumor?

206
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,100
That the Park bitch falsified her pregnancy.

207
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,420
In order to win His Majesty over,

208
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,850
she's been feigning morning sickness as though she were pregnant.

209
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,360
That type of rumor.

210
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,330
I understand.

211
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:50,090
But... something is strange today.

212
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:01,270
That Lady Park, she was only eating the ones with jujubes on it.

213
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,700
Did she?

214
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,830
She didn't even touch the ones with pine nuts on them.

215
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:11,180
Isn't it strange to call it a coincidence?

216
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,760
I heard that jujube helps to aid morning sickness.

217
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,860
From now on, only use jujubes as a topping.

218
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,260
Do you not trust me?

219
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,790
I don't want to misunderstand you needlessly.

220
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,750
I will do as you ask.

221
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,350
Are you still suspicious of her?

222
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,990
We have Yeon Hwa, too, so there's no need to worry,

223
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,190
but it doesn't hurt to be cautious.

224
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:53,020
Court Lady Seo is keeping an eye on her.

225
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,260
So you don't need to be concerned.

226
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,100
What's on here?

227
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,240
- Isn't that blood?
- Blood?

228
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,060
Why is it here?

229
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,540
It's obviously a sign of a monthly.

230
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,790
Monthly? These belong to the pregnant—

231
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,890
Huh?

232
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,190
Lady Park, who's pregnant, had her period?

233
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,540
There's no way. How can you when you're pregnant?

234
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,630
That's what's strange. Her being pregnant must be a lie then.

235
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,090
Oh!

236
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,140
Watch your mouths.

237
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,900
You all could get in trouble.

238
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,020
How can this happen?

239
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,270
There's going to be an uproar over the pregnancy being a lie.

240
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,850
Watch your mouth or we could be in trouble.

241
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,440
The atmosphere here today is strange.

242
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,070
Find out what they're whispering about.

243
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:52,360
That's... I'm sorry but...

244
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,320
So, you know something, right?

245
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,630
Tell me.

246
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,990
What?

247
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,320
False pregnancy!

248
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,300
The empress has entered.

249
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,490
What brings you here today?

250
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,490
There's a strange rumor going around the palace.

251
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,570
Have you heard anything?

252
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,700
A strange rumor?

253
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,390
That Lady Park's pregnancy is false.

254
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,320
So you're the one who spread that rumor.

255
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,400
You must find out the truth right away.

256
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,580
Find out the truth?

257
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,170
The doctor already confirmed it.

258
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,900
Do you believe that ridiculous false rumor?

259
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,980
I heard you were the only one who spoke with the doctor.

260
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,270
You don't trust me?

261
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,980
I'm saying this because I trust you.

262
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,850
Right now, it's just a rumor among servants,

263
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,620
but we never know when it will spread to those outside the palace.

264
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,090
We need to do a re-examination right away and silence this rumor.

265
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:23,430
Do you not realize the moment we do a re-examination, my authority will fall to the ground?

266
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,780
To me, the honor of the inner court is

267
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,820
more important than your authority.

268
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,890
As the head of the inner court,

269
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,990
I can't just stand by and watch.

270
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,360
If a re-examination proves that it's a groundless rumor,

271
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:45,010
I will catch the person who started the rumor and put them to death.

272
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,280
Of course, you should do that.

273
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,620
But if it's in fact a false pregnancy,

274
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:56,460
Lady Park and those involved will all be rooted out

275
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,550
and they will be punished severely by me.

276
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:05,650
Do whatever you want.

277
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,060
She dares to try and punish me, this Danashiri?

278
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,510
We'll soon find out who gets hit

279
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,960
with a bolt of lightning first.

280
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,060
Yang.

281
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,700
Like you asked, I tailed Yeon Hwa.

282
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,280
But just a moment ago, she went into the library archives.

283
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,490
The archives?

284
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,420
Yes, but do you know who else I saw there?

285
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,800
General Tanqishi!

286
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,490
Tanqishi?!

287
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,880
That's right.

288
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,120
General Tanqishi came out of there followed by Yeon Hwa a little later.

289
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,440
Where is Yeon Hwa right now?

290
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,800
Would you like some tea?

291
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,730
Why?

292
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,490
Do you have something to say to me?

293
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,600
What are you getting in return?

294
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,400
Palace maid?

295
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,550
- Or court lady?
- Now you're showing your true colors.

296
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,170
How about you?

297
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,190
What are you getting in return?

298
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,660
No way... you weren't promised to become a concubine, were you?

299
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,460
Why? I guess you weren't promised to become a concubine?

300
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,510
No way! I'm going to become a concubine, too!

301
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,490
What have you done to deserve it?

302
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,340
What do you mean?!

303
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,580
The gourd flowers and the tonic,

304
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,620
I fed them both to her.

305
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,480
She gave her the gourd flower?

306
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,000
Do you think you did it all yourself? No, I did all I could.

307
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,740
I'm warning you, you better not try to take this credit for yourself.

308
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,660
I won't let you take this away from me.

309
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,160
Yang!

310
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:45,260
Lady Park is very ill.

311
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,890
So that bitch Lady Park has a high fever?

312
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,280
Yes, since last night

313
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,110
and the fever is not subsiding.

314
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,900
Your Majesty, it seems the baby has finally miscarried.

315
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,680
We will do a re-examination.

316
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,130
Bring His Majesty and Empress Dowager here. Ask the doctor to come, too.

317
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

318
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,110
You bring Lady Park here. Hurry.

319
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

320
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,620
Re-examination?

321
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,590
Re-examination...

322
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,760
You don't look well.

323
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,140
My Lady!

324
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,070
Please wake up!

325
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,730
Out of the way.

326
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,210
Yeon Hwa, please tell the empress quickly.

327
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,750
Yes, I understand.

328
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,230
Lady Park, the concubine, on her way here,

329
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,450
she collapsed.

330
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,730
She collapsed?

331
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,570
Tell us more. What happened?

332
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,950
We don't know the details, but she returned to the pavilion.

333
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,010
She's playing tricks.

334
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,630
- Tricks? How dare you?
- Isn't it obvious?

335
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,970
That wicked girl is trying to hide her fake pregnancy.

336
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,380
Empress, please be quiet.

337
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,070
- Your Majesty.
- How can you be so cold-hearted?

338
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,270
How disappointing.

339
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,740
Did you just

340
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,250
say I was disappointing?

341
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,470
Do you really not know why I am acting this way?

342
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,640
I don't want to hear any of it.

343
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,060
We must have a re-examination.

344
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,040
That won't happen.

345
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,340
The inner court is my jurisdiction. You may be the emperor

346
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,480
but you cannot interfere in this.

347
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,050
- Let go of me.
- The re-examination...

348
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,720
please permit it.

349
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,790
Let go of me.

350
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,910
Court Lady Seo, bring Lady Park here immediately.

351
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,120
This is an imperial command!

352
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,160
Re-examination...

353
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,520
will never happen.

354
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,210
- Your Majesty.
- Please ask Father

355
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,980
to come here right away.

356
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

357
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,980
Your Majesty...

358
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,950
you want to take this to the end?

359
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,870
Yes...

360
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,850
let's do that.

361
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,890
So let us see

362
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,830
whether I die or that bitch dies.

363
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,540
Let's see this to the end.

364
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,570
How is she?

365
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,740
She just fell asleep.

366
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,680
Her fever was high, but she got chills and said she was cold.

367
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,550
Doctor, please examine her now.

368
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,010
Yes, Empress Dowager.

369
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,510
- You must not.
- Why not?

370
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,130
She got cold sweats

371
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,430
so we removed all her clothes.

372
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,720
Then let me just examine her pulse.

373
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,410
Please do that.

374
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,780
What's wrong? Is the baby doing well?

375
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,260
Something is strange.

376
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,220
What do you mean by strange? What is it?

377
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:05,040
I was certain that she was pregnant before,

378
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,440
but I can no longer feel her "rolling" pulse.

379
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,460
What does that mean? The child is no longer there?

380
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,200
Yes, it appears so, Empress Dowager.

381
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,530
Empress Dowager!

382
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,910
Keep this a secret.

383
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,910
I will make sure you are compensated well.

384
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:42,170
No, Empress Dowager, that isn't proper.

385
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,700
Please leave now.

386
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,180
How can this be happening?

387
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,640
Don't worry. She can always get pregnant again.

388
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,550
It's not so simple.

389
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:03,100
The empress and the prime minister are already suspecting that it's a fake pregnancy.

390
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,280
It looks like they will win this time.

391
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,730
Don't worry.

392
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,460
I will never permit a re-examination.

393
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,100
She's not pregnant?

394
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:22,370
If you are wrong about this, you won't be able to keep your neck.

395
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:29,800
How can I dare to not tell you the truth?

396
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,520
Please leave.

397
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,740
As long as Empress Dowager knows, they will refuse a re-examination.

398
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,790
Have the lords gather in the court.

399
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,910
Is there a need for that? Drag Lady Park out and—

400
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,660
You moron. You use swords during battle

401
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,190
for politics, you use justification.

402
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,990
Empress Dowager is the only one who can match my wits.

403
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:02,450
I can only win by strangling her with justification and eroding her supporters.

404
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,260
We were annihilated.

405
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,140
Annihilated? What happened to General Bayan?

406
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,680
He was captured by the enemy camp.

407
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,990
By now, he will have been executed.

408
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,420
General, what do we do now?

409
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,770
I got the message that Baghatur will bring a large army to attack us here soon.

410
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,720
I will lead the military and retreat. You follow later on.

411
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,630
Are you telling us to stay and be your shields?

412
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,930
Did you forget your duty?

413
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,660
You die for us, that is your mission.

414
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,920
- Prepare to leave.
- Yes, General.

415
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:06,910
The spies must be keeping watch over us.

416
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,990
The moment Talahai and the army leave,

417
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,430
we will retreat as well.

418
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,430
I understand.

419
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,980
It's a great historical victory.

420
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,200
Congratulations, General.

421
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,490
Everything is thanks to the depth of your strategy.

422
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,160
The soldiers are very tired.

423
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,430
How about some entertainment for all their efforts?

424
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,070
We still have reinforcements left to deal with.

425
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,250
Until we get rid of them all,

426
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,240
we cannot lower our guard.

427
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,420
You don't have to worry about them.

428
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,980
They're outside fighters who were forced here from various countries.

429
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:19,480
When you build a tower with sand, how can it withstand the wind?

430
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,160
Even if you leave them be, they will soon disperse.

431
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,520
Is there someone who used to be the King of Goryeo that leads them?

432
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,260
Yes. He was brought here after being deposed.

433
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,830
I once fought that man.

434
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,570
There was unusual determination in his swordsmanship.

435
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,890
He's not one to quit easily.

436
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,510
General.

437
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,960
The remaining reinforcements have retreated.

438
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,910
- Is that true?
- Yes. The enemy's camp has completely emptied out.

439
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,390
See, I told you?

440
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:09,050
Have I ever steered you wrong?

441
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,570
Congratulations, General.

442
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:24,690
Here it is.

443
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,900
There's plenty, so drink up!

444
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,310
General, why don't you have some? How can you refuse on such a momentous night?

445
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,240
I'm fine,

446
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,460
so why don't you drink?

447
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,480
Drink up until your bladder bursts!

448
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,180
Uncle, please lie down. Your injuries are deep.

449
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,860
I won't die from such a trivial wound.

450
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,800
Ah, what's this smell?

451
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,250
It's the smell of meat being cooked.

452
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,880
They must be having a feast.

453
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,230
Why isn't Baghatur showing up?

454
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:30,350
The general thinks your bravery is being wasted.

455
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:33,810
So, is he going to let me live?

456
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:37,470
The remaining reinforcements retreated and abandoned you.

457
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:43,890
So how about swearing allegiance to General Baghatur

458
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:47,610
- and becoming his subordinate?
- Shut that mouth!

459
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,580
Death to a warrior is like a pack on a wanderer's back.

460
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:57,260
It's not a big deal to unpack and find a place to rest.

461
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:02,630
Excuse me, General. What if you have a proper conversation with him and...

462
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:05,480
Rather than live in humiliation,

463
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,600
I will not let go of this sword even in death.

464
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,500
Relay that to Baghatur.

465
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,810
Generosity isn't shown twice.

466
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,990
Expect to die.

467
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,470
In the end, Talahai

468
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,710
abandoned us.

469
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,510
May the Buddha preserve us.

470
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,630
Seung Nyang...

471
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,620
We will meet again.

472
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:09,540
I will never let you be alone again.

473
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,930
Please protect me from in here.

474
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,350
Give me strength.

475
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,240
Seung Nyang.

476
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,730
Sire, I got word that the Turks are drinking up a storm.

477
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:30,050
Baghatur has fallen for your plans.

478
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,200
Get ready.

479
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,280
Whether you live or die,

480
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,480
this fight will be your last.

481
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,050
The enemy is in front of us.

482
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,180
For yourselves,

483
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,790
shout out in silence.

484
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:24,460
Hold up!

485
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,030
I can smell the alcohol from here.

486
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,890
Bang Shin Woo and Jeom Bak must come out first.

487
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,550
Go and contact them secretly.

488
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,520
I understand.

489
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,320
His Majesty has finally come.

490
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,520
Let's send a signal back.

491
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,170
Oh, I'm so dizzy.

492
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,010
How long do I have to do this?

493
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:50,700
Keep blowing it.

494
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,410
- Soldiers.
- Don't interrupt me, you fool.

495
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,480
- Soldiers...
- Come on, I told you!

496
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,590
Who are you sending that signal to?

497
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,200
What do you mean signal?

498
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,930
A little bird kept crying nearby, so I was trying to shoo it away.

499
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,560
Hurry up and go open the door.

500
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,300
Just like this.

501
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,830
Huh? Was it over there?

502
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,460
Catch him!

503
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,700
Get them!

504
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,660
Stay back!

505
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,150
What's that noise?

506
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:22,700
I think someone is carrying out a surprise attack.

507
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,510
Surprise attack? Are you saying Talahai came to rescue us?

508
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:30,410
Of course, he did. There's no way General Talahai would abandon us.

509
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,390
That bastard!

510
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,200
Sire, it's nice to see you again.

511
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,980
- Where's Baghatur?
- Follow me.

512
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,490
This bastard!

513
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,210
That treacherous subject-like bastard.

514
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,290
Treacherous subject...

515
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,310
To my master, I'm a loyal subject.

516
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:52,690
You're a woman.

517
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,620
- Where is Baghatur?
- This girl...

518
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,000
is Baghatur.

519
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,730
Kill me.

520
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,180
Hurry!

521
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,830
It's an appeal from the ministers.

522
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,810
Put your imperial seal on it.

523
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,440
That... so suddenly...

524
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,590
Why did the ministers send an appeal?

525
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,980
I'll tell you after you put the seal on it.

526
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,210
I'm certain it's about the re-examination.

527
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,300
You're holding it upside down.

528
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,650
Yes, yes.

529
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:03,070
Well, today, I don't feel well, so—

530
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,180
Hurry up and put the seal on it.

531
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,040
Well...

532
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,220
P-Prime Minister,

533
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,690
th-this appeal,

534
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,520
I can't allow it.

535
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:26,370
You can't allow it?

536
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:31,670
Emperor, do you really want to get kicked out of the imperial palace with the empress dowager?

537
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,110
P-P-Prime Minister.

538
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,940
This is all the patience I have.

539
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:13,470
Please don't disappoint me anymore.

540
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,490
Do you understand?

541
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,070
Your Majesty.

542
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:29,250
Empress Dowager is coming to make a petition.

543
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,340
Petitioning?

544
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,120
Empress Dowager!

545
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,830
Your Highness!

546
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,800
Your Highness!

547
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,500
Your Imperial Majesty!

548
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,280
You must not allow a re-examination!

549
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,920
Even just for the sake of imperial authority, it can never be allowed!

550
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,590
I, Empress Dowager,

551
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,890
am desperately raising my voice to you, Your Majesty!

552
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,160
Your Majesty!

553
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,230
Your Highness...

554
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:51,090
It's a sight to behold the empress dowager standing on the edge of the cliff.

555
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:55,270
I wish I could just push her off the cliff right now.

556
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,560
Please hold back, Your Majesty.

557
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:01,680
She will soon throw herself off the cliff.

558
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,590
Please get up quickly! Everyone is watching.

559
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:24,040
Until you command that there is to be no re-examination,

560
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,260
I will not move an inch from here.

561
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,200
I will die right here and turn to stone, Your Majesty!

562
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:35,700
You should go to the temple and become a stone there first!

563
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:41,710
I'm speaking to the emperor. Do you not see?!

564
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:46,730
Right now, there are overflowing appeals from ministers asking for re-examination.

565
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:51,290
Don't you know that disturbing the peace and upsetting the emperor is treason?

566
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:55,880
The person who is controlling others to upset the emperor,

567
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,670
is you, Prime Minister!

568
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:11,280
It's all been discussed. Order the re-examination.

569
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,510
You cannot, Your Majesty! You mustn't!

570
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,260
It's already been agreed to by the emperor!

571
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:20,650
You cannot, Your Majesty! No!

572
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,970
Please kill me first instead, Your Majesty!

573
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,030
Please stop it!

574
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:30,700
Please stop!

575
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,860
Please!

576
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:38,080
Your Majesty!

577
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,020
Your Majesty!

578
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,450
I'll tell

579
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,930
His Majesty to carry out the re-examination.

580
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,240
I'm scared, Yang.

581
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,340
We will win.

582
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,070
The bigger this issue gets,

583
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,700
the bigger the empress's sins.

584
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:25,150
Your Majesty!

585
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:33,920
- Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
- It's an order.

586
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,760
Don't follow me.

587
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,030
I want to be alone.

588
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,140
Your Majesty!

589
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,300
Your Majesty!

590
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,190
I want to die,

591
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:55,580
Seung Nyang.

592
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:07,520
I wish I had died on Daecheong Island instead.

593
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:24,000
Why are you here?

594
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,400
I have something important to tell you.

595
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,210
Did you come to laugh at me?

596
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:35,640
That this is all I got after betraying you?

597
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:42,430
Do you want to ask if I betrayed you for this pathetic and shabby position?
