1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,230
And when you return,

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,400
bring me some dried persimmons if there are any.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,860
Have his ears been plug--

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,110
- Who are you?
- Seung Nyang!

5
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,180
Who sent you?

6
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,890
Where are you going and not protecting me?

7
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,340
- What happened?
- It's an assassin.

8
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,510
An assassin got in.

9
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,410
- Search every corner.
- Yes.

10
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,210
- How about His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince?
- He is safe.

11
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,720
Tell the commander right away.

12
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,220
No. I'll stay here, so you tell him, Deputy Commander Yeom.

13
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,810
All right.

14
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,780
Commander!

15
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,220
- Did you look into it?
- We've carefully combed the entire island,

16
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,150
but there are only elderly fishermen and women.

17
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,490
I definitely slashed one of the assassin's arms.

18
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,590
I've checked all the soldiers, but none of them had a wound on his arm.

19
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,800
There's no place for him to run to on this small island.

20
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,340
I'm sure he is hiding somewhere.

21
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,100
How is His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince?

22
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,890
He fell asleep a moment ago.

23
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,580
He is in great shock, so please prepare a tonic for him.

24
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,470
I understand.

25
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,910
Deputy Commander Yeom, you stay here and stay on guard.

26
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,160
Seung Nyang.... you

27
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,860
follow me for now.

28
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,540
What's... wrong?

29
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,380
Your mother...

30
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,880
You resemble her a lot.

31
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,030
The fact that I'm your father...

32
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,590
Why do you feign ignorance about it?

33
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,090
Nyang.

34
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,090
- Commander.
- What do you mean, Commander?!

35
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,750
- Address him as your father.
- Nyang.

36
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,840
You also have older brothers in Haeju. I will have you meet them soon.

37
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,000
There's no need.

38
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,200
I...

39
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,830
- am happy with the way things are now.
- Seung Nyang!

40
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,360
His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince will be asking for me,

41
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,070
so I'll take my leave.

42
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,280
That girl...

43
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,180
Let her be.

44
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,340
It's not unusual for her to resent me.

45
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,010
After losing her mother...

46
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,930
Considering all those years of hardship she endured...

47
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,640
Seung Nyang!

48
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,280
Seung Nyang!

49
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,880
Do you know how much your father longingly searched for you all this time?

50
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,930
- After hearing your mother died—
- It's me! I can't...

51
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,200
allow myself to cause him pain.

52
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,860
I was already selected as a tributary girl.

53
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,700
If it's revealed that I'm hiding as a man,

54
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,000
don't you know what kind of punishment my family will suffer?

55
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,460
I will just...

56
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,340
stay next to the commander

57
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,450
as Seung Nyang.

58
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,980
So... act as though... you know nothing about this.

59
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,200
Please help me out, Deputy Commander Park.

60
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,950
No!

61
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,900
Imperial Father! No! No! That can't be!

62
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,710
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince?

63
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,530
Are you all right?

64
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,270
- Please drink some.
- Take it away.

65
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,350
Teach me sword fighting. I'm not kidding.

66
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,040
If you teach me the sword, I won't bully you anymore.

67
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,830
Other than guarding you, Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, I can't do anything.

68
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,220
Are you insisting on fighting me on this?

69
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,770
Fine then. Let's see who wins.

70
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,070
What are you doing!

71
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,250
If I die, then you won't be safe either.

72
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,190
Are you going to stand there like that until the assassin slashes your throat?

73
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,600
Then... I'm going... to really attack.

74
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,080
You're very kind to an assassin.

75
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,290
If it had been a sword and not a fist, you would have died at that moment.

76
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,680
Your leg has been cut off, this time.

77
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,960
Now your neck has been cut.

78
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,720
I'm saying you have already died.

79
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,130
I won't die. I will stay alive no matter what!

80
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,270
- Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince!
- What!

81
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,610
Th-There's b-blood flowing!

82
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,220
Blood?

83
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,110
Oh, blood! Blood!

84
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,030
It's blood!

85
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,610
Your Imperial Highness, what happened?

86
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,980
I told you never to leave him for a single moment!

87
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,370
I can't just overlook this matter.

88
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,680
Tell me in detail what happened.

89
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,670
E-Everything is due to my careless—

90
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,310
I hit my head on a stepping stone.

91
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,190
This kid did nothing wrong. If you must have someone to account for a crime,

92
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,740
dig that stepping stone up and break it into teeny tiny pieces.

93
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,220
Whenever I see that stepping stone,

94
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,550
it makes me gnash my teeth in anger.

95
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,000
For what matter did you call me?

96
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,590
There's an assassin on Daecheong Island. Did you know?

97
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,940
That's news to me.

98
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,400
I'm this country's king, and you are a vassal of Goryeo.

99
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,520
Your Majesty sits over there like so

100
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,080
and I am here like this.

101
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,660
I cannot just stand by and watch a vassal sell off his country.

102
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,700
Your words are harsh, Your Majesty.

103
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,210
Trying to get Goryeo incorporated into Yuan is

104
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,630
- directly selling the country. What else is it?
- Your Majesty,

105
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,170
Goryeo doesn't exist as a shield to protect your royal authority.

106
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,550
- What?
- How long do you think Goryeo can stand against the Great Yuan Empire?

107
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,350
10 years? 20 years? But, Your Majesty,

108
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,320
what will you do about all the suffering that your people must endure during that time?

109
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,770
Don't use the people as a front to hide your dirty ambitions.

110
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,650
Goryeo's people are withering thinly away more and more.

111
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,330
It's been a long time since they have been nothing but bones.

112
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,830
Now even those bones will bear holes.

113
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,880
And then they will all collapse at once, like rotten corpses!

114
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,980
Do you really not know who caused that to happen?!

115
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,860
Don't think that you're the only one who loves your people!

116
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,580
What keeps the people fat isn't the façade of justification but substance!

117
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,640
Your method isn't the only one that's right.

118
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,980
I will forgive you for following Yuan,

119
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,530
but I will not forgive your disdain for Goryeo.

120
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,190
Impress upon yourself that you are Goryeo's vassal!

121
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,460
There is no mercy for a disloyal vassal.

122
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,010
Understood, King Simyang?

123
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,490
How is my archery skill?

124
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,450
You barely hit the target.

125
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,320
Hey, do you think that's easy?

126
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,630
Don't just run your mouth and try shooting yourself.

127
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,350
What's that?

128
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,750
Wow, you're so tacky.

129
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,990
If you want that baby arrow to hit the target, you'll at least need to—

130
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,750
Next time don't say this and that about archery skills in front of me.

131
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,880
Really... whether by arrow or sword, I can never win against him.

132
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,000
It's Seung Nyang.

133
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,570
Excuse me for a moment.

134
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,950
Please change into these clothes and come out.

135
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,170
Where are trying to go?

136
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,360
Here. Massage them.

137
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,790
These.

138
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,720
That's it.

139
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,510
That's right. Harder.

140
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,430
That's good. A bit more.

141
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,280
That's it.

142
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,960
If it's a horse riding contest, I can win over you.

143
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,960
What? You're laughing?

144
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,790
Did you just smirk at me?

145
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,300
My bones have also solidified (grew up) on the back of a horse.

146
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,620
Tisk! Watch your mouth!

147
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,890
There are no people who ride better than us Mongolians.

148
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,220
People from Goryeo also have inherited the blood of Goguryeo.

149
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,200
When it comes to horse riding, we don't lose against anyone.

150
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,390
Oh, then will you compete against me?

151
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,980
Get two horses ready in secret.

152
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,680
Do you want to see someone beat to death?

153
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,720
Do you not have confidence?

154
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,030
Fine, I lost.

155
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,300
Wait! This isn't an order,

156
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,460
but a request. Please get the horses ready.

157
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,590
No, I feel so suffocated.

158
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,280
I feel like my heart is going to burst that I can't live anymore!

159
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,420
I want to race while having the wind blowing at me.

160
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,280
So, please, even for one day,

161
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,030
couldn't you let me out of this suffocating local office?

162
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,480
We haven't yet... caught the assassin.

163
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,430
Please. Just once, huh?

164
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,100
Please! Please let me breathe!

165
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,550
Even if you hold up a knife to my throat, what can't be done, can't be done.

166
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,130
Why is it no, no, no!

167
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,090
Exactly what can I do then?!

168
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,080
Everything else besides things that you aren't allowed to do.

169
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,210
Fine! I'll just go die then!

170
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,190
Are you sure you can do it?

171
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,620
Whoever embarks on that empty boat there wins.

172
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,070
Fine. But you don't even know how to ride a horse.

173
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,190
You have to secure the saddle first.

174
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,400
Since you can't win with ability, you're cheating?

175
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,590
Since there's no way to win against you,

176
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,380
so what can I do?

177
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,350
I will never take part in a race like this again.

178
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,390
Imperial Father...

179
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,620
I don't want to die.

180
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,520
I want to return alive no matter what.

181
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,940
When I go back, those people who killed you, Imperial Father,

182
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,870
and made me suffer like this,

183
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,090
I'll be sure to get revenge.

184
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,720
Why did you pass away so quickly?

185
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,050
Why did you have to leave so heartlessly?

186
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,310
Imperial Father...

187
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,020
I miss you, Imperial Father.

188
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,150
Imperial Father...

189
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,270
Imperial Father!

190
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,350
Imperial Father!!

191
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,150
Imperial Father!

192
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,730
Welcome, Your Majesty.

193
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,330
Welcome, Your Majesty!

194
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,380
All of you have been working hard. Where is Crown Prince and Seung Nyang?

195
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,410
That is...

196
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,120
Has something happened?

197
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,710
I couldn't find the other one.

198
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,420
We have to get back to the local office.

199
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,340
Somehow, you're the only one left beside me when you were like my enemy.

200
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,690
If...

201
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:49,350
if... I don't die and become the emperor,

202
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,200
I won't forget you.

203
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,060
It doesn't matter if you forget the likes of me.

204
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,970
If you become Yuan's emperor,

205
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,320
don't ever take the people of Goryeo to become tributary girls or eunuchs.

206
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,470
After being ripped apart for life from their blood relations,

207
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,420
how they must feel having to die in a far away foreign land. If you are Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince of now

208
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,420
I think you will understand too well.

209
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:24,070
Do you think I will ever get off this island alive?

210
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,960
Even if it's for Goryeo's sake, you must.

211
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,650
You wouldn't know.

212
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,440
How cruel and brutal the people who sent me here are.

213
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,180
They will try to kill me no matter what.

214
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:47,380
That fear... you could never truly know.

215
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,370
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

216
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,180
Are you crazy?

217
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,080
Why would you dare to leave the quarters when there's an assassin on the loose?

218
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,530
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

219
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:37,040
There's nothing to be forgiven for. I begged him to get me out.

220
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,560
Don't blame him.

221
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,680
I'm really hungry. Let's go back.

222
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,910
Where's the other horse?

223
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,380
It ran away.

224
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,620
Get up and get on my horse.

225
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,370
No.

226
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,980
Get on my horse.

227
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,890
What are you doing? Get on.

228
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,670
You will be uncomfortable. Please go back comfortably, Your Majesty.

229
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,110
The assassin is close by.

230
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:18,030
You must guard the perimeter and don't trust those around you.

231
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,400
Yes, Sire.

232
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,590
But... the crown prince seems ill-tempered.

233
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,270
Isn't it hard?

234
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,800
It's actually fun.

235
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,980
That's a relief then.

236
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,290
I have one request.

237
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,720
Tell me.

238
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,600
The crown prince is having a hard time eating.

239
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,820
I will send over a skilled cook.

240
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,770
Yes, Sire.

241
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:56,370
But... his clothes are also a problem. There's no seamstress.

242
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:05,290
I will send one over as well. Anything else?

243
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,690
Thank you, Sire.

244
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,030
Seung Nyang...

245
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,870
I will protect you tonight.

246
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,090
Go get Seung Nyang.

247
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:25,500
He... doesn't look to be coming back after going to the King of Goryeo's quarters.

248
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,410
He won't take Seung Nyang, will he?

249
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,750
He's someone who's watching you under the King of Goryeo's orders.

250
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,630
If he's taken away, it would be a good thing.

251
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,280
I finally have someone I can be close with.

252
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,820
I will have to go myself and get him back.

253
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,390
Then I'll take my leave, Sire.

254
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:51,920
You can stay here tonight.

255
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,760
Why are you so surprised?

256
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,900
A-As long as the assassin hasn't been caught, I cannot be away from the Crown Prince for even a second.

257
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,390
I will be sending over a guard.

258
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,620
He fights better than you, so don't worry.

259
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,790
Is Seung Nyang there?

260
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,640
Y-Yes, Your Highness!

261
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,870
Can I come in for a moment?

262
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,080
Come in.

263
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,680
What good timing.

264
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,840
I wanted a drink myself.

265
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,590
Have a drink.

266
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,220
You've been working hard to protect me.

267
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,870
I'm all right.

268
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,290
You will take a drink from the King of Goryeo but not from me?

269
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,730
I am on duty tonight.

270
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,700
Will you only drink if the King of Goryeo allows?

271
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,980
Have a drink.

272
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,090
Then... just one drink.

273
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,720
King of Goryeo, you have a very good subordinate.

274
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:14,420
Seung Nyang, when I go back to Yuan one day,

275
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,780
will you come with me?

276
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,510
Will this need his approval also?

277
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,830
Give Seung Nyang to me.

278
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,550
This kid, even if I make him leave,

279
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,430
he will never leave my side.

280
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,210
I see.

281
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,060
Seung Nyang, what do you think?

282
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,750
It's late. Please have a good night.

283
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,870
You have to wait for me!

284
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,570
Thanks for the drink.

285
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,500
Seung Nyang!

286
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,040
Was my dinner too salty?

287
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,500
Why am I burning up inside?

288
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,320
Drag him out!

289
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,160
Yes, Sir!

290
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,930
What are you doing?

291
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,360
Where are you taking us?

292
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:14,330
Bayan, you must finish what you failed to do.

293
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,300
Yes?

294
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,980
Since he landed on Daecheong Island, our blade must aim there as well.

295
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,150
Do you want me to be the assassin?

296
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,260
No.

297
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,490
A mere assassin cannot kill him.

298
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,130
I will send our military.

299
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,630
I will dress our soldiers in Goryeo's military armor and have them attack Daecheong Island.

300
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,620
Father.

301
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,150
You cannot entrust such an important task to him. Please also send us.

302
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,760
We will make sure that the prince dies by our hands.

303
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,590
But...

304
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:57,390
you must also kill everyone on that island.

305
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,710
You cannot let anything with eyes or ears survive.

306
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:04,140
Only then can we make Goryeo pay for this crime, do you understand?

307
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,650
- We understand, Father.
- We understand, Father.

308
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,170
Prime Minister El Temür is a truly terrifying person.

309
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,960
If the Yuan military comes to Daecheong Island, what must we do?

310
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,060
You will assist them so they can invade the local government office.

311
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,670
We understand, Your Highness.

312
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,890
No one figured out that you were the assassin, have they?

313
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,970
Please don't be concerned.

314
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,770
No one will ever suspect me, including Ki Ja Oh.

315
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:50,610
What? You'd like me to investigate my men as well?

316
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:57,330
The thorn under one's own fingernail hurts the worst. No one can escape suspicion.

317
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,780
I understand, Your Majesty.

318
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,560
I think you should give up on the baby arrows.

319
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,510
But even a pretty boy like you can shoot these arrows.

320
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,590
It's not an arrow that you can take lightly.

321
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,690
Let's try again.

322
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,920
Jeonchutaesan.

323
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,840
The hand that holds the arrow should be stretched as if you are pushing a big mountain.

324
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,250
Huakhomi.

325
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:37,010
Your clasped hand should pull as if pulling a tiger's tail.

326
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,550
Do you understand how this is supposed to feel?

327
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,570
Yes, I'm beginning to understand.

328
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,970
Push the big mountain

329
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,050
and pull the tiger's tail

330
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,730
like this...

331
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,040
Don't laugh.

332
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,180
What does that boy think he is doing?

333
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,480
This guy, really...

334
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,460
Leave him be.

335
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,130
Seung Nyang.

336
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:40,570
Why are you angry when I am with the prince?

337
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,900
Well, I'm angry because I dislike him.

338
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,760
Is that right?

339
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:55,460
But somehow I find that hard to believe.

340
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,950
Don't look at me like that.

341
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,420
Why can't I smile?

342
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,010
I said don't look at me like that.

343
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,120
It's an order.

344
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,540
Don't ever look at me like that.

345
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,200
Seung Nyang, I told you not to smile.

346
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,560
Don't look at me like that?

347
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,110
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

348
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,650
You may go and sleep now.

349
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,780
Your Majesty, please forgive our failings.

350
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,400
We failed to realize the pain that was in your heart.

351
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,040
What's wrong?

352
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,910
Seung Nyang is a man.

353
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,330
So?

354
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,560
You asked us to dig all over Goryeo to find him, but why did he have to be a man?

355
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,550
How can you have romantic feelings for a man?

356
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,430
What did you say? Romantic feelings?

357
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:28,430
Don't be ashamed. How can this be your fault?

358
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,150
It is because we have failed you.

359
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,060
What nonsense are you two saying?

360
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:38,740
Do you think that I have romantic feelings for Seung Nyang?

361
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,230
So that's not what it was?

362
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,100
If you say you don't, I'm very relieved, Your Majesty.

363
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,640
Out! Get out now!

364
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,600
Get out!

365
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,480
How could I... ? To Seung Nyang?

366
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,290
He's not taking Seung Nyang by any chance, is he?

367
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,890
I will reinforce this area with the royal military soon.

368
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,020
Once they come, immediately return to Gaegyeong.

369
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,980
I understand.

370
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:27,090
Do not listen to any of the prince's requests that is not part of my orders.

371
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,230
I mean, don't be uselessly generous to him.

372
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,520
I'll keep that in mind.

373
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,970
Your slash must be accurate and strong.

374
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,460
Chief Yeom.

375
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,230
Have you come?

376
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,090
I found this in your room.

377
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,060
This jar contains elm tree root that is used to treat wounds.

378
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,560
Explain why this was in your room.

379
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,900
Do you suspect me as the assassin?

380
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,430
Suspicion? Not really.

381
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,160
We just saw some medicine we haven't seen before, so we wanted to confirm.

382
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,740
Why? Were you hurt anywhere?

383
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,660
Explain immediately how you got that wound.

384
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,100
Do you want to know?

385
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,550
You will have to persuade me.

386
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,740
I was wounded while training the soldiers.

387
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,230
Yeom Byeong Soo, do you think we're dumb?

388
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,970
Then, who cut you with a blade?

389
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,110
It was me.

390
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:59,040
I was sparring with Chief Yeom and...

391
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,900
The soldiers here all witnessed it.

392
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,640
Have your suspicions been lifted now?

393
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,870
Don't be upset.

394
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:14,190
Commander is just touchy after the assassination attempt.

395
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,360
I'll be leaving then.

396
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,620
It's not Yeom Byeong Soo.

397
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:26,550
We don't know yet so we need to be careful around him.

398
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,210
Just one day left.

399
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:42,200
Once tonight comes, this sickening assassin playacting

400
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,180
can finally come to an end.

401
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,860
If only to cover our previous mistakes, we absolutely must

402
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,360
be the ones to end the prince's life.

403
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,480
But to go so far to kill the prince? Prime Minister sure is persistent.

404
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,260
He has no choice. If he embraces a viper,

405
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,440
it will one day rip his heart out.

406
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,000
So, Uncle,

407
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,220
do you believe that Prime Minister El Temür assassinated the late emperor?

408
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,810
If he didn't, for the mere reason that he is stupid,

409
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,870
would he go so far to kill the emperor's son?

410
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,860
Then...

411
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,720
I've heard the rumor that the emperor's health is very poor.

412
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,710
- What?
- If the emperor dies, the next in line for the throne

413
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,460
is his older brother.

414
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,540
That's right.

415
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,170
That's why Prime Minister is in such a rush.

416
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,460
He has to kill the prince before the emperor dies—

417
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,990
We will soon arrive at Daecheong Island.

418
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,770
Be well prepared.

419
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,080
No one knows what Daecheong Island looks like.

420
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,260
Is there anyone waiting there to meet us?

421
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,380
You just keep your mouth shut and follow carrying the banner.

422
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,530
Why do you speak that way? I am here to serve as a general, after all.

423
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,790
Quiet. Have you forgotten why we're all suffering through this?

424
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:19,990
Bayan, just be grateful that you are alive right now.

425
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,950
Of course.

426
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:27,260
For all that Prime Minister El Temür did for me,

427
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,340
I will make sure to repay him.

428
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,720
I was sent here by King Simyang.

429
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,640
Move.

430
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,940
I'm Yeom Byeong Soo.

431
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,320
- And the crown prince?
- He is deeply asleep right now.

432
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,920
How many entrances to the government office?

433
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,960
There is a north gate, a south gate, and three smaller gates.

434
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,180
And the crown prince's room?

435
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,000
It is near the north gate.

436
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,430
We will enter through the north gate, so Bayan, you guard the south gate and the side gates.

437
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,020
Sure.

438
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,360
Then hurry and take the lead.

439
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,900
Brother! Yeom Byeong Soo can't be found.

440
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,130
What do you mean?

441
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:50,340
He didn't come when it was time to switch shifts, so I looked everywhere. But he is nowhere in these government offices.

442
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,520
It is certain that he is the assassin. Search for him by the shores.

443
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,290
Yes!

444
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,510
What's wrong over there?

445
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,390
It's a big disaster. The military is invading.

446
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,500
The military? At this late hour?

447
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,030
So are you saying we are at war?

448
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,030
But the thing is, they are our Goryeo soldiers.

449
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,870
What? Goryeo?

450
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,230
We will take the prince's head!

451
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,010
We must not let them have it, ever!

452
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,260
Aren't you General Bayan of the Merkid?

453
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,560
What is going on?

454
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,120
If you want to know, take the lead. Where is the prince?

455
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,500
What happened? Why are Goryeo soldiers trying to kill me?

456
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,610
They are not Goryeo soldiers.

457
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,370
Let's go.

458
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,320
He's the prince. Kill him!

459
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,830
Yes!

460
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,290
Stop! Stop there!

461
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,950
Go up there!

462
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,670
Hurry and jump over this wall.

463
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,390
It's too high.

464
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,980
Hurry and jump already!

465
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,100
- Climb up there!
- Go up!

466
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,890
Oh, darn!

467
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,080
Seung Nyang!

468
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,440
How about you, Seung Nyang?

469
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,390
Please go right now!

470
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:25,410
I can't go. Hurry, grab my hand! Hurry!

471
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,770
Go now!

472
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,680
Your Highness.

473
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:42,280
- Your Highness!
- Seung Nyang is still in there.

474
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,650
Close the gates!

475
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,690
Lock the gates and retreat!

476
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,720
Seung Nyang is still in there!

477
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,330
Lock the gates before they can come out! Hurry!

478
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,380
Yes, Sir!

479
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,740
I told you, Seung Nyang is still inside!

480
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,610
You must jump over the wall! Jump over the wall, Seung Nyang!

481
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,480
I hear you!

482
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,780
What are you doing? Capture the prince!

483
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,660
Yes! Everyone, follow me!

484
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,530
Yes, Sir!

485
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,100
I will

486
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,330
tear you to pieces with my own hands.

487
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,630
Mom!

488
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,660
Yes, it was you.

489
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,840
You killed my mother.

490
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:49,900
What are you talking about?

491
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:58,810
All right, I've laid down my sword. So tear me to pieces or boil me to death.

492
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,050
Do whatever you want to.

493
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,740
How dare this guy speak to me with contempt?

494
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,850
Won't you pick up your sword already?

495
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:13,300
All right, I will kill you.

496
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,950
If that is what you want, do you think I can't do it?

497
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,940
Seung Nyang!

498
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,950
Seung Nyang.

499
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,890
We don't have time left.

500
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,880
Everyone, to the back gate!

501
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,480
Hurry and close the back gate.

502
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,560
Your Highness.

503
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,970
Lord Jang?

504
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,140
General Bayan.

505
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:12,910
If you surrender, we will spare your life. But if you rebel, all of you will be killed.

506
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:20,620
Put down your sword and give us the prince.

507
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:25,000
Our mission is to carry our task through to the end.

508
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,510
Although we may die, Goryeo will be proud of us.

509
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:33,280
And for us, there is no greater glory.

510
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,820
Who is with me?

511
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,510
- We are with you!
- We are with you!

512
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,940
Seung Nyang, protect the prince.

513
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:51,020
We've trained for this. Break through their ranks!

514
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,090
Shoot!

515
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:26,790
Kill them all! Don't let a single one of them escape!

516
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:40,890
There will be a boat at the shore. Take the prince and leave Daecheong Island.

517
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:42,560
But what about you, Commander?

518
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,590
If we run away now, we will all die.

519
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:47,590
I cannot go alone.

520
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,700
Can't you listen to your father?

521
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,130
Father...

522
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,460
Seung Nyang, do what I say!

523
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,620
You need to live, you cannot die.

524
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,230
You need to protect the prince.

525
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,510
That's my last wish for you, Seung Nyang.

526
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,320
Get those two!

527
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:26,720
Hurry!

528
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,210
Father...

529
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,660
I'm sorry, Seung Nyang. My daughter...

530
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,760
Kill them all!

531
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,640
Fight!

532
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,950
Split up and search.

533
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,720
Find them! Find them!

534
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,500
Find them!

535
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:48,400
We've arrived. Please be strong.

536
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,590
I feel like my heart will explode.

537
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,850
Please get up!

538
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,220
Over there.

539
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,040
Give me arrows.

540
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,730
Seung Nyang!

541
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,260
Push.

542
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,190
Seung Nyang.

543
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,540
Such a pretty boy, yet so vicious.

544
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,450
General Bayan.

545
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:26,000
Let us end this tiresome journey now.

546
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,890
This is my last courtesy to you, Your Highness. Please end your own life

547
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:37,420
and preserve what remains of your honor as a prince of a great nation.

548
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:42,790
If this is fate,

549
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,630
then I will be the one to end Your Highness's life.

550
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,900
Look at me, carefully. Who am I?

551
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,330
The late emperor

552
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:09,270
selected me as the crown prince.

553
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:13,160
This body is a direct descendant of Yuan's royal family.

554
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,750
If you kill me, you will survive as Prime Minister El Temür's loyal dog.

555
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:20,140
But for the sin you commit for slaying a royal heir,

556
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:24,410
10,000 of your descendants will be cursed and tormented.

557
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,340
So,

558
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,490
swing that sword and kill me.

559
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,710
Let the blood of the dragon drip on your sword.

560
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:44,200
A dragon that never ascended to the royal throne remains nothing but a serpent.

561
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,640
My younger brother is dying, he won't be alive for long.

562
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,870
So if we endure for just a little longer,

563
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,820
I will ascend to the Yuan royal throne.

564
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,180
Even if it wasn't me, it won't be easy to stay alive, Your Highness.

565
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,720
I will not die.

566
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:05,360
My grandfather's grandfather's grandfather, Genghis Khan Temüjin

567
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:09,360
is protecting me.

568
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,340
Genghis Khan...

569
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:19,900
Tanqishi will arrive soon.

570
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,780
Then promise me just one thing.

571
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:54,030
Make sure to survive and appear in front of me again.

572
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:00,140
The heavens will never abandon the dragon.

573
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:07,630
In my heart, I serve a new emperor.

574
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:13,100
Please do not forget me, Bayan.

575
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,310
Are you sure you won't regret this?

576
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:45,710
The moment the emperor passes away, the stupid prince will become His Majesty.

577
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:50,550
Since we have to gamble, shouldn't we play the bigger game?

578
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:55,970
For now, he's just one life. But if he survives, he will gain the world.

579
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,220
What are you doing? Shoot at them!

580
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,820
Hurry! Hurry!

581
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,540
Get a boat and chase them!

582
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,390
- Hurry!
- Yes, Older Brother.

583
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:19,360
- Follow me!
- Yes, Sir!

584
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,420
Looks like we lost the fish that was almost caught.

585
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,150
If we knew this would happen, we should have brought more soldiers—

586
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,770
Bayan! What good are you?

587
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,330
No!

588
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,260
No!

589
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,770
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

590
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:51,330
I dreamed an ominous dream.

591
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:54,380
What kind of dream?

592
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,310
My late mother was surrounded by demons.

593
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,660
Your Majesty, I, Moo Song, have arrived.

594
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,490
Come in.

595
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:09,350
King Simyang went to Inju during the night.

596
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:10,130
Inju?

597
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:15,880
It's strange that he left in the middle of the night with just one servant. And that he went to Inju...

598
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,760
That means something certainly happened at Daecheong Island.

599
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,060
Instruct Jeom Bak to have his thugs spread out and find out what happened.

600
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,980
Yes, Your Majesty!

601
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:32,780
Older Brother, Kim Simyang has arrived.

602
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,860
Did you really fail to catch the prince?

603
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,060
We found his boat nearby.

604
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,110
How can you make such a mistake?

605
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:44,650
There is no time to tell the whole story.

606
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,340
The military will stand by here and search the surrounding areas.

607
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,550
I understand, Older Brother.

608
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,900
Prepare the camp!

609
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:00,220
Where are we going exactly?

610
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,540
We must go to Gaegyeong.

611
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,670
What?

612
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,530
Gaegyeong? Why Gaegyeong?

613
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:06,590
That you are alive,

614
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,090
His Majesty must know.

615
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:12,390
There is nowhere we can hide in Goryeo as long as King Simyang is in league with them.

616
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,410
Hurry, we need to hide.

617
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:17,340
Wait, Seung Nyang.

618
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:55,850
All of this

619
00:55:55,850 --> 00:56:00,360
was because you were in league with Yuan, King Simyang.

620
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,030
Where did you hide the prince?

621
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:06,800
You've slayed your own people and betrayed your own nation.

622
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,320
Know to feel shame.

623
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,600
I will bring this man to Gaegyeong with me.

624
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,260
Why would you do that?

625
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,230
Don't worry.

626
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:21,730
I will pull his tongue out so he cannot say anything.

627
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:34,900
And in your place, Yeom Byeong Soo will testify.

628
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:40,040
Just what is your scheme?

629
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,910
You still don't understand, Ki Ja Oh.

630
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:48,920
You will become the one who murdered the prince on the orders of the King of Goryeo.

631
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,230
How dare you?

632
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:53,400
Do you not fear the heavens?

633
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,650
Kill me instead!

634
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,500
Just kill me instead!

635
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,860
Drag him away and pull his tongue out.

636
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,310
Let's go.

637
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,950
- No!
- Come!

638
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:20,830
Kill me!

639
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:24,180
Father...

640
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,410
Please look this way.

641
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,780
Kill me!

642
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,340
Father, please...

643
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,640
take a look at me.

644
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,720
Father!

645
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,100
Kill me now!

646
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:55,920
♫ Because I’m dangerous, my love ♫

647
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,270
♫ The more you love me, ultimately the more
only you may be hurt ♫
