1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,320
When did I begin to lose my memories...?

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,490
I drank the tonic that Golta gave me while looking over the petitions.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,250
It's always after I drink the tonic that I can't remember anything.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,590
Perhaps...

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,320
Golta?

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,610
Eunuch Baek left the palace to tend to his sick mother.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,690
When he returns, ask him to make the tonic.

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,760
Empress...

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,130
You called me the empress?

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,410
So you know me very well.

12
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,560
So who are you?

13
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,010
Kill them!

14
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,240
Leader, please get away.

15
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,720
Everyone, run away!

16
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,410
Chase them.

17
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,320
Chase them!

18
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,110
What is going on here?

19
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,430
They are puppets of Hawk House.

20
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,820
Your Majesty, you did this yourself?

21
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,160
In order to infiltrate their secret meeting, it could not be helped.

22
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,510
- The leader?
- We lost him.

23
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,640
But if we interrogate them, we should be able to find out who the leader is.

24
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,360
I will do so.

25
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,980
Drag these people away.

26
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,090
Yes, Prime Minister.

27
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,930
None of them know your identity, so don't worry.

28
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,580
Contact all the members and tell them to stay in hiding.

29
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,360
Yes, Leader.

30
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,410
How do you like my clothes?

31
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,090
It suits you so well.

32
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,230
How about mine?

33
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,040
It's quite obvious.

34
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,390
- It's very beautiful.
- Her Highness the Empress Dowager enters.

35
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,630
Wearing Goryeo clothes in the palace?

36
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,280
Are you concubines out of your minds?

37
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,020
We've committed a grave sin, Your Highness.

38
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,840
- We've committed a grave sin, Your Highness.
- We've committed a grave sin, Your Highness.

39
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,060
Anyone who dresses in Goryeo clothes after today will be punished severely by me.

40
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,630
And what is the reason they cannot wear them?

41
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,340
There have been Goryeo foods being served on the imperial tables lately.

42
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,860
Is that all?

43
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,020
Even the people are changing their memorial service traditions to Goryeo traditions.

44
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,080
Isn't this an effort to obliterate the spirit of Yuan?

45
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,310
Many Goryeo customs have adopted Yuan customs as well.

46
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,860
Such as putting rouge on the bride's face at weddings

47
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,900
and piercing ears for earrings.

48
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,630
It is the nature of cultural exchange. Why must Goryeo culture be forbidden?

49
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,160
Head Eunuch Dok Man.

50
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,490
Send Empress Dowager a Goryeo dress, please.

51
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

52
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:09,580
- Empress.
- I trust that you will wear what I send you to tomorrow's assembly.

53
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,980
Even if I am dead and buried, I will not stand to see this nation become Goryeo.

54
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,840
"If the monk doesn't like the temple, the monk should leave."

55
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,970
I won't stop you.

56
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,150
Your Highness, we got a message from Yeom Byeong Soo.

57
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,780
Is the leader of Hawk House safe?

58
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,900
Yes, Your Highness.

59
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,190
There is no change to the plan to enthrone a new emperor,

60
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,880
so we should continue.

61
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,370
You should meet with the military powers personally, Lord Jang.

62
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,020
Yes, Your Highness.

63
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,680
Empress, I am different from El Temür or Bayan.

64
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,070
Let's see who loses their head first, shall we?

65
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,970
Stop.

66
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,810
Have you learned the identity of the leader?

67
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,190
Everyone says the same thing.

68
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,780
We really don't know anything.

69
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,460
Please believe us, Your Majesty the Empress.

70
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,960
There is no way you know nothing.

71
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,170
Name, age, or where he lives.

72
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,750
Anything is fine, so tell us whatever you know.

73
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,340
There is one thing.

74
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,650
What is that?

75
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:01,320
I once heard that the leader comes to the palace.

76
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,850
Are you sure about that?

77
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:10,590
I heard the branch leaders say so clearly.

78
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,340
Leader of Hawk House enters the palace, you said?

79
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

80
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,550
Prime Minister is examining all those in the Imperial Court and the vassals as well.

81
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,710
So we will catch him soon.

82
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,430
Your Majesty, are you having another headache?

83
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:41,050
My head hurts as if it might break.

84
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,760
Eunuch Baek, please bring the tonic.

85
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,210
Leader of Hawk House is in the palace...

87
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,250
Leader of Hawk House...

88
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,800
Perhaps...?

89
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,980
The empress has stepped on my tail. There is no time to delay.

90
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,580
Tell Yeom Byeong Soo to gather all those in favor of enthroning a new emperor.

91
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,460
Yes, Leader.

92
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,800
Golta!

93
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,140
Your Majesty.

94
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,060
Hurry, the tonic...

95
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,120
Give it to me.

96
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,990
Are you all right?

97
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,720
This helps with the headache,

98
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,860
but then suddenly...

99
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,880
I am... so dizzy...

100
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,750
Your Majesty.

101
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,420
If you sleep, the pain will disappear.

102
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,790
I must not lose consciousness now.

103
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,510
I must not.

104
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,280
You have to stay alive until the new emperor is enthroned.

105
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,330
So don't die and just keep on being sick.

106
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:52,630
When preparations for a new world are complete, this Golta will send you off comfortably.

107
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,250
Leader.

108
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,200
Tonight, Empress Dowager will gather all those who agree with the plan to enthrone the new emperor.

109
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,870
Sounds good.

110
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,450
Leader... Golta is the leader of Hawk House?

111
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,860
Golta, you were a traitor? How can you, Golta?

112
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,850
How?

113
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,730
These are the followers of the late Prime Minister Bayan.

114
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,550
They are gathered here in agreement with Empress Dowager's plan to enthrone a new emperor.

115
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,740
How happy I am to see you all.

116
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,000
Our nation right now, due to a sick emperor

117
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,880
and a wicked Goryeo girl out to use him, we are facing a big crisis.

118
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,330
Those who are here, we must work together towards national salvation.

119
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,900
We are at your service, Empress Dowager.

120
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,590
- We are at your service, Empress Dowager.
- We are at your service, Empress Dowager.

121
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,540
Bolod Temür, is your heart prepared?

122
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,450
To make me the emperor,

123
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:32,620
support is rising like wildfire. How can I not prepare myself?

124
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,530
First, we must remove the empress's supporters in the Imperial Court.

125
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:45,340
If we submit a petition, Hawk House will make sure that we receive Imperial permission in the emperor's stead.

126
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,440
How is the emperor's health?

127
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,330
His illness appears quite serious.

128
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:59,890
Doesn't that mean that our time has come?

129
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,420
Your Majesty, you must recover soon.

130
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,270
Head Eunuch Dok Man.

131
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,660
Your Majesty, are you all right?

132
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,140
Come closer.

133
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,820
Closer...

134
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,410
Your Majesty!

135
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,760
Can you do it?

136
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,620
I will accept your imperial command.

137
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,750
Once he begins to cough up blood, he can no longer recover, he will certainly die.

138
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,850
So who is your leader, anyway?

139
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,190
You will find out soon.

140
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,800
But as long as the empress is there, a peaceful transition of power won't be easy.

141
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,870
Our leader said he will take care of that problem.

142
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,030
How will he do that?

143
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,040
Don't worry, please wait just a little longer.

144
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,830
We will find out who put poison in the tonic.

145
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,400
Golta... what are you thinking of, doing something like this?

146
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,830
I've returned.

147
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:23,050
Did you find the criminal? Why can't you say it? Tell me now.

148
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,990
The palace maid who made the tonic died.

149
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,050
But I heard that she worked for Park Bul Hwa.

150
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,580
How dare you!

151
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,280
There is no way that Her Majesty the Empress plotted this.

152
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,620
I'm sorry.

153
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,790
I am only telling you what I heard.

154
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,410
So his plan is to get rid of the empress.

155
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,320
And who is the person you plan to enthrone as the emperor?

156
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,000
Your Majesty, there must have been an error.

157
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,750
- I will investigate again.
- Never mind.

158
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,040
After all, this dragon throne,

159
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,090
it can make a father kill his son

160
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:09,590
and the son kill his father for it, isn't that true?

161
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,460
Your Majesty.

162
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,180
Your Majesty, how is your health today?

163
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,970
As you can see, I'm fine. You can go now.

164
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,300
- Your Majesty?
- I have nothing else to say, so get out.

165
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,940
Did I do something wrong?

166
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:42,150
If there is a reason you are angry, please tell me.

167
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:48,630
This dragon throne can make a son kill his father for it.

168
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,880
That is how things are.

169
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,160
- Your Majesty.
- I briefly forgot about your desire for power.

170
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,710
Why are you being like this suddenly?

171
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,820
I don't want to see you, so get out.

172
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,430
Get out, I said!

173
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,030
Do you have any idea why His Majesty is acting that way?

174
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,370
I don't have a clue.

175
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,370
What misunderstanding is he having now?

176
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,320
Your Majesty.

177
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,670
Yes, what poison was in that tonic, did you find out?

178
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

179
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,430
It is an esoteric substance.

180
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,780
The venom of the poisonfeather bird. (Zhenniao)

181
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,200
Do you mean that poison for which there is no detoxification medicine?

182
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,870
Your Majesty, what are your symptoms?

183
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,800
I'm anxious and cannot sleep. My head hurts like it's breaking apart.

184
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,430
And I cough blood.

185
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,130
You coughed blood?

186
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,730
Is that serious?

187
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,240
Your Majesty...

188
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,260
It's all right, so tell me the whole truth.

189
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,180
Once you begin to cough blood

190
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:58,240
that means the poison has spread into your organs, and there is no treatment.

191
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:21,160
When I drink that poisoned tonic, I become drunk with sleep.

192
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:28,060
Then I lose my memories. Is there any way to withstand the poison?

193
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,820
Do you intend to continue to drink it?

194
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,790
Just answer my question.

195
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,350
Is there any way to not lose my senses?

196
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,450
There is a tonic that can neutralize the effects of the venom.

197
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,860
Make that tonic for me.

198
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:52,490
You must not. It keeps you from losing consciousness, but it cannot block the poison from accumulating in your body.

199
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,310
You will become sicker.

200
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,300
It's my imperial command. Make that medicine for me.

201
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,240
Your Majesty.

202
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,250
And never tell the empress about this.

203
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,450
Just what do you plan to do?

204
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:13,990
Before I die, I will find everyone who is threatening the Empress and Ayu

205
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,240
and get rid of them.

206
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,730
Your Majesty,

207
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:25,250
still, you should let Her Majesty the empress know...

208
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,680
She will oppose my plan.

209
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,790
Your Majesty...

210
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,230
It is the last thing

211
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,670
that I can do for her.

212
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,760
Head Eunuch Dok Man, can you help me?

213
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

214
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,040
The pain is gone,

215
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,300
but I am tired again.

216
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,050
Your Majesty.

217
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,130
Your Majesty, please don't suspect Her Majesty.

218
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,220
Golta,

219
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:42,900
the empress... how could she do such a thing...

220
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,200
Your Majesty? Your Majesty?

221
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,860
I didn't expect that the emperor would suspect the empress so easily.

222
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,400
It's all thanks to Yeom Byeong Soo's many fake secret letters.

223
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:17,280
Suspicion and hate that have piled up over five years just exploded. It won't be mended easily.

224
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:24,280
Those secret letters... that was you, too, Golta?

225
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,710
You... You are the leader of Hawk House?

226
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,310
There is no need to be surprised.

227
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,710
More importantly, there is now a crack between the emperor and the empress.

228
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,570
If that is true, that is the best news I've heard in a while.

229
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,660
The emperor will collapse soon.

230
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:52,240
When we enthrone the new emperor, how about if you serve as his regent?

231
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,910
Did the emperor agree to that?

232
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:58,650
His will is determined by me.

233
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,630
You are quite a remarkable person.

234
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,870
Hawk House progressed enormously thanks to El Temür.

235
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:13,590
Once I learned that power is what earns money, I castrated myself without hesitation and ran into the palace.

236
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,250
El Temür, then Bayan. So, am I next?

237
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:25,010
If this kingdom's power was really held by the emperor, why would I take the long way?

238
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,920
If you think about it, it's thanks to the empress that you came to me.

239
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,170
It's not important how it happened.

240
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,420
I pledge all my loyalty to you, Empress Dowager,

241
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,810
so please give me all the mineral and salt rights of this nation.

242
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:47,100
You won't regret choosing me.

243
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,960
So hurry and make the emperor collapse.

244
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,880
Yes, Your Highness, I will do that.

245
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,000
Your Majesty, does your head feel clear now?

246
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,940
My head hurts again.

247
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:25,090
Your Majesty, perhaps you should briefly leave the affairs of the state to someone else and receive treatment?

248
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,980
Regency, do you mean?

249
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,390
Taking care of your health is important.

250
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,080
Command the empress to accept regency.

251
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,590
Not the empress.

252
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,620
- Then...
- To Empress Dowager,

253
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,690
I will ask her to do it.

254
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,330
There are many vassals in the Imperial Court who support the empress.

255
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,760
If they revolt—

256
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,820
I will cast them all out.

257
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,620
The empress tried to assassinate me.

258
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,570
Those who support her are all the same.

259
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,620
I will write an imperial decree, prepare for that.

260
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,590
Yes, Your Majesty.

261
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,430
His Majesty the Emperor enters!

262
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,350
The reason I summoned you, Lords,

263
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:53,360
I thought the way things were going in this palace was a mess.

264
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,150
So I want to find out who is responsible.

265
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,730
Prime Minister,

266
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,830
I dismiss you from your position.

267
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,140
- Your Majesty.
- Not only that...

268
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,010
The Three Excellencies, you three are dismissed.

269
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,070
Minister of Education, Minister of the Military, Minister of Culture, Minister of the Imperial Inspectors,

270
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:19,070
and the rest of you. All of you are dismissed.

271
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,720
Your Majesty, the high officials of the nation, and without any reason—

272
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,260
Empress, you be quiet.

273
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:30,580
Golta, give my decree to Lord Jang to read.

274
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,570
Vassals of the Court, hear me. My illness is getting worse by the day.

275
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,460
I can no longer conduct the affairs of the state.

276
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,030
So I will entrust Empress Dowager with imperial authority.

277
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,480
Vassals, you will regard Empress Dowager as the same as you regard me

278
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,410
and pledge all your loyalty.

279
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,760
Your Majesty, I will obey your imperial command.

280
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,960
Anyone who disobeys me—

281
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,870
Empress, stop. I am not finished speaking.

282
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,730
Do you not hear me—

283
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,760
Your Majesty.

284
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,340
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

285
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,650
Take him to his quarters, now.

286
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,370
Emperor.

287
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,830
Emperor, you should be in bed. Why are you in your office?

288
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:57,030
I'm thinking about abdication.

289
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,300
Abdication?

290
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,220
Holding onto imperial power with this body of mine,

291
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,420
I don't think it's right for the sake of this nation.

292
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,910
Who do you plan to give succession rights to?

293
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:16,870
I wanted to ask your opinion about that, Empress Dowager.

294
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:22,810
Maybe you can suggest someone suitable.

295
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,130
There is a well-qualified person, actually.

296
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,750
Please tell me who that is.

297
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,410
What do you think of Bolod Temür?

298
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:42,230
So Bolod Temür is the one you plan to enthrone as the new emperor?

299
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:47,590
Among your close relatives, when it comes to character and moral influence, there is no one better.

300
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,430
Oh, Bolod Temür. Yes, sounds good.

301
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,500
I will listen to your opinion.

302
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:01,300
So I will announce my abdication soon. Please summon all the vassals.

303
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,460
Emperor, to make such a courageous decision for our nation...

304
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:11,380
Golta, I will write the abdication decree myself. Can you help me?

305
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

306
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,610
By the Mandate of Heaven, the emperor decrees...

307
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,940
What did you just say?

308
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:30,530
His Majesty's illness cannot be treated?

309
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,850
Why are you telling me this now?

310
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,830
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

311
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,720
He earnestly requested for me to not tell you.

312
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,920
He did?

313
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,170
Did you ask for me?

314
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,060
I have something to speak to you about. His Majesty—

315
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,620
I already know.

316
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,990
His Majesty just gave me a secret order.

317
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,150
A secret order?

318
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,750
His Majesty gave you that order?

319
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,340
So, Your Majesty, please be prepared.

320
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,540
Your Majesty, congratulations.

321
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,450
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

322
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,450
This is all thanks to you guys.

323
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,530
When you ascend the throne, please don't forget me, Yeom Byeong Soo.

324
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,500
How can I forget you? Just say the word. What position would you like?

325
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,460
I may not look it, but I was a warrior in Goryeo.

326
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,950
How about the Commander of the Military—

327
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,220
So you want to command this nation's military?

328
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,910
You contributed the most to making me the emperor. How could I refuse your request?

329
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,400
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

330
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,560
Your Imperial Majesty...

331
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,100
Who knew I'd hear that from you for the very first time?

332
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,060
Please enter the palace, so you won't be late.

333
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,700
Then let's meet inside the palace later.

334
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,430
- Yes.
- Yes.

335
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:32,970
My plan is to just ride your coattails to the top.

336
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,850
You sure are smart.

337
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,470
Those rat-like bastards.

338
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,190
Maybe they'll end up as high officials?

339
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:52,110
Park Bul Hwa said there will be a huge rebellion in the palace.

340
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,670
So let's wait and kill those guys first.

341
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,290
His Imperial Majesty enters!

342
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,550
His Majesty is now standing at a crossroads between life and death.

343
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:36,920
He said he will eliminate anyone who is threatening you or the crown prince.

344
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,610
So he is desperately struggling against death.

345
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,380
Your Majesty, it's been a long time.

346
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:54,660
Everyone here, you are all close allies to the Empress Dowager.

347
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,740
Empress Dowager.

348
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,110
Please speak, Emperor.

349
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:01,010
For letting me see all these people at once,

350
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,970
I thank you.

351
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:09,050
Emperor, you must be tired. Please announce your decree of abdication.

352
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,740
Yes.

353
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,560
Traitors, hear me.

354
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,960
You dared to try to kill the crown prince and the empress,

355
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,970
and staged an insurrection in order to usurp power.

356
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:35,770
Emperor?

357
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:41,440
Therefore, I will have you pay for your crimes with severe punishment.

358
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,990
What are you saying right now?

359
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,350
Prime Minister.

360
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,230
Did you ask for me, Your Majesty?

361
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,000
These treacherous people in front of me,

362
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,830
kill them all.

363
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,380
Wait, wait! What are you doing?

364
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,940
Kill them all.

365
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,590
Kill them!

366
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,540
Your Highness...

367
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,750
Lord Jang!

368
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,390
Both of you have betrayed me.

369
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,510
Why did you do that?

370
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,290
You abandoned me first.

371
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,870
I abandoned you first?

372
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:16,850
Do you deny it? You were bewitched by that Goryeo girl

373
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,790
- and you tossed me like an old shoe—
- Empress Dowager,

374
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,930
you never needed me, you needed my power.

375
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,560
And when things didn't go your way, you plotted treason.

376
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,430
Power? Yes, I needed it.

377
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:33,700
I needed it in order to survive in this palace.

378
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,790
So I gave you everything.

379
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:43,950
But you gave that power to the empress. How is that not betrayal?

380
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:49,030
Please shut that disgusting mouth now.

381
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:55,580
Golta, why did you betray me?

382
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,540
I never betrayed you.

383
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,320
Because you were never my owner, Emperor.

384
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,030
- What?
- My owner is money.

385
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,020
Only money.

386
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,040
Power can betray you, but money never betrays you.

387
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:28,060
All right, keep babbling.

388
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,240
When the donkey you ride gets tired, you switch to a wagon.

389
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,160
For my purposes, I just abandoned the donkey I was riding on

390
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,010
and rode a new donkey. That is my only sin.

391
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:47,530
I see. Golta, you did it for money.

392
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,170
And her? She wanted power.

393
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,220
I was foolish.

394
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,050
I believed that there was something more precious than money or power.

395
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:02,120
So I was the idiot to believe that. I was!

396
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,380
Your Majesty, please calm down.

397
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,430
The empress isn't different from us.

398
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,110
- Shut that mouth.
- If she didn't get something from it,

399
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:14,130
would she give you her heart, even if you were an emperor?

400
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,730
- Shut that mouth!
- You foolish emperor.

401
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,920
So unenlightened—

402
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,220
Leader.

403
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,600
Your Majesty...

404
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,190
Your Majesty...

405
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:20,650
So let's hear you babble, Empress Dowager.

406
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:25,810
Babble to your heart's content!

407
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,860
Your Majesty.

408
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:58,170
The doctor said I would completely recover soon.

409
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,630
I already heard it from Head Eunuch Dok Man.

410
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,740
I don't know what you heard but

411
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:13,810
I will not leave you to die.

412
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,750
Your Majesty.

413
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:24,010
I must live a long happy life with my empress and our crown prince.

414
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,120
Why would I die?

415
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,360
I...

416
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:40,870
will do anything I can so that you can fully recover.

417
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,590
So that you can get up again,

418
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,490
I will make it so.

419
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,790
You're sending me to Gameop Temple?

420
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:37,820
You deserve to die, but I've decided to forgive you.

421
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,680
Please repent your sins at Gameop Temple.

422
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:47,070
There is no way I will leave this palace.

423
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:52,530
To the very end, will you insist on seeing a shameful sight?

424
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,180
Why should I?

425
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,100
Why should I get kicked out by a Goryeo girl like you?

426
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,770
Empress Dowager, don't bring death upon yourself.

427
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:10,620
I am not that benevolent.

428
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:29,580
Even after death, I will become a ghost in this palace.

429
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,970
How can I leave here?

430
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,630
I am the head of this Inner Court.

431
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,650
I am!

432
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,550
She committed suicide. Burn her body

433
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,890
and discard it outside the palace.

434
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,550
Get Yeom Byeong Soo!

435
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,400
When we get out of here, let's meet in Goryeo Village.

436
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,070
What? Goryeo Village people think of us as their mortal enemies.

437
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,330
That's why they won't look for us there.

438
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,400
Hide, and when you get a chance, run away.

439
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,310
Yes.

440
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,390
Fight until the end!

441
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,610
So where did you agree to meet him?

442
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,110
Yes. This way.

443
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,070
Maybe he was caught and killed?

444
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,100
Why is he so late?

445
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,740
Elder, it's Jo Cham.

446
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,180
Why are you so late?

447
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:43,860
You rat-like bastard. How dare you hide in Goryeo Village of all places?

448
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:53,890
Now we finally get to end your filthy life.

449
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,750
Kill him!

450
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,160
Kill Yeom Byeong Soo.

451
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:21,800
I guess you live for a long time when you suck the blood of your own people?

452
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,340
If the nation is starving its people to death,

453
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,550
shouldn't I live by sucking on something?

454
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:37,030
So you can't repent your sins until the end, either.

455
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,830
You are the same!

456
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:49,770
You also trampled on others to survive and came this far.

457
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:53,870
You became an empress, and I did not succeed.

458
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:57,030
But aside from that, how are we different?

459
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:03,030
Do you really not know what your sins are?

460
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,280
My sins?

461
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,690
Being very unlucky,

462
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:26,100
so I had to be born

463
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:30,340
in a pathetic nation like Goryeo!

464
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,770
If that is a sin, then yes, I'm a sinner.

465
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,150
If I have more sins, please tell me.

466
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:51,590
Just what sin have I committed that I deserve to die?

467
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,520
Kill Yeom Byeong Soo!

468
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,820
Kill! Kill!

469
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,800
Yuan's dog who killed his own people!

470
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:09,150
Kill him!

471
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,520
Yes!

472
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:18,090
I am Yeom Byeong Soo! How upright and proper are you?

473
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,150
You foolish and ignorant guys!

474
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,360
Kill Yeom Byeong Soo!

475
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,750
Kill him! Kill him!

476
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,940
Kill him!

477
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,370
Kill him! Kill him!

478
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:26,100
A man worse than an insect is dying. Why do you cry?

479
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,710
If the nation was proper,

480
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:36,620
Yeom Byeong Soo would have been a good husband

481
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,590
and a good father in Goryeo.

482
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:48,360
That is yet another image of a pitiful Goryeo person who didn't receive the protection of his country.

483
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,630
Stop!

484
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,530
Her Imperial Majesty the Empress.

485
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,070
Are they tributes from Goryeo?

486
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

487
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:16,280
The palace has not demanded any tributes from Goryeo. What is going on?

488
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,060
I'm sorry.

489
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,140
It is popular for the high officials to have Goryeo women as their mistresses.

490
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,640
Head Eunuch Dok Man.

491
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:30,520
Take them to the palace and allow them to rest. Then return them to Goryeo.

492
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

493
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:48,500
The high officials continue to transfer tributes from Goryeo to make them their mistresses.

494
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,140
I will not tolerate this anymore.

495
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,390
If anyone is discovered doing this, regardless of reason,

496
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:02,300
you will be severely punished in the name of this kingdom's empress who was once a tribute.

497
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:09,230
One more thing. Some lords and magistrates

498
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:14,690
wish to annex Goryeo.

499
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,550
I ask that I never hear of it again.

500
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:25,560
Whoever you are, even if you are a member of the imperial family,

501
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:31,960
I will never forgive you.

502
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:49,930
Your Majesty, this is Prince Gangneung.
(T/N: King Gongmin of Goryeo)

503
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:58,040
If you promise me one thing, I will let you ascend the throne.

504
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,850
Don't do anything that will cause me trouble.

505
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:09,050
Do you understand what I mean?

506
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

507
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:14,050
An edict will be sent soon.

508
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:17,960
Please escort the prince safely.

509
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,750
I will do so, Your Majesty.

510
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,750
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

511
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:35,500
Your Majesty, I think it will be good for you to supervise the new King of Goryeo.

512
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,260
Is that necessary?

513
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,890
You can't trust Prince Gangneung completely.

514
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,200
Ask Eunuch Bang to do it.

515
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,200
How about leaving it to your older brothers?

516
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,430
What do you think?

517
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,610
My older brothers?

518
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,600
They will be on your side, more than anyone.

519
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:10,350
Open the palace gates! A messenger! Open the gates!

520
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,070
What happened?

521
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:24,450
Prime Minister Toqto'a died during the battle.

522
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:32,830
The rebel forces will arrive at Daedo soon. You must run away, Your Majesty.

523
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,700
Teacher...

524
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:51,470
The Red Turban Rebels crossed the Yellow River.

525
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:55,930
If you cannot block them, Daedo will be in danger soon.

526
00:50:55,930 --> 00:51:01,280
I heard their army is formidable.

527
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,820
If by some chance I cannot return, and our nation...

528
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:19,040
... if Daedo is in danger, please escape to the north.

529
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,650
The meadows of Mongolia are still empty. If you go there,

530
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,800
you will be safe as you plan for the future.

531
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,980
Your Majesty?

532
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,640
You must get up now.

533
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,320
Yang.

534
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:01,130
Yang...

535
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:12,760
What happened to the rebel forces?

536
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:17,960
Don't worry, please.

537
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,930
Prime Minister brought news of victory.

538
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:39,840
What a relief. That's great news.

539
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,110
Your Majesty,

540
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,100
do you want to

541
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:52,710
ride with me in the meadows in the north?

542
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:59,050
Isn't that where Yuan began?

543
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,480
I wanted to

544
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:06,070
go there with you.

545
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:11,320
Yes... Yes.

546
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:17,140
If my empress wants it, where couldn't we go?

547
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,760
Outside,

548
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,040
the preparations for our travel are complete.

549
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,040
Yang.

550
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,190
My ears are itchy.

551
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:43,230
Please lie down in my lap.

552
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,960
Thank you to the entire Imperial Team for their hard work!

553
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:55,000

Channel Manager: captncoco

558
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:24,670
I remember when I first came here as a palace maid.

559
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:34,620
Your Majesty told me that your ears were itchy.

560
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,190
And at that time...

561
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,050
I love you.

562
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,150
I love you, Yang.

563
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,490
I love you, too,

564
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,230
Your Majesty.

565
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,450
I sincerely...

566
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:17,190
love you, Your Majesty...

567
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:29,160
♫ Don't you see me? ♫

568
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:37,540
♫ I continue breathing at your side ♫

569
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:45,720
♫ I guess you don't hear me ♫

570
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:51,980
♫ My love is for you ♫

571
00:55:53,040 --> 00:56:00,890
♫ With the words, "I love you," can't I have you next to me? ♫

572
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:08,150
♫ Won't you allow me for just one day? ♫

573
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:15,930
♫ Does my loving you make it hard for you? ♫

574
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:25,030
♫ Sorry. I am sorry for loving you ♫

575
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,440
Mother, are you a Goryeo person or a Yuan person?

576
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,730
Why do you ask that?

577
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:49,670
Goryeo people say that you are a Yuan person,

578
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:54,570
and Yuan people say that you are a Goryeo person.

579
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:59,700
Goryeo or Yuan, that is not important.

580
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:07,590
I just fought to protect my people and I won. That is all.

581
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:35,020
♫ Because I’m dangerous, my love ♫

582
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:40,710
♫ The more you love me ultimately the more
only you may be hurt ♫

583
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:48,900
♫ Don’t test me or my love ♫
