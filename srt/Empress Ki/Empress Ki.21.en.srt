1
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,670
The children of the traitor, come out now and surrender.

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,480
Shut your mouth!

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,600
Get rid of them all!

4
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,550
Seung Nyang.

5
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,560
It's a white ribbon.

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Does this mean El Temür is alive?

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,650
You must not kill Tanqishi.

8
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,410
It's a trap, Your Majesty.

9
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,740
So El Temür did not die.

10
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,910
We will change our plans.

11
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,300
Rebel forces, come out now and taste Bayan's sword.

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,110
Shut your mouth, Bayan!

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,870
Get rid of every last one of them.

14
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,170
Didn't we agree to kill Tanqishi?

15
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,070
Do you think I would help rebel forces like you?

16
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,380
You betrayed me!

17
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,120
General!

18
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,210
We can't leave anyone alive who knows our true identities.

19
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,180
I am aware.

20
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,330
These damned people.

21
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,660
How dare they deceive us so completely?

22
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,530
They're Capital Defense Forces! Our army is here!

23
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,000
We are surrounded.

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,540
This is what Tanqishi wanted.

25
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,680
Please lie down, Father. You will relapse.

26
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,480
My soldiers are fighting and bleeding.

27
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,520
How can I lie down and just wait for their victory?

28
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,210
A messenger has arrived.

29
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,260
Hurry and let him in.

30
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,730
- What happened?
- We've gotten rid of the rebel forces.

31
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:44,000
General Tanqishi will arrive soon with the army, Prime Minister.

32
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,070
Father.

33
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,780
I will go to the Great Hall and greet them.

34
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,030
Yes, Your Highness!

35
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,230
Your Majesty.

36
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,660
Prime Minister is headed to the Great Hall.

37
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,890
It's better this way.

38
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,600
There's no one by El Temür's side. Go there right away

39
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,910
and kill him.

40
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,410
Yes, Sire.

41
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,620
What's the matter, Father?

42
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,130
Your Majesty, stand behind me! Hurry!

43
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,050
Who sent you? Empress Dowager? If not...

44
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,700
Take a good look at me.

45
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,420
I took down an emperor. Do you think I'd die by the hands of assassins?

46
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,310
Don't die!

47
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,910
Yes, Prime Minister!

48
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:57,420
If you... command me not to die, I won't die!

49
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,590
Father!

50
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,750
I'm headed over to see Prime Minister El Temür's last moments.

51
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,660
Would you like to come with me?

52
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,300
What do you mean?

53
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,730
I'm going to kill him with my own hands.

54
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,300
The rebel forces have been crushed.

55
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,820
Wh-What did you say?

56
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,260
Tanqishi will be arriving soon with the army.

57
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,260
Your Majesty, you must stop the assassination right away!

58
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,230
Assassination?

59
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,350
Prime Minister!

60
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,040
How dare you! Without any fear in front of me, El Temür!

61
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,310
- Father! Father!
- Please refrain yourself, Your Majesty!

62
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,070
Father! Father!

63
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,340
Now, I'll take you down one by one.

64
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,330
Stop!

65
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,330
I said, stop!

66
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,210
Sire!

67
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,240
I'm so sorry...

68
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,940
I have to protect His Majesty...

69
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,230
If I had been even a little late, it would have been terrible, Prime Minister.

70
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,270
Brother!

71
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,140
What happened?

72
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,960
There were assassins.

73
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,730
His Majesty saved us.

74
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,050
We lived thanks to his imperial grace.

75
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,120
They're the ones who enlisted the soldiers in support of the rebel forces.

76
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,530
Hear me, sinners.

77
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,190
The now-dead Bang Jin and Joo Guk Cheong circulated the slanderous documents

78
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,490
and influenced the public sentiment and conspired to revolt in order to seize power.

79
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,480
Without a doubt, there is someone who led the coup!

80
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,750
If you confess, I will let you live.

81
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,670
But if you refuse to open your mouth, you will be put to death!

82
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,230
Minister Hyeong, name who led it!

83
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,380
I do not know anything!

84
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,320
Order the execution.

85
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,430
You- You are telling me to do it?

86
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,720
The execution of the traitors calls for the imperial order!

87
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,640
Hurry up, Your Majesty!

88
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,130
Your Majesty!

89
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,080
I order... Minister Hyeong...

90
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,430
to be executed.

91
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,050
Please!

92
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,420
Execute him.

93
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,610
Execute him.

94
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:25,120
Bang Jin of the privy council told me he was given orders by Empress Dowager!

95
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,570
How dare you lie!

96
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,080
I heard clearly from Bang Jin.

97
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,790
The one who is responsible for the revolt is definitely Empress Dowager!

98
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,900
Silence!

99
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,520
Take her away!

100
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,220
Your Highness!

101
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:16,170
Your Majesty, we finally caught the person responsible for the rebel forces!

102
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,100
Father.

103
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,460
You must never protect me.

104
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,630
Do what Prime Minister asks of you.

105
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,560
That's the only way you can be cleared of El Temur's suspicion.

106
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,190
What if he tells me to order your execution?

107
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,650
He won't be able to.

108
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,630
Everyone who I met in person have all died.

109
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,910
But, Your Highness—

110
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,620
As long as you are alive and well,

111
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,940
I can rise up again.

112
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,060
Understand?

113
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,160
It's all my fault.

114
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,290
I acted in haste.

115
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,520
Don't worry about me.

116
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,840
You must defend the throne no matter what.

117
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,370
I'm not the one who led the revolt! This is slander, Your Majesty!

118
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,100
Your Majesty, depose the empress dowager right away

119
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,550
and send her away to Gameop Temple!

120
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,380
This is unfair, Your Majesty.

121
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,650
Do you not hear me?

122
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,680
Right now...

123
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,130
I order...

124
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,680
Empress Dowager be deposed.

125
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,930
Your Majesty.

126
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,060
Take her away!

127
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,530
I will still be praying to Buddha for your sake!

128
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,200
Please be healthy, Your Majesty!

129
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,470
Don't worry.

130
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,620
I will carry your secrets to my grave.

131
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,720
Are you saying you will put all the blame on yourself?

132
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,160
Just promise me one thing.

133
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,890
While I'm not here, we need to gather up enough power to fight against the prime minister.

134
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:08,940
That is the only way... when I come back, we can drive out El Temur's family.

135
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,090
We will make sure your sacrifice is not for naught.

136
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,050
Don't worry, Your Highness.

137
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,840
Your Majesty, now let's give our

138
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,210
vassals of merit who stopped the rebel forces their reward!

139
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,700
You take care of it how you see fit, Prime Minister.

140
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,600
Your Highness.

141
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,270
Your Highness.

142
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,590
Your Highness.

143
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:32,220
Empress's jealousy might be intolerable.

144
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:41,890
Even if I'm not here, you must do everything you can to protect the heir.

145
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,890
Yes, Your Highness.

146
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,460
I will do so.

147
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,080
Her Majesty is here!

148
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,550
You've managed to keep your position for quite a while.

149
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,080
Now you have a big responsibility.

150
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,060
Please do your utmost to lead the inner court well.

151
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,130
Look at yourself.

152
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,420
Do you still think you're the empress dowager?

153
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,100
You should have left me alone.

154
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:44,320
Enjoy the scent of the nunnery until you grow old and die,

155
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,610
Your Highness.

156
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,000
I will be praying to Buddha that you bear an heir.

157
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,960
If you still don't manage to become pregnant,

158
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,220
think of it as a punishment from Heaven because of your father's sins.

159
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,210
What?

160
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,220
Seo, what should I do with that fox?

161
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:23,820
No matter how desperate she acts, you're the winner.

162
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,860
Since you now control the inner court,

163
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,140
why not generously forgive her, Your Majesty.

164
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,850
Right.

165
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,210
I will show her clearly

166
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,390
how I manage the inner court.

167
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,780
Prime Minister...

168
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,560
just because my head is shaven,

169
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,530
do you think I will become a ghost in Gameop Temple?

170
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:30,120
You will regret bitterly that you didn't kill me.

171
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,670
Bayan,

172
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,960
- have a drink.
- Yes, Prime Minister.

173
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,660
What do you think about overseeing Liaoyang Province?

174
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,380
- Father.
- Among the 10 provinces in Yuan,

175
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,800
it's the closest to Daedo.

176
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,260
Become the magistrate and oversee the province.

177
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,560
- I will do my utmost.
- I will do my utmost.

178
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,720
As for you, the empress praised you for your active role in this matter.

179
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,970
Tell me what you want.

180
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,570
Let me...

181
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,630
be reinstated as the King of Goryeo.

182
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,390
I told you to put away useless dreams.

183
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,400
I don't... trust the country of Goryeo.

184
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,870
For 30 years,

185
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,380
those malicious people have fought against Yuan!

186
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,630
There has never been a country that has tormented us more in this world.

187
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,110
You are...

188
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,220
not someone I want to become the King of Goryeo.

189
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,300
Stay here

190
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,430
and live with wealth and honor alongside me.

191
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,600
I got word from Goryeo

192
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,230
that my father is ill.

193
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,470
May I take a short trip?

194
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,540
How could I stop you from doing that? Now, have a drink.

195
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,860
I was rewarded with a high position unexpectedly,

196
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,430
but you didn't get to fulfill your wish.

197
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,350
You're not content with just the position you were given, are you?

198
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:34,440
The reason I wanted power was to make this into a proper country.

199
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:40,420
What can I change as a magistrate of one province?

200
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,100
I will gather up power in my own way,

201
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,100
so you do it your way as well.

202
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,390
Of course, that's a given.

203
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,660
Liaoyang Province is bigger than Goryeo.

204
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,500
Since you've become the magistrate there,

205
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,930
what's the difference in being a king of a country?

206
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,690
I'm worried about His Majesty.

207
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,000
Empress Dowager has left the palace and now we're leaving, too.

208
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,550
He's no different than an orphan.

209
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:21,180
Prime Minister El Temür's terror will become even worse.

210
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,840
What brings you here?

211
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,120
It bothers me to no end that the assassins who tried to kill me

212
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,460
were eunuchs who were once affiliated with the caravans.

213
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,290
We were told already they were...

214
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,680
bribed to be assassins.

215
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,990
Why do you look at me that way?

216
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,310
From now on, whom you meet and where you go,

217
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,470
will be reported to me. Just be aware of that fact

218
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,390
and watch your actions.

219
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,700
Also, you only went to the empress's quarters on set days.

220
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,460
But from now on, go there frequently.

221
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,760
It's your fault that the empress isn't pregnant. Understand?

222
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,750
I understand, Prime Minister.

223
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,790
- Your Majesty.
- Yang...

224
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,010
Please call Yang for me.

225
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,780
- I can't breathe.
- Yang has...

226
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,480
gone back to Goryeo with Wang Yoo.

227
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,670
- Did he get reinstated as king?
- I do not know the details.

228
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,910
Why did Yang leave without even a goodbye?

229
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,040
Perhaps Prime Minister prevented her from doing so.

230
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,040
Your Majesty...

231
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,070
Empress Dowager is no longer here...

232
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,420
and General Bayan has left, too.

233
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,740
Even Yang has gone,

234
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,900
so now...

235
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,220
am I truly all alone?

236
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,700
Your Majesty...

237
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,480
Is our sovereign that ill?

238
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,540
You're so dim-witted. It's just an excuse that he's ill.

239
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,910
There are problems in Goryeo, so he's asking for His Majesty to come back home.

240
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,390
Oh, is that what happened?

241
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,580
Only I didn't know it?

242
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,400
Don't worry about us here.

243
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,510
You must stay safe on your travel there and back, Your Majesty.

244
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,720
Would you like to...

245
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,330
come back to Goryeo with me even for a short while?

246
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:05,170
I hear Tanqishi is looking for the bloodletter.

247
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:09,390
If he gets his hands on it, your reinstatement

248
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,950
and my revenge will...

249
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,730
all come to ruin.

250
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,820
I will come back right away after finding out what the problem is.

251
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,730
Until then...

252
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,550
everyone, please stay safe.

253
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,790
Your Majesty, we must leave now.

254
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,220
Take good care of His Majesty.

255
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,120
Please stay safe.

256
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,960
Don't just think about women.

257
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:38,530
♫ Disappearing like something blowing and caught in my hand ♫

258
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,700
♫ At night when I clutched my chest and held my breath ♫

259
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,090
♫ At night when I clutched my chest and held my breath ♫

260
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,700
♫ In the darkness my day passed in sadness ♫

261
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,890
♫ In the darkness my day passed in sadness ♫

262
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,970
♫ No matter how I try and try to conceal them  ♫

263
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,190
♫ The tears keep filling my eyes ♫

264
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:14,970
♫ What can I do about the longing ♫

265
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,020
♫ Which runs and overflows like tears? ♫

266
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,810
Yeom Byeong Soo!

267
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,610
From now on, you take charge of the Kheshigs.
(T/N: Imperial Mongolian Personal Bodyguards)

268
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,820
I will serve you faithfully even if I have to grind down my bones

269
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,130
and break apart my body!

270
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:41,840
You will need to change out the Kheshigs with my soldiers and multiply them in number.

271
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,230
Yes, Prime Minister!

272
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,500
And you two take charge of the palace and the capital defense forces.

273
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,150
Yes, Father.

274
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:58,280
One mistake is enough. There should never again be insolent powers within the palace

275
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,300
raising their heads!

276
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,310
Where are you going?

277
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,400
Where we're going isn't your concern.

278
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,620
Watch your mouth!

279
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,400
He's the Captain of the Kheshig Guards, you eunuch.

280
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,200
All you got from betraying Goryeo is becoming a gatekeeper for the palace?

281
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,710
I see you've managed to survive.

282
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:48,810
Thanks to that dethroned king, all of you seem to be flapping your wings.

283
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:54,810
But as long as I'm in charge of the Kheshigs, I won't go easy on anyone that I disapprove of.

284
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,080
It's been a while, Seung Nyang. Did you not enjoy being a court lady? You're back to looking like a boy.

285
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:15,240
From today on, double the patrols of the palace grounds and be on full alert.

286
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,670
Yes, Captain.

287
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:24,810
Now that I'm in charge of the Kheshigs, something has to change.

288
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,460
Jeok Ho?

289
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,240
He stole money?

290
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,890
Why are you looking for him?

291
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:57,560
It's been said that he... has the bloodletter of the late Emperor Mingzong.

292
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,570
Bloodletter?

293
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,860
He's bald and a great swordsman.

294
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,980
Is there anyone here at Goryeo Village like that?

295
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,100
If you go to the Sorim Temple down the road,

296
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,620
there are tons of bald monks with great swordsmanship.

297
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,830
Seriously, he's not a monk but a eunuch, I said.

298
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,800
Eunuch? I thought he was supposed to be a monk.

299
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,320
Do you remember anyone like that?

300
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,710
Red tiger?

301
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,500
Jeok Ho...
 (T/N: jeok - red, ho - tiger)

302
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,860
Whether it's Jeok Ho or Gae Ko, he's not here,

303
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,090
so don't ever come back to ask about anything else!

304
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,370
Please think one more...

305
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,760
I think we made a useless trip.

306
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,010
I told you.

307
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,400
I told you not to listen to that crazy Court Lady Noh.

308
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,250
Tonight, we have to come back.

309
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,560
Come back? Why again?

310
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,470
I need to confirm something.

311
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,140
There's someone suspicious in the Goryeo Village.

312
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,790
Suspicious?

313
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:47,010
But he's not a eunuch.

314
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:51,790
He has a mustache and a full head of hair.

315
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,570
Has anyone ever seen Jeok Ho's face?

316
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:00,140
There's a picture that's been drawn from father's memory.

317
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,800
May I take a look?

318
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:20,170
They do have similar features...

319
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,290
That is him! The Chief of the Goryeo Village!

320
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,820
He is Jeok Ho!

321
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,390
Who's there?

322
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:43,520
Who sent you? If you don't tell me, I'll put a hole through your neck.

323
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,030
Before that happens, you will lose your head first.

324
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:55,360
That bloodletter, give it to us.

325
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,340
You're looking for Jeok Ho, too?

326
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,010
What? You are...

327
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,780
We apologize for our disrespect, Chief.

328
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,440
It makes sense that El Temür is looking for it,

329
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,620
but why do you need the bloodletter?

330
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:31,400
We're trying to take down El Temür.

331
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:39,480
I thought something was odd ever since you took all the mice. So you all were responsible for the slanderous document.

332
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,690
But I don't have that bloodletter.

333
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,020
Please, Sir. Don't be like that.

334
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,130
We came knowing everything, so please give it to us.

335
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:53,100
Before the emperor passed away,

336
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,250
he gave me an order.

337
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,870
That he would write a letter in blood and leave it in a book

338
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:17,420
and asked me to take it to His Highness the Crown Prince.

339
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,890
There was a picture of a butterfly on the bloodletter.

340
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:35,960
He said it was a code between him and the crown prince.

341
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,490
Kill all the court ladies and eunuchs who served the (late) emperor!

342
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,170
Yes, Sir!

343
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:14,730
Later when he found out the emperor had written a bloodletter, he went raving mad.

344
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,230
I thought the letter would be confiscated if I was caught,

345
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,160
so I decided to hide it for the time being.

346
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,260
But how did you survive during all that chaos?

347
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,600
There is a secret passage inside the palace that only I know about.

348
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,060
I escaped through it.

349
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:15,740
Then... where is the place that you hid the bloodletter?

350
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,630
We'll find it! Tell us its location!

351
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:23,410
I ordered a eunuch, later on, to look for it

352
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:28,000
and the bloodletter had disappeared without a trace.

353
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,200
By chance... do you know who took it?

354
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,580
Tell us who it was.

355
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:50,450
Chief! Chief!

356
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,430
Wait a moment.

357
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,060
Chief!

358
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,000
It's Yeom Byeong Soo! Where are you?

359
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It's Yeom Byeong Soo!

360
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,230
That damn Yeom Byeog Soo!

361
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,560
Hurry. Over there.

362
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,580
Where are you, Chie—

363
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,450
Have you been well, Chief?

364
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,070
Isn't this the uniform for the Captain of the Kheshigs?

365
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:28,720
Like someone who used to live at the palace, how did you recognize my position with one look?

366
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,880
So you're Jeok Ho.

367
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,590
Why? Do you feel like it's unfair?

368
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:56,730
I also feel the same. Why didn't I realize you were Jeok Ho earlier?

369
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,110
Search his home and find the bloodletter!

370
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,690
- Yes, General!
- Yes, General!

371
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,420
Come on!

372
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,210
- Search every corner!
- Yes!

373
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,250
General, we've looked everywhere and it's nowhere to be found.

374
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,400
It's true, General.

375
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,950
Take him to the palace!

376
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,390
- Yes, General!
- Yes, General!

377
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,740
- Take him!
- Yes!

378
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:44,700
We can't lose the bloodletter to them!

379
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,820
If you make a move now, it'll put us in danger, too.

380
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,760
Seung Nyang is right.

381
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,020
We'll have to wait for an opportunity inside the palace.

382
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,610
Proceed!

383
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,020
You're here, Prime Minister.

384
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,500
Jeok Ho! It's been a while.

385
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,440
Prime Minister...

386
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,240
Holding out any longer will only ruin your body. Tell me where the bloodletter is right now.

387
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,540
I don't know anything about that.

388
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,380
Why are you asking me to talk about something I don't know anything about?

389
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,620
I guess they've been too easy on you.

390
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,870
Burn him.

391
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,390
You must not kill him.

392
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:58,750
No worries, Sir. I am an expert in draining them without killing them.

393
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,800
What happened?

394
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,490
Seeing how there's no special movement, I don't think he's said anything yet.

395
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:31,390
Tonight, we need to get Jeok Ho out.

396
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:36,380
This is the palace. Even if we get him out, how will we get him away from here?

397
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,940
He said there was a secret passage only he knows about.

398
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,230
If we can just free him, we'll be able to get him out through there.

399
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:47,650
Ever since Yeom Byeong Soo became their captain, the Kheshigs have become more vigilant.

400
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:53,430
If we can figure out their movements, we'll be able to find their weak spots.

401
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:59,380
Eunuch Bang, please find out when they change the guards.

402
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,970
Deputy Commander Park, find out their route and the exact time for each patrol's round.

403
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:10,630
Tonight, when the guards are the least alert,

404
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,220
we will make our move.

405
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,260
Your Majesty, I'm here for the morning greeting.

406
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,000
You look quite pregnant.

407
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,880
She is due to give birth in just four months.

408
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,670
Who asked you anything?!

409
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,480
Why didn't you come by last night for the evening greeting?

410
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,130
Last night, the fetal activity was too severe, so—

411
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,790
I told you to keep silent!

412
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,660
After sitting on Empress Dowager's lap all this time, did you think the laws of the inner court were insignificant?

413
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,420
Not at all, Your Majesty.

414
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,430
If not, were you dismissing me because you bear the heir of His Majesty?

415
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,770
I've committed a grave sin. Please forgive me this once.

416
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,950
I can't stand the sight of you, so get out immediately.

417
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,430
Your Majesty.

418
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,910
Whenever I see her stomach, it turns my stomach inside out, and...

419
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:39,290
Your Majesty, do you still have an upset stomach?

420
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,640
I feel so heavy in the stomach these days. I don't feel well.

421
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,040
It seems like a serious case of indigestion, so I will call for the physician.

422
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:53,260
Never mind the physician. Bring me some spicy food. I think that might help ease the discomfort.

423
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,470
I understand, Your Ma—

424
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,010
Your Majesty.

425
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,280
Perhaps, are you with child?

426
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:06,190
For the past two or so months, you also missed your monthly.

427
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,120
Well, that's because...

428
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,390
Wait...

429
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,960
I... can't eat spicy food.

430
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,330
I don't even like it.

431
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:21,160
Your Majesty, congratulations.

432
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,510
You're finally with child!

433
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,460
I...

434
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,190
I... am pregnant...

435
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,140
You prayed for it dearly.

436
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:42,780
Buddha was finally moved by your earnest wishes.

437
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,720
There's no way the empress could become pregnant!

438
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,780
But the rumor is all throughout the palace.

439
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,900
There's no way.

440
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:03,400
From the combination of toxicity from the lip color and the smoke from the incense, she could never become pregnant.

441
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,670
It's a method that Indian women use to prevent pregnancy.

442
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,550
If you prolong its use, you can never bear a child.

443
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:16,590
Then... maybe the empress figured it out?

444
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:22,100
If you look at the lip color and the incense, they look very ordinary.

445
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,380
There's no way she would figure it out.

446
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:45,810
We only have an hour until the next shift.

447
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:49,660
We need to free Jeok Ho within that time and escape from the palace.

448
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,790
Let's go.

449
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,270
Who is that?

450
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:07,310
Over there!

451
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,190
Chief!

452
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,060
You are...

453
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,340
We need to leave right away.

454
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,330
Let's go, Sir.

455
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,000
Where's the secret passage?

456
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,040
There's a passage that leads to the outside from the royal corridor.

457
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,810
We'll lure the guards away, so Seung Nyang, you two get out through the passage.

458
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,440
Let's hurry.

459
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,860
They're running away!

460
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,720
Get them!

461
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,260
Get them!

462
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,720
Go get those men. I'll catch Jeok Ho!

463
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,080
Let's go!

464
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,430
This way!

465
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,010
Get him!

466
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,480
Seung... Seung Nyang!

467
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,590
Go ahead. Hurry.

468
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,010
Who are you?!

469
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,170
S-Seung Nyang, you were here?

470
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:30,000
Over by the royal quarters! Catch him!

471
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,650
Seung Nyang, let's go to my room.

472
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,060
It'll put you in danger.

473
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:42,110
Where can you go in this state?

474
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,570
It would be better to go to the bathhouse, Your Majesty.

475
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,520
You've bled too much.

476
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,780
- It-It's okay.
- Stay still.

477
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,340
How did this happen?

478
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:35,870
Are you sure it was Seung Nyang?

479
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,950
She can't fool me. They were Seung Nyang's eyes.

480
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:42,520
The blood trail has stopped.

481
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,830
It's the bathhouse.

482
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,700
- I'm fine.
- Hold on just a while longer.

483
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,380
As soon as the Kheshigs leave, I'll call the physician.

484
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:49,400
Your Majesty, Tanqishi is headed this way.

485
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,720
You must never...

486
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,810
You must never let him come in here.

487
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

488
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:34,150
What brings you here, General?

489
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,890
- Open the door.
- His Majesty is taking a bath right now.

490
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:39,230
If you have a matter to discuss, you should come back in the morning—

491
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,610
General Tanqishi, what do you think you're doing right now?

492
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,980
What is this about?

493
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,590
Someone helped a prisoner escape and disappeared nearby.

494
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,020
Oh, I see.

495
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:17,830
As you can see, nothing is going on here.

496
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,900
But...

497
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,860
why a bath so late in the evening?

498
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,160
I couldn't sleep and I thought it would help me recover from fatigue.

499
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,300
But...

500
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,780
must I, the emperor, explain such things to you?

501
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,210
My apologies.

502
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,540
Please finish bathing.

503
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,180
I need to search this area.

504
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:03,140
How long do you intend to look at my naked body?!

505
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:07,220
You are much too rude!

506
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,350
Even Prime Minister never acted like this!

507
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,380
I found Seung Nyang's blood outside.

508
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,930
- Where is it leading to?
- Toward the western gate.

509
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:25,390
Damn it.

510
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,230
Let's go!

511
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,490
Seung Nyang! Wake up, Seung Nyang!

512
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,240
Seung Nyang!

513
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:01,000
♫ Even though they were hard to erase and erase ♫

514
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,980
♫  the painful memories  ♫

515
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:10,660
♫ which are imagined again ♫

516
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,480
♫ which are imagined again make our sad love sadder ♫
