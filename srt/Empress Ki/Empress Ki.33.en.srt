1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,370
Have you sobered up a little?

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,020
Yes.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,950
Don't get bothered about what the empress said. She was speaking nonsense since she was drunk.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,120
I think I should get back to my quarters.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,290
♫ On that day ♫

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,370
♫ when the weather was so warm ♫

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,230
Tonight,

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,020
why don't you sleep here?

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,790
♫ Embraced in your arms, I rested ♫

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,170
How long are you going to keep me lonely?

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,460
- Your Majesty.
- I'm asking you until when you're going to keep your distance.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,130
♫ That day we loved until we wept ♫

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,460
I want you.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,020
♫ Can't I return to that day? ♫

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:06,800
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,510
♫ Embrace me in your arms ♫

17
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,820
♫ If I could become the dust flying in the wind ♫

18
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,370
♫ If I could become the raindrops on your window ♫

19
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,900
I will wait.

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,780
Until the day you take me into your arms first.

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,850
♫ No matter where it is, as long as you are there ♫

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,790
Even though you're with me,

23
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,330
I miss you so much.

24
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,790
♫ Until I wept ♫

25
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,350
Right now,

26
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,900
you should only be thinking about how to gain back your authority.

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,630
You're the one who made me this way.

28
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,400
So don't make me wait too long.

29
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,890
♫ at any time ♫

30
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,120
♫ You can return to me ♫

31
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,900
Go back to your quarters and get some rest.

32
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:12,240
♫ Because I will always remain there ♫

33
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,810
♫ Don't let the passing time ♫

34
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,040
♫ make you give up ♫

35
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,640
Is something on your mind?

36
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,620
I've started to become...

37
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,270
a little fearful.

38
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,660
You're so strong. What is making you fearful?

39
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,650
Your Majesty, what brings you here so late at night?

40
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,080
That wench Ki went into the emperor's quarters.

41
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,020
She's making a fool out of me even out here!

42
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,110
Tonight is the last time the two of them will be able to hurt your feelings.

43
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,120
Are you done preparing to kill that wench?

44
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,760
It's not just Lady Ki.

45
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,350
What are you talking about?

46
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,320
- You don't mean...
- Yes.

47
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,030
The two of them will die together.

48
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,590
- You didn't tell me you were going to kill the emperor, too.
- It's Father's orders.

49
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,180
The emperor and Lady Ki...

50
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,280
They will both die.

51
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,260
That's enough!

52
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,190
Those bastards are trying all kinds of things in order to win.

53
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,610
They must be planning on catching a large animal.

54
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,740
Cover it up so you can't see it.

55
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,340
Begin.

56
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,590
- Did you poison the arrows?
- Of course.

57
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,210
One arrow will cause death.

58
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,850
Let's finish up and go back.

59
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,540
Once they leave, we should destroy the trap they installed.

60
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,210
It's going to be daylight soon. How will we destroy them all?

61
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,920
Still, we can't let them cheat.

62
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,550
- We should do as much as we can.
- Those bastards...

63
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,000
they're really trying to capture all the animals. How many traps did they set?

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,780
There are 30 in total. Especially,

65
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,780
they're concentrated in this location, Cheonmaru, where the emperor's group has planned to hunt.

66
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,700
That will become his gravesite.

67
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,070
Make sure you place a man there who doesn't talk easily and is trustworthy.

68
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,100
Yes, Sir.

69
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,100
Don't take part in tomorrow's hunt.

70
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,350
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,900
I will watch that wench's demise with my eyes wide open.

72
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,350
Did you sleep well?

73
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

74
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,950
Today...

75
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,330
let's try to do well in the hunting competition.

76
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,080
You lost in the horseriding competition yesterday, too.

77
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,550
Your Majesty, you told me you won.

78
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,530
Golta, I said I... nearly won. When did I...

79
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,200
say I won?

80
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,900
Well, anyway, the real competition starts today.

81
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,720
Let's see who catches a bigger game.

82
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,120
Yes, I am confident, whatever it is.

83
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,160
- Your Majesty!
- My Lady!

84
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,200
What are you doing? Follow them!

85
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,470
They're coming!

86
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,400
The emperor and Lady Ki are on their way.

87
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,810
Everyone, to your places!

88
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,170
What?

89
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,720
What happened?

90
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,290
The rope must have been cut.

91
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,380
This dumb bastard!

92
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,620
There's no way that would happen.

93
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,180
Go check it!

94
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,440
Check the ropes!

95
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,770
Everyone spread out and check the traps!

96
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,710
Yes, Sir!

97
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,060
- It's this way.
- What are you talking about?

98
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,330
I saw it running away that way.

99
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,840
Then you go that way. I'll go this way.

100
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,520
Fine. Let's meet here once we catch something.

101
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,750
I will show you what a strong man I am.

102
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,740
There's boar's blood here.

103
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,570
It was hit by an arrow, so it couldn't have gone far.

104
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,290
Your Majesty!

105
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,190
Why are those imperial guards hiding there?

106
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,130
That's where the traps were set.

107
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,280
Traps?

108
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:42,420
Last night, those weasels put a lot of traps everywhere.

109
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,940
They seem to really want to win this hunt.

110
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,470
Something is strange, don't you think?

111
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,670
It's not normal for people to be near the traps.

112
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,350
That's true.

113
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,570
The animals won't go that way if people are there.

114
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,990
There will be a good spectacle.

115
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:09,940
I am going to catch a very impressive animal.

116
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,990
What they're trying to catch might not be animals.

117
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,500
Pardon? What do you mean? Why wouldn't they catch animals on a hunt?

118
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,690
Where were the traps set?

119
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,600
There are several over there and over by Cheonmaru.

120
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,700
Cheonmaru is...

121
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,310
where the emperor and Seung Nyang went hunting.

122
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,830
Pardon?

123
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,660
Then... what they're trying to catch is...

124
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,990
Eunuch Bang, go and tell Bayan about this. We're going to Cheonmaru.

125
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,800
- Yes, Sire.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

126
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,510
Whoa.

128
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,810
More.

129
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,130
Just a little more.

130
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,520
Kill that wench!

131
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,090
Hurry up and get her!

132
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,960
Go and fetch more imperial guards.

133
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

134
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,290
Stop!

135
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,070
Get her!

136
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,150
It looks like we won't even catch a rabbit today.

137
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,100
Let's go back, Lady Oh.

138
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,900
Still, it's our pride on the line. How could we go back empty-handed?

139
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,050
Lady Oh! Look over there!

140
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,610
Stop!

141
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,030
What's going on?

142
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,570
We need to let His Majesty know!

143
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,640
I will kill each and every one of you.

144
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:08,460
Yang will be really surprised when she sees this.

145
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,800
I think you've won this time.

146
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,460
But... I think Lady Ki is coming back too late.

147
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,850
Your Majesty!

148
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,540
The imperial guards are trying to kill Lady Ki!

149
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,300
What? Where is she?

150
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,490
It's toward Cheonmaru.

151
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,730
I know you're out of arrows. Come out here!

152
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,580
I see this lowly wench knows how to fight.

153
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:38,410
I told you once. There's no one who's better at shooting than me at the palace!

154
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,930
Over there!

155
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:03,250
Are you trying to kill me?

156
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:09,070
There are no witnesses. Who would know if you die out here in this deserted hunting ground?

157
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,000
Then hurry up and shoot.

158
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,820
Why? You want to die quickly?

159
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,680
I can't let you. I will kill you slowly

160
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:27,260
and watch you die in pain so that I can remember it for a long time.

161
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:37,050
You probably didn't expect the cost of having received His Majesty's favor would be this cruel.

162
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,730
Even if I die, I have no regrets.

163
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:50,920
Do you know what His Majesty tells me every night as he holds me in his arms?

164
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,620
That I am the true empress of this country.

165
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,300
- What?
- He said Danashiri is not even a woman.

166
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,430
She's just a shell of a person who's like an ornament of the inner court.

167
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,050
Shut that mouth!

168
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,370
Being upset will cause the arrow to miss the mark.

169
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:25,490
You're laughable. And I feel sorry for you for being an empress who the emperor doesn't even glance at.

170
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,390
Silence I said!

171
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,180
Even if you kill me, nothing will change.

172
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:38,870
You will never feel the emperor's touch for the rest of your life; and even in death, you will be wandering the heavens thirsty for love.

173
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,420
I will rip you to death!

174
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,390
I'm the empress of this country.

175
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,200
Do you think you'll be safe if you kill me?

176
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,720
Hurry up and put down this dagger. If you do, I will have reason to let you—

177
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,700
You can't kill me.

178
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:32,120
There are no witnesses, so who would know if I killed you out here?

179
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,760
You started this fight.

180
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,140
I will end it for you right here.

181
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,890
P-Please spare me.

182
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,240
I'm sorry. Please let me live.

183
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,370
Please... Please don't kill me.

184
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:14,500
You killed the innocent Lady Park and those Goryeo servants so brutally!

185
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:22,330
Your life is precious; but yet, their lives were that insignificant?

186
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,150
I am sorry. P-Please forgive me.

187
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,680
Please. Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me, Lady Ki.

188
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,910
Silence!

189
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:43,620
Death is too light of a punishment for you.

190
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,430
I will let you live. Live on

191
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,990
and feel pain down to your bones that's worse than death.

192
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,760
I will make sure...

193
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,690
you end up that way.

194
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,430
- You're here, Father.
- What happened?

195
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,230
The emperor and Lady Ki are still in the hills.

196
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,860
We sent the imperial guards as back up, so it will be taken care of soon.

197
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,230
We're going hunting, too.

198
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,420
You mean, you're going to do it yourself?

199
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,280
We will need to bring the bodies if they're dead; and if not, we'll have to kill them!

200
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,800
Your Majesty!

201
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,950
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

202
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,380
Why are you coming now?

203
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,310
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

204
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,310
Lady Ki just headed down. Go and kill her!

205
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,080
You must be sure to get rid of her!

206
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,880
Yes, Your Majesty!

207
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,510
But... what happened that your face is...

208
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,560
There's no time to waste.

209
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,840
I need to see that wench die myself.

210
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,840
Your Majesty!

211
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,620
She's finally here.

212
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,870
Yang! Where are you Yang?

213
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,640
Your Majesty!

214
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,570
Yang!

215
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,490
Yang!

216
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,970
Are you all right?

217
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,190
Sire!

218
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,800
Sire! Protect His Majesty!

219
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,670
My Lady.

220
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,720
Your Majesty.

221
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm fine.

222
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,750
I'm glad you're safe, Yang.

223
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,930
Because of me...

224
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,250
We're killing them all.

225
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,050
If we fail, we won't be able to live.

226
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,160
We've already failed.

227
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,010
We need to kill them in order to succeed.

228
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,820
But, Commander...

229
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,690
Whoever doesn't take action now, once this is over,

230
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,990
will die by my sword!

231
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,040
Everyone follow me!

232
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Hurry up and protect His Majesty!

233
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,300
Please get away from here with His Majesty.

234
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,670
Let's go!

235
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,010
It's the emperor! Kill him!

236
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,870
Get them!

237
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,260
Get them!

238
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,840
We need to stop them.

239
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,520
There are too many of them.

240
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,440
It's too dangerous!

241
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,630
Your Majesty!

242
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,260
Your Majesty!

243
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:10,980
We have an order from Prime Minister. Please stand aside!

244
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,430
You will need to kill me if you want to go after them.

245
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,510
You're a traitor! Kill him!

246
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:27,600
♫ Carried on the wind, you are heard ♫

247
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,750
♫ Ceaselessly falling ♫

248
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,630
♫ Drip Drip Drip ♫

249
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:41,690
♫ In the sound of the rain for a long time after ♫

250
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,970
♫ Even if I wander and am lost, ♫

251
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:52,010
♫ it is you, it is you again. ♫

252
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,500
Come and get it!

253
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,980
Your Majesty, are you all right?

254
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,860
I can't see anything, and my body...

255
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,390
I have a chill.

256
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,390
Please look at me.

257
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,770
It's a poisoned arrow.

258
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,860
We need to remove the poison.

259
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,760
No.

260
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,800
If you're not careful,

261
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,190
you could be put in danger, too.

262
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,860
If we leave it alone, you will die.

263
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,840
It's dangerous.

264
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,910
You must stay awake. You must fight it.

265
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,870
Your Majesty.

266
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,830
It's Wang Yoo.

267
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,000
He betrayed us.

268
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,840
Your Majesty!

269
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,980
Your Majesty!

270
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,290
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

271
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,540
We must not let even one man chase after Seung Nyang.

272
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,290
Even if we die, we must stop them.

273
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,100
Understand?

274
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,890
This is your chance. Shoot now.

275
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,990
Hurry up, Your Majesty!

276
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,530
What's wrong with me? Why can't I kill him?

277
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,560
Your Majesty.

278
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,850
Your Majesty, please come to your senses.

279
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,490
You must get up now.

280
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,300
Please wake up, Your Majesty.

281
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,940
Your Majesty!

282
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,420
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

283
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,000
My Lady!

284
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,740
What happened?

285
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,460
He was shot with a poisoned arrow. Hurry up and help him!

286
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,570
Help His Majesty up!

287
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,990
Yes, Sir.

288
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:19,560
You're bleeding a lot. You have to get down and stop the bleeding.

289
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,830
Did you tell General Bayan?

290
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:29,060
He's on his way here with his men.

291
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,820
There's no time to waste. Please get on my back.

292
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,800
I can still walk.

293
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,310
Never mind me. I don't know if Seung Nyang is safe.

294
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,070
Your Majesty!

295
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,980
Seung Nyang's life isn't the problem right now, Your Majesty!

296
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,390
You must take care of yourself!

297
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,760
You could die like this!

298
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,140
Please kill us, Prime Minister!

299
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,520
Please kill us, Prime Minister!

300
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:22,240
Useless bastards. Making me unsheath my sword!

301
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,010
I have no excuses for failing you!

302
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,640
Father, look over there!

303
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,250
Go and surround them!

304
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,980
Yes, Sir!

305
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:10,130
Is the emperor not well?

306
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:18,030
Your Majesty, I will soon send you where you can be comfortable.

307
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,130
Father, it's Bayan!

308
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,810
How did he know?

309
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,440
Sir!

310
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,390
What happened to His Majesty?

311
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,880
He was shot with a poisoned arrow.

312
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,960
Please bring him here with you.

313
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,090
Bayan. I will take care of His Majesty.

314
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,550
I will do it, so send him this way.

315
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,800
Are you disobeying me?!

316
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,960
Stand aside, Bayan!

317
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,160
Until I have His Majesty, I will not, even if I die.

318
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,930
Prime Minister, did you plot treason?

319
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,800
Treason? What ludicrous statement!

320
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,100
His Majesty got caught in the trap set for the animals.

321
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,530
We saw it clearly.

322
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,110
How dare you lie?

323
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,730
Silence. How dare a eunuch speak flippantly?

324
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,430
If His Majesty dies in Prime Minister's arms,

325
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:55,230
the magistrates won't be able to help but suspect you.

326
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,000
Stand aside, Prime Minister.

327
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,330
Bayan, His Majesty is not well,

328
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,000
so you should take good care of him.

329
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,000
Please come this way.

330
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,090
I will help him.

331
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,780
Please lead the way, Uncle.

332
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,960
We can't let them go like this! We need to kill—

333
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,160
Father!

334
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,870
You want the whole world to know we committed treason?

335
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,840
Forgive me.

336
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,060
You will need to get rid of the evidence. Take care of the bodies of the fallen imperial guards.

337
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,600
Yes, Father.

338
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,710
Your Majesty, please wake up.

339
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:51,020
You must take the medicine, Your Majesty.

340
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,290
Your Majesty! Are you awake?

341
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,000
What happened?

342
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,670
You've been sleeping for a day and a half.

343
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:35,030
According to the physicians, you seem to have been affected by the poison.

344
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,820
- Poison.
- It's a relief that it was a small amount.

345
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,980
His Majesty. How is His Majesty?

346
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:58,880
He's still unconscious.

347
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,780
I need to go see him, so get ready.

348
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,970
Is your wound all right?

349
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,120
Don't worry.

350
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,240
Are you all right?

351
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,670
We're not that easily affected, Your Majesty.

352
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,970
Please do not worry.

353
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,970
What are you doing here?

354
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,010
Prime Minister asked to see me.

355
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,840
Prime Minister is suspected of treason.

356
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,010
You could be put in danger,

357
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:02,000
so you will need to be careful.

358
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,040
Didn't we say we were going to follow our own path?

359
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,920
Whether interest or worry,

360
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,370
please don't have

361
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,830
concern for me.

362
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,270
Don't associate yourself with Wang Yoo any more.

363
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,720
He seems to be close to El Temur.

364
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,760
Your Majesty!

365
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,090
Seung Nyang is watching. Don't give it away.

366
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:12,100
We will need to change the dressing at the guesthouse.

367
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,550
Your Majesty.

368
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:32,070
Are you all right?

369
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,080
I'm fine.

370
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,810
He can't seem to drink the tonic.

371
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,210
What can we do?

372
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,180
I will do it.

373
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,510
You will?

374
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:59,380
He ended up like this while saving me.

375
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,310
I am going to make sure

376
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,430
I save His Majesty.

377
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,740
Try leaving it to Lady Ki.

378
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,520
If there are any changes, let me know.

379
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,710
Yes, Your Highness.

380
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,610
The magistrates?

381
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:36,090
I've called for them early on, so they should soon be here.

382
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,990
There are witnesses.

383
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:42,740
This time, Prime Minister won't be able to get out of this no matter who he is.

384
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,170
I will kill him myself for committing treason.

385
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:51,940
But if Prime Minister uses the soldiers to intimidate us again like last time...

386
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:57,160
We will prevent any threat by stationing our troops around the palace.

387
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,510
I'm worried about His Majesty.

388
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,290
He has to wake up soon.

389
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,380
Will you be all right alone?

390
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,310
I will be fine.

391
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:39,350
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

392
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:46,990
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

393
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:53,010
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫

394
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,640
Your Majesty,

395
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,600
you must drink the tonic.

396
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,850
That's the only way you can live.

397
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:12,880
♫ If I could become the dust flying in the wind ♫

398
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,180
♫ If I could become the raindrops on your window ♫

399
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:24,280
♫ No matter where it is, as long as you are there ♫

400
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,790
♫ If I could go there ♫

401
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,370
♫ I would give up everything I have ♫

402
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:38,510
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

403
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:46,170
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

404
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:53,920
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫

405
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,150
♫ Embrace me in your arms ♫

406
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:04,180
♫ I stand alone in the darkness ♫

407
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:08,150
♫ Like a lost child ♫

408
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:15,090
♫ My heart is frozen with fear ♫

409
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:24,620
♫ If we could return just once ♫

410
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:32,480
♫ You can come to me at any time ♫

411
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,500
♫ Because I will always remain there ♫

412
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,360
- The emperor is showing no signs of waking up?
- Yes, Father.

413
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,160
Seeing how they're even preventing me from entering his quarters, he must be in a critical state.

414
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,420
Why did you want to see me?

415
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,480
We need a witness who will help us.

416
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,670
Can you testify on our behalf?

417
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,870
Not Wang Yoo!

418
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,470
Why not?

419
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,440
That wench Ki is from Goryeo.

420
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,190
People protect their own. How can we trust Wang Yoo?

421
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:25,940
Right now isn't the time to worry about those things.

422
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,910
The magistrates will be here soon trying to uncover the truth.

423
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:35,370
We will need to draw up a contingency plan, so please help us.

424
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,130
I would like to hear your opinion first, Prime Minister.

425
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,700
What do you plan on doing about what happened?

426
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,220
I would like to get rid of all evidence of treason and safely ride out the storm.

427
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,670
If I can prevent it by

428
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:53,410
even losing one of my limbs, that will become my mission.

429
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:58,250
And if I have to shed blood by fighting, that will be the contingency plan.

430
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,320
If the magistrates band together and fight against you,

431
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,320
it will be hard to go with the contingency plan.

432
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:11,220
You are more afraid of the small knife at your throat than a large blade far away.

433
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,300
I have the Capital Defense Force.

434
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:18,880
We have put them on standby in case of the worst scenario.

435
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,170
I don't wish to go with the contingency plan either.

436
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:28,540
So please testify on our behalf.

437
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:37,130
You will have to change your plan to reveal his treason.

438
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:40,280
It will be hard to get rid of El Temur over this incident anyway.

439
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,190
You must do as El Temur wishes and save yourself.

440
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:50,080
Eunuch Bang, go and tell Officer Bayan

441
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,790
- El Temur's plans.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

442
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:08,060
Your wound must be painful, but you're dealing with it quite well.

443
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,960
Just one word from me

444
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,750
and your despicable mask will be taken off.

445
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,590
But why did you not tell him?

446
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,100
Don't be mistaken. I haven't yet...

447
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,950
I haven't yet opened my mouth, that's all.

448
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,740
Then please go tell him.

449
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,830
That I saved Lady Ki by killing the imperial guards.

450
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,640
Do you still have

451
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,280
affection for Lady Ki?

452
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,210
Is that why you're helping that wench while putting your life in danger?

453
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,520
It's not affection but duty.

454
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,390
Duty?

455
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:50,910
What duty do you have left toward that wench?

456
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:53,740
You don't know.

457
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:57,480
When I was shot with an arrow by General Danqishi

458
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,320
and was near death, how Lady Ki, who was my subordinate, saved me.

459
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,760
Now...

460
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:12,170
I have paid back all of my debt to her, so she has nothing to do with me.

461
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:15,070
Do you expect me to believe that?

462
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,560
Whether you believe me or not,

463
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,860
I am just expressing my belief.

464
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:28,370
So... do as you believe.

465
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,680
You will need to help my father.

466
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:42,130
If not, when Lady Ki dies,

467
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,280
you will die along with her.

468
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:00,550
Hello, General.

469
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,890
Because you didn't get the job done properly,

470
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,890
Father is in grave danger.

471
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,840
I am very regretful about that.

472
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,320
If something unexpected happens,

473
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,620
you will need to resolve it.

474
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:21,080
What do you expect us to do?

475
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,950
This treason was

476
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,190
carried out by you two all on your own.

477
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,180
- Pardon?
- You want us to

478
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:34,010
- take all the blame?
- That's

479
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:38,090
the only way we can live and you can live, too.

480
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:42,150
It's not something else but high treason of trying to kill the emperor!

481
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:46,570
You can avoid the punishment for treason. I will help you.

482
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:51,410
Still, there won't be a way to avoid execution.

483
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:55,750
Don't worry. I will

484
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,330
let you escape in secret.

485
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,320
I will follow your order, General.

486
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,580
So...

487
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,280
please keep your promise that

488
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:15,090
you will save us, no matter what.

489
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,510
I promise.

490
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:27,700
Brother, the magistrates have arrived!

491
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:38,130
El Temur has mobilized the Capital Defence Force?

492
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,580
That's what I heard from Wang Yoo.

493
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,400
Dammit.

494
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,260
I think it would be best to see how it plays out first.

495
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,910
Why did you try to kill the emperor and Lady Ki?

496
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,290
With what proof are you saying that?

497
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:24,370
Lady Ki and the guards saw you clearly!

498
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,580
I will ask Lady Ki.

499
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,440
Who tried to kill the emperor?

500
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,650
The imperial guards.

501
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,390
The imperial guards?

502
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,630
We saw it, too.

503
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,750
The imperial guards tried to kill Lady Ki.

504
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:50,520
So, among those who tried to kill His Majesty, was I there?

505
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,260
If not, did you see my sons?

506
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,730
There were only the imperial guards.

507
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:06,630
Therefore, I've arrested the conspirators who committed this treason.

508
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:08,290
Bring them in.

509
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:29,880
Tell us what happened.

510
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,700
Everything...

511
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,470
was my, Yeom Byeong Soo's, plan.

512
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,470
You definitely received orders from Prime Minister. If not,

513
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:45,650
how could the captain of the Imperial Guard plan to commit such treason?

514
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,820
The person I was after

515
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,080
was not His Majesty but Lady Ki.

516
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:02,500
His Majesty...

517
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,110
got hurt because he was in the way.

518
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:11,200
Empress Dowager, we cannot believe this man.

519
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,650
Why did you try to kill Lady Ki?

520
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,900
Lady Ki has a grudge against me because I dragged her here as a tribute.

521
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,660
She tried to take revenge against me after she became a concubine, so I decided to kill her first.

522
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,600
Shut that mouth.

523
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,970
How dare you lie here?

524
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:30,430
Empress Dowager, he committed high treason.

525
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,820
How can you believe his cunning words?

526
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:37,070
We must shut his mouth immediately and thoroughly search for the truth.

527
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,870
Your words are correct.

528
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:42,160
You will have to prove that your words are the truth.

529
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,270
Yeom Byeong Soo and Lady Ki were both Wang Yoo's subordinates.

530
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:51,490
Wang Yoo can confirm the truth.

531
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:59,090
Please speak. Are Yeom Byeong Soo's words the truth?

532
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,760
His words are the truth,

533
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,080
not a bit of falsehood.

534
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:23,340
Drag them away.

535
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,650
Your Majesty...

536
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,320
Your Majesty, are you coming to your senses?

537
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,030
Yang...

538
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:04,910
Yang... where is Yang?

539
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,860
This incident has not been solved.

540
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,110
So let us not cause a disturbance

541
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:27,230
with any more baseless conspiracy theories.

542
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,390
We are not finished.

543
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:39,650
Since the emperor has become injured, Lady Ki and the guards who were with him

544
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:42,710
should be held responsible.

545
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,430
Isn't this something we didn't expect?

546
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:53,480
Empress Dowager, please order the arrest of Lady Ki as well as her servants and guards.

547
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,150
Shouldn't we follow the imperial law with rigor?

548
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,390
If you can't,

549
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:04,370
I will do it myself.

550
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:12,890
Arrest Lady Ki as well as her servants and guards.

551
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,880
You must hold back.

552
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:56,650
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

553
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:04,180
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

554
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,070
♫ Even if I were to ache ♫

555
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,410
♫ and it was our last moment ♫
