1
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,460
Why are you bringing that girl along?

2
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,380
Bring those guys here.

3
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,720
Do you know why you are being dragged away?

4
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,120
When I meet Prime Minister El Temür,

5
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,700
I plan to ask him why he is doing this to us.

6
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,170
Things have become quite awkward.

7
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,420
I am taking you on Prime Minister's command.

8
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,000
But if you meet with Prime Minister El Temür, things will become difficult for us.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,570
So...

10
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,540
Why are you doing this to me?

11
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,850
Must I die without even knowing the reason?

12
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,620
Yes, please die now.

13
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,230
Please let me live.

14
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,390
Then I will give you 50,000 nyang.

15
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,670
So, the price of your life is only 50,000 nyang?

16
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,930
100,000 nyang.

17
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,360
If you speak to our leader, he can even give you several hundred thousand nyang.

18
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,680
Several hundred thousand nyang, huh?

19
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,410
But if you just kill me now, you will incur a debt

20
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,070
that you can never repay.

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,740
What?

22
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,950
- Bring that girl here, too.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,690
Stop.

24
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,010
That girl is my captive.

25
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,920
And she saw everything that just happened here.

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,270
- What are you waiting for, haven't brought her yet?
- Yes, sir.

27
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,560
You better not, you bastards.

28
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,630
Didn't my boss tell you to stop?

29
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,150
If we let her live, she will become a source of trouble for sure.

30
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:02,210
Whether she is killed or not, her life depends on what I decide.

31
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,510
It's not up to you.

32
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,770
Fine. Do whatever you want. However,

33
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,910
if there are problems, you will have to take responsibility.

34
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,910
Your Majesty.

35
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,810
Why did you come here?

36
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,350
I came to collect the imperial seals.

37
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,400
Please leave now.

38
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,740
- You cannot bring the imperial prince to the Cold Palace.
- What do you mean?

39
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,900
Aren't you being confined for committing a crime?

40
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,600
Take the imperial prince.

41
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,220
Please give the imperial prince to me.

42
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,080
Back away.

43
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,340
No one can take my son. No one!

44
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,380
- Your Majesty.
- Kill me.

45
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,350
If you take my son, you will have to kill me.

46
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,890
Head Eunuch, hurry and take the imperial prince.

47
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,620
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

48
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,610
Baby. Baby!

49
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,820
- Baby!
- Your Majesty.

50
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,130
Call Father. Father. Father!

51
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,490
These evil people are taking my son away. My son!

52
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,090
Get a hold of yourself, Empress.

53
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,800
What is this terrible behavior? Have you gone mad?

54
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,660
For not having your hair cut at Gamoep Temple,

55
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,480
is this how you pay me back?

56
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,400
Empress, please stop thinking such nonsense.

57
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,540
I'm just protecting a young prince from his foolish mother.

58
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,990
How can I leave the prince, a descendant of this imperial family with a mother who tried to poison the concubines?

59
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,720
This is just punishment for your sins.

60
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,690
My son,

61
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,670
if you let a single hair on him get hurt,

62
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,150
even you can not avoid my wrath.

63
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,590
I am not foolish like you, Empress.

64
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,320
Please atone for your sins here in the Cold Palace

65
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,740
and become reborn, Empress.

66
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,170
Baby! Baby!

67
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,780
Maha! Baby!

68
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,420
Baby... Baby...

69
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,230
- Your Majesty.
- Maha, my baby!

70
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,630
Your Majesty.

71
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,740
You've lost your baby for a short while,

72
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,860
but I lost my baby forever.

73
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,450
Even if I want to see him,

74
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,050
even if I want to hold him, I cannot.

75
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,090
Could you ever know that pain?

76
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,330
Your pain

77
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,620
is nothing compared to mine.

78
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,010
I swear on the heavens that I did not do this.

79
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,120
- I know that.
- This is so unfair and I am so embittered

80
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,980
that it feels like my blood is flowing in the opposite direction and my guts have flipped upside down. Can you imagine how I feel?

81
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

82
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,290
Please catch the true culprit, Elder Brother.

83
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:50,510
- Heuksoo is being brought here from Liaoyang. Once he arrives—
- Lady Ki,

84
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,320
that witch is the culprit.

85
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,580
Do you have evidence?

86
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,380
I do not and, of course, that is driving me crazy.

87
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,660
But her gaze is telling me. Her gaze mocks me

88
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,190
and disrespects me.

89
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,890
My pathetic state right now,

90
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,100
make sure to see it clearly. When I return,

91
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,480
Ki and Empress Dowager, those two wenches,

92
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,820
I will kill them with my own hands.

93
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Elder Brother, look over there, please.

94
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,870
You all stay here.

95
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,800
Do you have some business with me?

96
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,190
Please dismiss your people for a moment.

97
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,020
Stay back.

98
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,550
That poisoned dates would be found in Empress's quarters,

99
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,620
I never imagined it in my dreams.

100
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,100
So I will acknowledge it.

101
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,360
This is your victory, Lady Ki. We lost this one.

102
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,390
Why...

103
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,660
do you conclude that I did this?

104
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,800
Until you came to the palace,

105
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,060
no one was ever this perfect.

106
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,070
You're speaking about things that I cannot understand.

107
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,160
I'm feeling ashamed to continue to hear this.

108
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,720
Lady Park...

109
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,870
Do you know why she died?

110
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,980
She didn't know her place and dared to become impregnated with the emperor's seed.

111
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,230
That is why I killed her mercilessly.

112
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,630
The sin of pretending to be noble when she was the lowliest of the low. And it is the same for you.

113
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,620
Having been dragged here as a tribute, you dare to challenge the empress?

114
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,190
Revenge? Do you think someone like you could ever go against us?

115
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,480
Don't be mistaken.

116
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,510
I haven't yet begun.

117
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,260
She was only banished to the Cold Palace. How can I call that revenge?

118
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,450
Just as I wept while clutching the bodies of my friends,

119
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,840
you too will clutch the bodies

120
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,130
of your father and your sister

121
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,700
and shed tears of blood.

122
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,970
That will be my final

123
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,790
revenge.

124
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,690
Your Majesty, this is the room where you will be staying.

125
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,370
Your Majesty!

126
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,400
Be careful, please.

127
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,210
It's even colder

128
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,970
than what I heard from rumors.

129
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,780
We cannot light a fire, wear warm clothes,

130
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,590
or eat delicious foods here, Your Majesty.

131
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,770
I will endure this.

132
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:33,570
I will endure it just for a little while and Father will rescue me.

133
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,130
Now that Her Majesty the Empress is gone, isn't it enjoyable?

134
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:47,740
Yes, now we can stretch both legs out and enjoy a good night's sleep.

135
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,890
Just remembering drinking tonic during those morning meetings. Oh, terrifying.

136
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,300
Her Highness the Empress Dowager enters!

137
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,960
There was much commotion in the inner court due to some disgraceful events.

138
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,600
So we will recover the discipline we'd lost

139
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,240
and return to our duties, taking law and principles seriously.

140
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,880
The elders will take care of those who are younger

141
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,780
and the younger ones will respect their elders.

142
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,710
And we will get along harmoniously.

143
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,780
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Your Highness.

144
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,410
"Jwa-jo-moon-do."

145
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,530
"Jwa" for sit. "Jo" for morning.

146
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,910
"Moon" for questioning. "Do" for road.

147
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,140
"Soo-gong-pyeong-jang."

148
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,690
"Soo" for hanging.

149
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,710
Empress Dowager is on her way. Please clean this up now.

150
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,310
I don't think we have to hide this from Empress Dowager anymore.

151
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,010
Ask her to enter.

152
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,020
You've come, Your Highness.

153
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,700
Is the emperor writing characters right now?

154
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,460
Yes, Your Highness.

155
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,430
His Majesty wrote these characters.

156
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:43,240
Then you chose Lady Ki every night because...

157
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,050
It was so I could learn to read and write.

158
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,630
Emperor, you can speak now?

159
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,260
Yes, Empress Dowager.

160
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,990
Thank you. Thank you, Emperor.

161
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,550
It's all thanks to Lady Ki.

162
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,540
You are the real fortune.

163
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,390
This palace has been blessed greatly.

164
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:19,430
I hope we can continue to hide from others that His Majesty can speak.

165
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,640
Why?

166
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,810
Prime Minister is planning my abdication.

167
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,690
Abdication?

168
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:35,780
Since the empress was sent to the Cold Palace, they will reveal their true nature soon.

169
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,270
Lady Ki?

170
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,400
Lady Ki was the one who planned this poisoning incident?

171
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,140
When Lady Park was killed, she was the sole survivor.

172
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,180
She has a grudge against us.

173
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,050
Isn't Lady Ki the one Bayan submitted for concubine selection?

174
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,300
That is why you cannot trust Bayan either.

175
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,450
He will betray us someday.

176
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,090
Bayan will betray us?

177
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,240
Reporting to the Prime Minister. General Toqto'a has arrived.

178
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,780
- Ask him in.
- Yes, Sir.

179
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,140
You've come? Where is Heuksoo?

180
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,780
He bit his tongue and committed suicide on our way here.

181
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,490
Suicide?

182
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,310
Please forgive me. It was due to my negligence.

183
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,360
I know it now, so you can go.

184
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,360
Father, we cannot leave Bayan like this.

185
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,680
The abdication will be announced soon, then we will know

186
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,180
if he's a traitor or a loyal dog.

187
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,490
What did El Temür say?

188
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:13,360
I think you will need to watch your actions from now on.

189
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,320
Does he suspect us?

190
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,570
His gaze was definitely different from before.

191
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,260
This old serpent.

192
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,050
I didn't think we could fool him for too long, anyway.

193
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,370
But where is Wang Yoo right now?

194
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,870
Your Majesty, the Imperial Palace is nearby.

195
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,860
Why won't you meet with Seung Nyang?

196
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,000
It's all my fault.

197
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,790
Meeting her and making her unhealed wound hurt more,

198
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,490
that is what I am afraid of.

199
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,720
How can you only think about her?

200
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,310
Your Majesty, you probably felt more pain than she did.

201
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,250
You definitely did not hurt any less.

202
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,490
Eunuch Bang just left for the palace.

203
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,400
Without my permission?

204
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,760
I'm sorry. We cannot stand to see you in pain any longer.

205
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,830
Your Highness, Eunuch Bang is outside.

206
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,130
If you don't want to see him, I will send him away.

207
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,730
Please enter.

208
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:57,040
His Majesty requests to meet you.

209
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,150
Meet him? Where?

210
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,040
Since you cannot leave the palace, Your Highness,

211
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,340
- somewhere you won't be seen—
- Should a eunuch who serves a king ever speak of such a thing?

212
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:18,440
The person you are looking at is the emperor's concubine.

213
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,650
How can I meet a strange man in secret?

214
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,690
Strange... man, you say?

215
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,700
Go tell him this.

216
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,940
If he wants to meet me, he must request it from the emperor at the Imperial Palace.

217
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,790
There will never be a meeting between just us two.

218
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,580
Yes, I will relay that message.

219
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,040
Eunuch Bang.

220
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,380
Don't feel too hurt, please.

221
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,870
Give my thanks to Lady Ki.

222
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,000
Huh?

223
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,870
More than the person trying to relay affection,

224
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,340
the person trying to cut off affection feels more pain, you see.

225
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,820
Since Her Highness did this for him,

226
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,000
His Majesty will feel a little bit better.

227
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,200
I will be going now.

228
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,590
She called me a strange man?

229
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

230
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,840
If you want to see her, you must request an audience with the emperor.

231
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,430
She was so cold-hearted and indifferent.

232
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:01,130
Look at that. They say the position makes the person. She is not the Seung Nyang of the past.

233
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,450
I think you can finally forget about her, Your Majesty.

234
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,790
You fellows still do not know Seung Nyang.

235
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,130
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

236
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,590
Send this message to the Imperial Palace,

237
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,740
that I will meet with the emperor.

238
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,150
What? Wang Yoo has returned?

239
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,010
We received a message that he requests to meet with you.

240
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,630
Why are you looking at me?

241
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,220
Are you afraid to meet Wang Yoo?

242
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,490
Tell him I will permit it.

243
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,050
Yes?

244
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

245
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,360
You belong to me now. Why would I fear him?

246
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,150
Let me accompany you when you meet him.

247
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,160
Why would you come?

248
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,010
You must not speak yet.

249
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,860
Have you forgotten?

250
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,540
Your Majesty, have you been well?

251
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,620
His Majesty cannot speak.

252
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,480
I heard about it from the eunuch outside.

253
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,230
May I request a favor from you, Your Majesty?

254
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:26,600
May I meet with Wang Yoo privately?

255
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:34,440
If you don't want that, I won't meet with him.

256
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,060
However, if you trust me,

257
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,300
please grant my request.

258
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,930
I am grateful for your grace, Your Majesty.

259
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,070
You seem well.

260
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,050
Thank you, Wang Yoo.

261
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,320
Do you... resent me?

262
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,420
That could only be true if I had any feelings left for you.

263
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,360
In my heart,

264
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,070
Seung Nyang has already died.

265
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,000
Don't remember me, please.

266
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,370
Even being a part of your memories

267
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,620
is not something I want.

268
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:17,980
Indeed, you are not a memory I want to recall.

269
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,990
It's just a past I want to erase.

270
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,440
It is now meaningless to me.

271
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,240
A day like today,

272
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,670
I wish that it won't ever happen again.

273
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,050
I am sorry.

274
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,040
I am sorry.

275
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,410
There is no need for your apology.

276
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,860
Because I abandoned you, too, Your Highness.

277
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,770
Anyone who would resent you

278
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:18,670
or hate you,

279
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,850
there is no such person in this world including myself.

280
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,040
So don't be sorry

281
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,850
and don't shed any tears.

282
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,400
Please walk your path proudly.

283
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,500
I will do the same.

284
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,160
I won't look back, I won't feel hurt,

285
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,550
and I won't regret. That is how I will walk my path.

286
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,680
Please forget me

287
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,560
and become happy.

288
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,780
It is my selfish request to you

289
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,420
so that I can be at ease.

290
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:36,200
The last shameless request I make to you.

291
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,490
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

292
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,880
Your Majesty...

293
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:56,810
♫  Drip Drip Drip, in the sound of the rain for a long time after  ♫

294
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:06,710
♫ Even if I wander and am lost, it is you, it is you again ♫

295
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:14,940
♫ This heart which is sending you away day by day ♫

296
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:26,130
♫ feels like it's burning in hell ♫

297
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,370
Prime Minister, what brings you here?

298
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,600
Let His Majesty know that Prime Minister has arrived.

299
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,990
Your Majesty, Prime Minister has come—

300
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,080
Your Majesty...

301
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,450
Already drinking during the day?

302
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,690
Since the empress has gone to the Cold Palace,

303
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,440
of course, it would be regrettable if you were doing well.

304
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:30,040
There is a place I will take you. Please follow me.

305
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,710
What are you doing?

306
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,270
Escort him.

307
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,120
Where are you taking His Majesty?

308
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,980
Out of my way!

309
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,490
You cannot leave here without killing us.

310
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,780
So just follow me, then.

311
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,710
Your Majesty... Your Majesty...

312
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:50,460
I wish to give up my full authority as the emperor.

313
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,740
Crown Prince Maha will succeed the throne,

314
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,810
and until he is of the age to conduct state affairs,

315
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,120
I hereby name the empress as his regent.

316
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,830
Abdication...

317
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,010
Put your seal there.

318
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,380
I know you're mute, but are you deaf, too?

319
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,790
Put your seal on it!

320
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:41,230
I told you once before about abdication.

321
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:47,350
Does anyone else know about this?

322
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:57,010
But then again, you can't even talk, and you can't read or write.

323
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,830
Your Majesty, the magistrates are acting out of line these days.

324
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,400
They might come asking to see you,

325
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,110
but you must never meet with them. Do you understand?

326
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,570
Your Majesty.

327
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,350
Your Majesty.

328
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,770
Prime Minister

329
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,360
falsified a Proclamation of Abdication.

330
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,820
And? Did you put your seal on it?

331
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,100
Did you?

332
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,200
Yes.

333
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,180
Your Highness.

334
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,790
Abdication?

335
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:27,360
He's still alive and well. What does he mean an abdication?

336
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,020
The magistrates are the only people who can prevent this.

337
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,280
How about meeting with them, Your Highness?

338
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,340
If she does, it will put His Majesty in grave danger.

339
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,300
Then, what do you think we should do?

340
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,970
Are you saying we should give up full authority to El Temür?

341
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:46,560
We need to figure out what the magistrates are thinking.

342
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,690
How can we do that?

343
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:53,610
Magistrate Bayan will know of a way.

344
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,390
If you declare that you don't wish to abdicate

345
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,520
and if the magistrates unanimously agree,

346
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,620
we can prevent the abdication.

347
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,640
But each province has a very complex relationship with El Temür.

348
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,180
Also, it's a matter of power,

349
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,910
so it's impossible to win them all over.

350
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,620
We must get it done even if it's difficult.

351
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:20,650
I will help His Majesty, so please meet with the magistrates.

352
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,870
If El Temür finds out,

353
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:27,510
not only us, but you and the emperor could be put in danger.

354
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,170
What can we do when that's the only way?

355
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,890
If I bring the magistrates in,

356
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,050
do you have a way to convince them?

357
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,130
Do you know what this is?

358
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:50,250
It's a signed promise that the emperor will abdicate his throne.

359
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,400
Do you mean a Proclamation of Abdication?

360
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,980
That's right! Proclamation of Abdication!

361
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,170
Once he abdicates at the Kurultai meeting,
(T/N: Kurultai - political and military council in Ancient Mongolia)

362
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,550
my grandson will become the emperor!

363
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:12,690
I heard you need unanimous consent of the magistrates in order for the imperial prince to ascend the throne.

364
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,970
I can just get their consent beforehand!

365
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,690
I have a way to keep all the magistrates' hands tied.

366
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,100
Have you heard about Seung Nyang?

367
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,530
I thought she was dead, but she reappeared as an imperial concubine.

368
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,300
I met with her.

369
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:50,120
How was she? Did she greet you as her master like she used to do?

370
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,080
She has changed a lot.

371
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,380
The look in her eyes, the way she speaks, her thoughts...

372
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,060
She wasn't the Seung Nyang I knew.

373
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,860
I guess it's true what they say. When a woman gets a taste of power, they're worse than men.

374
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,780
After being dragged here as a tribute girl, she's now being addressed as "Your Highness."

375
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,850
Who could stop her from wanting that status and authority?

376
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,300
I guess you were very disappointed.

377
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,070
Just forget about that useless girl.

378
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,610
I can't believe this is happening.

379
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,510
I get to eat my fill every day and sleep.

380
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,570
Where's Wang Yoo?

381
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,620
Why do you ask?

382
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,840
Are you going to tell him about the secret ledger?

383
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:54,030
If not, don't look for him. He has a lot to think about right now.

384
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,590
Is something going on?

385
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,720
That is, His Majesty...

386
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,690
No, you don't need to know.

387
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,050
I'll meet with Wang Yoo.

388
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,500
Huh?

389
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,960
Why did you ask for me?

390
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,270
I can decipher the code in the ledger.

391
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,920
But only under two conditions.

392
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,560
Are you asking me to free you?

393
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,640
No.

394
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,950
I'm asking you to kill me.

395
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:33,070
Even if you let me go, I won't be able to get away from the clutches of Hawk House.

396
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:39,790
Heuksoo has died, too, so they will sell me off as a slave.

397
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:48,610
The other condition is... to bury my bones in the Turk Desert.

398
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,180
Don't decipher these codes.

399
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,520
I won't kill you

400
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,140
and I will not let you be sold off as a slave.

401
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:13,740
Are you saying... you'll protect me?

402
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,630
I tried to kill you.

403
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,700
Why? Why are you doing this for me?

404
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,990
Anyone out there?

405
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

406
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,500
Give her some food.

407
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,290
I told you... to kill me instead!

408
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,950
[Baeksumun - the Thousand-Character Classic]

409
00:39:53,950 --> 00:40:00,400
This code was used by the Eastern Xia Kingdom to represent numbers.
(T/N: Eastern Xia Kingdom was in Liaoyang Province)

410
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,940
Write out the 1,000 characters from the Baeksumun on one sheet and

411
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:13,000
then write out 100 characters horizontally and 10 characters vertically.

412
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:30,610
[天 = sky, 地 = earth]

413
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,840
If you combine the two numbers in this secret ledger

414
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,470
and count horizontally

415
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,720
and vertically, you'll get a character.

416
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,280
If you write down those characters in order,

417
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,500
you'll find out what's contained in this book.

418
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:41,460
How long will it take to decipher the entire book?

419
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,300
It should take several days.

420
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,560
Decipher it.

421
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,560
Your Majesty, the food is here.

422
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,200
You must be hungry. Please eat.

423
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,040
Your Majesty.

424
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,170
I'm so sick of eating dumplings! How am I supposed to eat this?

425
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,110
You'll die if you don't. At least to ward off the cold—

426
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,870
Never mind. I told you I don't want it!

427
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,600
Your Majesty!

428
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,460
Your Majesty...

429
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,580
Your Majesty.

430
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:19,130
Even if you're cold and sad, you must be strong.

431
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,670
If you become weak, you'll lose.

432
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,970
I can deal with being cold and hungry.

433
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:31,250
But... my baby... I miss my son.

434
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,180
I can't bear not seeing him.

435
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:40,580
Truthfully, Your Majesty, that baby is...

436
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,180
Truthfully what?

437
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,350
I'm sure you miss him.

438
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:55,980
Even for the sake of seeing him again, you must stay strong.

439
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,260
What's my father doing that he doesn't even come to see me?

440
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,170
He seems to be tied up with the abdication matter.

441
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:09,520
Who cares about the abdication when I'm dying!

442
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:24,850
Bayan. He is on our side; the most certain to oppose your abdication.

443
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,350
Oh Gwang.

444
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,930
Seol Do Gwan.

445
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,080
Bu Sa Gwi.

446
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,410
Jeop Gong.

447
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:44,340
- They're the fathers of Imperial Concubines.
- Since their daughters are Imperial Concubines,

448
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,670
they will certainly oppose the abdication.

449
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:49,410
The problem is the rest of the magistrates.

450
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,600
We have very valuable information.

451
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,350
According to Toqto'a,

452
00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:01,060
Oh Gwang is like a brother to Gansu and Henan Province's magistrates.

453
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,910
Bu Sa Gwi is very close to the magistrates of Jiangzhe and Jiangxi Provinces,

454
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:10,410
and Seol Do Gwan is close to the magistrates of Shaanxi and Huguang Provinces.

455
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,860
Then that means if we win over the (four) fathers of the imperial concubines...

456
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:18,680
We will have the support of all ten magistrates.

457
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,020
We have no time. You need to meet with them in secret right away.

458
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:30,890
Rather than that, how about you invite the magistrates to a banquet tonight?

459
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,950
Prime Minister doesn't know that I can speak.

460
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:42,140
If you take charge, it will be less dangerous than if I was to meet them in secret.

461
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,140
Have them invited to gather at the Great Hall at the sul-si hour. (7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.)

462
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,640
Yes, Your Highness.

463
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,020
Invite the magistrates to the house tonight.

464
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,910
There's a banquet tonight given by Empress Dowager.

465
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,300
That's why I'm saying it.

466
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:08,310
If it's a banquet for the imperial concubines, the emperor will be there. What good would it do for him to meet with the magistrates?

467
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:12,290
The magistrates won't turn down an invitation from Empress Dowager.

468
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:17,020
I am calling them. Why would they care about her?

469
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:25,990
You mean it's not Empress Dowager but the emperor who wants to see us?

470
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,310
He has something he wants to discuss with you.

471
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:32,350
Tell us what it could be about.

472
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:38,070
To be honest, the prime minister is planning an abdication.

473
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:43,190
- What?
- You must never speak of it.

474
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,290
Of course.

475
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:49,730
But you've all been invited by the prime minister. Will you be all right?

476
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,510
Who cares about that?

477
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:56,940
Ever since our daughters became imperial concubines, we haven't met with the emperor properly once.

478
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,440
And an abdication? Then our daughters will become nothing!

479
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,420
We can't allow that to happen.

480
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,690
- Do you think you can bring the other magistrates along?
- That's not hard.

481
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:14,710
Don't forget. Come to the Great Hall at sul-si.

482
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,020
We understand.

483
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,360
Not even one yet? Did you tell them the correct time?

484
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,080
Just wait a little longer.

485
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:32,240
Did you memorize what you're going to say to the magistrates?

486
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,860
I memorized every word.

487
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:39,810
Don't forget that you're the emperor and they're your vassals.

488
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:45,700
You have to be strong and determined but also need to show warmth which El Temür lacks.

489
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:52,390
Show them once and for all who the true ruler of this kingdom is.

490
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:55,020
Don't worry.

491
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:01,380
My grandfather's grandfather and his grandfather's grandfather was the Great Genghis Khan.

492
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:09,180
Your Majesty, it's time to head over to the Great Hall.

493
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:23,610
His Imperial Majesty enters!

494
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,350
Your Majesty...

495
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,820
What happened?

496
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,680
Why is there not even one magistrate here?

497
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,580
I'm asking you! Where is everyone?

498
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:07,740
They went to the prime minister's house.

499
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:17,660
Prime Minister, we wish you great health.

500
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:22,050
We wish you great health and long life, Prime Minister.

501
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:36,800
Before we get drunk, we need to talk about the matter at hand.

502
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,470
Do you all agree to His Majesty's abdication and the crown prince's ascension to the throne?

503
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:49,040
Before that, I think Prime Minister needs to keep his promise first.

504
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,960
Of course, I will!

505
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,360
[Individual Magistrate's Letter of Promise]

506
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,730
What did you hand out to them?

507
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:29,130
Someone tell us what's written on this document.

508
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:33,310
Once the abdication happens and the crown prince ascends to the throne,

509
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:37,170
each magistrate's debt to the prime minister

510
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:42,000
will all be erased.

511
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:49,640
That's right. Do you like the condition?

512
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:55,330
- We are much obliged, Prime Minister.
- We are much obliged, Prime Minister.

513
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,180
Once we have a new emperor, there will be stability in this country.

514
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:04,120
If I combined all the debt that you all owed, it's an unimaginable amount of money.

515
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:09,610
So instead, I have brought a reign of peace that will obliterate that huge sum!

516
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:16,580
Let's fill our glasses for a new world!

517
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:46,490
- Are you disappointed?
- It's all over now.

518
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:50,250
I've been cast aside by even my vassals.

519
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,990
I have nothing to say even if I get dethroned.

520
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:59,560
The people we need to fight are strong and immense.

521
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:06,150
But do you know why I'm facing them?

522
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,780
It's because I have faith in you.

523
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,040
You must not show any tears over a small defeat.

524
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,290
Even if it's for the sake of me, just one subject

525
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,200
who has faith in you,

526
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:42,880
you must never be discouraged.

527
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:35,890
El Temür's funds are beyond our imagination.

528
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:39,880
I think he's deeply involved with the Hawk House. If not, how could such an amount—

529
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,500
Your Majesty!

530
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:50,950
Yeon Bisoo has finished deciphering the code.

531
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:03,710
This is... not the transaction ledger of Hawk House.

532
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:08,950
- What?
- What is this then?

533
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:15,100
Yunnan Province: Yon Gak, Joo Haeng Ryeong, Song Chi Woo...

534
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,330
Henan Province: Seo Jae Gook, Jang Won Soo...

535
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:24,010
Yeon Bisoo has no idea what this is either.

536
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:26,080
Your Majesty.

537
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:35,530
Lingbei Province: Wang Si Pal, Joo Hae Seok; Nation of Goryeo: Kim Ja Chi...

538
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:38,730
Hold on. Did you say Kim Ja Chi of Goryeo?

539
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:43,350
Wait! Kim Ja Chi is...

540
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,000
Kim Ja Chi who was in charge of trade and commerce

541
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,900
was in on it with the Yuan envoys.

542
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:58,730
He was the one depleting Goryeo's state coffers working with Hawk House.

543
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:04,330
- So this ledger...
- It is a list of names of those who are working with Hawk House from each province.

544
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:12,060
So this was the reason that each magistrate is incurring huge debts with El Temür.

545
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:17,590
I will use this to block the abdication.

546
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,590
So you will help the emperor?

547
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:26,430
If you help the emperor, aren't you helping Seung Nyan— Ouch!

548
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,800
You startled me.

549
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:37,450
- Summon Toqto'a.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

550
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,450
His Imperial Majesty must do this properly.

551
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:03,540
I'm sure he will do well since Her Highness has been educating him.

552
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:10,990
But where did you find that precious ledger?

553
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:19,100
You must never say that you got it from me.

554
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:25,330
The person who gave it to us requested to keep their identity a secret.

555
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:40,320
Prime Minister has changed the emperor three times.

556
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:46,420
Now, he is working to change the fourth.

557
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:50,180
But he picked the wrong person this time.
