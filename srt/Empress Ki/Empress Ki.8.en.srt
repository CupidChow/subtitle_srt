1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,310
The emperor is here!

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,100
Untie her.

3
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,070
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,010
We were training the new servant.

5
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,660
Don't make too much noise.

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,270
Good night, Eunuch Bang.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,450
It's the servants.

8
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,860
He's gone.

9
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,250
Now, where were we?

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,200
Undress her.

11
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,030
Don't get closer.

12
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,490
I almost died countless times getting here.

13
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,730
Even the grim reaper can't touch me.

14
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,690
Don't bother me anymore.

15
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,870
I don't want to have to take care of those who are suffering alongside me.

16
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,540
I'm Hong Dan.

17
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,950
I came from Goryeo like you. Euijoo.

18
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,480
You were amazing yesterday.

19
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,120
It made me feel relieved!

20
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,480
Yeon Hwa, that girl...

21
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,490
By chance... have you ever seen the emperor?

22
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,270
Of course. I've even served him personally.

23
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,480
Can you tell me everything... you know about him?

24
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,700
Huh?

25
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,310
Whatever it is.

26
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,070
He's amazingly... hard-working.

27
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,060
Hard-working?

28
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,830
Very much so.

29
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,320
He wakes up before the rooster and takes a bath.

30
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,400
And he starts off the day by lighting incense in the library.

31
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,940
It's nearly midday! Please wake up, Your Highness!

32
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,980
After breakfast,

33
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,270
he pores over the appeals from all over the country.

34
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,540
He's so meticulous,

35
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,390
he looks at countless numbers of appeals and handles them.

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,710
And around the 17th period of the day, he studies martial arts.

37
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,370
M-Martial arts?

38
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,020
Try hitting me. Try!

39
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,520
Not only sword fighting, but he has also mastered spear fighting, stick fighting, and archery.

40
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,630
Where is he at night?

41
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,500
What do you mean? He studies reading and writing in the library.

42
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,780
He's so well-read,

43
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,430
he can read official documents that are known to be difficult effortlessly.

44
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,420
That's enough. Thanks.

45
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,630
Oh right. He's even been getting educated for his wedding night ahead of the ceremony.

46
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,650
Wedding Ceremony?

47
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,180
He's going to get married soon.

48
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,260
Are we going to be attending him, too?

49
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,940
Not all, but I'm sure one or two from each room will be called.

50
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,400
They're supposed to pick some extra servants.

51
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,110
Servants?

52
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,440
Hey! Wash mine, too.

53
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,320
Give them to me.

54
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,090
No. I'd better do them myself.

55
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,000
You said you're Yeon Hwa, right?

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,070
Talk with me for a second.

57
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,160
Sure.

58
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,800
You want to take part in the ceremony?

59
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,300
You want to get noticed by the emperor, too?

60
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,220
But then again, what wench doesn't want to change their destiny?

61
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,310
If we're lucky, we could even become royal concubines overnight.

62
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,560
But keep dreaming.

63
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,420
Who would pick you?

64
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,340
Can you do it for me?

65
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,990
I'll recommend you.

66
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,640
But you're new, so I don't know if the court lady will allow--

67
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,840
Do whatever you can to get me chosen.

68
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,690
Yes.

69
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,530
Thank you.

70
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,150
That girl...

71
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,790
Over there, pour it into the cauldron.

72
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,690
Hey, you!

73
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,460
Go fetch more water.

74
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,090
Yes.

75
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,430
For your sake, I will come back alive no matter what.

76
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,870
And you must stay alive for my sake!

77
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,340
I command you, Seung Nyang! Do you understand?

78
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,800
Please forgive me.

79
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,060
It seems like I will have to disobey your command, Your Majesty.

80
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,970
Get rid of the deposed king.

81
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,390
His father was restored to the throne as the King of Goryeo.

82
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,530
There could be trouble in respect to rank,

83
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,920
so I'm telling you to get rid of him without anyone knowing.

84
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,640
You guys poop but want me to clean up?

85
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,390
Father thinks he volunteered... on his own to come here.

86
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,100
No harm will come to you.

87
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,980
Damn it.

88
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,100
I have enough to worry about, so why should I add more burden to myself?

89
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,040
Don't push me!

90
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,350
Who's Baek Ho Jang?

91
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,560
They're new, so give them room.

92
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,640
Who's the king?

93
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,140
This is him. How do you know him?

94
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,890
We're from Goryeo.

95
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,720
We heard the Yuan soldiers talking.

96
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,460
Get up.

97
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,820
How many of you are there here?

98
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,760
At least half of the laborers.

99
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,100
How did you get dragged here?

100
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,920
At first, we were temporarily transferred as a unit for subjugation.

101
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,600
But once we ran out of weapons and food due to repeated defeats,

102
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,070
we were reduced to hard labor.

103
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,940
We're getting treated no better than animals.

104
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,760
One of us died today again by getting caught while escaping.

105
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,920
What?

106
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,230
Please help us, Your Majesty.

107
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,860
That's Deputy Commander Yeom's signal to gather.

108
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,540
He won't give you food if you're late, so please come outside.

109
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,960
Please lower yourselves.

110
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,470
Your Majesty!

111
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,780
Please.

112
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,910
Your Majesty.

113
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,790
Your Majesty.

114
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,260
Did you see? It's very easy to tame them.

115
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,640
It's quite a sight to see a deposed king bow down to us.

116
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,710
Yeom Byeong Soo.

117
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,250
You're now in charge of these people.

118
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,400
I will do my best, Sir.

119
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,080
I have to destroy the Turks

120
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,710
and obtain this Silk Road.

121
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:23,810
In order to do that, the most pressing matter is to build a strong army with these rotten troops.

122
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,520
So don't distract the soldiers.

123
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,940
If anyone gets in the way of military discipline, I will cut off his head no matter who it is.

124
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,220
Tell me what I can do to survive and get out of this place.

125
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,230
Do you want to leave here alive?

126
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,340
You're dreaming.

127
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,820
Then kill all the Turks, even in your dreams.

128
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,690
The only way to leave here

129
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,810
is for you and me to achieve success.

130
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,670
Tomorrow, you will become the empress.

131
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,170
Are you done getting ready?

132
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,070
What is there to get ready for?

133
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,450
The servants will take care of the wedding.

134
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,990
Put this on.

135
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,740
This is the scent that makes men weak-kneed.

136
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,320
The best quality musk.

137
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,390
I don't need this to make him weak-kneed, so don't worry, Brother.

138
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,920
You must get pregnant on the first night.

139
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,010
There is no happier occasion than pregnancy inside the palace.

140
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,140
Oh... Father.

141
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,640
I'll take care of it.

142
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,550
That night, a special liquor made from Persian silk tree flowers will be served.

143
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,600
Make him drink just three cups.

144
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,560
Then his breathing will get faster elevating his temperature and causing excitement.

145
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,730
Then if you make him smell this scent I'm giving you—

146
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,490
Brother, I said I will take care of it.

147
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,570
I'm not worried about you but that he might be as still as a rock.

148
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,310
Even so, I don't need such things.

149
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,350
He has eyes, so I'm sure he recognizes beauty.

150
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,090
Your eyes will not see if your heart doesn't feel.

151
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,250
If the eyes see, the body will follow

152
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,630
and that's how you will come to share the bed.

153
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,650
But... I have no feelings for her.

154
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,580
You're healthy, so why aren't you moved?

155
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,870
I keep seeing the prime minister's face on top of hers. What do you want me to do?

156
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,620
My Lord, please do as I say and don't think about such things.

157
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,370
First,

158
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,780
purse your lips.

159
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,160
P-P-Purse your lips.

160
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,040
Yes. And then from a normal position let—

161
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,110
Disgusting! Get those away!

162
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,250
How dare you act knowledgable when you're a eunuch?

163
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,580
Do you think I was born without anything? When I was young, I also—

164
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:17,080
But, My Lord, have you not been attracted to anyone before?

165
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,180
Attracted?

166
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,820
Yes, My Lord. Think about that time well.

167
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,670
That was when...

168
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,950
I was exiled to Goryeo.

169
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,180
That's a relief!

170
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,890
Think about her on your first night.

171
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,050
But that person was...

172
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,230
a man.

173
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,610
Man? A man!

174
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,120
When I think about him even now, my heart beats fast

175
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,160
and I get flushed, so I don't know what's going on.

176
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,350
Oh my goodness. How could this happen?

177
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,540
Head Eunuch.

178
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,100
Why did you choose her to be a servant?

179
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,180
I just followed the rules.

180
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,230
Rules?

181
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,780
My sister is going to become the empress.

182
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,370
Do you not know what that means?

183
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,770
Since you've picked her as a servant, work her to death.

184
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,600
So much so that she will ask to see me.

185
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,750
Understand?

186
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,300
The empress will stand about here,

187
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,310
and His Majesty will greet her from here.

188
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:24,350
Everything will happen right here. Understand?

189
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:32,790
About 30 steps from here to where the emperor will meet the empress.

190
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:44,010
26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

191
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,320
I can't stab his heart from 30 steps away.

192
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,060
And I have to get it done in one move.

193
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,820
Poison. Snake poison.

194
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,850
It's a day of celebration.

195
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,390
Please look happy.

196
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,950
Your Majesty!

197
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,180
His Majesty will say you look beautiful.

198
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,250
That won't be enough.

199
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,010
He needs to go completely blind from the sight of me.

200
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,170
The sedan chair is waiting outside. Please get on.

201
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,880
All right.

202
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,650
This is the scent that makes men weak-kneed. The best quality musk.

203
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:29,020
His Imperial Majesty!

204
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,760
Her Imperial Majesty!

205
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,030
Come this way.

206
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,950
Come.

207
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,070
A little... A little more.

208
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,870
How is life as a palace maid?

209
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:43,170
It's not too late. If you come to me now,

210
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,890
you can take off that servant outfit and enjoy wealth and honor.

211
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,410
Long live Her Imperial Majesty! All Hail!

212
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,420
Long live his Imperial Majesty! All Hail!

213
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,540
Hail! Hail!

214
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:27,380
Hail! Hail!

215
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,620
Hail! Hail!

216
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,810
Hail!

217
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,570
Hail!

218
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,090
Hail!

219
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,270
Hail!

220
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,180
I thought I was going to die. My legs hurt so much.

221
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,500
Do you want me to massage them?

222
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,150
No. It's fine. I need to go to the palace.

223
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,180
Why?

224
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,690
What do you mean why? I'm going to go decorate the emperor's marriage suite.

225
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:07,520
He's spending his first night here?

226
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,650
You're working there tonight?

227
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:16,120
The servants can't go. It's for court ladies only.

228
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,810
I'll be going.

229
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,010
All right, farewell.

230
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,230
Are you crazy?

231
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,720
You can't have a knife in here.

232
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,570
Yeon Hwa didn't see, did she?

233
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:44,800
I don't think so, but why do you have a knife?

234
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,980
Please ignore it. Thank you, Hong Dan.

235
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,990
Tonight will be your last.

236
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,850
Get up!

237
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,360
When are you going to finish at this rate?! Hurry up!

238
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,160
Come on!

239
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,950
Stop trying to fake it, eunuch bastard.

240
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,750
Move it!

241
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,560
That damn bastard Yeom Byeong Soo.

242
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,220
I'll chew him up one day!

243
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,440
How long do you think the deposed king will last?

244
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,460
Make them work night and day.

245
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,360
Yes, Uncle.

246
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,160
Those men who are with the deposed king, how about we send them elsewhere?

247
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,020
That would be better for getting rid of the deposed—

248
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,440
Have you heard from our spies who were sent to the Turks?

249
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,270
I haven't heard back yet.

250
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,830
Hey! Are you ignoring my words?

251
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,990
I'm not interested in some deposed king's life.

252
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,790
What?

253
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,920
I only care about getting rid of the Turks.

254
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,790
Anyone who interferes, I won't allow it, even if it's you.

255
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,640
Let's see how great you are.

256
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:38,400
He'll soon be the emperor's brother-in-law. It would be best not to upset him.

257
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,960
Give your advice to him instead. That it would be best not to upset me right now.

258
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,820
Hurry up!

259
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,760
If you pass out, you're dead. Move it!

260
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:57,310
Please rest. I'll do it.

261
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:01,070
I'm fine. Don't worry.

262
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,290
We'll have to work through the night.

263
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,490
Isn't this too much? We can't even sleep.

264
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,260
Sleep or whatever, I'm starving.

265
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,310
It's time to eat!

266
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,300
If you're late, you'll starve!

267
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,990
Line up!

268
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,950
Bastards.

269
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:58,200
They want us to survive with just one of these a day?

270
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,520
Have this one, too.

271
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,240
I'm good.

272
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,610
Have mine, Your Majesty. My stomach is small.

273
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,990
Eat up.

274
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,250
You're not going to eat it?

275
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,520
Thank you!

276
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,760
This punk!

277
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,560
This thing...

278
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,190
Come here and eat with us.

279
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,360
Let's go.

280
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,110
Filthy... Come here and do that again!

281
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,980
They're disappointed in me.

282
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,340
Why would they be?

283
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:44,860
They must have thought their situation would get better now that His Majesty was here.

284
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:50,200
Ignore them. Right now, your well-being is the most important.

285
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,890
Something's strange.

286
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,810
I heard the clashing sound of weapons in the woods.

287
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,850
Get them!

288
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,400
Get them!

289
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,900
I'll get back up. You stay here!

290
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,390
That Yeom Byeong Soo bastard!

291
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,410
Don't leave anyone alive!

292
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,020
Get them all!

293
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,240
Our people are dying.

294
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,150
They're dying in front of my eyes!

295
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,360
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty, you must get away from here!

296
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,530
We need to take their weapons.

297
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,550
Hurry!

298
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,740
Your Majesty!

299
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,830
Come on!

300
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,270
Whoever has weapons, come to the front

301
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,880
and block them!

302
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,180
How many Yuan soldiers are dead?

303
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,290
Twelve.

304
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,290
And the rest?

305
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:55,150
We'll have to count, but at least 100.

306
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,570
Stop!

307
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,920
You killed them. You killed them!

308
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,730
Your Majesty!

309
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,340
Stop!

310
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,900
Bring him to my quarters.

311
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:16,100
Even if they're foreigners, you should have given them weapons.

312
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,150
If you didn't have enough weapons, the Yuan soldiers should have protected them!

313
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,150
Your carelessness killed innocent people!

314
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,190
Do you think they're being discriminated against because they're foreigners?

315
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,810
You should know.

316
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:35,480
No. Even if they had weapons, it would have been the same.

317
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,980
Since they think this war is between Yuan and Turks,

318
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:44,380
the foreigners are the ones discriminating, not me.

319
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,640
A war without purpose is bound to be lost.

320
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,780
I cannot give any weapons to an undisciplined mob who only care about their own lives.

321
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:57,060
Whether they die today or tomorrow, in the end, they will die.

322
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:03,830
That undisciplined mob you speak of, I'll make into strong fighters.

323
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,600
Give me the ability to command.

324
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,200
Shut up!

325
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,630
I'm their commander!

326
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,950
You can't give the power to command to him!

327
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,450
You left the men and ran away!

328
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,340
I didn't run away but went to get reinforcements!

329
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,450
Stop running your wicked mouth.

330
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,870
You can't give him an opportunity to distinguish himself.

331
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,910
He could lose his head for any loss incurred.

332
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,020
So how about we let him?

333
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,210
Whatever the case,

334
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:48,060
Yeom Byeong Soo should be the commander!

335
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,790
I'll hand over the power to command to the one

336
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,380
who wins the fight against each other.

337
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,000
How about it? Will you follow my suggestion?

338
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,050
I'll do that.

339
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,980
How about you?

340
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,290
While this guy was living it up in the palace,

341
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,460
I was busy getting callouses from wielding this sword.

342
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,980
Why would I object?

343
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,740
21st period of day!
(T/N: sool-si = 7 - 9 PM)

344
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,600
You need to get to the marriage suite.

345
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,030
I got it, so stop nagging.

346
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,630
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager is entering!

347
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,100
Welcome, Empress Dowager.

348
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,390
You may leave.

349
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,430
I know how you feel.

350
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:58,950
Even if she's beautiful, she's still Prime Minister El Temur's daughter.

351
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,960
What should I do?

352
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,080
Go to the suite for the peace of the palace.

353
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,420
I should, right?

354
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,790
I will do so.

355
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:18,320
Spend the night together but you must avoid any pregnancy.

356
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:24,190
Prime Minister is old. He doesn't have many years left.

357
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:31,240
There will be a bloody fight to claim his place when his absolute power disappears.

358
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,110
That is the reason there can't be a child between you and Danashiri.

359
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:40,520
We can't give them a reason or a way to regroup!

360
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,820
Then, are you saying we can push their influence out?

361
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,980
We must.

362
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,260
I'm looking for a royal concubine right now.

363
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,380
Royal concubine?

364
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,260
You must only have a child with the royal concubine I have chosen.

365
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,820
Do you understand?

366
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,870
What brings you here this late in the evening?

367
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,820
Search this wench!

368
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,540
Yes, Sir.

369
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,020
Sir, a knife.

370
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,330
Drag her out!

371
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,020
Yes, Sir.

372
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,580
Why are you so late?

373
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,910
Sorry.

374
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:54,780
Please sit. I'll pour you a drink.

375
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:17,400
It's a liquor made from the flower of the Persian silk tree. The honey in it should suit your taste well.

376
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,240
Would you like one more?

377
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,870
Tell me the truth.

378
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,050
Why do you carry that knife?

379
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:00,600
The knife was to protect myself.

380
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,850
Protect yourself?

381
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:10,140
Rather than get humiliated by General Tanqishi after getting dragged here,

382
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,720
I would rather kill myself.

383
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,350
You're lying.

384
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,640
He's now the empress's brother.

385
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:27,250
What servant would refuse him unless she's a fool?

386
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,230
Lashings won't do.

387
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,840
Drag this wench away right now!

388
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,120
He...

389
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,140
He killed my mother.

390
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,860
Just for my own comfort,

391
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,850
how could I be in the embrace of someone who killed my mother?

392
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,750
If it's a sin to protect my honor,

393
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,010
please kill me this instant.

394
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,130
Do you know how many die every year in this palace?

395
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:12,250
Some die from saying the wrong things, some from dropping hair in food, some for having affections for a eunuch.

396
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,570
There are more than a hundred reasons!

397
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:19,390
Among all the quarters, this inner court is where most people die without anyone noticing!

398
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:24,350
It's fine with me if you just die, but in here, you never die alone.

399
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,770
If you say the wrong things, the one who hears also dies;

400
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:34,580
and if you have an affection for someone, that person also dies, which is why we have rules and punishments.

401
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:41,190
You... broke the rules of this place.

402
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,200
If you spill even one drop,

403
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,320
I will start the count again from the beginning.

404
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,350
Count the lashings.

405
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,710
One.

406
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,550
Two.

407
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,080
Three.

408
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,210
Four.

409
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,930
Another bottle of wine here!

410
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,060
Is anyone there?

411
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,560
One more bottle I said!

412
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,170
Sire, please go to bed.

413
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,990
Bed?

414
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,260
Ah, bed...

415
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,520
This is the marriage suite, right.

416
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:10,460
Empress, you are very beautiful.

417
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,010
Idiot, did you just notice?

418
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,390
Your face and body are

419
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:19,380
amazingly beautiful.

420
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,050
Please...

421
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:27,000
Please put your tired body here, My Lord.

422
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,150
Please, My Lord.

423
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,270
I'm waiting like this.

424
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:54,830
Now my heart and body are yours.

425
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,320
You are

426
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,160
my liege.

427
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,260
So have your way—

428
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,520
My Lord.

429
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,820
My Lord!

430
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,360
Damn!

431
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,750
Bring me more wine to drink! Wine, wine, wine!

432
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,920
Bring more to drink! Can't you hear me?

433
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,090
She was rejected on their first night?

434
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,490
Yes, Your Highness. He just went to sleep.

435
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:02,280
Tell the eunuchs and court ladies this news in secret.

436
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,260
Since she was rejected starting on the first night,

437
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,410
even Danashiri can't hold her head high.

438
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,490
I will do so.

439
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:17,620
I'm curious to see how Danashiri's arrogant expression will change.

440
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:23,190
Your Highness, His Imperial Majesty's here.

441
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,380
Please show him in.

442
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,510
Welcome.

443
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:35,780
But why isn't the empress with you?

444
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,160
She didn't come.

445
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,900
What do you mean?

446
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,630
Coming to say your greetings to me after the first night is an important rule of the palace.

447
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,740
When I woke up, she had gone to her quarters and wasn't around.

448
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,510
What happened?

449
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,800
Didn't you teach her the rules of the palace?

450
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,520
We taught her, Your Highness.

451
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,370
I'm going to open an inquiry right away.

452
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:05,960
Not only the empress but tell all the court ladies and eunuchs of the inner court to gather.

453
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,070
Yes, Your Highness.

454
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:14,580
How dare she refuse to carry out her first greeting?

455
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,440
What? Inquiry? When the lawfully wedded empress is here,

456
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,190
why would Empress Dowager open an inquiry?

457
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,890
The handing over of responsibilities hasn't finished yet.

458
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,380
You haven't carried out your first greeting to Empress Dowager so...

459
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,090
Do I look like I'm in the mood to go greet anyone?

460
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:34,080
In any case, you must go to Empress Dowager's quarters.

461
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,350
Tell her I had a rough first night, so I'm resting.

462
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,520
Your Majesty.

463
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,530
No. I think pregnancy would be better.

464
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:48,500
Tell her that I received so much of His Majesty's grace that I am too tired to go.

465
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,550
Why don't you try speaking to the empress?

466
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,630
What do you mean?

467
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:01,330
A war isn't always fought by wielding a sword.

468
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:05,830
If the two of them fight, we're the ones who will die.

469
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,390
I can't do anything about this.

470
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,120
Lady Yeom. Lady Yeom!

471
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:17,190
Empress is going to open an inquiry of the inner court.

472
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:21,620
Inquiry? But Empress Dowager just said she is opening an inquiry.

473
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:29,600
From Jong Sa Won, please introduce yourselves.

474
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,010
I'm Jong Sa Won who deals with documents at the Bureau of Commerce and Industry.

475
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:38,450
I'm Yeop Seo Bin from the Bureau of Commerce.

476
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,510
I'm Yong Sa Sik from the Sangbokgung.

477
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,470
Sangsigung's--

478
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,420
That's enough.

479
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,390
How am I supposed to remember all of you?

480
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,870
From now on, I'll just call you my way.

481
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,450
You're not very pretty for a court lady.

482
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:01,190
I'll call you Squash.

483
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,990
Your face is dark, so Coal.

484
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,390
You're pudgy, so Boar.

485
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:19,630
You look lazy, so Grub.

486
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,530
Your Majesty.

487
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,560
You can't call people that way in the royal palace.

488
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:31,130
Your face is wide-ish and looks like a toad.

489
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,100
I'll call you Big Toad from now on.

490
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:39,710
Squash.

491
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,150
Squash, you wench!

492
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

493
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,370
Do you like your name?

494
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,160
I... like it.

495
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,060
Of course, you should.

496
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:07,400
From now on, I am in charge of the inner court,

497
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,800
not Empress Dowager. Got it?

498
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,850
Yes, Your Imperial Majesty!

499
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:54,600
What brings you all the way here?

500
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,570
Why do you think? I came to see you.

501
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,580
I'm sorry,

502
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,640
but I was on my way to see the emperor.

503
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,880
I thought you'd want to see me.

504
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:13,100
I heard that His Majesty didn't even lay a finger on you on your first night.

505
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:20,470
That has never happened in any previous generation of emperors.

506
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:25,210
Aren't you curious as to how to win his heart?

507
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:29,610
Are you... going to tell me?

508
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,890
If you wish.

509
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,820
There's something else I'm curious about.

510
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,100
I heard that when the emperor dies, the empress dowager shaves her head and enters a monastery

511
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:46,020
and then spends the rest of her years as a female monk.

512
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:51,210
But how are you still here acting like you're in charge of the inner court?

513
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:54,160
I'm curious about that secret method, too.

514
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,830
Do you wish for me to leave the royal palace?

515
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,690
I heard you put a lot of importance on rules and customs.

516
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:07,640
What's the point if you don't act on them?

517
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,340
You need to set an example.

518
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:31,880
Tell Head Eunuch to bring the girl chosen to be the royal concubine.

519
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,550
Lift your head.

520
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,370
Your face looks kind and refined.

521
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,130
And you also have shapely and pretty breasts.

522
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,880
Turn around.

523
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,640
You have the hips that will bear children well.

524
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,240
I looked very carefully among the court ladies

525
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,900
and chose her by the strictest of qualifications.

526
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,500
Look this way.

527
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,370
Where are you from?

528
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,220
I came from Goryeo.

529
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,240
The emperor will come to your room tonight.

530
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,890
You're certain you can take good care of him, right?

531
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,550
I will do my very best.

532
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:33,650
She has been well-educated already. Please do not worry.

533
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:38,770
Get another girl from Goryeo to serve her.

534
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,310
Yes, Your Highness.

535
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:53,240
You will go to the royal concubine's quarters tonight. Get ready.

536
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:06,170
The deposed king's sword fighting skills aren't bad at all.

537
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:11,310
Don't worry. I have a special weapon.

538
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:16,750
Special weapon? What is it?

539
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,230
This is it.

540
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:31,780
You put... iron inside?

541
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,650
When his wooden sword is shattered,

542
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:39,520
is that the only thing that will be shattered? How about his head, too?

543
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:45,580
He used to teach sword fighting when we were in the Department of Military Defense in Inju.

544
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:48,320
Don't underestimate Yeom Byeong Soo's sword-fighting skills.

545
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,050
That bastard.

546
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:54,940
Even the best soldiers in Goryeo's military were no match for His Majesty.

547
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,030
It's almost time, Sire.

548
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,920
Please win!

549
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,900
Everyone is of one heart.

550
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,650
Please lead us!

551
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,110
Please win for us!

552
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:36,090
Don't get nervous and destroy him.

553
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,310
Today's fight won't be over until someone surrenders.

554
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,920
If no one surrenders until the end, you can kill each other.

555
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:03,630
Did you hear? If you don't want to scar your precious body, you can surrender now.

556
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,540
Don't ever surrender.

557
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:10,030
Why? Because you want to kill me?

558
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,550
Begin.

559
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,070
What is the tea for?

560
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:04,730
It's angelica root tea. You are to drink it tonight to warm up your body.

561
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,350
I heard you're from Goryeo.

562
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,840
I'm from Goryeo, too.

563
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:20,780
So... Head Eunuch brought you in especially to serve me.

564
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:25,230
Please drink it before it gets cold.

565
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,460
His Majesty is coming this way.

566
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,660
Didn't you say he was coming at Hwaeshi? (9:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.)

567
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:38,140
I thought so, but he suddenly made his way here.

568
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,660
Take the tea tray away.

569
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,120
Yes, Sir.

570
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,520
Watch yourself!

571
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,530
I apologize, Your Majesty.

572
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,420
Please let's go, Your Majesty.

573
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,660
Lift your head for a moment.

574
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:24,020
I said lift your head.

575
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,380
Didn't you hear His Majesty?!

576
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,190
You...

577
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,120
You are... You are...

578
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:58,470
♫ You are the love wind. You blow in ♫

579
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:02,540
♫ You spread through my heart ♫
