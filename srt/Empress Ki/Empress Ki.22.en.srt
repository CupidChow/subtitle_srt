1
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,850
Where are you going in such a hurry?

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,700
The empress told me to go see His Majesty.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,470
But... is there something wrong?

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,170
Brother!

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,550
We found a secret passage that leads to the outside in the royal corridor!

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,390
A secret passage?

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,280
He must have escaped the palace already.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,850
The blood trail led to the western gate.

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,500
Shut down the secret passage and tighten vigilance at the western gate!

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,030
Yes, General.

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,140
Let's go.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,190
You're in this state because of the bloodletter?

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,900
Yes. But... Jeok Ho didn't have it either.

14
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,150
Your Majesty, were you looking for me?

15
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,390
Yes. Please examine her wounds first.

16
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,080
Hurry.

17
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,530
Thankfully, her tendons are fine.

18
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,870
But... why is she so pale?

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,690
Give me your hand for a moment.

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,360
What's wrong?

21
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,120
Sir.

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,110
Sh-She bled so much that her strength has been weakened.

23
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,320
There's nothing especially wrong other than that.

24
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,880
We need to hide her in the Women's Pavilion.

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,090
I need to go outside the palace and meet up with Eunuch Bang.

26
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,760
Are you crazy?

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,770
The Kheshigs are scattered outside. How will you get out?

28
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,170
I heard there was a secret passage to the outside in the royal corridor.

29
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,430
That's already been discovered and shut down.

30
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,920
Pardon?

31
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,340
Tanqishi knows you're involved, so you can't even go back to the guesthouse.

32
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,290
The only place where the Kheshigs cannot enter is the Women's Pavilion.

33
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,480
It won't be easy to get there either because security has been tightened.

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,910
There's no other way. Hide her in the Women's Pavilion no matter what.

35
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,990
We do have one method.

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,090
What is that?

37
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,370
Who's inside?

38
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,050
Lady Park is on her way back after seeing His Majesty.

39
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,150
Lady Park?

40
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,680
Lady Park!

41
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,970
Lady Park, please let us see your face for a moment.

42
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,140
What insolence!

43
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,910
How dare you ask her to show her face when she's with child?

44
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,630
It's General Tanqishi's orders, so please understand.

45
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,600
My Lady?

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,410
My Lady, let me just see your--

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,710
Turn it around! I will go report this to His Majesty at once!

48
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,370
Yes, Sir.

49
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,690
Why are you being like this?

50
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,260
It's not as though you're not aware of the Kheshig's rules.

51
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,910
The Imperial family's customs are far more important to me.

52
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,720
What are you doing? Turn it around!

53
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,810
Yes, yes, yes. Fine, so go on your way.

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,820
Let's go.

55
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,690
That man is really something.

56
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,810
He's famous for being overly anxious.

57
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,060
So dusty.

58
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,250
I didn't know such a place existed in the Women's Pavilion.

59
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,010
There were a few royal concubines who committed suicide here in the past.

60
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:59,260
With rumors of their vengeful spirits appearing, eventually, no one comes this way anymore.

61
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,740
Yang is going to be scared alone.

62
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,850
That's why I'm going to ask Court Lady Noh to keep you company.

63
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,770
So, Hong Dan, act like you're looking after Court Lady Noh and keep your eye on Yang.

64
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,140
Yes, Sir.

65
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,590
As soon as I recover, I'll figure out a way to leave here.

66
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,910
But, Yang,

67
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,700
did you...

68
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,410
Do you have something you want to tell me?

69
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,540
Never mind. I need to get you a few things,

70
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,470
so, Hong Dan, you come with me.

71
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,410
Congratulations on the pregnancy, Your Majesty.

72
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,040
Thank you.

73
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,600
You did well, Empress.

74
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,760
I didn't do anything.

75
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,000
More than that, how about opening the state coffers and distributing grain to the people?

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,450
Oh, that's a great idea!

77
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,980
You should show at least that much Imperial grace on such a happy occasion for the country!

78
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,560
I will do so.

79
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,440
Oh, have some, Your Majesty.

80
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,470
I can't eat due to morning sickness.

81
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,560
Welcome, Brother.

82
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,610
I have a favor to ask of you.

83
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,950
Tell me.

84
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,560
Allow me to search the Women's Pavilion with the Kheshigs.

85
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,940
You still haven't found them?

86
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,160
If they're still not in the Women's Pavilion,

87
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,210
it'll be safe to say they made it out of the palace.

88
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,240
Allow it, Your Majesty.

89
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,920
I cannot.

90
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,790
In any previous generation, what empress has ever allowed men in the Women's Pavilion?

91
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,100
It's an urgent matter.

92
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,500
Do you have no concern for what matters to me?

93
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,980
If the Imperial family's authority falls to the ground, they will all criticize me.

94
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,270
Is that what you want to happen?

95
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,270
How about asking the Court Lady Inspectors to carry out the search?

96
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,770
I was thinking the same thing.

97
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,520
You stay out of it, Brother.

98
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,090
Do as they say. I will take my leave then.

99
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,960
Did that bother you?

100
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,870
Please don't be angry, at least for the sake of our baby, Your Majesty.

101
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,540
It's a happy occasion, after all.

102
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,860
There's no reason Jeok Ho would protect the bloodletter while putting his life on the line.

103
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,510
Then, are you saying he doesn't have it?

104
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,240
If he did, he would have handed it over to Empress Dowager already.

105
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,690
It's the last ember which threatens you. Maybe if we get rid of the source of trouble...

106
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,550
Find me some animal blood.

107
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,220
Why all of a sudden?

108
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,880
We can easily make as many bloodletters as we want.

109
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,760
Even if Emperor Mingzong's blood letter appears later,

110
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,480
no one has ever seen it, so how would anyone know which one is real?

111
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,120
That's a marvelous idea.

112
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,810
Son, everything is my fault.

113
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,210
When I die and you become the emperor,

114
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,850
trust and depend on Prime Minister El Temur.

115
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,400
He's the only one who will protect you and Yuan.

116
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,390
I am sorry, Son.

117
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,340
Why did you bring so much?

118
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,700
Head Eunuch told me you had to eat well and gave me all this to take.

119
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Why?

120
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,370
I don't know. He told me to take good care of you.

121
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,450
There are even tangerines. These are precious fruits!

122
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,370
It's so sour, it's inedible.

123
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,780
It's sour? It tastes sweet to me.

124
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,940
- It's not sour?
- No.

125
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,790
It's my first time eating it and it's tasty.

126
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,850
How is Yang doing?

127
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,330
Head Eunuch Dok Man is taking great care of her.

128
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,170
Would you like to go and see her?

129
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,060
Never mind.

130
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,480
Most of the people in the Women's Pavilion serve the empress.

131
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,780
I don't want to put Yang in danger because of my wish to see her.

132
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,070
If you go around the back of Lady Park's quarters, there's a small door that leads to there.

133
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,610
No one will know if you go that way when it's dark.

134
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,680
Your Majesty!

135
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,870
What are you doing here?

136
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,810
That's what I want to ask.

137
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,760
Are you on your way to see Lady Park so late in the evening?

138
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,330
Well, I thought I've been a little inattentive these days.

139
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,870
Your Majesty, I'm also pregnant.

140
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,970
Perhaps, are you choosing between the babies already?

141
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,830
Of course not.

142
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,210
I just wanted to see how she's—

143
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,150
She's eating well, sleeping well, and has been well.

144
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,880
So, there's no need to see Lady Park again.

145
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,630
I'm worried it might interfere with my own pregnancy.

146
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,660
We can't let that happen.

147
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,880
Golta, let's go.

148
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

149
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,450
Lady Park is pregnant with a son, right?

150
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,620
According to the physician, it's definitely a son.

151
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,620
If I have a daughter, it'll ruin me.

152
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,400
I need to call the physician and have him do an examination of my pulse right away.

153
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,330
I will prepare for it, Your Majesty.

154
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,950
Did you wake up because of me?

155
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,940
It seems like I overate earlier.

156
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,800
I'm fine, so please get some sleep.

157
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,210
Have you been blessed with the king's favor?

158
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,390
Pardon?

159
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,330
I'm asking if you're pregnant.

160
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,320
That's nonsense. What do you mean pregnant?

161
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,060
No, I'm sure you're pregnant.

162
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,950
I have never been wrong.

163
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,470
Yang, are you sleeping?

164
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,360
Yang.

165
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,660
Head Eunuch, Sir.

166
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,100
Change into these.

167
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,990
Take it day and night. It's a tonic you must drink.

168
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:31,180
Also, it'll be good to keep yourself warm, so refuel the fire in the room often.

169
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,470
Please tell me the truth.

170
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,120
When you took my pulse last time, why were you so surprised?

171
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,200
Why are you looking after me so well,

172
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,200
and... what is this tonic?

173
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,440
You tell me honestly.

174
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,360
It doesn't seem to be His Majesty's child. Is it Wang Yoo's?

175
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,760
My suspicions were right.

176
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,130
- Then...
- You're right, also. You're pregnant.

177
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,590
From the pulse, it seems like it's been at least three months.

178
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,180
You were struck with the sword and even bled in that state...

179
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,120
The child is...

180
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,780
Is the child okay?

181
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,370
Don't worry.

182
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,610
The pulse was beating strongly.

183
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:51,460
It didn't happen while you were a court lady, so I don't intend to fault you.

184
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,380
Until Wang Yoo comes back to take care of you,

185
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,410
I will help you, so just know that.

186
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,160
Is it a son?

187
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,910
It must be. It has to be a son.

188
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,260
Your Majesty.

189
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,960
What's wrong?

190
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,730
No way! It's not a daughter, is it?

191
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:50,020
I beg your pardon, but you're not pregnant.

192
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,390
I'm not pregnant?

193
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,660
You didn't say that last time!

194
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,340
There are times when the pulse is hard to feel during the early stage.

195
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:10,100
You had a false pregnancy.

196
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,670
False pregnancy?

197
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:23,580
Your body reacted as though you were really pregnant due to your excessive obsession over a baby.

198
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:29,760
Silence! I was... I had morning sickness and my stomach even became larger.

199
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,530
How dare you lie?!

200
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,630
You're infertile, Your Majesty.

201
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,510
Infertile?

202
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,810
You cannot become pregnant.

203
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,180
I can't...

204
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,210
have a child?

205
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,130
I apologize, Your Majesty.

206
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,770
Your Majesty.

207
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,770
Your Majesty, please wake up.

208
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,160
Your Majesty!

209
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,720
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

210
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,750
Your Majesty!

211
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,300
I can hear you from here. Why are you sighing so much?

212
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,420
Is it a child of someone you're not fond of?

213
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,840
It's not that.

214
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,760
Then?

215
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:51,320
I have... never thought about having a child.

216
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,510
How to protect this child,

217
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,550
if I will do a good job...

218
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,800
I feel so lost.

219
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,540
All women who become pregnant for the first time probably feel like you do.

220
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:19,760
But... a mother who bears a child becomes stronger than anyone in this world.

221
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:26,320
The heavens gave a strong will in place of a delicate body.

222
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,490
Will I... be able to do well?

223
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,600
How was your mother?

224
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,730
My mother was...

225
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,790
My mother, for my sake...

226
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,420
even gave up her life.

227
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,120
That's a mother's heart.

228
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,900
There's nothing in this world she fears if it's for her child's sake.

229
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,370
That's what you call a mother's instinctive love.

230
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,350
The heavens give new life.

231
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,510
Something to be thankful for, a blessing.

232
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:35,550
Even if it's for your child's sake, only have good thoughts.

233
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,800
Yes, My Lady.

234
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,400
I will do so.

235
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,530
Baby... don't worry

236
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,910
and come out after your full 10 months.

237
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,690
I will make sure to come to my senses

238
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,860
and become a good grandmother to you.

239
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,350
Any one objecting will be killed immediately!

240
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,400
How dare with your dirty hands...

241
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,250
You should've picked the chief more carefully.

242
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,610
Take them away!

243
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,580
Are you watching, Jeok Ho?

244
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,550
If you want to save these people, bring the bloodletter.

245
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,620
Otherwise,

246
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,670
you'll do hard labor in the mine for the rest of your lives.

247
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,310
Understand, Jeok Ho?!

248
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,890
Are you out of your mind?

249
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,700
You want me to just watch them getting hurt because of me?

250
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,040
I am going to kill those bastards and end my life.

251
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,720
Can we leave Seung Nyang in the Women's Pavilion?

252
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,640
What can we do on our own?

253
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
Head Eunuch Dok Man said he has a plan to get her out of the palace,

254
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,190
so all we can do is trust him and wait.

255
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,910
Shouldn't we let His Majesty know?

256
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,170
He will just feel bad.

257
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,870
Let's wait until Seung Nyang comes out.

258
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,450
You shut the physician's mouth, right?

259
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,210
I did as you asked.

260
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,050
But how about if you just let the people know—

261
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,140
The emperor even issued grain to people to congratulate my pregnancy.

262
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,530
Are you asking me to be the mockery of the world?

263
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,510
It will be known after a few months anyway.

264
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,510
Things go wrong during childbirth all the time.

265
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,390
Your Highness.

266
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,910
I'll receive the fertility treatments. So have that prepared.

267
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,990
I heard it's very painful.

268
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,810
That pain is nothing.

269
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:17,740
I can't be childless, living as an empress in name only for the rest of my life.

270
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,540
Yang. Please come out for a minute.

271
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,260
Are you saying there is a way for me to leave the palace?

272
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,350
Lady Park will request from the empress to leave

273
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,240
the palace for her child's birth and recovery.

274
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,590
She will sneak you out at that time.

275
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,670
Thank you.

276
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,110
We agreed that Goryeo people will help each other, didn't we?

277
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:05,300
It's in four months. If you endure four months

278
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,860
here, you can leave the palace

279
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,140
and raise your child without worries.

280
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,380
I won't forget the generosity everyone has shown me.

281
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,550
If Wang Yoo knows about your pregnancy, he will be so happy.

282
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,860
We've arrived at the Gaegyeong that we've been longing for in our dreams.

283
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,760
I don't know why my heart is racing and my eyes are welling up.

284
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,120
It would've been nice if we had all come together.

285
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,220
Let's go, Your Majesty.

286
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,220
Is that true?!

287
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,620
What do you mean by counterfeit Yuan currency?

288
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,380
Are you saying these are fakes?

289
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:32,420
Then... Yuan's envoys have been paying for trade with counterfeit banknotes all this time?

290
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,190
That's what I heard.

291
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,580
How could this happen?

292
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,180
Kim, who was in charge of trading,

293
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,930
was in on it with the Yuan envoys.

294
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,230
He was the official in charge of trading with Yuan.

295
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,730
He got attacked by something blunt instead of a knife.

296
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,810
Bring me all the fake money and silver.

297
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,240
Understood, Your Majesty.

298
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,300
How much are all these?

299
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,430
The fake banknote is so detailed that it's hard to tell the difference from the real one.

300
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,670
According to the investigators, they are made by one source.

301
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,840
You said the envoy hasn't paid for the current trades yet?

302
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,010
Since the officer who was in charge is dead, they are delaying the payments.

303
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,160
They probably couldn't take a chance on being found out to be using fake banknotes.

304
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,520
We can't beat them up since they are Yuan's envoys.

305
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,850
What shall we do to those bastards?

306
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,500
Where are the envoys now?

307
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,650
I heard that they're staying in Poonghwa Pavilion.

308
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:03,660
Do as I say from now.

309
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:10,640
If you serve me well from today, I will make you my concubine.

310
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:16,220
Forget being concubines, just sell us some Yuan money to make our owner happy, please.

311
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,590
What do you mean by sell you some Yuan money?

312
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,830
I heard the value of the Yuan banknotes will go up soon.

313
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,990
Our regular customers are buying them because of it.

314
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:28,120
You can get three times the value if I introduce you.

315
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,610
Three times?

316
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,690
You can trust the information circulating here.

317
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,070
I don't have any to make a deal.

318
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,090
The count is correct, Owner.

319
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,900
You sure we don't need to weigh it?

320
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,260
My hands are the scale.

321
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,150
It seems plenty more than three times.

322
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,410
Are they fake?

323
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,070
They are real.

324
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,550
Those bastards...

325
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,020
He seems to be cautious.

326
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,130
Keep buying up the Yuan banknotes.

327
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,700
Yes.

328
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,820
They will give you counterfeit money sooner or later.

329
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,960
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

330
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,330
My dearest Seung Nyang,

331
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,960
I think the business here will take longer than I thought.

332
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,130
I feel uneasy having left you there.

333
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:14,150
We'll soon roam around Goryeo's land together.

334
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,260
Please don't overdo it until then...

335
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,260
I miss you Seung Nyang.

336
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,610
General!

337
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:35,050
I just confiscated Wang Yoo's letter coming from Goryeo.

338
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,270
This confirms Seung Nyang didn't go to Goryeo.

339
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,630
What about Wang Yoo's men?

340
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,340
I can't find a trace of them.

341
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,420
Don't be lax in guarding the inside and outside of the palace.

342
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,340
Yes, General.

343
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,380
Empress Dowager, General Bayan's man has sent you a letter.

344
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:31,040
Empress Dowager, I hope you have been healthy and peaceful.

345
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:36,180
In Liaoyang, General Bayan's first order of business is to train the soldiers.

346
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:42,000
We cannot create a strong army in one day, but our forces are definitely becoming stronger.

347
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,650
I've done wrong, please let me live.

348
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,600
I've committed a sin punishable by death.

349
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,200
Kill him.

350
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,290
Please let me live, General.

351
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,940
Using his position to be paid 100 nyangs of gold,

352
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,830
he has exploited the people for many years.

353
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,290
Please forgive me.

354
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,110
I cannot forgive greed and cruelty.

355
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,750
Confiscate all his assets. Beat him just to the verge of death then throw him in prison.

356
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,140
But, of course, the problem is always money.

357
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,030
Just by confiscating the assets of corrupt local politicians,

358
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,580
it is still difficult to have enough to finance an army.

359
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,240
So I am looking for another way to finance our army.

360
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,180
I am requesting that you look for someone who can help us.

361
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,650
Have you looked into any wealthy merchants in Yuan?

362
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,980
Most of them are connected to Prime Minister El Temür.

363
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,880
Of course.

364
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,660
The power to maintain Prime Minister El Temür's status

365
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,100
must come from a tremendous amount of money, after all.

366
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,430
So what is your plan, Empress Dowager?

367
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,790
Yuan has ten provinces.

368
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,470
One of them is definitely on my side.

369
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:56,620
If I can get five of the remaining nine magistrates on my side

370
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,220
we could challenge El Temür.

371
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,620
I will help you, in any way I can.

372
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,560
How is the emperor these days?

373
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,960
He has become much more dignified, unlike before.

374
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,580
I'm sure he's feeling very lonely.

375
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:23,710
Please endure a little longer and wait, Your Majesty.

376
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,810
This...

377
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,350
You made this yourself, My Lady?

378
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,150
How do you like it? Do you like the baby clothes?

379
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,700
Yes.

380
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,800
Just thinking about my baby wearing this

381
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,320
is so fascinating.

382
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,380
It's almost finished, Your Majesty.

383
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,080
Just a little more...

384
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,470
Please endure just a little longer.

385
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,510
Just a little longer and it will be done.

386
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,040
Your Majesty.

387
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:14,740
Your Majesty, just a little longer.

388
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,350
Endure just a little longer, Your Majesty.

389
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,330
Just a little longer.

390
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,310
Your Majesty, please,

391
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,850
stop the treatments now.

392
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,490
You receive acupuncture and moxa therapy every day.

393
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,630
But there has been no progress in four months.

394
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,430
It is difficult for me to continue watching you suffer.

395
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,900
To give up now,

396
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:44,730
it would make me look so pathetic.

397
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,900
His Majesty the Emperor is here!

398
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,710
Your Majesty, please put this around your belly.

399
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,270
Hurry, please.

400
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,550
Why are you so late?

401
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,620
Your Majesty, His Majesty the Emperor has come.

402
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:13,040
Her Majesty was taking a brief nap.

403
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,410
Please go in now.

404
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,050
Welcome, Your Majesty.

405
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,140
But why did you come with him?

406
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,650
It seems Lady Park will give birth soon.

407
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,570
- What about it?
- She wishes to recover from the birthing at Gameop Temple where Empress Dowager is.

408
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,690
So we were hoping that you would permit it.

409
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,690
I apologize, Your Majesty.

410
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:50,170
Please permit it. The mother should be comfortable in order for a safe birth.

411
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,750
It is typical for those giving birth in the Imperial family to recover in private homes.

412
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,550
There is no reason I can't permit it.

413
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

414
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,950
I have a request of you as well.

415
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,890
- Please tell me.
- During my remaining months of pregnancy,

416
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:12,910
I would like to offer prayers in the small Buddhist temple at Hwanggak Temple.

417
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,920
Will you be all right away from the Imperial Palace?

418
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,700
When doing good for the unborn child,

419
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,200
what could possibly harm me?

420
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,290
Then do as you wish, Empress.

421
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,350
Your Majesty!

422
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:41,020
Now you can see Yang whenever you want to.

423
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,270
- Not yet.
- But it's already been four months.

424
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,960
Are you all right?

425
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,570
As written in Empress Dowager's letter,

426
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,130
regaining my dignity as the emperor is first and foremost to me right now.

427
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,960
I can't do anything in the end without any power.

428
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,160
Even for Yang...

429
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,980
Were you looking for me, Your Majesty?

430
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,700
Can you help me, Brother?

431
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,010
- Is there a problem?
- Yes.

432
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,760
Whenever I think about it, it makes me gnash my teeth even while sleeping and makes my hair stand on end.

433
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,380
What's the matter?

434
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,360
Tell me.

435
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,460
When you are this troubled, what can't I do to help you?

436
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,090
That wench, Lady Park...

437
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,380
please kill her for me.

438
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,680
Over my dead body, I can't stand to see her having His Majesty's child!

439
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,230
Please kill that wench, Brother

440
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,670
and stop my bloody tears from falling.

441
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:00,320
Is it doesn't go as planned, not only you but even Father

442
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,140
- will be put in danger.
- She's leaving for the Gameop Temple to give birth.

443
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,020
Who would know if we got rid of her?

444
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,950
Please grant me this request.

445
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,630
I feel like I'm going to go crazy!

446
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,760
We shouldn't

447
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,010
tell Father about this.

448
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,600
Of course, I'll take it to my grave.

449
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,770
This is General Tanqishi.

450
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:44,330
I'm Crazy Dog.

451
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,840
I need you to become a bandit

452
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,590
and kill some wenches.

453
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,780
Just give me an order.

454
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,260
My Lady.

455
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,600
You'll die if you touch this. It 's been cursed.

456
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,330
I understand. I won't touch your things.

457
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,730
This belongs to someone else.

458
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,920
Do you know why I'm not giving it to you?

459
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,210
If I give it to you now, you will die. So I'm going to give it to you later.

460
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,330
I understand, My Lady.

461
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,940
Yang.

462
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,570
Why is that man back again?

463
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,670
In two days, Lady Park is heading to the Gameop Temple.

464
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,120
She'll be going in the palanquin,

465
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,110
so if you hide inside beforehand, you should be able to get out of the palace safely.

466
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:03,370
Please ask Eunuch Bang for me to meet at the second peak of Chilbong Mountain

467
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,760
where Hwanggak Temple stands.

468
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,790
All right, I will do that.

469
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,210
But...

470
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,130
when you get out, what are you planning to do?

471
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,420
First, I'll go back to Goryeo

472
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,470
and meet His Majesty.

473
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,170
All right. I understand.

474
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,890
Baby...

475
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,910
You'll soon meet your father.

476
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,700
When he meets you,

477
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,370
he'll be so happy.

478
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,640
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

479
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:04,590
Those bastards sent word that they will sell 20,000 banknotes.

480
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,880
If they are real banknotes,

481
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,480
20,000 is impossible.

482
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,640
So they're definitely fake.

483
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:32,580
Did you bring the money?

484
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,330
Show us the banknotes first.

485
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,030
What do you think you're doing?!

486
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,320
Don't move!

487
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,230
Your Majesty, we finally found them.

488
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,680
Take them away.

489
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,160
Yes, Sire.

490
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,920
Take them away!

491
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,860
Stop!

492
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,370
How dare you touch a foreign envoy?

493
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,580
Do you want a war with Yuan?

494
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,400
We know these are fake currency.

495
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,840
You took the real banknotes from Yuan's Imperial family for yourselves

496
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,860
and paid for trade in Goryeo with counterfeit currency.

497
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:16,860
Once Prime Minister El Temür hears about this, who do you think will lose his head first?

498
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:22,230
I heard there's only one place that makes counterfeit currency.

499
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,170
If you tell me where that is, I'll burn the fake banknotes right here

500
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,650
and overlook your offense.

501
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,720
I-Is that the truth?

502
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,860
You must not have heard the rumors about me.

503
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:45,740
I never... break my word.

504
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:58,190
The location where the fake currency is made... is in Liaoyang Province.

505
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,150
Liaoyang Province?

506
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,400
That's under General Bayan's control.

507
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,490
Where in Liaoyang Province?

508
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,530
We don't know the specifics either.

509
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:14,040
There's someone named Hong Ga who distributes alcohol to courtesan houses.

510
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,050
We get the fake currency from him.

511
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,450
Are you certain?

512
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:25,340
I'm about to die, so how could I lie to you?

513
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,090
Lock these men up

514
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:33,110
and send word to Yuan and report their crimes in detail.

515
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,360
Yes, Your Majesty!

516
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,120
You said you would let us go!

517
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,930
Is that true? Lady Park is coming to give birth here?

518
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,990
Yes, Your Highness. She's leaving today.

519
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:50,040
How strange.

520
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,970
The empress wouldn't have allowed it, knowing I am here.

521
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,300
The empress is visiting the small temple room in Hwanggak Temple right now.

522
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,450
Why is she there?

523
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,810
Until she gives birth, she's planning to pray.

524
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,600
I won't fall for that kind of talk.

525
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,710
Pregnant? It's impossible!

526
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,270
Her stomach has grown quite a lot.

527
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,290
Anyone can play a trick with the stomach.

528
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,460
Wicked girl.

529
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,460
What is she scheming?

530
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,070
Baby,

531
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,760
just bear with it even if it's stifling.

532
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:27,070
Once we get outside the palace,

533
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,470
you'll soon be comfortable again.

534
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,790
Yang!

535
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,160
Change into these clothes.

536
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,440
That's good. If you go through the side door,

537
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,910
Lady Park's palanquin is waiting, so get inside.

538
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:59,390
Only the servants from Goryeo are going this time, so there's no need to worry.

539
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,620
Who is guarding us?

540
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:06,670
I told Lady Park a way to get the Kheshigs away from the vicinity.

541
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,770
But... where's Court Lady Noh?

542
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:15,740
She's stuck to the palanquin insisting she's going to accompany you all the way.

543
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,500
Live well when you get out.

544
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,570
Thank you, Head Eunuch, Sir.

545
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,120
I will never forget your kindness.

546
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,160
She'll be waiting. Let's go.

547
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,070
Lady Park, it's His Majesty.

548
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,170
Your Majesty.

549
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,410
No need to come out. Have a safe trip.

550
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

551
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,020
Let's go!

552
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,280
You cannot make any mistakes.

553
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,330
Yes, Brother.

554
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,610
Stupid Dok Man, telling me she's pregnant only now.

555
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,230
How much Seung Nyang must have suffered...

556
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,470
But I'm so proud of her that she's safe.

557
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,450
When His Majesty hears about this,

558
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,670
he'll be happy and grinning from ear to ear!

559
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:07,460
But why are they so late?

560
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:15,640
The bandits will start their attack soon.

561
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,750
I think we should get out of the way now.

562
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,680
I understand, so be still!

563
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,670
Stop!

564
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,480
Stop!

565
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:39,390
Lady Park needs to go.

566
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,680
Go?

567
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:46,760
Yes. So please remove yourselves and stay close by the forest.

568
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,550
Oh, all right.

569
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:54,060
We'll take a sufficient rest stop, so do what you must.

570
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,750
Come on out, Yang.

571
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,770
Hurry.

572
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:33,930
Yang, when you get back to Goryeo, please give this to my mother.

573
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,540
All right.

574
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,520
Please, mine too.

575
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,550
Me too. Mine too.

576
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,530
You're starting again! Who do you want her to give this, too?

577
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,460
Take mine with you, too.

578
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,630
Tell my mother I'm well.

579
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,870
This is precious to you, Court Lady Noh.

580
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,470
When you get back your senses, you'll regret it. Please take it back.

581
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,850
Take it with you. Take it, hurry.

582
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:04,460
We're going to waste daylight at this rate.

583
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:13,110
Yang, hurry up and leave before the Kheshigs come back.

584
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:17,960
Everyone, thank you so much.

585
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,790
- Be happy, Yang.
- Don't forget us.

586
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,600
- I will.
- Stay safe.

587
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,330
You must raise the baby well.

588
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,350
Yes, My Lady.

589
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,710
- I'll get going.
- Hurry up.

590
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,430
Farewell!

591
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:15,220
Bandits!

592
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:05,660
My Lady! My Lady!

593
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:16,860
My Lady!

594
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,600
My Lady! Please don't die!

595
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,900
My Lady! My Lady!

596
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,570
Hurry up and get away!

597
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:31,560
Your baby... You must keep your baby alive!

598
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,580
My Lady! My Lady!

599
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:43,750
Before I die, it is my wish to step on Goryeo's soil...

600
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,490
Hurry up.

601
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:47,670
My Lady...

602
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,260
My Lady!

603
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,310
My Lady! My Lady!

604
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:56,040
- Yang, let's go!
- My Lady!

605
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,130
Yang, we have to go!

606
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:02,870
My Lady! My Lady!

607
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,570
Let's get going, Yang.

608
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,300
My Lady!

609
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,430
Yang!

610
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,880
Yang! Yang!

611
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,130
Go! Hurry!

612
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,110
- Eunuch Bang.
- What happened to you?!

613
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,110
Are you all right?

614
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:16,370
Who do we have here?

615
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,330
It's Seung Nyang!

616
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:29,020
I'll take care of them, so take her away from here.

617
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:30,200
Deputy Commander Park!

618
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,280
You're with child. You must live.

619
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,960
Seung Nyang, let's go.

620
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,330
Deputy Commander Park.

621
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:42,010
Get them!

622
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:55,060
Today, I'll dice your flesh to pieces.

623
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:59,000
Fine! Let's take it to the end!

624
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:30,900
Go and ask forgiveness to Commander when you get to the other side!

625
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,210
Seung Nyang!

626
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,150
Seung Nyang! Seung Nyang! Are you all right?

627
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:30,310
I'm all right.

628
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:34,660
I'll lure them away,

629
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,430
so don't go anywhere and stay right here.

630
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:50,780
Hey, you slow morons! Hurry up and come catch me!

631
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,410
Get him!

632
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:57,260
Get him!

633
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,730
What? Yang left the palace?

634
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,100
Baby...

635
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,520
Don't worry.

636
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:43,990
Like my mother protected me,

637
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:51,320
I will... I will protect you.

638
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,540
Don't worry, Baby.

639
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:36,880
♫ No matter how I try and try to conceal them
the tears keep filling my eyes  ♫

640
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:47,300
♫ What can I do about the longing which runs
and overflows like tears? ♫
