1
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,560
Can't you be more careful?

2
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,220
I deserve death, Your Majesty.

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,370
Let's go, Your Majesty.

4
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,060
Lift your head for a moment.

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,900
I said lift your head.

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,260
Do you not hear His Majesty?

7
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,860
You are... You are...

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,430
You're really...

9
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,590
You look so much alike.

10
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,550
Let me ask you one thing.

11
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,220
- By chance--
- Your Majesty.

12
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,710
Sorry, I'm a little late.

13
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,150
I just got here, too.

14
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,120
Bring the tea out again.

15
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,910
This is my chance.

16
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,900
But...

17
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,380
why did you want to see me here?

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,710
There's something very entertaining to watch.

19
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,430
Entertaining?

20
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,370
Please go inside.

21
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,380
Say your greetings.

22
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,930
My name is Eojin.

23
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,180
Emperor Dowager.

24
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,590
Her dance skills are one of the best.

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,980
I called you here to comfort your mind and body.

26
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,480
The soldiers who were ordered by the king

27
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,170
caused a rebellion and tried to kill me.

28
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,120
That's a lie.

29
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,790
How can you lie!

30
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,360
Ki Ja Ho wielded the sword at me and—

31
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,000
Shut that mouth!

32
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,830
Father!

33
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,880
You can't, Father.

34
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,470
You can't!

35
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,490
If I get caught after killing the emperor,

36
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,150
Tanqishi will definitely come to find me.

37
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,640
Then I can kill him

38
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,070
and I will also die.

39
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,870
The people in the room are the Head Eunuch, Empress Dowager,

40
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,080
Lady Park, and the emperor.

41
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,000
The eunuch guards are highly skilled in fighting.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,940
If I don't want to be interrupted by them...

43
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,220
tonight...

44
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,090
I need to strike his vital spot.

45
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,530
That's enough.

46
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,060
How is it, Your Majesty?

47
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,240
Isn't she elegant?

48
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,150
I'm getting up now.

49
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,030
You must sleep here tonight.

50
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,410
I was told she has a very good chance of getting pregnant tonight.

51
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,410
- You need to have a child as soon as—
- That's enough.

52
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,970
I don't want to hear anymore.

53
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't you know this is for the good of the imperial family?

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,430
For the good of the imperial family?

55
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,480
I thought you were different from the prime minister, but now I see

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,050
you are the same in the way you dismiss me!

57
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,720
You're not different one bit!

58
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,150
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

59
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,140
I can't give up like this.

60
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,560
Please get her ready

61
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,480
and take her to his bedroom.

62
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,540
Emperor Dowager!

63
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,170
What do you think will happen if the prime minister and the empress find out about what happened tonight?

64
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,540
There won't be another chance like this.

65
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,120
We only have tonight.

66
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,160
Understand?

67
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
I understand.

68
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,480
Your Majesty,

69
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,580
even your hair is so silky.

70
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,780
You're so beautiful.

71
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,330
Nothing I don't know.

72
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,140
Especially tonight, you seem to be glowing even more.

73
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,440
I think so, too.

74
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,600
Should I ask His Majesty to come?

75
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,450
Never mind. I'm going to bed tonight.

76
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,290
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

77
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,830
By keeping your distance like this,

78
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,270
what if he falls for another woman?

79
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,390
What are you talking about?

80
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,610
Is there a girl who's prettier than me here?

81
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,730
No, there isn't.

82
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,550
- But men's hearts--
- Men whose hearts are

83
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,560
easily changeable aren't interesting to me.

84
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,500
When they themselves act cheap, who will recognize their worth?

85
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,850
- But Your Majesty--
- Why are you so impatient?!

86
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,850
Just wait for a little,

87
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,010
you will get to see His Majesty

88
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,480
desperate to see me soon.

89
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,060
You said your name is Yang.

90
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,180
Yes.

91
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,180
Please help me a lot from now on.

92
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,570
While tired and lonely in a foreign land,

93
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,840
those from Goryeo at the very least

94
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,020
should trust and rely on each other.

95
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,560
We don't have much time. Is she almost ready?

96
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,690
Yes, Sir.

97
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,310
What are you doing?

98
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,530
My apologies, Your Majesty.

99
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,470
Get out.

100
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,440
- Your Majesty.
- What are you doing? Get out!

101
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,970
Please lie with her.

102
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,430
You can punish me for offending you.

103
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,270
Empress Dowager...

104
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,780
You...

105
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,170
being the puppet of the prime minister,

106
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,200
I cannot bear to see it anymore.

107
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,170
I have my own thoughts, too.

108
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,670
- Even if you don't do this--
- Having an heir not born of the empress

109
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,650
but by the royal concubine is the only way for you to fight against the prime minister.

110
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,890
Empress Dowager!

111
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,200
Think about

112
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,510
your late father and your late brother.

113
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,380
I am also the emperor's lowly servant...

114
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,330
If you want to have me killed right now, I will gladly accept it.

115
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,610
I put my life on the line,

116
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,890
so please don't refuse, Your Majesty.

117
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,620
Eojin, what are you doing? Lie with His Majesty.

118
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,970
Lead the way. What are you doing?

119
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,250
There's no need to feel anxious.

120
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,780
There will be plenty of opportunities when the emperor visits the Imperial Concubine's quarters.

121
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,630
I will be sure to live and come back for your sake.

122
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,290
You also must stay alive for my sake.

123
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,330
Your Majesty.

124
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,700
It's an order Seung Nyang. Do you understand?

125
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:30,110
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

126
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,460
It's the flag that represents you.

127
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,220
Only the winner

128
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,950
will receive this flag.

129
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,440
Begin.

130
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,380
Yes!

131
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,900
Yes!

132
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,560
Your Majesty!

133
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,230
Come to your senses!

134
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,380
Please regain strength!

135
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,010
Please!

136
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,250
Kill!

137
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,080
Kill!

138
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,080
Seung Nyang...

139
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,710
Your Majesty, did you forget the promise you made with me?

140
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,010
You must not give up.

141
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,870
I will also be sure to stay alive

142
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,030
and come to you again.

143
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,270
Focus yourself

144
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,150
and muster up your strength once more.

145
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,960
You are my only hope, Your Majesty.

146
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,610
Press on! More!

147
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,080
Smack that Yeom scum!

148
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,070
Your Majesty!

149
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,610
This is a sword fighting match. You cannot win by cheating and using underhanded methods!

150
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,010
Underhanded?

151
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,580
Give up already. You're the loser!

152
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,200
Shut up!

153
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,020
Bastard!

154
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,920
Look carefully.

155
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,760
There's iron inside this wooden sword!

156
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,400
What?

157
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,920
That bastard...

158
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:49,010
The underhanded one isn't me but Yeom Byeong Soo!

159
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,380
Kill Yeom Byeong Soo!

160
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,000
Kill him! Kill him!

161
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,860
Kill him!

162
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,330
Kill him! Kill him!

163
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,700
Kill me!

164
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,650
You are dying to kill me, aren't you?

165
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,280
Right?

166
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,370
But it's too bad.

167
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,320
You see, I am going to give up right now.

168
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,930
Here. I lost.

169
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,980
I give up. I give up.

170
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,570
Kill him! Kill him!

171
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,100
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

172
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,710
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

173
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,190
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

174
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,400
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

175
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,540
You're no better than an insect.

176
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:19,260
Give me the promised flag of the soldier.

177
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
Give it to him.

178
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,020
Yes!

179
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,160
Don't be mistaken.

180
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,120
I didn't fight for you.

181
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:05,340
I have a reason I must survive and go back.

182
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,500
So... I was only guarding my own life.

183
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,280
Even if I have become your commander,

184
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,940
I have nothing.

185
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,460
We are lacking weapons and we will be hungry,

186
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,790
but... I will fight to live

187
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:35,680
and in order to go back. I will win this war.

188
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,820
Because no one in this place

189
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,050
will protect our lives.

190
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,780
We have nothing more to lose.

191
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,720
Nothing more to fear.

192
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,040
This is hell.

193
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,850
Only those who want to kick open the door of hell and get out of here follow me.

194
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,400
Those who are underhanded and weak,

195
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,570
those who complain, I don't need.

196
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,030
I will follow you!

197
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,310
I will not be afraid of hell!

198
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,650
I will follow!

199
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,950
Please command us!

200
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,950
Please command us!

201
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,370
Please command us!

202
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,950
You want to work in the labor unit?

203
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,740
When I get a chance,

204
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,960
I will surely kill that deposed king myself.

205
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,870
You could die instead.

206
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,040
The weak Yeom Byeong Soo

207
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,050
has already died.

208
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,890
This one right here is another Yeom Byeong Soo!

209
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,530
Fine. I will back you.

210
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,040
Thank you, General.

211
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,840
These are all the weapons they've given to us?

212
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,420
Is this a joke? We'd get more to go hunting for pheasants.

213
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:32,120
Damn it! How are we to fight a war with this?

214
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,300
What's with all the complaints?

215
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,130
How dare you show your face here?

216
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,210
Watch your mouth!

217
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,140
From now on, he's the commanding officer of this unit.

218
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,970
What?

219
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:54,080
General Bayan has told our men to take the lead in every combat.

220
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:01,070
With these weapons? It'll be hard to barely survive.

221
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,090
Are you telling us to be the fodder for arrows?

222
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,790
A commander shouldn't be lacking such discipline.

223
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,040
We live and die by the orders given.

224
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,780
If he says to take the lead, you take the lead.

225
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,820
The Turks!

226
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,030
What's that?

227
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,470
He's the leader of the Turks, Baghatur.

228
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,690
Baghatur.

229
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,210
Why is he wearing that atrocious mask?

230
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,170
According to the rumors, he has deep scars on his face.

231
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,500
He must be brutal.

232
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,740
To a warrior, battle scars are marks of honor.

233
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,400
We shouldn't underestimate him.

234
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,290
- Choi Eon Yeon.
- Yes.

235
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:23,200
You clean the water area. Make sure it's spotless.

236
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,160
Yes, Sir.

237
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,970
- Lee Hong Dan.
- Yes.

238
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,280
You go with Ha Ni and clean the Court Lady's room.

239
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,800
Yes, Sir.

240
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,210
Ki Yang.

241
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,780
Yes, Sir.

242
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,830
You wash the blankets.

243
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,570
Yes, Sir.

244
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,140
Yang, have you heard?

245
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,110
Someone received the emperor's favor.

246
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,030
I'm not interested.

247
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,640
I heard she was a tribute girl.

248
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,170
How lucky for her.

249
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:12,360
Only time will tell if she's lucky or not.

250
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,480
What are you saying?

251
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,700
The rumor about your wedding night has already spread outside the palace.

252
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,680
Then there will also be a rumor soon that His Majesty is in the palm of my hands.

253
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,550
It's not time for you to be so confident. You need to have an heir soon.

254
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,760
Don't worry, Brother.

255
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:41,380
If I wish, I could have him wrapped up in my skirt right now.

256
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,010
This atmosphere is strange.

257
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,230
What do you mean?

258
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,060
I think they're talking about you.

259
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,010
Bring those girls.

260
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:29,370
You were definitely talking about the empress. Am I wrong?

261
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,220
Tell me the truth. What were you talking about?

262
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,830
- That's--
- Tell me now!

263
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,870
Your Majesty, spare me!

264
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,780
If you tell us, we'll let you live.

265
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,000
Someone... received...

266
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,180
His Majesty's favor.

267
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,440
Favor?

268
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,470
Did you... just say "favor?"

269
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

270
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,100
Your Majesty.

271
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,080
Who is it?

272
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,920
All I know is...

273
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,130
she's from Goryeo.

274
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,510
Bring me all the wenches from Goryeo!

275
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,810
She found out already?

276
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:24,450
Every girl from Goryeo, even the servants, have been taken to the hall, Empress Dowager.

277
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,290
I told you to be careful.

278
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,420
I think it's best to tell His Majesty.

279
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,760
There won't be a way to resolve this by him knowing.

280
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,240
It's a failure...

281
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,110
It was you.

282
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,070
Remove her from the palace right—

283
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,070
No.

284
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,040
Drag her away and kill her.

285
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,310
Your Majesty, for what reason?

286
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:41,390
Shut up. How dare you, a mere eunuch, speak to me!

287
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,490
What are you doing? Get rid of her this instant!

288
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

289
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,970
What's going on?

290
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,110
What is making you this upset?

291
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,100
What the reason is,

292
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,230
I believe you, who is on her side,

293
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,960
would know better.

294
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,530
Let her go.

295
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,210
- Drag her away.
- Let her go.

296
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,930
- I said drag her away.
- Empress!

297
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,310
My father...

298
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:26,490
Once he finds out, what then?

299
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,450
Getting rid of one tribute girl

300
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,870
won't be the end of it.

301
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,410
Drag her away from my sight right now!

302
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,110
But...

303
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,800
Is there a sign of pregnancy?

304
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,450
I think so.

305
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,530
Let go of her.

306
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,570
She is carrying the heir of the emperor.

307
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:23,060
It's like high treason to lay a hand on her, even if you're the empress.

308
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,040
Bring her to my room.

309
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,040
Welcome, Prime Minister. Please sit—

310
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,440
Is there something that's worrying you?

311
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,830
I heard you tried to have an heir through a tribute girl.

312
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,400
Your Majesty,

313
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:19,020
you haven't forgotten the promise you made in Goryeo, have you?

314
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,420
P-Please spare me.

315
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:28,100
P-Prime Minister, if you want me to be a fool, I will be a fool,

316
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,270
if you want me to be a coward, I will be a coward. If you want me to be a stone, I will be a stone.

317
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,390
If you want me to be a puppet,

318
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,000
I am a puppet.

319
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,860
So please...

320
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:45,160
please don't throw this poor person away, Prime Minister.

321
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,640
How could I have forgotten?

322
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,460
If you haven't, you're acting with contempt for me.

323
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,740
C-Contempt! That's not true!

324
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:08,640
The throne is harder to keep than obtain.

325
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,220
When you rise to it, you wear the golden crown, but when you come down, you'll have to give up your head. Got it?

326
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,580
O-Of course, I know.

327
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,970
I'm old.

328
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:25,740
Death doesn't scare me since I don't have many years left to live. So what do you think I have to fear?

329
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:31,070
Whoever bothers me, I will kill them all. People call it senility.

330
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,200
Do you want to see me senile?

331
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,820
I...

332
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,830
I-I'm sorry, Prime Minister.

333
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,040
E-Everything is due to my carelessness.

334
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,520
I-I'm sorry.

335
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:04,630
The moment Danashiri sheds a tear, blood will flow through this palace.

336
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,670
Don't ever forget it,

337
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,920
Your Majesty.

338
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,870
Your Majesty, you can't do this.

339
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,680
Your Majesty!

340
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,520
Your Majesty! Where are you going?

341
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,550
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

342
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,760
I can't breathe that I can't bear it!

343
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,620
- Your Majesty.
- I feel suffocated.

344
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,880
I want to go anywhere where I can breathe comfortably.

345
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,950
Your Majesty!

346
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,270
Your Majesty!

347
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,790
The girl who looks like Seung Nyang.

348
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,770
Your Majesty!

349
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,830
Your Majesty.

350
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,800
Can't do it now.

351
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,360
Your Majesty, you can't go out alone.

352
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,950
Tell this girl to bring out some tea.

353
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,950
Look at me.

354
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,510
Left.

355
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,110
Right.

356
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,190
By any chance, do you have a brother named Seung Nyang in Goryeo?

357
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,150
No.

358
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,960
That boy was even prettier than you.

359
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,050
Unlike his delicate looks, he was very strong and brave.

360
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,610
He was a skilled archer and rider.

361
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,010
We got along very well.

362
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,580
This is a chance from the heavens.

363
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,410
Stay like that.

364
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,630
I told you not to move.

365
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,550
This is what you're using as a hairpin?

366
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,020
Get rid of it.

367
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,020
Even if you're a servant, you can't wear such a thing in your hair.

368
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,480
Have this.

369
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,260
You look just like that boy, so I'm giving it to you.

370
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,920
Why aren't you accepting it?

371
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,370
Empress.

372
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,680
What are you doing here?

373
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,300
How dare you, a mere servant, face the emperor!

374
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,980
What are you doing right now?

375
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,360
I will take this wench and—

376
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,290
Stop it, I said!

377
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,560
A tribute girl wasn't enough that

378
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,660
now you're even extending your hand to the lowliest servant?

379
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,540
Why? Why don't you have all the girls in the entire palace?!

380
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,420
You're out of line.

381
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,430
How could you humiliate me like this?

382
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,400
I will tell my father everything!

383
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,260
Empress! Empress!

384
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,880
Archers!

385
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,020
Shoot!

386
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,260
Retreat!

387
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,910
Retreat to the hills!

388
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,300
What are they doing now?

389
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,490
They're retreating after feining an attack.

390
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:47,780
It's been five days already. I will not withstand it any longer.

391
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,930
Open the gates!

392
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,940
Retreat to the hills!

393
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,330
What strange scoundrels they are.

394
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:15,590
Why do they come every night raising a fuss but retreat when we attack?

395
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,200
Don't you know?

396
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,050
They realized that General Yeom Byeong Soo is standing guard.

397
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,820
General? Poop General, idiot.

398
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:30,250
But they advance from one direction and retreat to another.

399
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,850
It's a trick to hide their base.

400
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,730
We still haven't even figured out their headquarters.

401
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,370
That's the reason we're having so much difficulty with this war.

402
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:44,460
They know us, but we don't know them.

403
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,030
Hurry!

404
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,000
Don't dare to go further.

405
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,840
I will be sure to cut Baghatur's neck tonight!

406
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,340
I'll chase them all the way!

407
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,540
You cannot!

408
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,080
Why not?!

409
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,770
They know this area like the back of their hands.

410
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:23,170
Not only can we not catch them, but if we're ambushed, we're be annihilated.

411
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,220
It's been five days already!

412
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,910
Those bastards are mocking me!

413
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:32,120
Baghatur is making fools of us!

414
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:37,640
Please command them to retreat.

415
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,800
I'll kill all of them!

416
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,180
General, they are all asleep in the middle of the day, just as you expected.

417
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,900
A day attack, too?

418
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,460
Your Majesty!

419
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,220
How many casualties?

420
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,300
Over 100 are injured.

421
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,860
Those bastards... Is this why they were acting up every night?

422
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,720
This isn't the end.

423
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,860
They showed us that they can also attack in the day.

424
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,080
Then what they're after is...

425
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,640
They're trying to keep us from getting any sleep.

426
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,670
We have to be prepared for an attack not only at night but during the day, too.

427
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:03,160
So they're going to bother us night and day so it affects our fighting power?

428
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,530
Any news from our spies?

429
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,730
Spies?

430
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:10,170
In order to locate their base, we've sent out spies.

431
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,050
Then once we find that out—

432
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:16,380
We have a sufficient chance of winning.

433
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,220
We must take back control of the Silk Road.

434
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,360
We need to hold out until then, no matter what it takes.

435
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,580
We can't lose the Silk Road to Bayan.

436
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:32,740
For the sake of our future, we need to seize the Silk Road.

437
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,040
That's the reason I wanted to become commander of the slaves.

438
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,640
Are you thinking about working with the Turks?

439
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:45,770
I can't delay it any longer. Is it time to make the winning move?

440
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:51,050
But does that Baghatur bastard sleep at all?

441
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,780
I know. He shows up day and night. How is that possible?

442
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,010
He wears a mask.

443
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,910
I'm back.

444
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,040
The ambush

445
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,460
was a total success.

446
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,440
They don't know what we're really after. They're standing guard night and day.

447
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,820
They're not getting any sleep.

448
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,360
Are these the men?

449
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,630
Yes, as you ordered, I picked them especially from among the soldiers.

450
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,140
He worked as a spy.

451
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,450
So he has a special ability to scope out the region.

452
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:03,090
He was a well-renowned woodworker in Goryeo.

453
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,930
He's the best at working with wood.

454
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,770
He used to be a hunter.

455
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:12,140
He laid traps and dug up holes

456
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,820
and caught over 100 tigers.

457
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:24,820
From now on, we're going to prepare to fight the Turks.

458
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:35,200
Bang Shin Woo, make a map of the region where the Turks retreat to.

459
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,520
Not only the trails but brooks and rocks without missing any details.

460
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,780
Moo Song, you need to use wood and stone to make weapons.

461
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,360
We need our own secret weapons aside from the weapons we lack.

462
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,370
Please hurry!

463
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,700
Jeom Bak should install the secret weapons in the mountains.

464
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,190
It's no different than hunting tigers.

465
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,980
Predict where the enemy will land

466
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,260
and lay a trap in a precise location and dig up holes.

467
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,840
Park Bul Hwa will train the soldiers in sword fighting with the weapons provided.

468
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:17,390
Their numbers may be few, but we must make them into the best fighters.

469
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:23,130
We can't give Wang Yoo a chance to achieve victory.

470
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,980
Don't worry, General.

471
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,990
In the end, he will die by my hands.

472
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:37,970
That way, I will have my victory, too.

473
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,010
Yeom Byeong Soo, it will not turn out the way you wish.

474
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,500
I will no longer blame you.

475
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,790
So don't blame me after you're dead.

476
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:06,420
This is our destiny.

477
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,310
Follow me quietly.

478
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,790
I heard this from the tribute girls who were brought here with you.

479
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,620
That while disguised as a boy, you saved the life of the deposed king who was on the brink of death.

480
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,260
I'm not interested in your story.

481
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:57,820
There isn't a person here from Goryeo who doesn't have a deep wound in their hearts.

482
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:04,080
But if you kill the emperor,

483
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:11,460
all the people from Goryeo in this palace will die.

484
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,100
Whether they're tribute girls, servants, or eunuchs,

485
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:28,910
just because they're from Goryeo, they will be gruesomely massacred.

486
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:31,650
That's what the Imperial Palace is like.

487
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:37,590
There is no blood, tears, or mercy.

488
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:46,540
There were numerous people who I've wanted to kill when I was brought here, too.

489
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:52,380
But that's not what real revenge is.

490
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:04,930
Surviving until the end. Surviving anyway we can

491
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:09,040
and rising above those who hurt us this way,

492
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,630
that's real revenge.

493
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,040
This is the only time I'll ignore what happened.

494
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:33,610
If you do something rash again, I will point you out myself.

495
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,420
Your Majesty.

496
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,530
Your Majesty.

497
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,010
Have you forgotten that you're Goryeo's warrior?

498
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:14,070
What is the duty of the warrior? It's to protect the people!

499
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,740
Then...

500
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,000
who's going to avenge my parents' deaths?

501
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,580
They're trivial feelings.

502
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,990
Throw them out for our cause.

503
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:26,150
What exactly is that cause?

504
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:29,770
While having the enemy in my immediate vicinity,

505
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:32,630
I will not keep holding back like a fool anymore.

506
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:37,730
I will kill them and avenge my parents' deaths.

507
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:43,370
Will you really be able to ignore the deaths of the people of Goryeo?

508
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,830
That's not my business.

509
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,210
Your friends are among those, too.

510
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,000
I don't have any friends!

511
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,190
You're lying to yourself right now.

512
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,500
You're wrong.

513
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:00,450
Even if they die,

514
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:04,230
I will not blink an eye.

515
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:07,680
Other than getting my revenge on my enemies,

516
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,830
I don't care about anything else.

517
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,350
You can't, Seung Nyang.

518
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:15,330
Why do you only keep saying I can't?

519
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,960
My heart...

520
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,930
Why don't you see the despair in my heart?

521
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,750
Seung Nyang.

522
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,960
You're unfair.

523
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,370
Everyone is so unfair!

524
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,510
Seung Nyang, please don't go.

525
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,440
I missed you.

526
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:56,330
I really missed you.

527
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:20,120
Your Majesty.

528
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,260
Your Majesty!

529
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,770
Your Majesty!

530
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,800
Your Majesty!

531
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,010
Your Majesty!

532
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,640
Your Majesty...

533
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:48,160
Your Majesty.

534
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,890
Your Majesty.

535
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,220
Why are you breaking out in a cold sweat?

536
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,680
You're burning up.

537
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,800
I'm fine.

538
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,230
What do you mean fine? Hurry up and lie down. I'll get you some cold water.

539
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:09,860
I said I'm fine.

540
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:15,170
Do you know... what the saddest moment here is?

541
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:19,920
It's when you get sick. When you're sick...

542
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,400
there are too many people you miss.

543
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,560
You need to take care of your own health.

544
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,730
Wait a minute, all right?

545
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,690
You're here.

546
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:11,560
Baghatur, tonight, I will take your head.

547
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,120
Your Majesty.

548
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,580
Did you see? I hit the target!

549
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,830
I saw that you did, Your Majesty.

550
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:37,620
Ah, it would have been nice if Seung Nyang had seen it.

551
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,360
Your Majesty, the tea you ordered is here.

552
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,100
It's too bad, but something is better than nothing.

553
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,200
Just stay here for a moment.

554
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,910
Your Majesty, I can't even kill him...

555
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:58,660
What must I do now?

556
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:02,520
I miss you, Your Majesty.

557
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,310
Watch carefully how well I shoot.

558
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:14,930
The hand that holds the arrow should be stretched as if you are pushing a big mountain.

559
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:19,490
Your clasped hand should pull as if pulling a tiger's tail.

560
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:32,060
That's strange. I hit the target every time just a minute ago.

561
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,710
Let's try again.

562
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,760
Jeonchutaesan.

563
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,860
Huakhomi.

564
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:49,690
Your Majesty, I think you've tired yourself.

565
00:56:56,610 --> 00:57:01,490
You. Did you just laugh at me?

566
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,930
It's been a long time.

567
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,810
This is all your fault.

568
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:25,660
After you came, the shots aren't hitting the target.

569
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,800
Your Majesty.

570
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:31,990
Your Majesty? What do you mean?

571
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,450
Oh...

572
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:57,490
♫ You are the love wind. You blow in ♫

573
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:04,460
♫ You spread through my heart ♫
