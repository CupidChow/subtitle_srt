1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,910
Arrest Lady Ki as well as her servants and guards.

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,120
You must hold back.

3
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,130
- Take her away.
- Yes, Sir.

4
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,680
His Majesty the Emperor enters!

5
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,860
Your Majesty, have you recovered your strength?

6
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,040
Who are you daring to touch?

7
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,860
I am relieved to see that you are safe.

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,520
Lady Ki is a criminal.

9
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,760
A criminal? What crime did she commit?

10
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,230
The royal concubine did not protect the emperor, it is right for her to be punished.

11
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,590
Lady Ki saved my life.

12
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,180
She sucked the venom out with her own mouth and saved my life.

13
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,840
So please stop arguing about this.

14
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,280
Your Majesty!

15
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,350
Your Majesty...

16
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,520
Your Majesty!

17
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,160
He is burning up.

18
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,600
I will summon Head Eunuch Dok Man.

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,090
- Why won't you call the doctor?
- Please lower your voice.

20
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,020
It was His Majesty's command.

21
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,350
Because you could be put in further danger,

22
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,450
he ordered that we must not call the doctor even if he collapses again.

23
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,020
So he came to get me when he was so sick?

24
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,280
It must have been difficult to stand up at all.

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,020
Yet he ran to the Great Hall.

26
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,840
Your Majesty...

27
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,780
It's Yeon Bisoo.

28
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,640
Come in.

29
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,140
I saw that your clothes had blood on them when you returned.

30
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:47,600
It's medicine we used in my tribe. It works well for knife wounds.

31
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,340
Leave it and go.

32
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,130
It won't be easy to put the medicine on yourself.

33
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,740
Is Seung Nyang that person?

34
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,520
You previously told me that there was someone you longed for.

35
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,070
It's so long ago

36
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,750
I forgot about it all.

37
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,180
Your gaze didn't seem as if you'd forgotten.

38
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,740
On the hunting grounds...

39
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,180
It's very late at night, so turn in and sleep.

40
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,410
I plan to leave here before the sun rises.

41
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,860
I learned a lot while I was here.

42
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,870
Do you have somewhere to go?

43
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,550
I plan on approaching the leader of Hawk House.

44
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,620
Did you find out his identity?

45
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,400
I think I may find a clue.

46
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,350
What you are doing is dangerous.

47
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,820
Didn't Hawk House say they will sell you as a slave or kill you?

48
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't worry. I found a way.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,370
What is your plan?

50
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,210
So it is something dangerous.

51
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,440
Stay here.

52
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,910
I staked my life for the sake of my tribe.

53
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,510
No one can block my path.

54
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,050
Then take one of my subordinates.

55
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,480
It's all right.

56
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,650
We will meet again soon.

57
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,320
It's me, Maksaeng.

58
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,290
His Majesty asked me to protect you, Chief Yeon.

59
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,000
Do you think I am following you because I want to?

60
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,110
It's better you got me than nothing.

61
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,920
Wait for me!

62
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:35,730
♫ On that day the wind was blowing ♫

63
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,690
♫ On that day when the weather was so warm ♫

64
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:47,670
♫ Embraced in your arms, resting ♫

65
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:56,680
♫ And my image remains there, just like that ♫

66
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:03,650
♫ That day when I said I loved you until I wept ♫

67
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:11,370
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

68
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:19,160
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫

69
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,470
♫ Embrace me in your arms ♫

70
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:37,200
♫ If I could become the dust flying in the wind ♫

71
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,470
♫ If I could become the raindrops on your window ♫

72
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,560
♫ No matter where it is, as long as you are there ♫

73
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:56,610
♫ If I could go there I would give up everything I have ♫

74
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:04,370
♫ Even if we wept and it was our last moment ♫

75
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,590
♫ Let me stay in your arms ♫

76
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,520
♫ I stand alone in the darkness ♫

77
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:27,630
♫ Like a lost child my heart is frozen with fear ♫

78
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,560
Do you feel better, Your Majesty?

79
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,140
My Yang took care of me all night long.

80
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,580
How could I not feel good?

81
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,310
Summon Officer Bayan.

82
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,480
Why Officer Bayan, suddenly?

83
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,180
I will be issuing an imperial command.

84
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,610
Will Prime Minister keep his promise to save us?

85
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,070
Isn't he the only one we can trust right now?

86
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,130
Then, why haven't we heard anything?

87
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,080
How could I know that, you bastard?

88
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,110
If you don't, who would know, you bastard?

89
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,710
You bastard, how dare you?

90
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,320
Who cares? You're the one who got yourself kicked out from being an imperial guard.

91
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,550
You bastard, have you gone crazy?

92
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,880
- Just release those two guys.
- Yes, sir.

93
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,850
Why are you doing this?

94
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,880
So let's hear the truth.

95
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,320
I'd rather you killed me.

96
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,450
You two will die anyway.

97
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,690
The only difference is whether you are torn to death or boiled to death.

98
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,020
And the more you try to endure, the worse your suffering.

99
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,020
Do you still have more to find out?

100
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,090
I am only following His Majesty the Emperor's command.

101
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,910
Emperor, you said?

102
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,820
- Take these traitors away.
- Yes, Sir.

103
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:22,510
We have not finished questioning them.

104
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,730
I will execute them now.

105
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,980
They dared to try and assassinate the emperor. They cannot be allowed to live.

106
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,510
Execute these criminals in a public execution.

107
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,250
Yes, Father.

108
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,820
- Move.
- Yes, Sir.

109
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,970
General!

110
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,450
General...

111
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,340
Follow them and confirm it.

112
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,510
Yes, General.

113
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,990
Hey, Yeom Byeong Soo. Stop being ridiculous, I can't stand to see it.

114
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,080
Stop.

115
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,370
Put hoods on the criminals.

116
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,940
- Put hoods on their heads.
- Yes, Sir.

117
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,490
General! General!

118
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,200
You take care of the execution.

119
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,240
Yes, Brother. Let's go.

120
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,960
Yes, Sir.

121
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:07,200
We cannot entrust them with the execution of the traitors.

122
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,810
I will go and confirm it.

123
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,430
I really want to see Yeom Byeong Soo's death with my own two eyes.

124
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,000
Execute them.

125
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,660
- Follow me.
- Yes, General.

126
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,650
Where you two must go and what you must do is written inside.

127
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,910
It is a place that Prime Minister regards as important as his own life.

128
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,590
That is how important your upcoming duties are.

129
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,210
Yeom Byeong Soo will be in charge, so you support him well.

130
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,500
Yes. What?

131
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,500
Listen well.

132
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,940
No one must ever find out you two are alive, or the location you are going to.

133
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,530
- Yes, General.
- Yes, General.

134
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,710
Um... Captain.

135
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,660
How about you try talking back to me again?

136
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,530
I'm sorry.

137
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,050
Why? Where is that place?

138
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:30,280
If I do well, this is where my fate will change.

139
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,520
Sorry.

140
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,320
Is Hong Dan there?

141
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,490
Did you call me?

142
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,470
Tonight,

143
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,450
I will spend it with His Majesty.

144
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,310
Everyone leave the bed chambers.

145
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,480
If you look so pretty,

146
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,240
how can I read any books?

147
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,840
Please turn off the lights.

148
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,810
Let me do that.

149
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,350
So does this mean that

150
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,720
I no longer have to be in pain because of you?

151
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,520
You are the only one

152
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,910
who makes my heart flutter.

153
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,690
♫ That day when I said I loved you until I wept ♫

154
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:39,350
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

155
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:47,180
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫

156
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:53,380
♫ Embrace me in your arms ♫

157
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,000
These are the two largest factors helping El Temür maintain his power.

158
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,130
First is the enormous funds he receives from an unknown source.

159
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,050
The second is the military funded by those funds.

160
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,530
So what is it that you want to tell me?

161
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,140
I want you to take charge of the Capital Defense Force.

162
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:31,870
As long as there is the Capital Defense Force, no one can challenge El Temür in the palace.

163
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,110
What happened to your attempt to build up military forces?

164
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,910
We don't have enough funds, even the Imperial Family can't provide enough.

165
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,850
But if the Capital Defense Force can be maintained with the regular expenses of the palace

166
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,020
all our efforts will be in vain.

167
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:52,740
Capital Defense Force? You want to take charge of that?

168
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,610
Can't I?

169
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,400
It's not something that suits you. Why would you want it?

170
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,660
It contains troops that Prime Minister regards as most important.

171
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,810
Is that enough of an answer?

172
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,370
Even if you don't say that, I do not doubt your sincerity and loyalty.

173
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,860
Then you have no reason to refuse my request.

174
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,870
Then I must demote Won Jin, the current commander of the Capital Defense Force to captain.

175
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,070
- Father.
- How can you entrust the Capital Defense Force to Wang...

176
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,970
If that is your intention, how could I refuse?

177
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,060
Do a good job.

178
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,560
Thank you, Prime Minister.

179
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,150
What happened?

180
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,110
I received his permission.

181
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,080
He gave permission so easily?

182
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:00,260
That is strange. He is so suspicious of everyone. And he let you be in charge of the Capital Defense Force?

183
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,190
What happened to Commander Won Jin who was in charge?

184
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,190
He said he would demote Won Jin to captain.

185
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,980
So that was the reason he gave permission easily.

186
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,090
What do you mean?

187
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,460
Who is Won Jin? The honored elder of the Capital Defense Force.

188
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,890
Will the soldiers stand for it if he assumed command after pushing out their hero?

189
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,820
So the reason you gave permission to Wang Yoo...

190
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,390
He will face a big resistance and won't be able to last long.

191
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:45,020
And El Temür acknowledges that Commander Won Jin is very skilled.

192
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,240
If you have a conflict with him, El Temür will never take your side over his.

193
00:22:53,080 --> 00:23:00,070
Not only me, but the emperor and Lady Ki are alive thanks to you.

194
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,490
You can stop talking about that.

195
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,690
But Lady Ki does not know you are helping her behind the scenes.

196
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,410
What is your reason for hiding it?

197
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,250
If misunderstandings pile up, they can become loathing.

198
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,240
So if they loathe me, leave it alone.

199
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,770
The one who loathes, and the one who receives loathing,

200
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,370
sometimes that is the easiest thing for both parties.

201
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,750
But how can he do such a thing?

202
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,200
- You got into such trouble because of Wang Yoo—
- Hong Dan.

203
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,410
[Finance Office Financial Ledger]

204
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,880
Your Highness, Lady Ki has arrived!

205
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,080
Ask her to come in.

206
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,410
I am asking after your health, Empress Dowager.

207
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,070
Go ahead and sit.

208
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:00,730
You seem very tired, Empress Dowager.

209
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,970
I have had a headache lately, managing the palace finances.

210
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,090
I heard that things are difficult.

211
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:12,150
It's not just difficult, the finance office is about to shut down.

212
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,830
May I look at that ledger?

213
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,830
Our kingdom has seen famine for several years,

214
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,200
so our taxes have decreased severely.

215
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,750
A bigger reason is extravagance and debauchery.

216
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,980
The cost of the Imperial Palace annual events is 3 million nyang of gold.

217
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,520
Especially in Gondeok Palace where the empress lives,

218
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,720
a million nyang is being spent.

219
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,970
Perhaps we should minimize the size of palace celebrations for spring and harvest season,

220
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,550
and decrease the amount spent on clothing and food.

221
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,880
That way, I think we can spend at least a million nyang less than before.

222
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,000
You are very good with numbers.

223
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:15,090
When I lived in Goryeo, I spent my youth watching merchants at the market.

224
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,490
I will give you the seal for the finance office,

225
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,750
so how about managing the palace finances?

226
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,770
I am grateful, but that is not my task.

227
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,250
I'm not assigning this task to you permanently.

228
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:35,610
But the palace finances are a problem, so I'm asking you to try and fix it.

229
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,250
Her Highness the Empress Dowager enters!

230
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:57,620
Lady Ki will begin to manage the operational finances of the palace starting today.

231
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,500
- Your Highness...
- Your Highness...

232
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,840
Begin the meeting.

233
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,770
The palace finances are in a very difficult state.

234
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:24,120
Therefore, frugal and simple practices will begin in the inner court.

235
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,250
Everyone, please understand and comply.

236
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,620
Yes, Your Highness!

237
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:40,270
From now on, events in the inner court will be decreased in size or eliminated.

238
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,650
The making of new clothes will be suspended for the time being.

239
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:51,700
Instead, we will concentrate on mending clothes, and decrease clothing expenses.

240
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,660
The servants in the kitchen will avoid meat

241
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,260
and prepare simpler meals.

242
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,290
And the food portions will be decreased by half.

243
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:08,700
The department making snacks and drinks will determine the daily amount to be made.

244
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,040
And make sure there is no waste.

245
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,590
Servants who disobey will be given demerits and their wages will decrease.

246
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,050
You know what you did wrong, don't you?

247
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,740
So everyone please be mindful.

248
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,910
Why have you stopped bringing the food?

249
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,580
This is all of it.

250
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,510
What about meat? Why is it all just grass?

251
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,000
Hurry and capture the servants in the kitchen right now.

252
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,670
It is not their fault...

253
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,490
Lady Ki told them to do it.

254
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,790
Lady Ki?

255
00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:00,680
Yes, Your Majesty. She wants to be frugal about palace expenses.

256
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,120
She hasn't done enough? Now she's insulting me using food?

257
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,310
Your Majesty, food is not the problem right now.

258
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:13,020
On the list of next month's events, there is none to honor the imperial prince.

259
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,480
What? That bitch removed that from the schedule?

260
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,540
Who else would have done it? That wicked Ki bitch, of course.

261
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,630
She dares to cancel the Thousand Lights ceremony praying for my son's blessing and luck?

262
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,810
I will not let this bitch get away with it.

263
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,980
Why did you cancel the Thousand Lights ceremony?

264
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,460
There are thousands of people starving to death right outside this palace.

265
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,890
I asked you, why did you cancel the Thousand Lights ceremony?

266
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,050
The million nyang of gold that the ceremony would cost

267
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,200
could save the lives of tens of thousands of this kingdom's people, that is why.

268
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,970
Are you so envious of my son receiving the blessings of Buddha?

269
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,770
Do you know why the palace finances have become such a mess?

270
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:13,140
Because you took charge of the finance office and spent lavishly.

271
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,830
Shut that mouth, and restore the Thousand Lights ceremony.

272
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,590
- I cannot do that.
- You can't?

273
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:24,140
If you want it so badly, ask your wealthy family to pay for it.

274
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,970
Your Highness!

275
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,110
Please come to your senses, Your Highness.

276
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,230
Come to your senses, Your Highness.

277
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,720
I wish she would just die.

278
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,890
I feel like my 10-years-long indigestion was just cured.

279
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,820
What is wrong?

280
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,070
Is she seriously hurt?

281
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,100
No, it's not that...

282
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,370
What do you mean? Hurry and tell us.

283
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,710
She is pregnant.

284
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,580
Pregnant?

285
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,650
Yes, Your Majesty, she is definitely pregnant.

286
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,970
Is the baby healthy?

287
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,380
The baby is safe.

288
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,380
Emperor...

289
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,100
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

290
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,190
You made Lady Ki pass out?

291
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:51,790
Yes, Father. I grabbed her by the throat and threw her down.

292
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,380
Lady Ki is not that weak.

293
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,340
Don't you believe me?

294
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,420
Court Lady Seo, please tell them how awesome I was.

295
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,660
She was like a hellcat.

296
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,500
Your Majesty!

297
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,750
What's the fuss?

298
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,770
I was at the main palace...

299
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,810
Did that Ki bitch die or something?

300
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,170
She didn't die,

301
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,000
she is pregnant.

302
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,970
Pregnant? She is with child, you mean?

303
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

304
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,480
Is this a tonic that is good for pregnant women?

305
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

306
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,940
Your Majesty, how can you do that yourself?

307
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,000
How happy he is.

308
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,350
Have you awakened?

309
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:15,160
Be careful. Be careful.

310
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,960
I'm all right now.

311
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,150
But why would you bring me tonic?

312
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,720
Yang.

313
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,610
Has something happened?

314
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,600
We...

315
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,150
will have a baby.

316
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,560
Thank you, Yang.

317
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,300
Thank you.

318
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,430
Why are you making this complicated?

319
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:53,040
You're the one in charge of Capital Defense Force, Won Jin.

320
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,360
What could Wang Yoo do there, anyway?

321
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:01,850
Then you mean I can do whatever I want with him?

322
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,470
That's exactly what I want.

323
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:11,050
Be very harsh and make him run away on his own.

324
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:21,060
General, he has just arrived.

325
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:40,230
I welcome your appointment to the Capital Defense Force.

326
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,600
You are General Won Jin.

327
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,460
I know well of your successes in battle.

328
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:54,110
But why are the soldiers not offering proper greetings to their new commander?

329
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:59,360
The soldiers said they cannot accept the command of someone from Goryeo.

330
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,140
What kind of bullshit is that?

331
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:11,010
Everyone, hear this. Soldiers only act according to military discipline and commands.

332
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,720
They only obeyed the command of just one person for 10 years.

333
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,330
They will not accept the command of anyone else.

334
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:33,820
How do military rules deal with a soldier who disobeys a command?

335
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,770
They will be beheaded and their head hung at the camp gates.

336
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:43,340
Now I command you. I will be the one issuing all the commands from now on.

337
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,690
And they must follow my commands as if their lives depended on it.

338
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,390
Let the soldiers know that.

339
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,700
That is my command to you.

340
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:58,100
You must deliver my message without leaving out a single word.

341
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,310
Behead him.

342
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,310
Protect our general.

343
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,680
To cut my head off, you will need to cut all the heads off the entire Capital Defense Force.

344
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:29,420
As Prime Minister told me, your spirit is strong.

345
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,950
The Capital Defense Force is in good hands with you.

346
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,070
Just give me thorough reports.

347
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,790
But he was just appointed. Shouldn't you show him his office, at least?

348
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,940
Follow me.

349
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,900
Here... This is where all business is conducted—

350
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,240
What a nice welcome you gave us.

351
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,120
Let us return the favor.

352
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,050
You bastard.

353
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,420
You already disobeyed my command.

354
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,320
Got anything to say?

355
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:52,370
Then try beheading me and hanging my head on the gate.

356
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,670
If that is your wish.

357
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,200
General!

358
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,320
Don't touch them.

359
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,320
The moment you issue the wrong command, you lose your head.

360
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:18,310
Do you think you can have my soldiers this way?

361
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:23,880
I don't want any soldiers who won't obey my command.

362
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:32,710
Anyone who refuses to serve me can leave now.

363
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,610
This is your only chance. If you remain and disobey his command,

364
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,020
you will be beheaded according to military rule.

365
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,890
I think things are going wrong.

366
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,490
At this rate, not one soldier will remain.

367
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,910
You must stop them from leaving.

368
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,310
It's better this way.

369
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,150
Post signs recruiting soldiers.

370
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,000
No other qualifications are required

371
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,730
except a willingness to obey my command.

372
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:34,210
You will fill the Capital Defense Force with an undisciplined mob?

373
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,550
An imperial edict from His Majesty!

374
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:03,130
Lady Ki's temperament is generous and kind,

375
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:09,570
her conduct is proper, and she possesses superior wisdom. She has been a role model to all.

376
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:16,600
In addition, she carries the imperial child, a happy occasion to the palace and the kingdom.

377
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:22,690
So, Lady Ki is granted the title of Imperial Consort of the Third Rank.

378
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,480
Lady Ki will now accept the edict.

379
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,900
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

380
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,890
Lady Consort, we congratulate you on your pregnancy.

381
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,560
We congratulate you, Your Highness.

382
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,280
Maha, don't worry about a thing.

383
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,460
Even if that Ki bitch has a son,

384
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,920
you are the crown prince of this kingdom.

385
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,150
You will become the crown prince for sure.

386
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,620
His Majesty is really too much.

387
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:31,310
How can he never ask to see the imperial prince even once?

388
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,260
Your Majesty, His Majesty is coming.

389
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,140
His Majesty?

390
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:47,040
I should have held my tongue just one moment longer. Looks like I spoke too soon.

391
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,520
What brings you here without notice?

392
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,960
I was passing by and thought of something.

393
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,210
I see.

394
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:06,870
- Our Maha...
- I'm sure you know that Imperial Consort Ki is with child.

395
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:27,990
I am visiting because I am afraid that you will be jealous like when Lady Park was with child.

396
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:35,550
Maha and the child Consort Ki is carrying are both my children. So please,

397
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:38,070
get along with her harmoniously.

398
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:44,810
How can you leave without even holding Maha?

399
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:57,500
Never mind holding him, you didn't even look at him once.

400
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:03,110
How can you say that they are both your children?

401
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,820
I know you won't be so cold towards that Ki bitch's child.

402
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:11,010
You promoted her a whole two ranks to Imperial Consort.

403
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,830
Does that bitch conceiving a child make you so happy?

404
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,510
Is that bitch's child so precious to you?

405
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:23,360
Maha has many others who will hold him besides me.

406
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:30,650
He has great uncles and a grandfather who is sooo grand. But!

407
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,280
Yang's child has no one but me.

408
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,930
No one to hold him, no one to protect him.

409
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,050
There is only me.

410
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:46,010
Even if a boy is born,

411
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:50,110
don't think about making him the crown prince.

412
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:58,250
Already worrying about the power of a baby who hasn't yet been born?

413
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,990
I am warning you.

414
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,410
Maha is this kingdom's crown prince.

415
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:13,210
I feel sorry for you. You are so pitiful that I can't stand to look at you anymore.

416
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,180
Your Majesty, are you all right?

417
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,110
This way, Your Majesty.

418
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,080
Have some water.

419
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,410
Your Majesty...

420
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,160
Never mind.

421
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,220
Have you heard of

422
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,080
Gyeon-go-sul?
(T/N: A curse using a dog's spirit)

423
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,430
What is that?

424
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:24,300
It's a curse that could even kill a person.

425
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:30,090
So we can kill that Ki bitch with that curse?

426
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:34,260
I know of a very skilled practitioner of Gyeon-go-sul.

427
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,110
Want to meet with her?

428
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,620
There are things you should know before you do Gyeon-go-sul.

429
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:56,360
If the person dies due to the curse, that is fortunate.

430
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:02,300
But if it fails, the curse is returned to the person who set the curse.

431
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,220
Will you proceed anyway?

432
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,870
So does that happen from time to time?

433
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:16,250
It's quite rare. But if the cursed one has a strong spirit,

434
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,560
the curse may not work.

435
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,500
I don't care, so kill that Ki bitch.

436
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,580
First, I will need that person's time and date of birth.

437
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:33,710
Here it is.

438
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,880
Does she have a son?

439
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,780
She is currently pregnant.

440
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,990
What is it?

441
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:54,270
That child is destined to become emperor.

442
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:59,320
Hey, you should take a closer look.

443
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,310
Let me see your time and date of birth, Your Majesty.

444
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:17,360
How about it? Is my son destined to be an emperor as well?

445
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,320
You don't have a son.

446
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:25,970
What are you saying? The imperial prince exists for sure.

447
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,050
How odd.

448
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,880
Odd? What is odd?

449
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:42,060
We're not here to look at birthdates. Let's get on with the curse.

450
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,190
In order to curse someone,

451
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,750
there are a few things to prepare.

452
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,780
Please bring me the underwear of the one to be cursed.

453
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:16,260
After that, please bring me fresh dog's blood.

454
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:31,100
Once you're prepared, build an altar in a hidden area of the palace.

455
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,970
I will do anything if I can kill you.

456
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:47,270
Do you think I'm afraid of divine punishment?

457
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:51,140
Your Majesty.

458
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,050
I've brought her.

459
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,600
Let us begin now.

460
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,680
Your Highness? What's wrong?

461
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,600
Are you all right?

462
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:31,610
I think I had a nightmare.

463
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:37,570
Your Highness, you have a wound on your arm.

464
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,550
Once she is cursed, she will be tormented by nightmares every night.

465
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,330
If she cannot overcome the fear,

466
00:52:55,330 --> 00:53:00,310
she will eventually be unable to drink a drop of water and die of thirst.

467
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,490
How long does it take?

468
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:09,350
There are 30 talismans.

469
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,020
Burn one every night.

470
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:18,320
Before all those talismans are burned, she will die.

471
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,360
[Ki Yang]

472
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:45,420
Bury that nameplate in the front yard of the cursed one at "chuk-si." (1:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m.)

473
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,130
What is this?

474
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,080
The name of the cursed, for the grim reaper.

475
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:06,870
[Ki Yang]

476
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:36,530
Try eating some of that.

477
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,710
Why can't you eat a single bite?

478
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:46,010
I cannot swallow any food at all.

479
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:50,700
Your face doesn't look good. Are you ill anywhere?

480
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,840
You have that dream every night?

481
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,530
Yes. It's been three days.

482
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:06,670
I've become afraid to fall asleep every night.

483
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,200
And because I can't sleep, my body hurts.

484
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,380
I'm worried this may harm the child.

485
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,620
Do you have any wounds on your body, by any chance?

486
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,510
How did you know that?

487
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:25,720
If I'm correct, the wound will be a dog bite.

488
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,920
What is this?

489
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,130
Gyeon-go-sul.

490
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:38,280
Gyeon-go-sul?

491
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,170
I read about it before.

492
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:45,220
It's a curse using a dog spirit.

493
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:50,370
Empress Lü Zhi, wife of Emperor Gaozu of Han Dynasty is said to have died from this curse.

494
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:55,530
Do you know the way to undo this curse?

495
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,970
You must overcome it yourself, there is no other way.

496
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:04,480
And that is very rare.

497
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:15,610
If you win against the curse, the curse is turned to the one who cursed you.

498
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:20,650
Someone who would curse you, Your Highness...

499
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:27,880
Danashiri. There is no one but Danashiri.

500
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:39,380
A curse or a spirit. Come at me.

501
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,590
You can't make me collapse with a mere curse.

502
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:50,530
Danashiri, I am your curse.

503
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:54,080
I will return this to you.

504
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:02,590
♫ That day when I said I loved you until I wept ♫

505
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:10,250
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

506
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:14,300
♫ Even if I were to ache and it was our last moment ♫
