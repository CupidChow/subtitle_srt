1
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,170
There's only one candidate who passed this competition.

2
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,310
We made every effort for fairness,

3
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,670
so please accept the outcome and you are dismissed.

4
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,090
Head Eunuch Dok Man, take Yang and carry out her physical examination.

5
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,320
Yes, Your Highness.

6
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,620
Please come with me.

7
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,630
Where are you headed now?

8
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,160
We're on our way to do her physical examination.

9
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,150
Physical examination?

10
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,420
Are you saying she got picked to be an imperial concubine?

11
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,810
Please watch your words.

12
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,340
From now on, address her as "Your Highness."

13
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,360
Shall we?

14
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,030
She knows all our secrets.

15
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,210
What do we do?

16
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,250
I even shot an arrow to kill her.

17
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,720
How about if we tell the Prime Minister now and get rid of her?

18
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,490
Tell him what?

19
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,430
Tell him that we killed that wench Lady Park?

20
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,560
If the magistrates find out this fact, our father will be in deep trouble.

21
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,480
Our father won't let us off the hook either.

22
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,480
As long as Seung Nyang is in the imperial concubines' quarters, we are in danger, just the same.

23
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,210
Since Bayan said he'd keep quiet, we just need to take his word for it.

24
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,130
The physical examination will be carried out by me, Hong Dan,

25
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,650
and the court ladies from Goryeo.

26
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,690
So, you don't have to worry.

27
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,950
Thank you, Head Eunuch.

28
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,020
I serve you from now on.

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,360
Please drop the honorifics.

30
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,690
The empress is outside.

31
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,280
It was my mistake. I should have been more cautious.

32
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,630
I underestimated her.

33
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,510
We trusted Empress Dowager's promise.

34
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,150
We even went against the prime minister's will to

35
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,720
help Empress Dowager return to the palace. But the result is absurd.

36
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,660
Suddenly my daughter became less than a tributary girl from Goryeo.

37
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,350
This is an embarrassment to our family name.

38
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,140
Tell Empress Dowager that we are very disappointed.

39
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,490
Empress Dowager did her best.

40
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,600
There's nothing more to hear from you!

41
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,640
Let's go.

42
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,620
Let's.

43
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,800
The aftereffects of the imperial concubine selection are going to be bigger than expected.

44
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,790
We could lose them, too.

45
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,880
I heard El Temür invited them over tonight.

46
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,460
El Temür saw the magistrates' uprising before, so he'll take measures for sure.

47
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,250
El Temür's method will be one of the two.

48
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,770
Either remove them or keep them under his knees.

49
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,290
Father.

50
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,490
What did you just say?

51
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,490
I said to bring in more concubines.

52
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,590
Do you not know how hard I tried

53
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,810
to stop the concubine selection?

54
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,810
Bringing a few more concubines is nothing.

55
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,950
Father, you don't understand a woman's heart.

56
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,130
There won't be any more concubines—

57
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,160
Danashiri!

58
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,590
I am not talking about jealousy now but

59
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,800
I want to talk about politics.

60
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,040
What do you mean politics?

61
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,230
The selected concubines were daughters of the key magistrates in Yuan.

62
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,120
What about it?

63
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,490
I'm thinking about...

64
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,820
making the emperor step down.

65
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,000
Are you saying you are going to take away his emperor title?

66
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,640
If your son inherits the power, you'll end up being his political advisor.

67
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,090
You'd be the ruler of this country.

68
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,550
For that to happen, I must first bring the magistrates to my side.

69
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,360
How can the emperor's love compare when you can have such great power?

70
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,450
If you understood my words, discuss this with Empress Dowager at once

71
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,390
and make the concubines official.

72
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,150
Political advisor...

73
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,460
Imperial Concubines, accept His Majesty's written order.

74
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,090
Liaoyang Province's Ki

75
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,000
due to her wisdom and charms achieved a grade of merit.

76
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,590
So to Lady Ki, we offer the Imperial Concubine of 5th rank title.

77
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,030
Lady Ki, please accept the official document.

78
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:32,300
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

79
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,550
To Lady Oh of Yunnan Province, we offer the Imperial Concubine of 5th rank title.

80
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,540
Lady Oh, please accept the official document.

81
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,860
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

82
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,090
To Lady Bu of Lingbei Province...

83
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,610
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

84
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,750
To Lady Jeok of Shaanxi Province...

85
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,310
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

86
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,730
To Lady Seol of Sichuan Province...

87
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,400
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

88
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,100
Yang received the official document as an imperial concubine.

89
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:30,720
Dear late emperor, this lowly Bayan, to wipe away your tears,

90
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,810
has taken one step forward.

91
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,230
You wait and see.

92
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:43,460
I will bring the traitor El Temür's neck to you.

93
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,470
I ate well.

94
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,200
Farewell!

95
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,920
Which room is it?

96
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,220
The last room over there.

97
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,540
Your Majesty, why is Batoru, I mean, Yeon Bisoo here?

98
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:09,300
She is suspicious, so I think you should be cautious.

99
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,320
This is Yeon Bisoo.

100
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,530
May I come in?

101
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,060
Please come in.

102
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,550
Please accept my bow.

103
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,550
Don't bother. You don't have to.

104
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,040
This is like a dream, seeing you here.

105
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,960
I thought you'd be riding horses somewhere in the desert.

106
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,870
My tribe is already pulverized.

107
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,760
I met a western merchant and I opened a courtesan house with his help.

108
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,380
But what brought you here?

109
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:18,370
I heard that Bayan who was leading the army is now here as the magistrate.

110
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,400
I stopped by to see him.

111
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,830
Meeting here again after wielding swords at one another...

112
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,610
I guess we were fated after all.

113
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,920
I am thinking about getting a merchant caravan together.

114
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,670
I heard big merchants are gathering here.

115
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,400
Could you help me?

116
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:51,760
You saved my life. What would I hold back?

117
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,160
Watch Wang Yoo carefully.

118
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,180
Yes, Ma'am.

119
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,980
Seeing her dressed up like that, she's quite a beauty!

120
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,610
Get a hold of yourself.

121
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,320
Be cautious of your words and actions,

122
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,320
and don't allow any bandits to come here.

123
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,840
I understand.

124
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,490
No word from Moo Song?

125
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,340
You call yourself guards with this skill?

126
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,020
The more I see you, the more I like you.

127
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
Where did you learn martial arts?

128
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,820
I was an imperial guard at the palace but got kicked out.

129
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,550
That makes sense. I knew you weren't just anyone.

130
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,270
Why did you get kicked out?

131
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,470
Well, that is...

132
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,570
Did you get too close to a court lady?

133
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,070
Your features tell me that must have been the cause.

134
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,110
Welcome. Please come in.

135
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,200
The counterfeit currency is arriving today.

136
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,230
How much did they promise us?

137
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,410
They said at least 30,000.

138
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,280
After Bayan arrived, security's been tighter.

139
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,770
We'll go to the outskirts of town,

140
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,590
so send the messenger pigeon to meet us at Maebawi.

141
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,490
I'll do that.

142
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,160
And the signal?

143
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,210
I think an arrow would be good.

144
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,470
Who's there?

145
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,110
What's the matter?

146
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,950
Someone was listening to us. Search everywhere and—

147
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,670
Wait a second.

148
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,270
It must have been his doing.

149
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,450
He must have come in this far because the leash broke.

150
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,980
Everyone, stay outside.

151
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,630
Yes, Sir.

152
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,700
Oh, thank you. You will be blessed!

153
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,970
Thank you!

154
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,610
It's so cold. Why did you take off your top?

155
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,310
Be quiet.

156
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,940
They're coming!

157
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,970
Get ready! You're blind!

158
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,970
Blind, right.

159
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,200
Oh, please just a little.

160
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,030
Please spare us a little.

161
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,670
Please, we need help.

162
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,160
Just a little, please.

163
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,150
Please, Sir.

164
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,810
Please, Sir, just once.

165
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,380
Oh, thank you, Sir. You'll be blessed!

166
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,730
You'll be blessed!

167
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,850
Thank you, Sir!

168
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,380
Thank you!

169
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,140
Thank you! Thank you!

170
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,790
What does it say?

171
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,600
The counterfeit currency is arriving tonight.

172
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,220
How much time left until Heuksoo is coming out to meet them?

173
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,550
It said Ja-si (11:30 p.m.to 1:30 a.m.) on the letter, so we have just under an hour left.

174
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,020
Let's get it done quickly and leave.

175
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,100
Give me the bow and arrow.

176
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,200
Put the weapons away.

177
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,050
It's safe for you to come out.

178
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,690
We were supposed to meet at Maebawi. You came early.

179
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,300
Did you bring the counterfeit currency?

180
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,160
Of course.

181
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,070
Bring it.

182
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,090
This time, you really can't tell the difference between real and fake.

183
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,240
They came out very well.

184
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,090
Good job.

185
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:41,780
♫ Carried on the wind, you are heard ♫

186
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:49,760
♫ Ceaselessly falling Drip Drip Drip ♫

187
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,850
♫ In the sound of the rain for a long time after ♫

188
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:06,380
♫ Even if I wander and am lost, it is you, it is you again. ♫

189
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,190
Put our girls into the imperial concubines' quarters.

190
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,610
You have to keep an eye on those wenches at all hours of the day.

191
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,120
I've already done so.

192
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:26,840
Just wait and see. I will be very harsh on how I teach them as imperial concubines.

193
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,610
But, Your Majesty,

194
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:36,660
tonight, the emperor will be spending the night with one of the girls chosen.

195
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,030
He's not even well. I doubt he would do that.

196
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,310
Congratulation on entering the Imperial Concubines' Quarters.

197
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,310
Congratulations, Your Highness.

198
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:49,120
Take these girls away and bring girls from Goryeo.

199
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,080
That's not possible.

200
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,410
Head Eunuch Dok Man told me to do so.

201
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,350
These girls were hand-picked by the empress.

202
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,600
Please leave us.

203
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,630
Don't leave.

204
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,380
Didn't you hear me tell you to leave?

205
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,560
Anyone who leaves will be punished.

206
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,310
You may leave now.

207
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,670
The empress has ordered for me to oversee everything here for now.

208
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,010
Just think of my word as that of the empress's

209
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,620
and let your anger subside, Your Highness.

210
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,400
By the way, one of the imperial concubines will be going to the Imperial Quarters tonight.

211
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,500
Just in case, you might want to think about putting on some blush or something.

212
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:01,110
Tonight is a set date to sleep together.

213
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,920
If you don't feel well, you don't have to carry on with it tonight.

214
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,410
Yes, I think it's best that you don't tonight.

215
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,940
His Majesty will follow protocol.

216
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,760
Is that so?

217
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,280
Then... I liked Lady Oh.

218
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,780
How about Lady Ki?

219
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,830
Lady Ki?

220
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:38,250
She used to be a court lady in the Imperial Quarters, so His Majesty may be the most comfortable with her.

221
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,950
Would Lady Ki suit you?

222
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,540
Yes.

223
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,230
Tell Lady Ki to prepare herself.

224
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,200
Yes, Your Highness.

225
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,710
It's Dok Man.

226
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,430
C-Come in.

227
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,310
Deputy Commander Park!

228
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,380
Yo-You were...

229
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,870
You were alive?

230
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:54,100
From now on, he's the eunuch who will serve you.

231
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,070
Eunuch?

232
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,610
Please accept my greetings first.

233
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:18,220
Commander Ki didn't take me this time so that I could protect you.

234
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,820
Now that I've been reborn, I will give my life to you.

235
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,410
Deputy Commander Park...

236
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,700
You will need to get ready, Your Highness.

237
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,100
The emperor chose you for tonight.

238
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,130
Your Majesty, Lady Ki is here.

239
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,590
Y-Yang...

240
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,050
Please send the people outside away.

241
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,240
Everyone, leave.

242
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,650
You're beautiful.

243
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,140
Are you still lacking confidence?

244
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,680
Are you talking about that again?

245
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,480
I came to talk to you about that.

246
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,490
I can't stand seeing innocent lives being lost because of me anymore.

247
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:44,800
Your reasoning for running away is too childish and cowardly.

248
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,810
Do you know why I came back here?

249
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:01,290
Staying alive alone was too shameless.

250
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:08,980
I came back in order to ask for forgiveness from those who lost their lives because of me.

251
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:20,610
But you're trying to save only your own life with inadequacy as an excuse.

252
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,160
Prime Minister is planning my abdication.

253
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,040
Do you know why he allowed the royal concubine selection?

254
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,370
By placing the daughters of the magistrates in the palace,

255
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,790
he's going to threaten the lives of anyone who opposes the abdication.

256
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,330
Before Prime Minister sheds any more blood in the palace,

257
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,610
I'm planning to announce the abdication myself.

258
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:51,140
Therefore, I am keeping my mouth shut like this.

259
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,170
If I alone become a fool,

260
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,090
if I alone give up my throne,

261
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:04,080
a blood bath in the palace won't be necessary.

262
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,390
What is this?

263
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,550
Read it.

264
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,540
Bloodletter...

265
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,050
The butterfly picture...

266
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,250
Father...

267
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,020
I am sure this is from my father.

268
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,860
Father...

269
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,520
What does it say here?

270
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,320
Read it yourself.

271
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:20,720
Your father is speaking to you by shedding his blood.

272
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,970
If you are to understand the meaning of it, you must study and read it yourself.

273
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,420
Your eyes will open up to the world.

274
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,730
Once you know about the world, people will rally around you.

275
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,880
And once they gather,

276
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,430
you must retrieve the royal seal that El Temur took from you.

277
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,790
After that,

278
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,630
feel free to show your anger.

279
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:57,100
All of this... I will help you with.

280
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,550
What did you just say?!

281
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,890
The emperor was with that wench Yang all night?

282
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

283
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,450
He came to my room like a cow being led to slaughter.

284
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,990
But he sleeps together with a royal concubine on the first night?

285
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:32,920
That arrogant thing has now even received His Majesty's favor.

286
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,180
She will act up, unafraid of anything.

287
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,860
- Court Lady Yeon.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yang...

288
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,470
No.

289
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:48,420
I'll have to ruin all the imperial concubines' faces. Then His Majesty will no longer want to see them.

290
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,070
I understand what you mean, Your Majesty.

291
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,110
Your Highness, I brought your face wash water.

292
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,590
The smell is nice.

293
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,880
- What kind of water is this?
- It's iris water that's good for your skin.

294
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,600
Ruining a royal concubine's face is the most

295
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,280
common tactic used by the inner court.

296
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,960
This is marigold.

297
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,080
This is Liliaceae plant.

298
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,440
Lastly, this is Leopard plant.

299
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,640
They each have a great scent,

300
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,660
but if you juice them and apply them to the skin, they cause rashes.

301
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,860
Here, smell it.

302
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,910
It's Liliaceae plant.

303
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,820
Come closer.

304
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,780
Why are you so scared about some

305
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,150
iris water on your skin?

306
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,750
Wicked wench...

307
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,800
So she wants to put up a fight, huh?

308
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,060
Have you already eaten?

309
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,720
No, not yet.

310
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,710
You're working hard.

311
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,190
Here, have some.

312
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,800
It's all right.

313
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,540
I used to be a palace maid, so I know what it's like to be hungry.

314
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,310
Here.

315
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,080
I'm not hungry.

316
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,030
Are you ignoring my sincerity?

317
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,690
Your Highness...

318
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,920
Seeing how you continue to refuse it,

319
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,770
it means you already know what's in this food.

320
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,180
If you don't finish eating all this up,

321
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,040
I will have you punished for daring to insult me.

322
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,940
The palace maids are saying they can't withstand it any longer.

323
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,610
It seems we can't leave it up to just the palace maids anymore.

324
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,650
How interesting...

325
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:47,560
I'll have to enjoy that wench properly...

326
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,800
But you can't reprimand her without a valid reason...

327
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,130
- Court Lady Yeon, you do as I ask.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

328
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,050
It's time for you to enter the hall.

329
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,760
Don't laugh like that.

330
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,330
Huh?

331
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,590
I will rip your mouths.

332
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:54,100
What? Her face looks fine.

333
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,230
Even her face is so toxic.

334
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,460
What is all that in your hair?

335
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:17,470
Haven't your maids told you?

336
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,500
- About what?
- The empress—

337
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,360
Her Majesty the Empress enters.

338
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,740
How dare you, you wench!

339
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,080
Undress this wench right now.

340
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,930
- Why are you doing this, Your Majesty?
- Today is my mother's death memorial.

341
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,500
I told everyone to not wear any ornaments.

342
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,820
- You dare to disobey my command?
- I

343
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,660
- was never told.
- Shut up.

344
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,250
How dare you insult me and dishonor my mother?

345
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,130
Bring the whip.

346
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:27,010
I had heard that your conduct was unbecoming.

347
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,030
But I didn't know you were this arrogant.

348
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,270
Grit your teeth.

349
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,480
Stop. You got that cut off!

350
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,300
Do you want your head cut off, too?

351
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,690
What did you just say right now?

352
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,290
Lady Ki is getting a beating?

353
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,920
Her Majesty the Empress is very infuriated.

354
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,400
- Where are they?
- At the pavilion for their morning meeting.

355
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,340
- You must not go.
- Yang is getting beaten right now.

356
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,140
Your Majesty, you are suffering from aphasia right now.

357
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,010
What can you do even if you go?

358
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,720
This toxic wench.

359
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,020
Not only won't she scream, but her breathing is also still steady.

360
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,420
She is as toxic as the rumors say.

361
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,270
My words are...

362
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,570
the law and the rule of this domain.

363
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:21,600
Whoever disobeys my command will be harshly judged.

364
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,640
So know that well.

365
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,410
Everyone leave now.

366
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,770
What kind of place this inner palace is,

367
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,690
do you understand now?

368
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,140
For teaching me a good lesson,

369
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:57,140
your grace is immeasurable, Your Imperial Majesty.

370
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,480
Your words...

371
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,360
still have bite, somehow.

372
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,990
I am keeping my eyes on you.

373
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,920
Conduct yourself accordingly.

374
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,060
Your Highness.

375
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,070
Please give me my clothes.

376
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,840
Take her to her quarters.

377
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:09,980
Sergeant Bayan requests to meet with you briefly.

378
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,390
Did you show tears in front of the empress?

379
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,920
There are no tears left in me at all.

380
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,590
When the enemy sees tears they become more vicious

381
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,090
then when they see blood.

382
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:37,150
The person that I, Bayan, chose must not do something to make the enemy happy, can she?

383
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,210
I have developed a strange habit.

384
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,450
Suffering and sadness mean nothing to me

385
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,600
but I can't endure unfairness.

386
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,020
So I cannot endure this.

387
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,200
I won't endure it

388
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,500
and I won't live being treated unfairly anymore.

389
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,710
The moment that feels most unfair to me is when my self-worth is broken.

390
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,230
So don't ever break.

391
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:17,630
Because you are my last shred of self-worth.

392
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,330
Be still.

393
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,900
I am all right now.

394
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:14,230
I was happy to see you again,

395
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,070
but I was sad because I knew that a day like this would come.

396
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:22,000
I cannot provide you with any support.

397
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,150
It doesn't matter.

398
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,890
I came to become your support.

399
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,470
I am not all right.

400
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,030
My heart hurts so much.

401
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:39,480
Do you really think that you cannot give any support to me?

402
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,160
I am a puppet emperor, nothing more.

403
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:48,050
I am the world's biggest idiot.

404
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,060
Please come to the pavilion tomorrow.

405
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:58,690
You will see what support you can give to me.

406
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,940
- Did you see?
- I did.

407
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,250
- It was great.
- I thought that, too.

408
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,770
Really?

409
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,270
Lady Ki is looking for you.

410
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,080
Follow me.

411
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,210
The empress's command that we not wear ornaments,

412
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:35,190
you did not convey it to me.

413
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:40,110
Not to mention, you put more ornaments on me than even for a celebration.

414
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,500
Who told you to do that?

415
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,150
We don't know what you are talking about at all.

416
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,040
You don't know?

417
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,580
Your Highness.

418
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,710
You have not committed any sins.

419
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:02,630
You were ordered by those above you, you had no choice.

420
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:10,560
However, by saying that you did not know, you did commit a sin after all.

421
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,730
The sin of lying.

422
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,700
We serve the empress.

423
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,620
If you dare to touch us, the empress... ah!

424
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,550
Please save us, Your Highness.

425
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:35,270
It's too late to show mercy.

426
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,810
Court Lady Yeon told us to do it.

427
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,280
Yeon Hwa?

428
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:48,070
Yes, Your Highness, she told us to do it. We couldn't disobey her...

429
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,380
So make a choice.

430
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,810
Do you want to die by my hands right here

431
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:59,870
or tell this truth to the empress?

432
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:03,370
Yes. We will tell her the truth.

433
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,860
Please just save us.

434
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:15,550
Do not misbehave again while trusting the empress.

435
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:19,820
The emperor is behind me.

436
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,080
Yes, we understand.

437
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,160
Are you being lazy? Can't you do it satisfyingly?

438
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,010
Yes, My Lady.

439
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,000
What are you doing? You may be a concubine—

440
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:02,410
Your evil deeds will be revealed in the pavilion.

441
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,800
What is His Majesty doing in the pavilion?

442
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,980
Since he cannot speak, we don't know.

443
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,830
But he suddenly came here while talking a walk.

444
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,050
You wench—

445
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,680
How dare you arrive late to the morning meeting? Are you in your right mind?

446
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:44,070
My conduct toward you last time was disrespectful, Your Majesty.

447
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:48,000
Why... bring that up all of a sudden?

448
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,610
Court Lady Yeon is the one who caused me to be blamed unfairly.

449
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:04,320
It's not true, Your Majesty. Lady Ki is just throwing a fit.

450
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:11,380
You may speak now. Who was the one who told you to put ornaments in my hair?

451
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:21,930
Hurry and tell the truth. Who told you to do that?

452
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,660
Yes.

453
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,080
It was Court Lady Yeon.

454
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:48,090
I have already forgotten about that.

455
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:51,730
How dare you bring that up again and upset me?

456
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:56,890
Court Lady Yeon caused a rift between you and the concubines.

457
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:03,050
Breaking the harmony of the inner court is an unforgivable offense, isn't it?

458
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:09,530
If rewards and punishments are not clear, no one will respect or obey the empress's commands.

459
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:14,190
You must flog Court Lady Yeon 20 times

460
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:20,770
and show us your dignity as the leader of the inner court.

461
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,130
Do... as Lady Ki says.

462
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,200
Oh! Your Majesty!

463
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,710
Is there even any space on her backside to whip?

464
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:23,290
Do you like Court Lady Yeon?

465
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,970
How dare you?

466
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:31,240
Romance with a court lady? So I can get killed?

467
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:58,440
Just your presence gave me so much strength.

468
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,980
Please don't say that you are incompetent ever again.

469
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,620
Did you find it?

470
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,530
You did well, Big Brother.

471
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:07,490
Where is His Majesty?

472
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:16,400
You seem especially lonely today.

473
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,030
Doesn't everyone

474
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,270
have such days?

475
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,630
When you miss someone

476
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,840
very much

477
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,610
or think of them?

478
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,760
Who that may be,

479
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:37,290
can you tell me?

480
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:40,870
I don't really

481
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,100
want to talk about it.

482
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,880
You can leave for today.

483
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,030
Thank you for drinking with me.

484
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:11,480
Then please rest comfortably.

485
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,220
Come now, Big Brother.

486
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,600
That guy is a bodyguard.

487
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:48,570
Then the ones who stole the counterfeit money...

488
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,650
This is definitely what we were looking for.

489
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,570
Records of the counterfeit money

490
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,360
and transactions, too.

491
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,820
Tomorrow,

492
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:11,290
there will be another transaction of the counterfeit money.

493
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:24,350
With just one word from me, Wang Yoo will die.

494
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,080
He will die...

495
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,940
Welcome.

496
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:46,850
In order to catch a rat in the middle of the night,

497
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:50,280
I left a little door open.

498
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,450
And you know, a little rat

499
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:57,660
came through that door on his own.

500
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,950
Can you guess who it was?

501
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:06,000
That guy named Choi, who came as a new bodyguard.

502
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:11,930
He is the spy for the ones who killed Hong and stole the counterfeit money.

503
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:16,620
And that rat took the fake ledger.

504
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:20,770
So tomorrow night to steal more counterfeit money

505
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:25,150
that horde of rats will show up.

506
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:27,320
What do you plan to do?

507
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,670
Kill them all, of course.

508
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:36,600
Kill that Choi and the rest of the trash

509
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,600
will have to be swept away, too.

510
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,390
Where did you go so late at night?

511
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,940
Was there some reason?

512
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:11,430
Or something you want to tell me?

513
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,630
In the end, they could not endure that Ki wench

514
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:23,130
and all the palace maids you put in her quarters ran away.

515
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:28,140
So the Goryeo wenches have gone in there as the maids.

516
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:33,080
- Yeon Hwa?
- Her flesh is torn, she can't even walk.

517
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:37,500
Since that wench dared to pick a fight with me,

518
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:41,080
I have no choice but to see this to the end.

519
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:55,650
It's the calming decoction that you drank before.

520
00:56:55,650 --> 00:57:00,540
I had it specially made for you to make up for the last time.

521
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:05,450
- So drink it well.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

522
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,530
Why won't you drink it?

523
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,250
Do you suspect me, by any chance?

524
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,910
Drink it.

525
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,040
Hurry!

526
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:07,860
♫ Carried on the wind, you are heard ♫

527
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:12,160
♫ Ceaselessly falling ♫

528
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,810
♫ Drip Drip Drip ♫

529
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:18,260
♫ In the sound of the rain ♫
