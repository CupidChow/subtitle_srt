1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,250
Emperor Mingzong's lament was buried in the ground

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,700
as El Temür's laughter pierced the sky.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,480
The day the Emperor's letter written in blood is revealed,

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,090
Heaven and Earth shall fill with rage and the winds will fill with blood.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,970
Who is it?

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:30,250
Who did this? Who dares to challenge me, El Temür?

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,500
Get them!

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,480
Block him!

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,160
Get him!

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,970
I had no idea you would come to watch kickball, Prime Minister.

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:59,400
That document came through the imperial office, so it has to be someone near me.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:06,680
Those two? They may be brave, but they aren't capable of that yet.

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,980
He doesn't have the character to do that.

14
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,480
And it's definitely not Wang Yoo.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,270
Then... maybe...

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:28,250
The only one who is capable of matching me is Empress Dowager, but this isn't the way she does things.

17
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:35,310
She may plan a secret conspiracy, but she would never show her hand like this.

18
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,710
I don't know.

19
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,670
I just don't know.

20
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,430
Your Majesty!

21
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,620
[2 to 1]

22
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,510
[2 to 2]

23
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,730
If I win, you must never look at Seung Nyang ever again.

24
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,550
And if I win, you have to let Seung Nyang leave this palace.

25
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,610
No, you don't get to demand anything regarding Seung Nyang.

26
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,130
How is that fair?

27
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,140
My words are the law.

28
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,080
Block him!

29
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,050
Go!

30
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,620
Oh, dear!

31
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,540
Your Majesty!

32
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,750
Your Majesty!

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,030
Your Majesty...

34
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,640
He was out with just one blow.

35
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,390
Your Majesty... Your Majesty.

36
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,550
Detain everyone who manages the petitions.

37
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,180
What?

38
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,810
Careful! Careful!

39
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,060
How is he?

40
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,830
We'll know when the doctor gets here, but it doesn't appear that he is seriously injured.

41
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,480
He should wake up soon, right?

42
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,790
Yes, Your Majesty. Please don't worry too much.

43
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,610
Just what is going on?

44
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,450
Tell the truth.

45
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,570
How did this petition get delivered to the imperial office?

46
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:54,120
I swear to the heavens that we really do not know.

47
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,760
Lord Jang.

48
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,420
All I did was deliver the petitions that I received. How would I dare to include such a foul petition?

49
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,290
You can kill these men.

50
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,830
Rip their flesh until they tell the truth.

51
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,600
Yes, Sir!

52
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,750
How is His Majesty doing?

53
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,570
He just woke up.

54
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,790
I was too careless. I should have been more careful.

55
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,100
It seemed to me that you were purposely aiming at his royal countenance.

56
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,790
It's just how I perceived it, that's all.

57
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:42,380
Your expression and attitude seemed like someone angered, someone with a grudge.

58
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,860
Did you look at my face that closely?

59
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,560
I heard that His Majesty suggested the game first.

60
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,540
Since it happened during the game, don't worry about it too much.

61
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,080
Thank you, Your Imperial Highness.

62
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,820
About now, the prime minister's fury is piercing the sky.

63
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,220
You've done well, Eunuch Bang.

64
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,940
Yes.

65
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,230
The red ink used in writing talismans was used.

66
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,490
And the handwriting is difficult to identify, so they wrote it with their opposing hand,

67
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,840
or asked an illiterate person to write it.

68
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,910
This petition was brought right to the imperial office.

69
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:52,980
He is showing me that he can put a blade in my neck at any time.

70
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,120
He is nearby,

71
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,220
watching and mocking me.

72
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,920
But does the letter written in blood really exist?

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,010
When Emperor Mingzong died, there must have been those who were close to him.

74
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,060
Once I learned about the letter written in blood,

75
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,120
I killed all the servants and eunuchs who were caring for him.

76
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,390
But... I never found the body of one man.

77
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,960
Who was he?

78
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,630
The eunuch who was the emperor's personal guard.

79
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,910
Please tell us what you know about him.

80
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,460
His name was Jeok Ho. A very skilled martial artist.

81
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,780
Anything else about him? About his family?

82
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,880
He was from Goryeo.

83
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,270
So tell us, what information did you learn?

84
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:49,500
The plague I got came from the corpse who was the Captain of the Imperial Guard.

85
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,920
What would that mean?

86
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,750
So someone killed the Captain of the Imperial Guard and threw him in the Goryeo Village.

87
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,120
But someone brought that body to the palace.

88
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,990
There is a possibility that the Captain of the Imperial Guard's body came from Goryeo Village.

89
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,810
Is that true?

90
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,230
Yeom Byeong Soo touched that body and got the plague that is going around Goryeo Village.

91
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,440
Search Goryeo Village. I'm sure there is a clue to the bloodletter.

92
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,830
Your Majesty, your face looks terrible.

93
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,810
Please put this ointment on your face.

94
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,870
I said it's bothersome. Get out.

95
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,820
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

96
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,690
Oh, get out already! Get out!

97
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,440
Get out!

98
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,690
Get out, get out, get out!

99
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

100
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,380
Yang, you stay here.

101
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,450
You put the ointment on him. He will listen to you.

102
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,660
Gently.

103
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,630
Put on the ointment.

104
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,370
If you don't want to, I'll leave now.

105
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,600
Wait, wait...

106
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,390
Did you enjoy it?

107
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,790
Did seeing this happen to me make you happy?

108
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,410
How could that be true?

109
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,950
You wanted me to lose.

110
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,510
I saw you cheer Wang Yoo on.

111
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,640
That is why this happened— Ouch!

112
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,460
That hurts. Be gentle.

113
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,360
You are picking a fight for no reason.

114
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,610
Then did you... want me to win?

115
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,330
If you move, it makes it harder to put the ointment on.

116
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,800
Even if you don't mean it, say you rooted for me,

117
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,570
that you wanted me to win. Can't you even say it?

118
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,520
Yes, I hoped you would win, Your Majesty.

119
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,610
Happy now?

120
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,360
Yes.

121
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,650
Put that away.

122
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,400
My whole body hurts now.

123
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,500
Here, massage my legs.

124
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,020
What are you doing, not massaging them?

125
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,020
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager is here.

126
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,040
Ask her to enter!

127
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,630
You leave.

128
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,230
I just met with Lord Jang.

129
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,850
He said Prime Minister El Temür is out of his mind because of a petition.

130
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,990
A petition?

131
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,720
Your Majesty, listen well to what I tell you.

132
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,850
Your father, the late Emperor Mingzong did not die of acute indigestion.

133
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,890
Yes, I know that, too.

134
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,540
It's possible that the world we hope for may arrive sooner.

135
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,010
What do you mean?

136
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,250
If we can only find that letter written in blood,

137
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,150
Prime Minister El Temür's high treason will be revealed.

138
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,340
How grief-stricken Father must have been

139
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,390
that he cut his own finger to write a letter.

140
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,450
This is not the time to be angry or sad.

141
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,430
We must watch them with the eyes of a hawk and fight them with the heart of a snake.

142
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,320
What must I do?

143
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,690
First, pretend that you know nothing.

144
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,880
You must not make any effort to find the bloodletter.

145
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,980
I understand.

146
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,860
I have brought clothes for the guests of the palace.

147
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,720
Seung Nyang!

148
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,040
Seung Nyang?

149
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,450
It's become embarrassing that I am your bodyguard.

150
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,090
I know that you went easy on me.

151
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,730
It seems to me that he gave it his all.

152
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:02,000
Your Majesty, why did Seung Nyang meet with Eunuch Bang without visiting you?

153
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,100
Seung Nyang was here?

154
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,760
In the future, if I have a message for you, I will put a letter in the clothes.

155
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,680
Yes, good work, Seung Nyang.

156
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,250
What is our next mission?

157
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,000
His Majesty hasn't said anything.

158
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,890
Please contact me when he does.

159
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,180
Of course.

160
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,030
You better leave now.

161
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,080
Y-Your Majesty.

162
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,130
Eunuch Bang, you tell me.

163
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,030
Why was Seung Nyang the one to carry out my command?

164
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,910
Your Majesty.

165
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,250
Eunuch Bang has done nothing wrong.

166
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,700
I didn't ask you.

167
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:53,390
If something goes wrong, your life could be in danger.

168
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,340
So I requested Eunuch Bang to entrust me with this task.

169
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,750
I was confident I could do it.

170
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,410
Seung Nyang, how can you not know my heart?

171
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,310
So we've succeeded.

172
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,750
So, what is wrong?

173
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,660
Never... appear in front of me again.

174
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,410
Your Majesty?

175
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,220
Don't look for me, don't even think of me.

176
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,950
I will never see you again.

177
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,930
You may leave now.

178
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,340
Your Majesty.

179
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,300
I told you to leave, didn't you hear me!

180
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,430
My dumb brain cannot understand this situation at all.

181
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,230
Why are you casting Seung Nyang out?

182
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,440
Don't you know?

183
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,900
It's all for her sake.

184
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,470
Seung Nyang just wanted to help you, Your Majesty.

185
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,350
You... may all go now.

186
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,340
I'm sorry, Seung Nyang.

187
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:48,090
I don't have any power yet, so this is all I can do to protect you.

188
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,910
Please forgive me for being incompetent.

189
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,310
Go to Goryeo Village ahead of us.

190
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,310
- Did you cry?
- I'm not in the mood to speak with you so get out of my way.

191
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,670
Lady Park's pregnant belly is becoming larger. Do you know what that means?

192
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,090
That means your crime is becoming bigger as well.

193
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,690
Don't cry for anyone else!

194
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,810
You must only cry because of me.

195
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,240
If I cannot have you, I will make sure to ruin you.

196
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,340
You will be the most miserable one in the whole world. Do you understand?

197
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,570
It's shady and damp here. I'm not getting a good feeling.

198
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,800
Hurry and move already!

199
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,150
Hurry up!

200
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,470
He is the head of Goryeo Village.

201
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,080
What is your name?

202
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,650
My name is Mak Saeng.

203
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,430
Mak Saeng.

204
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,760
Someone died here a few days ago. Do you know about that?

205
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,980
Here, someone dies every time you open your eyes.

206
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,700
Your response is not sincere. Will you come to your senses after I set fire to this place?

207
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,860
A corpse that didn't come from here was taken.

208
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,120
There was someone who pulled a corpse out of a well.

209
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,640
Do you know who they were?

210
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,340
I saw them from far away. Unfortunately, my eyesight is bad.

211
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:13,000
Then have any outsiders passed through here recently?

212
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,740
I'm not sure.

213
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:25,670
If you tell any lies, you will die by this sword instead of the plague.

214
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,920
Well, that...

215
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,170
The King of Goryeo came here.

216
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,300
Are you sure that it was the King of Goryeo?

217
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,340
He told us himself that he was deposed from the throne.

218
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,880
Did you ask to see me?

219
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,200
Why did you go to Goryeo Village?

220
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,270
To risk exposure to the plague, you must have had a reason.

221
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,580
So, what are you going there for?

222
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,220
They were brought here because their king was incompetent.

223
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,360
I wanted to see my people. Why would a plague matter?

224
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,760
Is that all?

225
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,570
I felt bad for them, so I gave them the 1,000 nyang I received as my reward.

226
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,950
Can't a deposed king take care of his people?

227
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,830
There is a complicated situation in Goryeo Village right now. Don't do anything to cause suspicion.

228
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,910
What situation would that be?

229
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,260
It's not for you to know.

230
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:46,050
It's where the people of Goryeo have built Goryeo homes and live by Goryeo's traditions.

231
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,210
Why are you telling me to ignore them?

232
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,240
I don't want to suspect you.

233
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,570
Suspicion causes illness of the heart and I'd prefer to not become distant from you.

234
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,790
You may leave now.

235
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,340
I think you are showing him excessive favor.

236
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,800
The more talented and dangerous someone is, the closer you should keep him.

237
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,600
Do you still not know how to manage people?

238
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,320
What did Prime Minister El Temür summon you for?

239
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,780
I think they need to be shaken up some more.

240
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,920
The imperial office is being more intensely guarded.

241
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,810
We can't use petitions anymore.

242
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,410
So we'll have to find another way.

243
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,630
You may not have an appetite, but eat anyway, so you can live.

244
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,890
Did you visit Goryeo Village?

245
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,990
We went.

246
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,060
But aside from the deposed king having visited, there was nothing.

247
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,120
And? So you just returned here?

248
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,390
You just take care of yourself. You could die any day now.

249
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,330
You idiot.

250
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,360
I've survived so far on my wits alone.

251
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,260
The Captain of the Imperial Guards and all the other secrets are in that Goryeo Village.

252
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,410
I got it, so just eat this food.

253
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,670
Hey, Jo Cham.

254
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,540
Get me out of here.

255
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,510
I need to get out of here.

256
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,950
So you can spread that plague everywhere?

257
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,880
Jo Cham.

258
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,350
Let go! Let go!

259
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,560
Come on!

260
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,740
Jo Cham!

261
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,620
I need to live. Success is right around the corner.

262
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,750
I can't die like an idiot in here.

263
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,750
Bring more tea.

264
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,580
Yang.

265
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,360
You seem sad.

266
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,280
I also don't feel so great right now.

267
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,100
Angry and then sad...

268
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,210
My feelings are all mixed up.

269
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,250
Should we have a drink together?

270
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,860
Yang!

271
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,280
Sit here.

272
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,190
Your Majesty, you can't drink with such a lowly person.

273
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,380
How about I...

274
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,090
You? What would be the point?

275
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,400
Get out. Hurry up and get out!

276
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,620
Don't let anyone in tonight.

277
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,350
Pour yourself some, too.

278
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,440
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

279
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,720
Since we both feel down, let's get drunk freely.

280
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,440
Drink up.

281
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,640
Come on, drink. It's an order.

282
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:28,650
We've opened the porthole with the petition, so it's time for a bolder attack.

283
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,660
What method would that be?

284
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:36,630
What can I do to stir up El Temür and shake the palace?

285
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,970
Your Majesty, there's something...

286
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:49,070
I saw something rare and precious when you came here before as a crown prince.

287
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,900
Rare and precious?

288
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,300
It's something that a trickster from a western county used to do.

289
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,840
I wonder if that might help.

290
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,310
Tell me in detail.

291
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,110
It was a trick where the writing disappeared without a trace.

292
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,210
Writing disappears?

293
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,720
Yes. It's a trick of the eye, but it was amazing.

294
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,390
Can you find out how that trick is done?

295
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,560
There are many tricksters like that in this city of Daedo.

296
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,860
I'm sure I can find out if I put my mind to it.

297
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,200
Writing disappears...

298
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,120
Writing...

299
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,850
Oh... really...

300
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,830
Your Majesty, it's late at night.

301
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,440
Please send Yang away now.

302
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,090
If you nag me one more time,

303
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,420
I'll rip that mouth of yours!

304
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,540
Now, did you see that?

305
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,430
I may not seem like it elsewhere,

306
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:14,830
but in here, I'm a true emperor.

307
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,490
Drink slowly.

308
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,340
You keep emptying out that cup too fast.

309
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:35,620
You're a little cute when you drink.

310
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,810
You can't pick that up?

311
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,640
Here.

312
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,720
Open your mouth.

313
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,190
It's an imperial command... imperial...

314
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,650
Open your mouth.

315
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,200
Never mind.

316
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,740
It's more fun now that we're a little drunk.

317
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,710
It was a good idea to drink with you.

318
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:30,170
It feels like everything... that was knotted up in my heart... has all been undone.

319
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:38,400
Now that I'm drunk, let me ask you something, so answer honestly.

320
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,380
Do you still...

321
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,820
want to go back to Wang Yoo?

322
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,550
If not...

323
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:11,680
do you like... being here with me?

324
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:26,030
It's all right Seung Nyang, tell me honestly.

325
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,700
You're bad.

326
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:46,360
How do you not know how I feel?

327
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,420
Seung Nyang.

328
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,950
I wanted to help you with anything I could.

329
00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:01,110
So why... You're cold-hearted.

330
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,560
You're so cold-hearted.

331
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:20,000
Seung Nyang! Hey! Wake up, Seung Nyang.

332
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,910
Seung Nyang! Wake up...

333
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,790
My goodness...

334
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,730
Tonight... rest up comfortably in my bed.

335
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,030
Your Majesty...

336
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,510
Your Majesty...

337
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,920
So it was Wang Yoo, after all?

338
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,860
Still won't work.

339
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,240
I'll never let you go.

340
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:40,010
Never... will I let you go.

341
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,650
♫ Even slow stride follows you  ♫

342
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:50,310
♫ might lag two steps  ♫

343
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,890
♫ I keep getting afraid  ♫

344
00:31:54,890 --> 00:32:02,640
♫ Love is a crazily sad word to me  ♫

345
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:08,910
♫ The word I'd have to swallow with heartache  ♫

346
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,120
♫ I can't do without you  ♫

347
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:18,090
♫ Not even one day  ♫

348
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:22,820
Ah, should I just do it? She won't know.

349
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,980
No, no. I can't be a coward.

350
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,440
This is it for today.

351
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,440
Ah, I feel drunk.

352
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,020
His Majesty must be feeling awful.

353
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,720
Of course, he is.

354
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,380
He cherished Seung Nyang so much.

355
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,230
Ah, crap...

356
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,510
Last night... just what happened?

357
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,680
Your Majesty! Please wake up now.

358
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,550
The empress is here.

359
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,240
Is His Majesty awake?

360
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,150
What brings you here so early, Your Majesty?

361
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,780
I stopped by to see His Majesty while taking a walk.

362
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,710
Right now... you can't.

363
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,860
What do you mean I can't?

364
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,110
If he's still asleep, I'll go wake him up.

365
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,350
His Majesty, right now...

366
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,320
He's doing private business now.

367
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,220
Private business?

368
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,770
Yes, Your Highness.

369
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:43,550
He'd been eating a lot of dried persimmons, so it'll take a while.

370
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,560
I'll stay outside. Call me when he's done.

371
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

372
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,130
Do you want to die?

373
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,100
I'm sorry.

374
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,150
Your Majesty, please wake up.

375
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,820
Seung Nyang...

376
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,370
It's Golta.

377
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,660
Oh my god... You scared me!

378
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,610
Your Majesty, the empress is outside.

379
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,870
W-What... the empress?

380
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,490
Why is the empress here so suddenly?

381
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:48,440
Don't bother her anymore since she has the document of your promise to her.

382
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,850
Come in, Empress.

383
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,930
Did you drink last night?

384
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,270
I drank a little because I couldn't sleep.

385
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:15,320
But why do you have... two glasses?

386
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,550
Who did you drink with?

387
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,550
Why are you asking me?

388
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,660
What do you mean why am I asking? Is that something I can't ask?

389
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,430
Ah, I am tired because I am still intoxicated.

390
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,680
Please leave now.

391
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,460
So, it's the smell of alcohol.

392
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,890
What did you talk about all night?

393
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:08,180
Did you disparage me?

394
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:12,070
Or did he offer to sleep with you?

395
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,290
You dare to look at me with that gaze...

396
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:21,590
I just drank the few that he offered.

397
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:46,530
Are you the ones who wanted to learn magic?

398
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,120
Are you the magician?

399
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,690
Wait a minute.

400
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,800
Whoa! What is this...

401
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,020
Look carefully.

402
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,680
What is this?

403
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,950
What happened?

404
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,750
Nothing to be surprised at.

405
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,660
The secret is in this ink.

406
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:42,430
This ink is mixed with a magical liquid that came from the West.

407
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,510
The letters disappear with moisture.

408
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:50,150
Whoa. Please sell this to us.

409
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,220
Take it.

410
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,900
Any other inks?

411
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,970
What do you mean other inks?

412
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,550
The kind of ink that doesn't smear when wet.

413
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,290
Of course, I do.

414
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,220
I have one more favor to ask.

415
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,540
Can you leave Yeongyeong today?

416
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,390
We'll give you plenty of money.

417
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,090
I will.

418
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,430
Whoa, this is...

419
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:34,320
What do you plan to do with this?

420
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,960
The people of Yuan,

421
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,370
do you know what they fear the most?

422
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:44,800
It's the heavens. The curse of the heavens.

423
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,910
I will provide that curse.

424
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,160
How is the weather?

425
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,860
The rain clouds are here.

426
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,690
The heavens are helping us.

427
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,040
Will it be all right with your handwriting?

428
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,080
They will all disappear but a few anyway.

429
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:25,320
Incident Report. When the son went missing, the father trembled in fear and cried while spewing blood.

430
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,610
Why do you keep changing the brush?

431
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:35,140
After seeing the letter from the culprit, the father never set foot outside his home.

432
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,390
In the end, the son died and the culprit was caught.

433
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,240
During the transfer to Yuan,

434
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:46,060
the father killed him by striking him on the head three times with an iron mace, and an unprecedented event happened.

435
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:54,620
The victim's family had been ruined already. Since the father hasn't been punished, please judge the right from wrong.

436
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,560
Where do you make civil complaints?

437
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,090
At the Central Government Office.

438
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:06,220
Eunuch Bang and Moo Song, get someone from the outside and make them submit this under a made-up name.

439
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,790
You must never reveal our identity.

440
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,100
I understand.

441
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:16,590
Jeom Bak and Bul Hwa, I'll write the same letter, so you two take it and post it in the market square.

442
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:21,180
I intend to let the people of Daedo know this as well.

443
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,750
What does it say?

444
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,850
It's a petition for a wronged father that killed his son's murderer.

445
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:44,370
Awful things are happening because the world is harsh.

446
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,330
Let's go.

447
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,610
Uncle.

448
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,200
Take a look.

449
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,510
My...

450
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,050
What's happening? All the letters disappeared but those.

451
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:16,670
"Emperor Mingzong. Letter written in blood."

452
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:21,800
"Death to El Temür, three generations exterminated."

453
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,790
What?

454
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,570
If Emperor Mingzong's letter written in blood shows up,

455
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:30,190
three generations of El Temür's family will be exterminated.

456
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,460
Just who is spreading this rumor?!

457
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,850
I was surprised at first, but it is one of those magic tricks.

458
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,870
- A magic trick?
- It's a well-known magic trick in the West.

459
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:45,660
Arrest all the magicians in Yuan!

460
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,970
I understand, Prime Minister.

461
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:56,230
It's the work of that man. The one that's trying to strangle me!

462
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,620
I've been looking for the bloodletter all these years.

463
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,160
It's all useless now.

464
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,960
They are much more determined and scary people than we thought.

465
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,100
I don't know what they are after.

466
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,540
If they were after the bloodletter, I don't think they'd make it so obvious.

467
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,360
My head is cramping.

468
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,600
Why are things getting so complicated?

469
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,440
For now, let's get and torture the magicians and

470
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,150
stay on Prime Minister El Temür's good side.

471
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,810
You had the magician move away, right?

472
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:42,260
Don't worry about it. He went to his hometown of Seo Yeok.

473
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:47,300
I threw a bomb in the cave, so I am going to watch for now.

474
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:52,360
If we relax, it might backfire on us.

475
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,090
So be extra careful of your words and actions.

476
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

477
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:04,930
El Temür, I will exterminate your bloodline.

478
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,350
Who is this rascal?

479
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,300
He was watching the village, so I brought him in thinking he might be a thief.

480
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,950
Thieves come here to steal but they end up giving the shirts off their backs.

481
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:27,040
Take him out.

482
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,580
Elder, please let me live here.

483
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,780
We are shy, so we don't take in just anybody.

484
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,010
I am from Goryeo, too.

485
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:41,790
- What?
- I don't have anywhere else to go because the law is after me.

486
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,570
I even got the plague and

487
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:47,990
barely survived.

488
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,910
Please have mercy on me and

489
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,520
take me in.

490
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,790
What did you do in Goryeo?

491
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,780
I was in a division in the military defense.

492
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,160
So you were a bad man capturing girls to bring here as tributes.

493
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,890
I ended up like this because I let them go.

494
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:13,070
Please believe me, Chief.

495
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:17,370
Put him in the storage room. I'll decide tomorrow.

496
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:19,430
- Yes, Sir!
- Thank you.

497
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:24,110
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

498
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,960
You are quite brazen.

499
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,520
After making such a mistake that night being so drunk,

500
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,090
yet you are saying nothing.

501
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:51,720
Did I... make a mistake?

502
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,720
You don't remember?

503
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,090
Like this...

504
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,860
Your Majesty.

505
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:06,160
Empress Dowager.

506
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,140
Your Majesty, please take a look at this.

507
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,720
What is this?

508
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,630
Lord Jang brought this back, it was posted in the market square.

509
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,990
I'll read it to you.

510
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:28,990
"If Emperor Mingzong's bloodletter is found, three generations of El Temür's family will be exterminated."

511
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,560
This is too bold. His Majesty made his move to win.

512
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,250
But the opponent is El Temür.

513
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,070
The smallest mistake will...

514
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:10,370
Your Majesty, I have something to tell you urgently.

515
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:14,200
I told you not to say anything to me.

516
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,320
Your Majesty!

517
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,920
Are you ignoring that order, too?

518
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,260
Let's go.

519
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,120
Eunuch Bang.

520
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

521
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,260
Even if I can't,

522
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,970
you find out what's happening with Seung Nyang.

523
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:48,310
I understand.

524
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:00,090
I will call a meeting and discuss this with all the vassals officially.

525
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,270
You must not.

526
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:07,520
What do you mean I can't?! This bloodletter is no longer a secret.

527
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:10,460
It has been revealed to the world that El Temür is the culprit.

528
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,450
Unless we find the bloodletter, this will be buried as a rumor as well.

529
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:21,150
That's correct, Your Majesty. No one can fight El Temür on a hunch alone in the Imperial Court.

530
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,080
I can't do this. I can't do that.

531
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:28,560
Then my father's wrongful death I should just

532
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,600
bury it in my heart?

533
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,730
The fight has begun.

534
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:38,130
This strange document has given us the upper hand.

535
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:41,720
So please be patient.

536
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,260
Just who is this person...

537
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,670
helping us?

538
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,800
I can't even imagine.

539
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,760
It's so ghostly,

540
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,790
sometimes it gives me the chills.

541
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,360
The content of the strange document is circulating in the palace.

542
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,930
- Not only the palace, but all the people are talking about the bloodletter---
- What about Empress Dowager!

543
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,590
She is making more frequent visits to the emperor's quarters.

544
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:22,820
If the vassals in the court begin to also speak about it—

545
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:27,170
I've had countless critical times. But each time

546
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,960
I used a certain method.

547
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,200
Talahai, tell the emperor to meet me in the Imperial Hall.

548
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,960
- You bring the private soldiers.
- Yes, Father!

549
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,890
Come closer.

550
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:42,150
Your father left a bloodletter, Your Majesty.

551
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,270
Using that,

552
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:51,390
someone is trying to strangle me.

553
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:56,740
P-Prime Minister.

554
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,450
Hold up.

555
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:20,360
If you make a move, the emperor will be in danger.

556
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,100
Please tell me.

557
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:34,390
Unless you're deaf, you must have heard something.

558
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:40,150
I... don't know anything about it.

559
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:45,980
Please believe me. I really... don't know anything.

560
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:50,330
Whether you know or not about the bloodletter, it doesn't matter.

561
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:54,620
What's important is that, in the end,

562
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,810
those people are trying to use you.

563
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:01,000
P-P-Prime Minister...

564
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:08,990
People say that I've replaced the emperor twice.

565
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:16,160
Then... couldn't I do it three times?

566
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:23,440
What... What would you like me to do?

567
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,130
Please tell me, Prime Minister.

568
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:35,310
I've... done everything, everything you've told me to do.

569
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:37,620
Please, just tell me what to do!

570
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:43,560
So, please... please just tell me, Prime Minister.

571
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,620
Just stay quiet as if you are dead.

572
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:53,390
No matter what anyone says, just like a living corpse.

573
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,660
Understand?

574
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,890
I understand.

575
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:05,300
I'll do that.

576
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,780
Stand down.

577
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,930
Your Majesty.

578
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:30,910
What are you doing, Eunuch Baek?

579
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,480
Take the emperor back to his room!

580
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:10,080
The eunuchs and the palace maids saw it all, so the rumors will spread soon.

581
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:15,240
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

582
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:19,400
Since the enemy has warned me with a slanderous document, I also

583
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,390
will warn the enemy.

584
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:26,330
The throne suits you very well, Father.

585
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,650
Yang.

586
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,260
You go and tend to him.

587
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:07,040
The only one in the palace who can comfort him is you.

588
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,430
Father...

589
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,440
Father...

590
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,720
I said I wanted to be alone.

591
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,510
Why did you come here?

592
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,690
No more...

593
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,320
I don't want you to see me look pathetic anymore.

594
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,960
My eyes are shut

595
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,830
and my ears are closed.

596
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:53,430
I can't see anything and I can't...

597
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:55,680
hear anything.

598
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:04,350
Please... Please lean on me comfortably.

599
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,600
Your Majesty.

600
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,470
Isn't that Seung Nyang?

601
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:58,220
♫ Love is crazily sad word to me  ♫

602
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:04,110
♫ The word I'd have to swallow with heartache  ♫

603
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:05,400
♫ Even if dawn breaks with tears ♫
