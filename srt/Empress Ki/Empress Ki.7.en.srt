1
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,000
What do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,280
Just as I thought. The scent of a woman.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,090
Stop with your nonsense.

4
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,420
General!

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,430
General!

6
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,220
This jerk, how dare you?

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,990
For a woman, you really hit hard.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,660
A woman?

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,210
Dress this wench up prettily and bring her to me.

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,820
Yes, Sire!

11
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,080
Let go! Let me go!

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,760
Seung Nyang was a woman?

13
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,780
You two, make this boy--

14
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,180
Dress this wench up and put makeup on her.

15
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,660
General! I've brought Seung Nyang.

16
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,890
Come in.

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,790
General.

18
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,530
General!

19
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,140
Make her kneel... and leave.

20
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,830
Your eyes, nose, and mouth...

21
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,610
You're very pretty.

22
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,680
What are you going to do with me?

23
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,420
When you go on a hunt, sometimes you catch a fox.

24
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,650
If you cage it up and feed it, sometimes there's one that eats readily,

25
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,610
or another that growls and shows its teeth to the end.

26
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,100
The one that eats and becomes docile is skinned after being killed immediately.

27
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,860
But the one that is hostile to the end isn't killed as easily

28
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,890
because it gives you the desire to tame it first.

29
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,110
When we get to Yuan, I'm going to make you my concubine.

30
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,730
You must never be tamed with the food that I feed you.

31
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,650
The moment you obey me, I'll kill you by skinning you.

32
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,450
What's that look? Are you already afraid?

33
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,630
That takes away all the fun! You have to keep being spiteful!

34
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,670
Afraid?

35
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,370
I'm not afraid of an insect-like bastard who only bothers the weak.

36
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,290
Insect?

37
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,800
Whoa, that's right! Now, it's getting to be fun!

38
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,390
I hear that the prime minister is your father.

39
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,560
Don't speak ill of my father.

40
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,990
If you take away your father's power, who would be afraid of you?

41
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,890
Shut up.

42
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,250
The prime minister must feel disgraced to have a son like you.

43
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,490
I said, shut up!

44
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,510
Just because I've been lenient, you don't think you'll die?

45
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,360
How dare you run your mouth?!

46
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,420
Go ahead. Kill me.

47
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,490
It's better to die than get

48
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,100
trampled on by an insect like you!

49
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,240
She's going to become General Tanqishi's concubine?

50
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,580
If my life is in danger because he falls for that wench's ruse...

51
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,090
I can never let that happen.

52
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,660
Never!

53
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,630
Seung... Seung Nyang!

54
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,930
Seung Nyang.

55
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,310
There's a kid who was taking care of me. Where is he?

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,500
I need to see Seung Nyang.

57
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,690
I'll keep guard here, so you two go get some rest.

58
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,380
Yes, Sir!

59
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,930
Did you know Seung Nyang was a girl?

60
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,580
What are you talking about? Seung Nyang is a woman?

61
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,930
You didn't know.

62
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,340
She's probably being humiliated by General Tanqishi right about now.

63
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,440
I can deal with anything except any dishonor to my father!

64
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,250
Try running your mouth off one more time! Try!

65
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,870
Tell them to prepare two horses.

66
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,870
Two horses?

67
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,880
Are you trying to run away with the King of Goryeo?

68
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,950
Like what you did to him, I will count to three.

69
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:06,160
If you don't give you order within that time, this arrow will pierce your heart.

70
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,870
One. Two!

71
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,840
If you kill me,

72
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,030
your king will die, too.

73
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,340
Mother!

74
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,760
Why?

75
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,530
Are you scared that your former king might die?

76
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,320
Don't get any closer.

77
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,160
Shoot it!

78
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,630
Try killing your king too, with your own hands!

79
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,050
I said don't come any closer!

80
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,930
Your owner is not him but me, Tanqishi!

81
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,980
It will never work out the way you want!

82
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,730
You can't, Your Majesty.

83
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,020
Let me go. I'll kill him!

84
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,160
I want to kill him desperately, too.

85
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,950
I want to kill him and avenge my mother's death,

86
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,910
but... not here, Your Majesty.

87
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,430
You can't, Your Majesty.

88
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,130
Come with me.

89
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,170
I will let you leave this place.

90
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,370
Your Highness, Seung Nyang really is a woman.

91
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,610
You've surprised me so many times.

92
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,180
I got hit with an arrow while being chased by them on Daecheong Island.

93
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,910
I barely lived after getting caught in a fishing net after falling into the ocean.

94
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,360
It's amazing you came back alive.

95
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,280
But why did you follow us here?

96
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,520
I wanted to save Seung Nyang and kill Yeom Byeong Soo.

97
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,310
But what are you two doing here anyway?

98
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,970
We're the same.

99
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,970
His Majesty made us stay behind,

100
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,440
but we were so worried that we could barely stand it.

101
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,070
There's a problem!

102
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:38,600
I think those damned guys are about to kill Seung Nyang.

103
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,560
We have to rescue him right away.

104
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,150
It's not enough with just the four of us.

105
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,250
No,

106
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,140
I thought about a way.

107
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,900
How about setting fire to the barracks where the tributes are stored?

108
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,180
While they are putting the fire out, I think we can rescue His Majesty and Seung Nyang.

109
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,330
- Let's try it.
- What's the worst that can happen other than our death?

110
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,680
It would have difficult for a man, how did you endure it with your female body?

111
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,920
All this time,

112
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,620
I have been deceiving you, Your Majesty.

113
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,550
Are you disappointed?

114
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,600
What are you saying?

115
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,260
That's absurd.

116
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:07,070
Nothing has changed just because I am a girl.

117
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,860
I will serve you just as I always have before, Your Majesty.

118
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,060
How can you sleep here?

119
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,960
Whoa, what perfect shots.

120
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,590
How do you shoot poison darts so well?

121
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,290
Eunuchs have to let their male vigor out through their mouths.

122
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,170
Shut up and change your clothes.

123
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,690
Talking about male vigor when you've never had a woman.

124
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,810
Please hurry.

125
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,230
I'll go to the storage. You two save His Majesty and Seung Nyang.

126
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,480
Let's meet on the eastern mountain path.

127
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,470
What is it?

128
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,690
General Tanqishi asked us to bring him liquor.

129
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,280
I haven't seen you around here before.

130
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,740
Look carefully. Do you know me now?

131
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,560
Who?

132
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,850
You still don't know me?

133
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,150
So who are you?

134
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,400
What are you doing?

135
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,210
Would you rather have General Tanqishi kill you?

136
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,230
Calm down.

137
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,040
Follow me.

138
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,780
It's strong!

139
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,970
Hurry and go in, please.

140
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,710
What is that?

141
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,480
Like this.

142
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,560
Fire!

143
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,380
Fire! The tributes are on fire!

144
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,030
Fire, fire, fire!

145
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,670
Run!

146
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,830
What are you doing? Run!

147
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,960
Fire! Fire!

148
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,730
Where is the fire?

149
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,450
What do you mean? The storage tent for tributes...

150
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,800
You.

151
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,430
Fire! There is a fire!

152
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,360
These guys, how dare you!

153
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,060
Fire...

154
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,910
- Fire...
- There's a fire.

155
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,740
Catch them! Catch them!

156
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,240
Put the fire out!

157
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,600
Hurry! Move quickly!

158
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,170
Where is the fire?

159
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,350
The storage tent for the tributes.

160
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,840
These idiots.

161
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,310
You two over there.

162
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,610
We've been caught.

163
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,990
Blood must be shed.

164
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,030
Look who's here? Isn't this Park Bul Hwa?

165
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,910
So you were alive?

166
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,790
I will... dice your flesh.

167
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,630
- Ah!
- Stop!

168
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,570
Unless you want to see these fellows' heads fall,

169
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,260
drop your swords now.

170
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,040
Park Bul Hwa...

171
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,190
What is this?

172
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,950
It is the date of the marriage ceremony.

173
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,390
Don't you know that it's within my jurisdiction to determine the date of the marriage ceremony?

174
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,930
There are so many government affairs to attend to.

175
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:45,230
Can you entrust a big event for our kingdom to a common fortune-teller?

176
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,340
Prime Minister!

177
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:52,070
I trust that you will understand the intentions of a loyal vassal taking good care of the imperial court.

178
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,450
Then,

179
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,710
until the day of the marriage ceremony,

180
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,250
Danashiri will be receiving empress-training in the palace, so please tell her.

181
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,740
Of course, she must.

182
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,240
My daughter is lacking in many ways.

183
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,590
Please teach her well, Your Highness.

184
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,770
You must not allow him to manipulate you already.

185
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,260
Please let him know that you've chosen another marriage date, Your Highness.

186
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,150
No need to be so noisy from the beginning.

187
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:33,920
Let's first begin with the empress training. It will be severe.

188
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,880
Please get up. It is time for your lessons.

189
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,870
Why are you waking me so early in the morning?

190
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,890
It's already late.

191
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,380
Late? Empress is the highest-ranking person here.

192
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,840
So who cares when I wake up?

193
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,220
The highest-ranking person among the ladies of the inner court is Empress Dowager.

194
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,190
- What?
- Empress Dowager wakes before the mao hour.
(5:00~7:00 a.m.)

195
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:25,370
Therefore, all court ladies must rise before the Empress Dowager. That is the rule.

196
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,630
An empress must walk as graceful as a crane.

197
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,870
She must never be frivolous.

198
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,660
Again.

199
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,940
Again.

200
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,770
Again.

201
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,340
Again.

202
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,830
Again.

203
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,780
Again.

204
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,030
I won't do it! I won't!

205
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,810
Please see to your dignity.

206
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,270
I'm hungry! Who cares about that?

207
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,660
Just bring me more rice.

208
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,940
Please maintain your dignity.

209
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,850
I can't even eat whichever way I choose?

210
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,920
The women of the inner court must not covet food.

211
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,470
That is the command of Empress Dowager.

212
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,550
Empress Dowager. Empress Dowager.

213
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,130
My ears are about to form scabs!

214
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,570
- Take away the table.
- Huh? Wha--

215
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,290
What are you doing? Can't you see I'm not finished yet?

216
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,460
Take it away.

217
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,520
Then... why not just starve me to death?

218
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,100
It's time for your private decorum lessons.

219
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,030
- Try memorizing it.
- Jaeil Su-jeol. Jaeyi Cheong-jeong.

220
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,130
The first important thing for a woman is to be faithful to her husband.

221
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,380
The second is to be upright and chaste.

222
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,450
Yooyeojaesil Makchulgyujeong.

223
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,030
A woman's place is at home, she must not venture out the door.

224
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,580
Speak no evil, hear no evil. She must not spread gossip

225
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,770
and she must not listen to it or obscenities. Hwang-on--

226
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,710
Rae...

227
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,610
At twilight, she must light the candles.

228
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,720
She must light candles at dusk. Start from the beginning.

229
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,040
- Recite it all again?
- Yes, recite it again.

230
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,070
I can't do it! I won't do it!

231
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,820
If you cannot complete your education, you cannot become empress.

232
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,140
No matter, I just won't become one. I give up, I give up.

233
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,180
She really said she gives up?

234
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,560
Are you that happy about it?

235
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,930
She's leaving on her own. If that isn't a happy occasion for this empire, then what is?

236
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,990
Prime Minister El Temürl will not permit it.

237
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,380
Want to place a bet with me?

238
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,610
I will bet one piece of dried persimmon on Danashiri giving up.

239
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,510
It looks like you two are made for each other.

240
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,950
How dare you? How can you say something so appalling?

241
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,400
Just wait. Danashiri with her fiery temper

242
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,070
will never complete her empress-to-be training.

243
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,560
That miserable halfwit.

244
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,720
You dare to boss me?

245
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,750
Empress Dowager is here.

246
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,970
The hour is late.

247
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,780
It's not the slumber hour.

248
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,780
And I had not retired yet.

249
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,870
I hear that the empress training has been difficult for you.

250
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,930
To be honest, it's not easy.

251
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,130
The palace is different from your private home. It has many rules.

252
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,780
It's even more true for an empress, the Mother of the Empire.

253
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,970
- That is why it's so difficult.
- In that case,

254
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,190
I can just change the rules of the inner court.

255
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,220
Aren't you the one who made the current inner court rules, Empress Dowager?

256
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,020
When I become the owner of this palace,

257
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,630
I will be changing the rules anyway.

258
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,350
Please don't misunderstand. This isn't personal.

259
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,300
You picked this fight first.

260
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,330
Rest well.

261
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,390
Please go safely on your way, Empress Dowager.

262
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,980
You think I will give up?

263
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,420
Let me give you a taste of something hot later.

264
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,690
So insolent.

265
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,270
I think we must prepare that item.

266
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,970
Do you mean... that item?

267
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,130
I understand, Empress Dowager.

268
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,340
As to what a veiled hostile place this inner court truly is,

269
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,710
we must teach her well.

270
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,790
You look even more beautiful today.

271
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,630
Actually. my face is swollen since I didn't sleep well last night.

272
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:58,650
Is that so? But to me, you are far more beautiful than these flowers.

273
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,190
Looks like he's really fallen for me.

274
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,380
But... I don't really like this flower garden.

275
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,640
The landscaping and the planted flowers, they're not very aesthetically pleasing.

276
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,550
It was created personally by my late mother.

277
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,270
I apologize. I was rude.

278
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:22,710
It's fine. I don't really like this flower garden, actually.

279
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,670
- May I ask you one thing?
- Please, go ahead.

280
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,410
You must answer truthfully.

281
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,460
I never lie.

282
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,600
Do you really...

283
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,830
want this humble consort to be your empress?

284
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,360
I have never imagined anyone else becoming my empress.

285
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,880
Then please listen to my conditions.

286
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,380
Of course, I must.

287
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,600
I'll bring my own people into my quarters.

288
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,650
That, you cannot do.

289
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,770
Fine. What else?

290
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,880
Whenever you come to see me, you must ask me first.

291
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,090
I will allow that. Any other requests?

292
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,270
I would like...

293
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,130
a proper proposal from you.

294
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,990
Proposal... What would you like me to do?

295
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,750
I really love flowers.

296
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,290
Please make me a coronet of precious flowers.

297
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,700
Fine. I will do so.

298
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,880
I will take my leave now, Your Majesty.

299
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:46,440
Pull out every flower in the Imperial Palace.

300
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,080
She says she likes flowers.

301
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,710
Get rid of them all.

302
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,800
Without giving us a single soldier, he tells us to go fight on the front lines and defend the frontier.

303
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,340
This is not even a demotion. How is this different from exile?

304
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,550
But it's a relief that we have preserved our lives.

305
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,660
I chose the wrong faction to support. If I had known this would happen, I'd have beheaded the emperor on Daecheong Island

306
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,470
and won merit from the prime minister.

307
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,970
Uncle, we have a long road to travel ahead of us.

308
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,250
The tributes have been all burned up.

309
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,510
We need a plan, don't we?

310
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,990
This is all because of that deposed king, that bastard.

311
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,010
- We can pin all the crimes on him.
- That's dangerous.

312
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,660
As long as the father of the deposed king has been reinstalled—

313
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,760
There isn't any way.

314
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,440
Do you have a good idea?

315
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,680
I just received a letter from a messenger.

316
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,750
It says that General Bayan of the Merkid was sent to clean up the Turkic Khaganate.

317
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,810
Yes. What about it?

318
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,960
The best thing to do with a dangerous item is to get rid of it.

319
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,540
So we send the deposed king there?

320
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,590
I heard that it's a very dangerous and dilapidated place.

321
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,350
So if the deposed king does us the favor and dies there...

322
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,770
won't that be what we all want?

323
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:29,560
We will tell Ji City that the deposed king volunteered to go there in order to atone for his sins.

324
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,350
Sending the deposed king to his death...

325
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,100
Drag the deposed king out!

326
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,870
Where are you taking him?

327
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,820
He'll be taken to a place worse than hell and die.

328
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,030
Take me, too. I'll go with him!

329
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:03,540
Don't worry, wench. You will also go to a place that's like hell.

330
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,300
Seung Nyang.

331
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,600
No matter where we go,

332
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,870
please, please do not die.

333
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,070
You must...

334
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,270
You must survive, no matter what.

335
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,280
I...

336
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,500
will come back to life because of you.

337
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,010
You must also stay alive because of me!

338
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,450
This is a promise and an order. Understand?

339
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,770
Yes.

340
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,460
I will obey your orders, Sire.

341
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,100
Hurry and untie them.

342
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,560
Your Majesty!

343
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,960
Your Majesty.

344
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,340
Seung Nyang!

345
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,830
From this moment on, you will go on a long journey.

346
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,080
It might become the road to your afterlife.

347
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,390
What are you going to do with Seung Nyang?

348
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:08,990
Why? Does it whet your appetite to know she's a woman?

349
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:14,550
I'm going to take her as a slave and trample on her for life.

350
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:29,490
If anything happens to Seung Nyang, you're all going to die.

351
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,240
Talahai, drag him away.

352
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,420
I understand, Older Brother.

353
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,630
Move it!

354
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,270
Move!

355
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,950
What is it?

356
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,650
It's nothing.

357
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,350
Hurry it up!

358
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,020
Yes!

359
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,770
This isn't the way to Yeongyeong.

360
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,330
We've been going west for three days.

361
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,440
Are they going to kill us?

362
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,070
If they wanted us dead, would they have made us suffer like this?

363
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,400
They're in military uniform, but they're no different than beggars.

364
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,700
Telling us to go to war with this gang of wretches. It's like telling us to die.

365
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,250
Something feels weird.

366
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,680
What is it?

367
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,840
They look like a bag of bones.

368
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,960
Not only is there lack of discipline,

369
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,980
there are no weapons prepared for war.

370
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,610
You're right.

371
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:31,280
I'm sure there's a reason for this other than losing the war.

372
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,790
It seems like we have a great task ahead of us to make them into soldiers again.

373
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,290
General!

374
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,640
Welcome, General Bayan.

375
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,380
- Welcome, General!
- Welcome, General!

376
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,820
Are you in charge here?

377
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,410
Yes, General. You came from very far away.

378
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:57,280
We heard you were coming, so we prepared a liquor table.

379
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,160
Liquor table?

380
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,490
Please come into the command tent.

381
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,620
It's an honor to serve you!

382
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,240
- It's an honor, General!
- It's an honor, General!

383
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,440
Your efforts are appreciated.

384
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,950
The liquor and the side dishes are good, but it's a shame there isn't a woman to keep us company.

385
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,810
Is that what you want?

386
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:25,160
No matter how skilled, it will be hard to find a woman here.

387
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,290
Not at all!

388
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:33,150
We're a military camp. Not far from here, there is a tavern.

389
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,030
I will bring you some women right away.

390
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,990
I didn't expect to meet such a skilled commander in a border area.

391
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,250
If there's anything you want, please give me your order, General.

392
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,930
Give me your sword.

393
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,520
I have grown up fighting wars.

394
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,890
I have killed many enemies

395
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,980
and used their bodies as pillows for countless nights.

396
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,710
I am very well aware of your military achievements.

397
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,630
A well-used commander's sword gives off a certain scent.

398
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,190
But I don't smell any blood on your sword.

399
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,090
What's the matter, General?

400
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,160
Where did you sell all the weapons off to?

401
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,530
General!

402
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,830
I'm getting very impatient.

403
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:30,590
If you don't admit it this instant, I will slice off your plump skin

404
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,710
and feed it to the starving soldiers.

405
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,690
Tell me the truth!

406
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,890
General... this is a misunderstanding.

407
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,010
I told you I was impatient.

408
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,340
What do you mean I sold off the weapons?

409
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,930
Who's next in the chain of command! Come!

410
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,500
Please kill us, General!

411
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,930
- Please kill us, General!
- Please kill us, General!

412
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:03,030
Toqto'a, cut off the dead one's head and hang it above the doorway!

413
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,080
I understand.

414
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,040
We can fight without swords, but an army with no military discipline will never win!

415
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,630
The enemies within are scarier than enemies out there!

416
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,070
From now on, I will cut out all the rotten flesh with this sword

417
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,410
and form a new army. Announce it.

418
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,750
From now on, we will reorganize the military to strengthen our forces.

419
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,910
"Soldiers from Yuan will be a separate unit and the other tribes divided

420
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,850
according to their origins and strengths.

421
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,690
We will separate the elite of the civilian militia and tribal units establishing a stronghold.

422
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,010
The rest will serve as laborers and fodder for arrows in battle.

423
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,870
We will separate the units of civilian militia and tribal soldiers by best to least

424
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,360
and distribute the food accordingly.

425
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:01,140
Those who fail to follow orders or desert the army

426
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,350
will be executed immediately."

427
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,250
Come here.

428
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,540
Here.

429
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,190
You don't need to give anything to that wench!

430
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:40,070
Because of you, I lost the throne that was right at my fingertips.

431
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,180
All because of you, Seung Nyang.

432
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,440
I will give you just enough for you not to die.

433
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,410
Because if you die too quickly, you can't suffer.

434
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,180
Eat it.

435
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:36,340
I don't need your mercy or whatever else if it's from you.

436
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,950
Don't make me angry.

437
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,960
I can kill you right now.

438
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:50,030
We'll soon arrive in Yeongyeong. I'm giving you a chance.

439
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:55,350
Live as a slave for life in the palace or be my wife.

440
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,060
Choose one. Which is it?

441
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,500
I'll become a slave in the palace.

442
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,510
You will never get out until you work like a cow all your life and then die.

443
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,180
I've already resolved myself to do so!

444
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,920
Wait for it, Tanqishi...

445
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,370
I will kill you, too.

446
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:22,060
But before that, I will first kill the bastard who has become the emperor.

447
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,480
Damn it.

448
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,090
It's strange. I did well on Daecheong Island.

449
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,360
Jeonchutaesan (Balyeohomi)
("The Big Mountain" Korean archery lesson)

450
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,900
The hand that holds the arrow should be stretched as if you are pushing a big mountain.

451
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,350
(Jeonchutaesan) Huakhomi.
(Move 2 - Grab The Tiger's Tail)

452
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,800
Your clasped hand should pull as if grabbing a tiger's tail.

453
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,220
Do you understand how this is supposed to feel?

454
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,510
Yes, I'm beginning to understand.

455
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,920
That's right.

456
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,590
Jeonchutaesan Huakhomi!

457
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,030
I'm not doing it.

458
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,090
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not!

459
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,960
Your Highness!

460
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,470
You mean she's never once come to give her greetings?

461
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,980
You must not overlook her arrogant and impudent behavior any longer.

462
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,530
You should punish--

463
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,080
Your Highness, It's Lady Yeom.

464
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,770
Let her in.

465
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,800
Is that it?

466
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,920
Yes, Your Highness.

467
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,420
The scent is wonderful.

468
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,110
Make sure Danashiri uses this.

469
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,930
You must follow my order to the letter.

470
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,930
What is it that's inside that box?

471
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,910
What kind of place is the Imperial Palace?

472
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,770
Even if she's the empress,

473
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:41,250
without generous rewards...

474
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,940
You don't mean...

475
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,940
It's a perfume and incense Empress Dowager cherishes.

476
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,140
It will make your skin more beautiful

477
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,590
and clear your head also if you keep it near.

478
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,880
Tell her thank you.

479
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,430
I heard that Empress Dowager receives everyone's respect.

480
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:20,830
Her character is admirable, which is why she sent you a gift.

481
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,630
This is a bribe, not a gift.

482
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,670
A bribe?

483
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,280
The moment I become the empress, I will be in charge of the inner court,

484
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,140
so she's trying to remain in my good graces.

485
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:40,430
As the eldest, the Empress Dowager will run the inner court.

486
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,790
Eldest, pssh.

487
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:47,660
It's time for her to retreat to the back hall after all these years of acting like she's in charge.

488
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,060
Why are you staring at me like that?

489
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,920
- Go and be about your business.
- Yes.

490
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,900
You've made a long journey, General.

491
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,040
It's been a long time, Dok Man.

492
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,730
I will take charge of the court ladies now.

493
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,660
I have something important to speak to you about.

494
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,080
See that wench over there.

495
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,270
Throw her out of the palace.

496
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,320
To a courtesan house?

497
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:22,420
I will take her. You just have to throw her out.

498
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,990
This is...

499
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,580
where you live.

500
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:39,230
If you want, I will give you a palace the size of Goryeo.

501
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,600
If that's not enough,

502
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,010
I will even give you the highest government position in Yuan.

503
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:48,360
His Imperial Majesty!

504
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,710
Everyone on your knees!

505
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,710
Until His Imperial Majesty has passed by, you must never raise your heads!

506
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,660
Who are they?

507
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,460
They're the tribute concubines from Goryeo.

508
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,990
Concubines?

509
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,410
Your expression has suddenly darkened.

510
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,980
There was a rascal who saved me in Goryeo.

511
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,420
When I think about him,

512
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,940
I'm ashamed to see them.

513
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,600
Let's go.

514
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:08,770
I heard if you can become a court lady, you'll get a stipend.
[Pavillion of Women]

515
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,390
I heard you can become a maidservant, too.

516
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,420
You're lucky if you become a servant.

517
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,340
If you get thrown out of the palace,

518
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,190
they'll sell you to a courtesan house!

519
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,040
- Really?
- What to do?

520
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,000
Are they done bathing?

521
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,280
Yes, Sir.

522
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,300
There will be a court lady screening.

523
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,480
If you're chosen to be a concubine,

524
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,030
you will get a red ribbon.

525
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,120
If you're a maidservant, a blue ribbon.

526
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,550
The yellow ribbon is for those who will be sent out of the palace.

527
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,120
Front row first.

528
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,960
Take your tops off.

529
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,150
Face, body,

530
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,080
and teeth are high-grade.

531
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:14,310
Big cheekbones and flushed, she has a full face.

532
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,880
Servant.

533
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,790
She's mid-grade.

534
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,230
Her face and body are both upper—

535
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:36,350
She has scars on her body. Low grade would be quite fitting.

536
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,190
Wait a minute.

537
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,750
How did you get those scars?

538
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,800
Let me see your hands.

539
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,480
You have held a sword before.

540
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,260
What did you do in Goryeo?

541
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:01,150
My father...

542
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:05,090
was a hunter.

543
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,510
You have very good facial features.

544
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,090
Throw her out. If you let the likes of her into the inner court—

545
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,970
Mid-grade.

546
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,950
- Head Eunuch.
- A hunter's daughter...

547
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:20,940
Isn't she perfect for a servant who does manual labor?

548
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,450
Next.

549
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:50,340
Senior Miss, she's the new servant.

550
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,270
Put her at the end.

551
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,120
Come here.

552
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,280
Watch out for her.

553
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,980
She nearly became a concubine but failed,

554
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,630
so she's become a crazy poisonous snake.

555
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:17,220
Hey! You.

556
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,810
Come here.

557
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:25,610
Are you deaf? Come over here.

558
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:31,550
All of you get lost.

559
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,090
You massage me instead.

560
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,790
What are you doing? Massage her.

561
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,670
I washed clothes all day

562
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,250
and my body aches.

563
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,660
Wench! That hurts!

564
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:03,940
What?

565
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:07,130
Are you glowering at me?

566
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:16,050
This wench doesn't realize where this is.

567
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:19,060
This won't do. Get her.

568
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,660
What is all this noise?

569
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,750
Greetings, Court Lady Yeom.

570
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,610
Head Eunuch will be doing an inspection soon.

571
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,580
Stay quiet.

572
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,610
You sent Wang Yoo to the border?!

573
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:59,660
Who made such a decision?!

574
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:03,570
That's...

575
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,370
He made the decision himself.

576
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:13,060
He requested going to the border himself?

577
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,050
His wish was to be restored as king.

578
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:21,950
Due to his carelessness, his people died, so he must have wanted a chance to make up for it.

579
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,240
By making a contribution for merit,

580
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,330
he wants to be restored as King of Goryeo?

581
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,050
That's right, Prime Minister.

582
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:33,840
You know what that place is like. It's the doorway to the Silk Road that connects to the West.

583
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,370
It's a region that's brought us nothing but headaches since the Turks seized the area.

584
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,460
If a deposed king takes care of them all,

585
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,110
what could be better for the Great Empire in the end?

586
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:48,950
He offered to go to the border in order to make a contribution?

587
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:55,030
He's as interesting as I thought.

588
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,330
We'll know in time,

589
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:03,680
whether he will give us good or bad news.

590
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,940
General!

591
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:23,200
General Talahai just arrived!

592
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,760
That bastard? Why?

593
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,840
I heard earlier that

594
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,910
there are a lot of soldiers who were dragged here from Goryeo.

595
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,820
No way. All those dead bodies aren't

596
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:58,550
- people of Goryeo, are they?
- How would we know?

597
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,060
There is a strange energy flowing in the military village.

598
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,970
What brings you all the way here?

599
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,120
I brought this man.

600
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,020
Why do we need him?

601
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,720
Why do you think?

602
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,610
Good luck fighting with them.

603
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:25,470
Good luck with just a few people who aren't even reinforcements?

604
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,290
We heard there are

605
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:30,150
people from Goryeo here.

606
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,920
Put me in with them.

607
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,920
He is offering to be fodder for the arrows himself.

608
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,440
Even killing deserters...

609
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,520
The atmosphere here is not good.

610
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,310
But where are we exactly?

611
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:02,450
Since we kept going west, it seems like a border somewhere.

612
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:06,260
- It's the gateway to the Silk Road.
- The Silk Road?

613
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,130
I didn't see any silk on our way here!

614
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:15,190
Not that silk! It's the trade route that connects to the West, you fool!

615
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:20,240
I heard that the Turks have seized this area.

616
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,410
We have to conquer the Turks?

617
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:28,370
Now I see why they brought me here.

618
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,220
Change into these clothes.

619
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,140
We're not beggars. You want us to wear these?

620
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,190
Stop complaining and change, you lowly eunuch.

621
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,980
You no good—

622
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,990
We don't care, but these clothes are not fit for His Majesty!

623
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,350
It would be good to wear them.

624
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:02,800
This place doesn't care about your position or status.

625
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,510
It would be best to

626
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,360
let go of any lofty ideals for survival.

627
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,990
Who cares about what you wear?

628
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,700
Change into them.

629
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,470
Your Majesty...

630
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,400
Stay still.

631
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,320
Seung Nyang, right?

632
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,410
Tell me yourself what mistakes you made today.

633
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:20,370
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- What?

634
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,290
This rude wench!

635
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:28,280
This wench...

636
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,840
This won't do. Bring the whip.

637
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,300
I said bring the whip, you wench!

638
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,460
Yes.

639
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,020
Your Majesty

640
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:45,010
it's cold outside. Please go back to your quarters.

641
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:48,600
I can't sleep these days.

642
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,450
- Let's just walk a little to the front here.
- Yes, Sire.

643
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:59,940
But what is that place that's all lit up?

644
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,340
It's a storage room.

645
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:05,490
What are people doing there in the middle of the night?

646
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,930
What? Does it hurt?

647
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,660
This is just a start.

648
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:19,060
I will show you what it's like to be punished.

649
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,070
Hold her tight.

650
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,980
Who's inside?

651
