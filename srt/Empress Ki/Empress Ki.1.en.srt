1
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,700
I will leave for Goryeo.

2
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,770
Will you not attend the coronation of Imperial Consort Ki as empress?

3
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,110
Is there a reason I must attend?

4
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,230
It is a moment that someone who was brought over as a tributary girl becomes an empress. Isn't it a celebration for Goryeo?

5
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,190
A celebration for Goryeo is something that is made by me, the King of Goryeo.

6
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,480
If it weren't for the imperial consort,

7
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,160
you'd already be dead.

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,540
Your pitiful life was saved by the imperial consort.

9
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,520
To the imperial consort, please relay my thanks.

10
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,700
Do you still love Seung Nyang?

11
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,820
Are you still holding Nyang in your heart, I asked.

12
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,740
I love her. She is my all.

13
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,490
She's not meant to belong to a pitiful thing like you. Do you understand?

14
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,040
Understood?

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,580
Understand!

16
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,320
The Goryeo king has left Yeongyeong.

17
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,900
It is a drink to celebrate your health and long life.

18
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,660
10,000 years! 10,000 years!

19
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,170
10,000 years!

20
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,750
10,000 years!

21
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,930
Seung Nyang, are you really her?

22
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,580
10,000 years!

23
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,890
10,000 years!

24
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,080
10,000 years!

25
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,190
Nyang.

26
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,240
Your Royal Highness.

27
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,120
Let's depart.

28
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,520
Move!

29
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,930
Let's go!

30
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,610
- Mother!
- Nyang!

31
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,630
Mom!

32
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,060
Don't hit my mother.

33
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,130
Don't hit my mother. Mom!

34
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,560
Nyang!

35
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,680
Won't you get up?

36
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,470
Stop!

37
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,250
Stop hitting them.

38
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,500
Mom, are you all right?

39
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,760
I am. I'm okay.

40
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,720
Why have you tied these women with ropes?

41
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,420
They are tributaries that have been captured after attempting to escape in the night.

42
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,260
Still, can you regard these people like you would beasts?

43
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,860
Untie these ropes and have the injured healed!

44
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,740
Have you given me a command?

45
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,030
Your Royal Highness, the Crown Prince.

46
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,970
Why is our march being delayed so?

47
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,630
Brother,

48
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,520
Goryeo's Crown Prince has said to untie their ropes.

49
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,450
I think Crown Prince has forgotten you are a hostage in this empire.

50
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,110
I will let it go this time, but I shall no longer tolerate any more meddling.

51
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,860
To the descendants of the Borte-Cino (blue wolves), there is no such thing as magnanimity.

52
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,610
Increase the speed of the march!

53
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,830
Increase it!

54
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,130
Get moving!

55
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,850
Come on!

56
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,920
What happens to the women once they reach Yuan?

57
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,200
The ones who ran away are sold to brothels

58
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,300
or used as slaves, is what I heard.

59
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,990
Beastly things.

60
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,130
Even that young thing.

61
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,830
Your feet hurt a lot, right?

62
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,230
It's okay.

63
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,380
Mom, I will massage you.

64
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,080
I am sorry, Daughter.

65
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,780
I couldn't protect you.

66
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,600
I am sorry.

67
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,560
My mom's crying again.

68
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,330
Don't cry, Mom.

69
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,930
Open it.

70
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,000
Your Royal Highness, please.

71
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,400
Hurry and open it!

72
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,760
Yes.

73
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,580
Escape.

74
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,730
It's all I can do for you.

75
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,890
I am sorry.

76
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,630
Open there, too.

77
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,810
Those of you who wish to, also escape.

78
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,460
Nyang! Nyang!

79
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,050
Whoa.

80
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,350
Do not leave a single bitch alive.

81
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,700
Kill all those who have escaped.

82
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,700
Mom! Mom!

83
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,160
Mom! Mom!

84
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,960
Mom!

85
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,740
Mom!

86
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,080
Mom!

87
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,630
Mom...

88
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,880
Ma, just hold on a bit more.

89
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,550
I...

90
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,170
You must stay alive.

91
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,780
Because you're a tributary girl that escaped,

92
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,770
if you get caught, those bastards will kill you.

93
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,180
Mom, don't leave me alone and go.

94
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,960
Mom.

95
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:12,850
Having birthed you as a girl in this dangerous world

96
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,590
is my greatest regret.

97
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,510
This...

98
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,720
was given to me by your father.

99
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,830
Your father...

100
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,150
is still alive.

101
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,000
Go to Gaegyeong.

102
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,980
He has the last name Ki

103
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,690
and has the same exact ring.

104
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,250
Mom.

105
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,730
Mom!

106
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,320
Mom!

107
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,620
Mom!

108
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,910
It is my sin.

109
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:33,370
It's because I have no power, I was unable to protect my pitiful subjects.

110
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,540
Your Royal Highness.

111
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,470
An incompetent father causes his child to die.

112
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,200
And an incompetent king causes countless loyal subjects and people to die.

113
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,100
Crown Prince, you have no qualification to be king.

114
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,060
You're incompetent and naive.

115
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,060
If you want to live for Goryeo,

116
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,070
bury your bones in Yuan. Understood?

117
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,600
I mean to say never again return to this land.

118
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,860
Ki? Name?

119
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,070
- I don't know the name.
- Hey kid,

120
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,310
if you don't know the name, how can you find a person just by their last name?

121
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,690
Go over there. I'm busy.

122
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,460
Wait.

123
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,470
Was the owner of the Three-Way Stop Tavern of surname Ki?

124
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,520
Three-Way Stop Tavern?

125
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:01,480
Ok Boon was the one who said she couldn't raise a child as a concubine and escaped with her.

126
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,370
It's not your fault, Brother.

127
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,400
If we ask the translators in Yeongyeong,

128
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,010
you should be able to find Nyang's whereabouts.

129
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,470
Is anyone there?

130
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,850
Is the owner here?

131
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,890
What's with you?

132
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,190
Is there anyone with the surname Ki?

133
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,920
Why are you asking?

134
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,830
I'm looking for my father.

135
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,380
I am Ki.

136
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,070
Ma'am is?

137
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,750
Hey, how can you eat that.

138
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll give you a bowl of gukbab (rice in stew).

139
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,390
It's okay. I won't eat free food.

140
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,160
Is he dead?

141
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,420
I believe so.

142
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,000
- Move it.
- Yes.

143
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,010
Your Royal Highness, he's alive. What shall I do?

144
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,770
Eek. Smell.

145
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,480
I will do it.

146
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,410
He's awake.

147
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,460
Looking like a boy, you're shy now?

148
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,550
Wear these.

149
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,470
Where's your home?

150
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,180
I don't have one.

151
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,770
Your parents?

152
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,560
They passed away.

153
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,090
When Crown Prince arrives in Yuan, I will ensure he pays for releasing the tributary women.

154
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,090
This time make sure he is unable to even set foot on Goryeo forever.

155
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,400
That way, I, Wang Go, can ascend the throne.

156
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,570
To do that, you, King Simyang must gain favor

157
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,130
from our Royal Court and Imperial Family.

158
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,230
Would there be any issue?

159
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,290
I have a method thought out already.

160
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,290
A method?

161
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,260
Wait.

162
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,600
Soon, an enormous sum in this Wang Go's name

163
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,050
will be released into the coffers of the Yuan Royal Court and Imperial Family.

164
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,870
I will look forward to it.

165
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,300
Where did you put His Royal Highness's shoes?

166
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,430
They were just here.

167
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,880
They're here.

168
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,980
I held onto them in case they got wet in the rain.

169
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,090
Who is this kid?

170
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,320
He is the one who got hit by the horse not too long.

171
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,800
Sir, please take me in.

172
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,010
- I will be sure to repay your kindness.
- To repay the grace, you say...

173
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,450
What is your name?

174
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,150
Nyang—

175
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,940
- I am called Seung Nyang.
- Seung Nyang, I see.

176
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,150
So how will you earn your keep?

177
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,610
Seung Nyang, don't just take care of Big Brother. Look after me, too.

178
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,300
Anytime help yourself to becoming the most skilled. Then you will be able to be served by me.

179
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,940
Ah... I must increase my skill at the very least for this kid. I'm so darned jealous.

180
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,570
What is the kid doing over there?

181
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,360
He said that he'd repay your kindness by learning martial arts.

182
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,120
Is that so?

183
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,380
Brother, it is time to go to the state salt dealership.

184
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,620
Hurry on up!

185
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,090
- Why is there so much?
- Why are you being so loud?

186
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,220
Don't you know that salt is a prohibited good in this nation?

187
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,000
Don't worry about us, and be sure to keep silent on your end.

188
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,150
Load the salt.

189
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,340
Your Royal Highness, long live your peace and happiness.

190
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,340
Your Royal Highness.

191
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,700
You have worked hard delivering the salt.

192
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,070
What are you doing? Take it.

193
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,940
The amount of salt being smuggled

194
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,540
has increased to double.

195
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,040
- So?
- Double the money.

196
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,830
In whose presence do you dare?

197
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,850
Have you forgotten His Grace's kindness in raising you?

198
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,680
My household members have increased.

199
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,770
Moreover, there's a thing called hazard pay.

200
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,090
Do as the kid Seung Nyang has requested.

201
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,650
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

202
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,440
Next month, the amount of salt traded will increase even more.

203
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,930
Let it be known.

204
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,110
I shall take my leave now.

205
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,970
Your Royal Highness, what do you mean you'll increase the salt traded amount?

206
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,220
If your tail is long, it can be stepped on (get caught).

207
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,550
The current crown will soon proclaim his abdication.

208
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,080
To further attain the approval of Yuan, don't you know that even more money is needed?

209
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,840
- That is true.
- The tides are on my side.

210
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,090
The current crown is deep in his illness and

211
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,330
do you know what the crown prince is doing?

212
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,060
Cooperative owner, why are you acting this way again?

213
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,030
If it's a purpose, then I am confident I won't lose to anyone.

214
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,200
I don't exempt anyone based on circumstance.

215
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,000
Your Royal Highness!

216
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,220
Cooperative Owner! Cooperative Owner!

217
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,430
- Elder!
- Do you have a crazed death wish!

218
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,380
Why are you doing this to me? I did just as the cooperative owner had wished.

219
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,320
A doctor— Call a doctor!

220
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,010
- Yes.
- A doctor?
- Guide him inside, everyone!

221
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,380
Yes! Hurry!

222
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,940
Work hard.

223
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,310
Truly so incompetent.

224
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,650
To have the so-called Crown Prince of Goryeo associate with thugs.

225
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:29,620
- Your Royal Highness. Your Royal Highness!
- Your Royal Highness,

226
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,110
- come to your senses.
- That's right!

227
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,430
It's Inju!

228
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,930
I will go and play in Inju.

229
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,610
Your Royal Highness.

230
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,480
Are you all right? My liver lobes almost fell in fright!

231
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,230
Who is the most important thug in Inju?

232
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,590
Now's not the time for you to play while forming brotherhoods with the thugs.

233
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,880
King Simyang is prowling constantly for your position, Your Royal Highness the Crown Prince.

234
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,400
Again. Again with that. Didn't I say that what King Simyang does, I have no interest.

235
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,990
Your Royal Highness!

236
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,780
Tell me! Is there an entertaining lad in Inju?

237
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,670
Inju is where trade occurs with Yuan,

238
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,050
so the might of the gamblers is a force to be reckoned with. Among them,

239
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,410
the main center is controlled by a guy named Seung Nyang.

240
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:27,350
- Seung Nyang faction?
- As you can tell by the name, the faction is led by a guy named Seung Nyang.

241
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,900
- It fell!
- If there is a bird flying within three footsteps, with an arrow

242
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,910
he catches them.

243
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,140
How can you believe those words?

244
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,340
In exchange for protecting the merchants, he collects protection money.

245
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,360
There's a rumor that if it's for money, he doesn't discriminate.

246
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,690
If you were to destroy those Seung Nyang faction thugs,

247
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,790
then all the thugs in Inju would submit willingly.

248
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,990
Then, I have decided that this hunt's target will be a wolf.
 (T/N: Seung Nyang is a dhole, a mountain wolf.)

249
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,080
Whose turn is it this time?

250
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,740
It's me, Leader. Where did your sister get dragged to?

251
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,950
A courtesan house near Yeongyeong.

252
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,610
The money is a bit lacking to redeem your sister.

253
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,790
When the payment is fulfilled next month, go and head to Yuan.

254
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,110
Thank you so much, Leader.

255
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,970
Do not forget why we gathered as thugs.

256
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,760
Until we find all our blood relations seized by Yuan,

257
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,360
we must trust and rely on each other.

258
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,640
- Understood?
- Yes, Leader.

259
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,510
Leader, please come down. Hurry.

260
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,870
Is the son of a bitch named Seung Nyang, you?

261
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,670
What's this pup barking in front of someone else's house?

262
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,470
I am Jeom Bak from Gaegyeong.

263
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,390
Jeom Bak?

264
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:16,550
- Your point?
- If you heard my name, then you should come and kowtow to the ground.

265
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,750
You want...

266
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,940
us to crawl underneath your crotch?

267
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,550
I don't have much patience.

268
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,150
If you don't come down before I grab my sword,

269
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,040
your dinner meal tonight shall be served on the path to the netherworld.

270
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,840
- Go back.
- What?

271
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,180
The moment you unsheathe a sword in my territory,

272
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,690
you're going to be slammed dead.

273
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,590
What?

274
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,740
You wait there, son of a bitch!

275
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,800
Anyone who moves shall have a hole through their head.

276
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,660
This time it's the back of the hand,

277
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,420
but if you utter nonsense one more time,

278
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,450
you will find an arrow pierce through the middle of the mole on your face.

279
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,320
The speed at which the arrow was shot was so fast and also accurate!

280
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,550
I have no words to present before you, Your Royal Highness.

281
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,710
Interesting.

282
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,960
- Have you seen these types of arrows?
- It's a baby arrow.

283
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,930
- Baby arrow?
- It's also called pyeonjeon. It's short and hard to handle,

284
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,600
yet powerful. That is what I heard.

285
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,360
He's called Seung Nyang, right? Go and request a showdown.

286
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,100
- I will take him on directly.
- Your Royal Highness!

287
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,910
Why are you so surprised? Do you distrust my skill?

288
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,440
Rather have me entertain him.

289
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,110
When it comes to shooting arrows, I have never lost to anyone.

290
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:48,460
With these two eyes, I will confirm that guy Seung Nyang's skills in person.

291
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,680
Over there! That guy with a bow is called Seung Nyang.

292
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,970
Compared to your reputation, you look quite effeminate.

293
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,020
I didn't come to get my face graded by a thing like you.

294
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,310
You dare in whose presence—

295
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,250
Your shooting skills are quite something, they say.

296
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,830
If you compete with me and win, I will leave here with no complaints.

297
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:39,040
In exchange, if I win, you become my subordinate.

298
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,130
- How about it?
- I don't have time to play with you, punk.

299
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,190
If you don't want to die, leave immediately.

300
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,940
You bastard!

301
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,670
Son of a bitch.

302
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,370
If you don't want to spill the blood of your subordinates,

303
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,510
it would be best to willingly accept my proposal.

304
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,440
Let's confirm that you agreed to back off if I win.

305
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,230
How can a real man go back on his word?

306
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,810
If we are only to shoot arrows, it wouldn't be fun.

307
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,660
We will drink this soju every time we shoot.

308
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,690
- How about it?
- Are you saying let's drink then shoot?

309
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,820
It will end up being a fight of mental strength.

310
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,430
Leader, you're weak on alcohol.

311
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,620
Why? Are you hesitant?

312
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,530
You're not going to give up now before even grabbing your bow?

313
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,570
Let me make a proposal.

314
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,540
The bullseye will be the lid of this alcohol vat.

315
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,870
And the lids will be on the heads of one of our subordinates.

316
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,650
- What?
- Amongst us, who shall become the target?

317
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,460
I shall! I will.

318
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,680
I will do it. Let me!

319
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,420
Have someone there also volunteer.

320
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,310
It seems they all are distrustful of your shooting skills.

321
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,750
I...

322
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,600
I will volunteer.

323
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,060
You...

324
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,700
know how to play well.

325
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,940
You're very drunk.

326
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,440
If you were to give up now...

327
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,570
Oh my!

328
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:55,300
In terms of being drunk, the same goes for you. Go down it!

329
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,420
You also down it!

330
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,500
Drink! Up!

331
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,080
I'm okay. Shoot, Leader!

332
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,060
No, don't.

333
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,180
The target is over there!

334
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,910
I would rather kill you, bastard.

335
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,190
Then, will you give up?

336
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,130
With your own mouth admit that you lost, hurry!

337
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:16,050
Did you see that? I won! I have won!

338
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Why is my chest warm?

339
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,100
This son of a bitch has puked!

340
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,050
Vomit?

341
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,910
Because our cooperative leader is buying,

342
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,740
be sure to drink and eat a lot!

343
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,970
Let's drink!

344
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,790
What are you peeping at?

345
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,130
Have a drink here if you've awakened.

346
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:40,210
Looking at you, it doesn't seem like it is your fate to roll around in the streets like dog poop.

347
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,290
Then, what does my fate look like?

348
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:47,190
You're probably a wasteful good-for-nothing spilling money thanks to meeting good parents.

349
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,830
Well, I'm not sure if I did meet good parents

350
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,880
but I am a good-for-nothing.

351
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,570
Do you know how to play geomungo (a type of zither)?

352
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,100
Shall I teach you geomungo?

353
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,260
It's fine. What is the use in learning such a thing?

354
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,780
There's nothing like this for winning the favors of girls!

355
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,610
Well, I will teach you geomungo

356
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:24,230
and you should teach me how to shoot baby arrows. How about it?

357
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,600
Now, try to tug on a string.

358
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,120
It isn't as hard as it looks.

359
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,230
What are you doing?

360
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,100
What do you mean? Be still.

361
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,670
For a hand that shoots, your hands are smooth.

362
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,180
Let's play a fast piece.

363
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,830
I must go.

364
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,270
What do you mean go? It's time for you to teach the baby arrows.

365
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,410
Live plucking the geomungo and chasing women

366
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,310
rather than the bow. That's more suitable.

367
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,090
Have you forgotten the shooting match?

368
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,450
You are my subordinate from this moment.

369
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,960
Go when I say go. Come when I say come.

370
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,060
I am your owner.

371
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,080
You should go and raise a passing dog.

372
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,350
I am a dhole (wolf).

373
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,770
If you don't want to be my subordinate, what about my younger brother?

374
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,350
Let it only be known to you

375
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:30,810
that a best friend of mine, we consider each other as brothers,

376
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,640
is the crown prince of this land.

377
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,450
So, if you become my younger brother,

378
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,810
you also get to have this nation's crown prince as your older brother!

379
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,810
Are you still going to reject me?

380
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,990
Go tell the three-heir (homonym) or the four-heir

381
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:54,240
that rather than becoming king by selling young subjects to become concubines and eunuchs,

382
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,740
it is better to eat horseshit.

383
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,890
You have much disgruntlement with the world, I see.

384
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,890
Because it's as rotten as they come.

385
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,580
Royal Family, the court, and even the officials who parasite off them,

386
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,440
all of them are rotten and bent.

387
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,690
Next time, if you are to prank in this manner,

388
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:22,050
then instead of the alcohol vat lid, the arrow will pierce your face.

389
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,140
You are too much of a waste to rot as a thug.

390
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,950
What brings you here?

391
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,800
What have you said to those people?

392
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,620
They picked a fight.

393
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,090
But who are they?

394
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:58,050
Didn't they ask about the salt smuggling?

395
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,350
There was no such conversation.

396
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,110
Are they here to investigate the salt smuggling?

397
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,760
If His Royal Highness were to find out you associated with them, he would be angry.

398
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,340
Do not meet them again.

399
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,250
Yes.

400
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,130
Is it today that you find the owner of that bandana?

401
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:28,080
There's no doubt, this person will appear soon.

402
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,440
This kid flew into the Office of the Auditor.

403
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,640
It's something you need to know.

404
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,420
If you want to find out King Simyang's salt smuggling,

405
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,600
wear the bandana and go to the tea house in Inju.

406
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,340
This was sent by messenger.

407
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,960
I will go myself. To fool the eyes of King Simyang,

408
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,800
will be easier for me than you, Auditor.

409
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,040
It is dangerous, Your Royal Highness.

410
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,200
Send this to the messenger inside by putting it in the cloth

411
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,300
since I also need to recognize him.

412
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,190
In case things go awry, state that I am an auditor.

413
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,690
Understood, Your Royal Highness the Crown Prince.

414
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,410
Why is it that he hasn't appeared, but you have.

415
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:29,120
Since that person's circumstances are not opportune, he sent just the information concerning the salt smuggling.

416
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,980
What about the time and location of the clandestine exchange?

417
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,750
According to the person who sent the message...

418
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,400
It's an assassin!

419
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,700
You must flee immediately.

420
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,560
There's a traitor!

421
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,620
Without one, how can a mere royal auditor

422
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,370
know in such detail about our salt smuggling?

423
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,040
Without a doubt, it's probably the resellers.

424
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,070
There's no reason there would be a traitor among us.

425
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,700
How many know about the smuggling on the reseller side?

426
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,070
Th-Three, Your Highness.

427
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,350
Three, you say?

428
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,280
Including the three here, that's six total.

429
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,250
Don't your faction thugs know, too?

430
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,900
They only deliver. They don't know anything about those involved.

431
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,430
Governor, manage the reseller side.

432
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,980
Yes, Your Highness.

433
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,850
You may all take your leave.

434
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,650
Yes, Your Highness.

435
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:37,320
The crown prince doesn't know about this yet, does he?

436
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,270
Before the royal auditor opened his mouth,

437
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,040
my arrow pierced his heart.

438
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,480
But are you sure there's a traitor among those three men?

439
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:51,110
What I'm sure of is that Seung Nyang is the one I trust the most.

440
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:56,860
You must not stray your eyes from the crown prince for not even a moment. Understood?

441
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,450
Yes, Your Highness.

442
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,040
There's a spy among us.

443
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,490
If not, the royal auditor couldn't have been silenced like that.

444
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,920
I'm sure it's one of Jeom Bak's subordinates.

445
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,560
Please, it's not safe here. Please hurry and return to the palace.

446
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,980
King Simyang has noticed that I was sharpening my blade.
(T/N: preparing to fight)

447
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,890
If I retreat, I will be cornered to the edge of a cliff.

448
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,500
Then, what are you planning on doing?

449
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,250
- I will shake him.
- Pardon?

450
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,110
They say King Simyang has nothing to fear in Goryeo,

451
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:33,940
but he's at least fearful of the Yuan court.

452
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,880
First, dry up all of the salt in Inju by buying it all.

453
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,450
The tradespeople from Yuan will become angry for making a vain effort.

454
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,690
That's when you'll spread gossip that the reason for lack of salt

455
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,820
is because King Simyang is profiteering off of salt trafficking. Let that slip on the sly.

456
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:57,130
Crown Prince used his head, I see.

457
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,750
Your Highness, this isn't the time to give him compliments.

458
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:06,980
We can't smuggle the salt because the crown prince's people are guarding the salt storage house all day.

459
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,920
If Yuan learns of our salt trafficking—

460
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,880
Don't worry about that.

461
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,530
The person who's illegally trading salt isn't me,

462
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,430
but the crown prince.

463
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,960
Your Highness, it's Seung Nyang.

464
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,730
Come in.

465
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,680
You're the only one I can trust.

466
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,660
Listen carefully to what I say from this moment.

467
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,770
You must carry it out without a single deviation.

468
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,630
Bestow your order.

469
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,830
The anxious one will move first.

470
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:01,350
King Simyang will attempt to relay false information to me.

471
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:05,500
I just need to wait. Who will come to see me...

472
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,360
who that will be...

473
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,020
Cooperative Elder, sir

474
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,320
You have a guest.

475
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,030
Guest?

476
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,560
You're Seung Nyang.

477
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,890
What brings you here?

478
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:29,880
You asked me to teach you to shoot baby arrows. You forgot already?

479
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:37,590
The person King Simyang sent... is it you, Seung Nyang?

480
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,760
If you don't want to, then carry on with your plucking of the geomungo.

481
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,400
Why wouldn't I want to?

482
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,160
Jeonchutaesan. Extend your hand with strength as if you are pushing a large mountain.

483
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,350
Huakhomi. With the other grip, pull as if pulling on a tiger's tail.

484
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,050
Jeonchutaesan.

485
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,650
Huakhomi.

486
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,590
Give me your hand.

487
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,530
There's no need to be disappointed.

488
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:32,110
To properly shoot aegisal (baby arrows) takes at least three years.

489
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,330
What is there in Inju that makes money?

490
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:41,730
If I knew, would I leisurely be here to teach you how to shoot baby arrows?

491
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,560
From the rumors, they say salt makes money.

492
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,300
Because it makes money, that's probably why the royal family regulates it directly.

493
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,620
Right. You said you are friendly with the crown prince, right?

494
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,160
Can you get the salt rights then?

495
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,710
This boy is not the spy.

496
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:08,780
Until I skillfully shoot baby arrows, would you stay by my side?

497
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:13,680
You must first gain that person's trust.

498
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,460
I'm saying you must get him to trust you well.

499
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,460
Why aren't you answering?

500
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:22,060
My services are quite expensive.

501
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,620
In terms of money, I am confident.

502
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,820
Let's go out for some drinks.

503
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,480
Because starting today there's a lantern festival, there'll be a lot to see.

504
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,430
What did you wish for?

505
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,620
What are you going to do knowing someone else's wish?

506
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,090
Did you wish for a pretty wife?

507
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,260
What wife.

508
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,260
Why are you so adamantly denying it?

509
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:19,340
It's not any embarrassment for a man to fancy women.

510
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:23,700
Look, tell me what kind of women suits your fancy. If you just say so—

511
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,640
I wished to earn a lot of money.

512
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:30,640
Money, money, money. How is it that when you open your mouth it is all about money?

513
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,190
There's nothing you can trust in the world besides money.

514
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,360
Your life is quite pitiful, I see.

515
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,050
What happened?

516
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,350
It won't kill me.

517
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,320
This won't do. Get on my back.

518
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,160
It's fine.

519
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,450
What are you doing?

520
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:43,620
Won't you put me down?

521
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,910
Since you had been injured in trying to save me, remain still.

522
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,290
Let go!

523
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:51,050
I said let go! Let go!

524
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:52,570
Let go!

525
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,740
Won't you let me go?

526
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,260
To have even gotten hit instead of him!

527
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,980
Anyway, the work seems to be progressing well.

528
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,220
Bear it for a bit longer. We've arrived.

529
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,850
Let me down.

530
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,500
Cooperative Elder!

531
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,590
What happened, Sir?

532
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,170
I said to let me down!

533
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,420
Stay still. You bled a lot.

534
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,580
I shall take him.

535
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:29,350
It's okay. Move.

536
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,240
Hold on a bit.

537
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,300
Luckily the wound isn't deep.

538
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,650
I will get the medicine.

539
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,410
There, let me have a look.

540
00:48:58,410 --> 00:48:59,870
I-It's okay.

541
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,820
I said let me see.

542
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,100
I... said it's fine. Why are you being like this?

543
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,960
I said let's look.

544
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,200
I only have one piece of clothing.

545
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,490
Since you ripped it,

546
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,820
you must compensate me.

547
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,560
What?

548
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,430
Why did you lock it? Open up.

549
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,880
What is it?

550
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,740
Didn't you say to compensate for your clothes?

551
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:08,350
I brought clothes for you to change in, so open the door.

552
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,380
I don't need it, so just go.

553
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,680
What kind of man is so shy!

554
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,370
Gosh! Come on!

555
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:19,140
I said to just go.

556
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,570
No need to yell.

557
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,220
I heard that guy was completely hoodwinked.

558
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,070
Are your injuries okay?

559
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:44,940
My life is yours, Your Highness.

560
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,210
Listen well.

561
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:52,700
On the day of the deal, go load the salt at the storage and be on standby.

562
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,900
I'll tell you the location of the transaction at that time.

563
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,810
It's not that I don't trust you.

564
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:05,530
It's because I don't want to be the least bit suspicious of you.

565
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,490
Then, what should I tell him?

566
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:15,290
That day, you could have died while protecting me.

567
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,830
How could you be so reckless?

568
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:20,720
I have received a saving grace from you, so I'll make sure to pay that debt.

569
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,110
Never mind. Grace, my butt.

570
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,010
It's the one who's watching me.

571
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,970
But why did they want your life?

572
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:37,610
Not sure. I wonder.

573
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:41,340
Is it because you are investigating the salt smuggling of King Simyang?

574
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,920
If it's that, I can help you.

575
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,840
How can you help?

576
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,820
Among my close contacts, there's someone who knows those in the state salt dealership well.

577
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:01,270
So it was you. The one who was sent by King Simyang.

578
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:06,990
In four days, there will be a deal going down in a tavern called Haeweoljang in Byeokrando (Bluewater Swift Crossing, a pier).

579
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:13,240
It's valuable info, so gather plenty of money at the ready.

580
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,720
I should have killed him.

581
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,160
No way...

582
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,200
Have I become fond of that kid?

583
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:51,770
Make my private soldiers lie in ambush in Haeweoljang. When the crown prince shows up,

584
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:54,310
he must be killed and gotten rid of.

585
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:59,040
Even if he's a fool, he's the crown prince of this country. To kill him is...

586
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:05,050
If you kill him without justification, there will be backlash.

587
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:09,640
But we're killing a thief who smuggles salt.

588
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:16,710
Let's go to Haewoljang!

589
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:20,410
Cooperative Elder, Sir! Sir!

590
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,610
It doesn't seem to be the way to Haewoljang.

591
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,450
Listen up.

592
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:32,340
We will face salt thieves on the way.

593
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:36,530
We must never attack first.

594
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,450
- Got it?
- Yes.

595
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,390
- Sir.
- It's the salt thieves.

596
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:56,220
Before they get to the location to make the deal,

597
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,840
we can never attack them first.

598
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,310
- Tell everyone again.
- Understood.

599
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,890
Let's go now.

600
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,590
It's an ambush.

601
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,290
Look.

602
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:18,190
Who shot that arrow?

603
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,750
Run!

604
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,980
Remove the cover.

605
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:21,360
Hey! Hey!

606
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,610
Did they open their mouth on the location of the deal?

607
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:30,810
They say only the punk named Seung Nyang knows, and no one else does.

608
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:35,240
But how did you find out that Haewoljang was the fake information?

609
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,530
This...

610
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:41,060
flew into my bedroom.

611
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:48,700
On that note, it said that Haewoljang was a fake location

612
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,080
and that Seung Nyang would be the one delivering the salt.

613
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:56,890
But... why did you keep it a secret from us, too?

614
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,860
I was told there was a spy among those around me.

615
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:03,550
Then the one who sent the headband also sent the note?

616
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:06,070
The person who first reported to the Office of Auditing

617
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:07,790
is helping me.

618
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:10,600
Who could that person be?

619
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,810
I am dying to find out who he is.

620
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:18,970
Exactly who has the headband that I sent...

621
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:50,990
But after killing off all the wenches who ran away,

622
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,770
there aren't many left. I think we'll have to, unfortunately,

623
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:56,760
gather more tributary girls.

624
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,010
Whether it be gathering hundreds or thousands of

625
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:03,160
mere tributary girls is nothing.

626
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,160
Thank you,

627
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,820
King Simyang. Here.

628
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,910
This person is King Simyang's spy.

629
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:56,280
♫ I am dangerous, so my love ♫
[4Men - Thorny Love]

630
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:02,020
♫ Is such that the more you love me, only you may be hurt ♫

631
