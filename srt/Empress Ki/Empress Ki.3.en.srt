1
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,260
It's getting dark.

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,210
Let's speed up. We can't let the Prince of Yuan die on our land.

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,240
If the prince dies, Goryeo will have to take responsibility.

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,530
And how do you intend to take responsibility?

5
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,790
Prime Minister El Temür wants Goryeo to be incorporated into Yuan, doesn't he?

6
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:40,940
So do you intend to do what Prime Minister El Temür wants?

7
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,730
How foolish it is to wage a war when we cannot win.

8
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,830
We have learned that lesson well for the past 30 years.

9
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:56,500
It's not a waste to throw away a nation's title for the sake of its people in misery.

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,820
You're very wise indeed.

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,070
Please communicate my thoughts to Prime Minister El Temür.

12
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,250
To solidify my position with Yuan,

13
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,190
I will need your help, Your Highness.

14
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,700
Of course, I will help you.

15
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:24,900
But how will General Bayan kill the prince?

16
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,550
- What about the band of robbers?
- They will attack tonight between 11:30-12:30 p.m.

17
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,620
Have all the soldiers near the temporary palace withdraw at that time.

18
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,400
I don't want any of our men fighting in this raid.

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,510
Yes, Uncle.

20
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,890
Who are you?

21
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,220
I... I am...

22
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,470
Who are you to be hiding in my quarters?

23
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,600
How dare you? Do you know who I am?

24
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,270
So that's why I'm asking you.

25
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,860
Say it. What are you trying to steal?

26
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,100
- How much did you see, you sleazy rat.
- You are being insolent!

27
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,160
- Insolent?
- Do you know who I am?

28
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,590
- Who are you?
- I'm the Great Yuan's...

29
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,880
soldier.

30
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,950
Okay, you are such a great person, huh?

31
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,930
Since you snuck in like a rat, I'll kill you like one.

32
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,080
Let... Let's negotiate!

33
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:21,290
If you would only let me leave, I'll grant you a fortune.

34
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,340
Oh, so you're a deserter?

35
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,830
No, I'm— Just get me past the eastern perimeter.

36
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:37,050
Then, I'll repay you with grace.

37
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,970
Come with me.

38
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,540
Wa-Wait! Let me go!

39
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,500
- Huh? You!
- Shut up and come.

40
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,120
Wait! Where are we going?

41
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,290
Oh, come on.

42
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,640
Wait! Where are we?

43
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,080
Clean up all this manure.

44
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:16,020
Have it done by dawn or I'll report you as a deserter. Understood?

45
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,260
Wa-Wait! Wait, wait!

46
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:27,670
I am the brother of the Emperor of the Great Kingdom of Yuan.

47
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:39,790
Help me. If you just get me out of this camp, I'll make you rich beyond your dreams.

48
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:46,100
- Your Highness?
- Yes. You'll never get another chance like this.

49
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,730
- First, I must pay my respect—
- Never mind that.

50
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,790
Paying your respect in this stinking muck?

51
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,250
If you are the prince, I'm the Jade Emperor.

52
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,920
There are Goryeo soldiers guarding outside, so don't even think of running away.

53
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,590
Why is he still not coming?

54
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,720
Your Highness, you must hurry!

55
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,230
Your Highness! How are you feeling?

56
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,730
It's already late, so we'll stay until Lord Jang brings your dried persimmons.

57
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,410
So please get some rest.

58
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,100
Your Highness, are you all right?

59
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,510
Where are all the Yuan soldiers at while ours are here?

60
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,400
Their rotation time is already long past but there is no sign of them.

61
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,470
Come to think of it, I haven't seen any of the Yuan soldiers in their quarters.

62
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,110
What are they up to anyway?

63
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,820
An attack!

64
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,440
Attack!

65
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,690
We'll hold them here. Seung Nyang, you go get the prince!

66
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,750
What are you doing! Move!

67
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,270
Yes, Sir!

68
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,480
The prince is in the temporary palace.

69
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,640
Find the prince. And kill him!

70
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,850
Hurry and come out!

71
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,640
Hurry and come out, I said.

72
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,760
Why are you here?

73
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,590
I don't know, he told me to stay here like this.

74
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,550
Follow me.

75
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,670
I can't. He told me to not take one step out until morning.

76
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,140
If you stay here, you will die.

77
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,450
Hurry and take those clothes off.

78
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,450
Hurry up already.

79
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,520
Here! This is where he is!

80
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,550
Follow me.

81
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,360
Stay right behind me.

82
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,420
So we finally found you.

83
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,520
That guy is the brother of the Yuan Emperor.

84
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,880
You are wrong. This guy is not the brother of the Yuan Emperor.

85
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,610
Kill him.

86
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,120
Please let me live.

87
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,110
The prince is dead. Withdraw.

88
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,790
- Withdraw!
- Withdraw!

89
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,790
- Withdraw!
- Withdraw!

90
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,830
Kkweo Bo? Kkweo Bo!

91
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,140
Mom...

92
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,170
Mom is waiting...

93
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,750
Kkweo Bo!

94
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,940
The prince is dead. His Highness has passed away.

95
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,130
His Highness has passed away.

96
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,390
His Highness has drawn his last breath.

97
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,790
Your Majesty, the late emperor,

98
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,600
do not forgive this Bayan.

99
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,080
Everyone leave now.

100
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,010
Your Highness,

101
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,550
I pray for your easy passage into eternity and in your next life, please be born

102
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,070
where there is no power struggle.

103
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,630
Am I drunk?

104
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,770
That's not His Highness, is it?

105
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,170
I am bewildered.

106
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,410
What is going on? Why is this boy lying here?

107
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,860
The prince is alive. We must find him quickly.

108
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,360
It's too late. I'm sure that he ran away with Lord Jang by now.

109
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,270
Your Highness...

110
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,600
You're here, Lord Jang?

111
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,810
You deserve divine punishment! What have you done to His Highness?

112
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,500
Your Highness. Your Highness! Let go of me.

113
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,650
Your Highness! Please forgive my failure to my duties, Your Highness.

114
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,000
Your Highness...

115
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,440
His Highness is still in this camp somewhere.

116
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,890
No one must find out about this, no one in Goryeo, and not even our Yuan soldiers.

117
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,100
I will go and find him myself.

118
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,360
So the brother of the emperor is still alive?

119
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,150
I am certain that the dead body was a eunuch.

120
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:38,370
Then that means we won't be blamed for this crime.

121
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,220
We've been saved, Commander.

122
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,130
Then, where is the Prince now?

123
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,690
As the prince lost his life on Goryeo land,

124
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,770
Goryeo must take responsibility for it.

125
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,000
Please turn over his body to us.

126
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,150
He may have passed away, but we will still escort him to Gaegyeong.

127
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:06,020
Shut your mouth. We will take his body and return to Yuan.

128
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,870
And as soon as you arrive at Gaegyeong, you will all be beheaded.

129
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,390
Let's go.

130
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,590
They are hiding the prince.

131
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,150
We can't just let this happen. We have to find the prince.

132
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,790
But we don't know his face, how can we find him?

133
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,800
But we can't let ourselves die so unfairly, can we?

134
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,480
Everyone split up and look around this area.

135
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,400
Since they are in Goryeo, they probably couldn't hide him too far away.

136
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,000
Your Highness?

137
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,950
Your Highness?

138
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,110
Who? Who are you?

139
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,870
This rat-like bastard.

140
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,060
Everyone is fighting for their lives, and you hide to save yourself.

141
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,270
There is no one here.

142
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,320
Your Highness?

143
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,490
General Bayan.

144
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,750
I am, of the Great Kingdom of Yuan,

145
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,820
the brother of the emperor.

146
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,820
No way. Is it him?

147
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,650
Just what is going on? Why are you hiding, looking like this?

148
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,660
In any case, the heavens have helped you. There could have been a disaster.

149
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,130
Please save me, General Bayan.

150
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,750
Please don't kill me.

151
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:36,560
No, let's say that I did die yesterday, and just let me go, General.

152
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:43,560
I know that you're doing this because you can't disobey the orders of Prime Minister El Temür.

153
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,260
But you can't do this to me, General.

154
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,190
- Think of the grace that my royal father, the late emperor, showed to you.
- Your Highness.

155
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:58,430
I don't want to die like this. Please, please let me go, General.

156
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,510
Please stop crying.

157
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,940
Then you will let me live?

158
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,870
The reason I am in this position is thanks to your father, the late emperor.

159
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:15,460
- How can I forget his grace?
- General.

160
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,840
No one must know that you are alive.

161
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,810
Please hide here for now.

162
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,590
Thank you. Thank you. I will never forget your great deed.

163
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,540
Thank you, thank you.

164
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,120
Thank you.

165
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,690
Lord Jang will come after preparing a hideout.

166
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,360
I will live there as if I am dead.

167
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,190
I vow this to the gods of Heaven and Earth.

168
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,970
Your Highness, the world is a chaotic place.

169
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,160
Please rest well in the afterworld.

170
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,810
General!

171
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,880
The King of Goryeo has just arrived.

172
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,880
What? The King of Goryeo came here?

173
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,830
- That is correct, General.
- We understand, so leave for now.

174
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,030
Put away your sword.

175
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,440
General Bayan?

176
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,820
His Majesty is waiting for you. Please come out now.

177
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,210
Tell me what happened.

178
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,430
So the brother of the emperor really died?

179
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,200
Your Majesty, about that...

180
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,870
We suffered a brutal slaughter by a band of robbers last night.

181
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,860
- Come out.
- What? What?

182
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,010
Hurry and come out.

183
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,060
Hold on! Wait! Why are you doing this?

184
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,090
No, I can't go out.

185
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,200
I do not think that his death is Goryeo's fault.

186
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,080
Whatever you think,

187
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,320
you have committed a dereliction of duty that can't be cleansed even if you flipped over every mountain in Goryeo.

188
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,890
Aren't you the ones who did this?

189
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,510
The robbers only wanted the prince's life, rather than any money or valuables.

190
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,880
There is certainly another story behind this death.

191
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,950
Another story, you said?

192
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,970
Your Majesty, the brother of the emperor's body is fake.

193
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,320
What do you mean by that?

194
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,320
This body is the eunuch who served the prince.

195
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,530
The real prince is alive.

196
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:50,470
How dare you? What are you saying?

197
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,870
Let me go! Come on!

198
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,890
Seung Nyang.

199
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,650
Who are you dragging like that?

200
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,680
He is the Prince of Yuan.

201
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,110
Ah, Seung Nyang. So that's your name, huh?

202
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,120
Where is His Majesty?

203
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,050
Chief Yeom?

204
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,490
Oh, right, Seung Nyang. Well done.

205
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,870
I will escort the prince, so you stay here.

206
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,870
- Follow me.
- Where? Where?

207
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,180
I will not forget your rudeness. So remember this, boy!

208
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,660
The prince who was well

209
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,540
has become a cold corpse due to you. And now you're speaking nonsense,

210
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,260
saying that the prince is alive?

211
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,130
I know the face of the brother of the emperor.

212
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,140
If this body is not him,

213
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,360
all of you can only leave Goryeo as dead bodies.

214
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,930
You may be the king of Goryeo,

215
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,060
but I cannot forgive you for touching our precious royal family member.

216
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:26,090
Once we confirm this body, we will know who must beg for forgiveness.

217
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,560
It's burned by fire?

218
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,870
We cannot tell what he looks like, Your Majesty.

219
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:43,850
The body was burned by the fire arrows the robbers shot.

220
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,270
Can you still recognize him?

221
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,490
How hot it must have been! Just thinking of the suffering of His Highness,

222
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,210
it wouldn't be enough for us to chew you up into pieces.

223
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,790
Your Majesty, this is not the brother of the emperor.

224
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:00,820
- They purposely did this to the body...
- Shut up!

225
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,390
I will make sure that the Royal Court in Yuan sees what has become of this body.

226
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,410
So King of Goryeo, be prepared.

227
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:13,530
Your Majesty! I found him.

228
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,100
This guy is the brother of the Emperor of Yuan.

229
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,500
General Bayan.

230
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,870
Your Highness.

231
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,060
Your Highness, what has happened?

232
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,080
You were alive? We thought you had died.

233
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,060
The heavens have helped you. What are you doing? Escort His Highness.

234
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,890
Yes.

235
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,150
What is your name?

236
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,880
My name is Yeom Byeong Su.

237
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,100
How did you find the brother of the Emperor of Yuan?

238
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,710
I was certain that they had hidden him

239
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,090
so I was searching the barracks.

240
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,280
You have saved Goryeo.

241
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,960
Your Majesty.

242
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,670
I will not forget your great deed.

243
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,710
I am honored, Your Majesty.

244
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,260
Yeom Byeong Su.

245
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,870
Make sure to record that name.

246
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,530
Yes, Yeom Byeong Su.

247
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,890
I can remember that.

248
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,030
Yeom Byeong Su. Quite a name.

249
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,160
You may rise.

250
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,300
Crown Prince or whatever, go tell him.

251
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,590
Rather than becoming a king by dragging away young girls to offer as concubines and eunuchs,

252
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:47,470
it would be better to live eating horseshit.

253
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,810
Your Majesty.

254
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,590
To imagine that he was a king, and not a royal inspector.

255
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,250
I'm about to go crazy.

256
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,580
Did you do it?

257
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,520
I made sure no one could see the corpse's face just in case.

258
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,780
Thanks to you, we got over a hurdle, but now the big trouble begins.

259
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,690
Prime Minister El Temür will not let us live.

260
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,300
We still have a chance.

261
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,430
To win Prime Minister El Temür's favor,

262
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,440
I accepted such a dirty job.

263
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,820
I, King Simyang, greet you, Your Highness.

264
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,390
We greet you, Your Highness.

265
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,230
Your palace is so cozy. It's nice.

266
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,020
How do you feel visiting Goryeo?

267
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,880
The way you look and the way you live isn't so different from the people of Yuan.

268
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,700
Haven't Yuan and Goryeo pledged brotherhood as nations?

269
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,830
How about just switching over your nationality to Yuan now?

270
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,000
If you do that, Goryeo's people will live more comfortably—

271
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,200
Heaven forbid!

272
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,300
Goryeo is Goryeo, and Yuan is Yuan.

273
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,800
They have different blood, how can they become one nation?

274
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,270
What did you say?

275
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,650
How dare you raise your voice to His Highness?

276
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,320
You haven't yet extended proper greetings to His Highness. So back off

277
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,990
and observe your manners.

278
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,210
What are you doing, not offering your greetings to His Highness?

279
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,270
Your Majesty, please greet him.

280
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,890
Please greet him!

281
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,290
Wow, have you seen anyone so rude?

282
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:26,670
What did I say that was wrong? Why is the Goryeo king getting so angry?

283
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,950
- Our military?
- They are on guard.

284
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,540
Have them protect the prince's quarters tonight.

285
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

286
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,610
Just what is going on? How is the brother of the emperor still alive and well?

287
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,410
He figured it out and escaped.

288
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,360
This is truly frustrating.

289
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,480
What will you do when the Prime Minister El Temür finds out about this?

290
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,880
The final destination of the exile is Daecheong Island.

291
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,910
We will escort him there, so there are plenty of chances left.

292
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,910
Once you arrive at the island, assassination will become more difficult.

293
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,320
However, there is no need to rush.

294
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,510
This event has caused His Highness to trust in General Bayan even more, so it's made our job easier.

295
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,650
You must not make the same mistake again.

296
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,930
Don't worry.

297
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,400
I, Bayan, will personally roll up my sleeves

298
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,630
and end the life of His Highness.

299
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,580
General Bayan.

300
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,210
You must return to the palace. It's a big disaster.

301
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,380
What do you mean "big disaster"?

302
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,270
How dare you block our way?

303
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,950
His Majesty has ordered that no one may enter.

304
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,480
His Highness the Prince is inside.

305
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,740
Do you dare to lock up His Highness?

306
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:53,010
Unless His Majesty commands, you cannot set one foot inside.

307
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,600
How dare you?

308
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,830
Lord Jang, bring me some water.

309
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,810
Jang—

310
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,900
Did you ask for me?

311
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,640
Where is Lord Jang?

312
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,190
I don't know who Lord Jang is,

313
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:33,750
- but I will be serving you from now on, Your Highness.
- Lord Jang...

314
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,990
Gosh. It's not as if you're a baby's rattle. Lord Jang! Lord Jang!

315
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,360
No one from Yuan is here, so please hurry and eat.

316
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,090
And have some rice cakes.

317
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,670
This is all because of that guy Seung Nyang.

318
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:59,770
Who is Seung Nyang? Did you meet someone on your way here?

319
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,930
If only he didn't find me.

320
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,220
What do you mean, he found you?

321
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,680
It wouldn't be enough satisfaction to beat him to death.

322
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,980
Your Highness, General Bayan is here.

323
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,840
What have you just done?

324
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,670
How dare you lock up our prince?

325
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,330
I'm not locking him up, I'm protecting him.

326
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,840
So, who are you protecting him from?

327
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,060
The people who are trying to kill him.

328
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,840
We will take care of the prince from now on.

329
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,840
Until he reaches his exile destination, Daecheong Island, not one person from Yuan can accompany him.

330
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,070
I will tell you honestly.

331
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,670
I am the one who disguised the prince as a soldier.

332
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,210
I am the one who protected his life.

333
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:02,020
If I didn't protect His Highness from those brutal robbers, Goryeo would not be safe.

334
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,880
It wouldn't be enough if you thanked me—

335
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,780
I will make sure Prime Minister El Temür learns exactly how hard you've worked.

336
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,830
I've heard that Prime Minister El Temür regards the prince as a thorn in his eye.

337
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:16,800
Since you saved his life, Prime Minister El Temür will be so happy

338
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,890
that he beheads all of you.

339
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,490
What are you saying to me right now?

340
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:29,690
Return to Yuan tomorrow. If you want to live, you better keep your mouths shut and do what I say.

341
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,450
What brings the King of Goryeo here?

342
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:59,940
Lord Jang, no, please summon General Bayan.

343
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,310
He will return to Yuan tomorrow.

344
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,750
He's going to Yuan? Then what about me?

345
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:12,740
We cannot allow even a single soldier from Yuan to go to Daecheong Island with you.

346
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,750
I am the Prince of Yuan. How can you be so blasphemous towards me?

347
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,230
Blasphemy, huh?

348
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:30,870
Didn't you say that you will change Goryeo's nationality to Yuan?

349
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,250
So, what about it?

350
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:38,280
Do you really not know what that means?

351
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,610
The people of Goryeo were struggling and in pain.

352
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,450
And I was just trying to help our brother nation—

353
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,010
Do you really not know why our nation became this way?

354
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,800
You are being insolent. How dare you?

355
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,460
Shut your mouth. And listen to me clearly.

356
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,630
The one keeping you alive right now is not Yuan, but Goryeo.

357
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,320
I can't even protect my own people

358
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,580
but I have to keep you safe. Can you imagine how wretched I feel?

359
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,730
Why are you doing this to me? What did I do?

360
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,250
Even if you die,

361
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:23,500
go to Yuan to die. You must not spread your dirty body on our land

362
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,270
and cause harm to Goryeo. Do you understand?

363
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,440
I understand.

364
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,550
Where did everyone go?

365
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,170
Lord Jang...

366
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:59,220
General Bayan...

367
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,240
- Seung Nyang, he said?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

368
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,910
The one who found the prince is not Yeon Byeong Su but an officer named Seung Nyang.

369
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,530
Find him and bring him to me.

370
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:21,540
The Seung Nyang you are looking for is a thug. I'm sure that it's a different person with the same name.

371
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,860
Even if he is not the Seung Nyang I am looking for, he deserves a reward.

372
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:30,720
But that guy named Yeon Byeong Su,

373
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,850
what do you plan to do with him?

374
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,460
I have to make him pay for what he did.

375
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,420
Hurry and find that person named Seung Nyang.

376
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,750
His Majesty didn't forget about me, did he?

377
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,210
How could he? You did a great deed, so I'm sure he will summon you soon.

378
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,500
Maybe I'll be promoted to palace guard

379
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,000
or maybe a royal inspector? That would be nice.

380
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,010
I'm sure you can have any position you want.

381
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,860
Indeed, what would have happened without me?

382
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:09,080
We would have all been beheaded, and His Majesty may have even been dethroned—

383
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,220
Hey, he came.

384
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,050
His Majesty sent someone.

385
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,740
- Welcome.
- His Majesty is well?

386
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,630
Is there an officer here named Seung Nyang?

387
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,490
- Seung Nyang?
- Didn't His Majesty send you here?

388
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:45,600
Of course, I'm here because His Majesty sent me. Why else would I ever come here?

389
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,280
But why are you asking for Seung Nyang instead of me, Yeon Byeong Su?

390
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,570
Yeon Byeong Su? Are you joking?

391
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:57,820
You would steal the great deed of your subordinate?

392
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,950
Seung Nyang? This person came to see you.

393
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,860
You're him! You are that Seung Nyang.

394
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:20,250
Hey, boy, where have you been? His Majesty has been looking so much for you.

395
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:27,230
Oh, really. You look exactly like you did back then.

396
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,880
His Majesty, I've brought Seung Nyang.

397
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,950
Hurry and go in.

398
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,290
Hurry.

399
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,600
Your crime has been found out.

400
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,390
I've committed a crime punishable by death, Your Majesty.

401
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,060
So tell me yourself what crime you've committed.

402
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,710
I've caused Your Majesty to be cursed.

403
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,110
And?

404
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,760
I've dared to touch the king's face.

405
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,560
And?

406
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,100
Please kill me, Your Majesty.

407
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,390
Where have you been all this time?

408
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,950
Huh?

409
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,970
I wanted to see you so much that my heart burned and my blood ran dry.

410
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,410
So if that's not a crime punishable by death, what is?

411
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,590
Your Majesty?

412
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:12,070
You awful boy. If you ever dare to leave my sight again,

413
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,460
I will shove you in the pig pen.

414
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,910
Get up.

415
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,640
I'm happy to see you, Seung Nyang.

416
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:44,060
I really missed you. I am so happy.

417
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,850
My name is Yeom Byeong Su.

418
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:01,600
He is Ki Ja Oh's subordinate, and they escorted the exiled prince.

419
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,890
If you properly follow my orders, you will escape your small post

420
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,400
and enjoy abundance for yourself and your future generations.

421
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,870
I am awe-struck, Your Highness. Please give me your orders, whatever it is.

422
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,380
Kill the Prince of Yuan.

423
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:22,660
Since General Bayan cannot accompany him on the way to Daecheong Island,

424
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:27,940
you end the prince's life yourself.

425
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,420
Can you do it?

426
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:40,370
I will make sure to carry out your command.

427
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,880
You may leave now.

428
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,260
Yes, Sir.

429
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,640
Did you say that he is a subordinate that Ki Ja Oh trusts?

430
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,330
To ax one's own foot (be stabbed in the back), isn't a trusted ax the easiest?

431
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:05,720
Bayan's failure has become an opportunity for me.

432
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,140
If I can win the favor of Prime Minister El Temür,

433
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,380
this nation's royal throne

434
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,290
will become mine.

435
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,350
You don't need a rich family background to succeed.

436
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,460
Why not me?

437
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,890
Who says this Yeon Byeong Su can't succeed?

438
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,980
So live viciously.

439
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,840
Vicious

440
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,710
and tough.

441
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,560
Your Majesty, preparations for our travel are complete.

442
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,170
You have a heavy responsibility. You must not let the prince be harmed.

443
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:09,130
I, Ki Ja Oh, accept your royal command.

444
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,070
What happened to Bayan and his party?

445
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:15,100
Everyone returned to Yuan except for Lord Jang.

446
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,710
- Lord Jang?
- He is someone who shared the same viewpoint as the prince.

447
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,720
I believe that he is careful, and you don't need to worry about him.

448
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:28,510
I will give you an important mission.

449
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,150
You must protect the prince from now on.

450
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,470
Become his shadow and examine his every movement.

451
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,290
Do you understand?

452
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,520
You must not allow even a single mistake. Do you understand?

453
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,700
- Yes, we understand!
- Yes, we understand!

454
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:00,110
You have to get well soon.

455
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,090
Your bud has not yet bloomed. How can you suffer so from illness?

456
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:13,660
Your Highness, Prime Minister has arrived.
(Empress Dowager Budashiri)

457
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:21,240
I did not know you would be here, Your Highness the Empress Dowager.

458
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,140
What brings you here, Prime Minister?

459
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,170
What do you mean?

460
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,930
I have stayed up all night worrying about His Majesty's health.

461
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:34,240
Someone who worries so much exiles his brother who will succeed his throne

462
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,610
to the faraway land of Goryeo?

463
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,910
You know that it was the will of the Royal Court.

464
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,470
And at whose beck and call is the Royal Court?

465
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:51,090
The only flaw that I possess is that I care too much about protecting our nation.

466
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:55,210
I'm sure that is true.

467
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,570
Your Majesty.

468
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,050
Your brother who was exiled to Goryeo

469
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:22,260
was killed by the blade of robbers, I hear.

470
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,000
So please stop struggling

471
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:29,740
and pass onto the afterlife now.

472
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,010
If you are alone here, it will get boring.

473
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:36,370
So hurry and

474
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,810
join your older brother, shouldn't you?

475
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:43,330
Father, Bayan has just arrived.

476
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:47,550
- Did he bring the prince's body?
- About that,

477
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,960
he said that he failed.

478
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:54,220
These idiots.

479
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,160
Did you hear that?

480
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,060
So don't die yet.

481
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:15,710
For Yuan's sake, you can only die after your brother does.

482
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:29,560
Please stop! Please let us go.

483
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,360
Tanqishi, please stop.

484
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,390
Weren't we friends before?

485
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:41,930
Please go easy on us.

486
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,980
Shut your mouth!

487
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,160
You failed to carry out Prime Minister's orders.

488
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,250
And you dare to want to live?

489
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,110
What are you doing? Beat them until they're dead!

490
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:58,340
Tanqishi? Tanqishi!

491
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,040
Prime Minister.

492
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,310
Please kill us.

493
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,640
I've committed a crime punishable by death.

494
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,780
Don't hit us like this. Please just kill us instead.

495
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,860
Why did you return before going to Daecheong Island?

496
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,980
King of Goryeo figured out our plan.

497
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,490
You stupid idiot.

498
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:34,940
You went all that way, and you can't break a little child's finger?

499
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:39,100
There are not enough words to express my apology.

500
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,010
- Imprison them.
- Father,

501
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:43,680
they have committed a great crime.

502
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,930
We must immediately kill them and feed them to the vultures.

503
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,070
It's not the time to take their lives.

504
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:59,050
How dare you?

505
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:03,380
How dare you bring shame to my father?

506
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,720
Uncle, are you all right?

507
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,210
Yeah. Just you wait.

508
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:34,450
If I don't die this time, Tanqishi and Talahai,

509
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,060
I will tear them to pieces with my hands.

510
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,560
Daecheong Island.

511
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,410
Daecheong Island?

512
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:48,960
Now that they've arrived at the island, an assassination won't be easy.

513
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,230
And if the King of Goryeo figured out our plan—

514
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:56,120
In all my life, I have never allowed anyone to live once I've decided to kill them.

515
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,690
Whether that was my enemy or the emperor, not anyone.

516
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:06,350
If the Prince reached Daecheong Island, that must become his grave!

517
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,090
Royal Father?

518
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,280
Don't come near. You must not.

519
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,550
Royal Father!

520
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:56,770
Son, my son.

521
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,740
- Royal Father...
- Don't die.

522
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,690
You must live

523
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:10,800
and avenge my death.

524
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,490
Royal Father...

525
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:15,220
You are the one

526
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:19,110
who must take the throne...

527
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,570
Royal Father? Please don't die, Royal Father.

528
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,390
Royal Father?

529
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,070
Don't come.

530
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,430
Don't come near.

531
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,840
Don't come near me.

532
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,020
It will be a while until daybreak.

533
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,000
Please sleep some more.

534
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I need to pee.

535
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,090
Hey.

536
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:20,450
I have never undone my waist sash myself.

537
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:25,100
Didn't you say you will serve me? I really need to go pee.

538
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,360
That's right.

539
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,740
Just pull it off.

540
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:50,050
I've never pulled off anyone's underwear either.

541
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:54,060
- What did you say?
- Pee in your pants or not. Do whatever you want.

542
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:15,440
What? He's never undone his own waist sash before?

543
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,000
Please eat.

544
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:46,530
If you're tired, go take a nap somewhere.

545
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,450
I'm fine.

546
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:51,680
Well, I'm not. Please just be gone from my sight.

547
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,130
His Majesty commanded me to assist you, Your Highness.

548
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,810
You're about to drive me crazy.

549
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,330
Aren't you sick of it, too? You are human after all, so how could you not be?

550
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:06,740
I am only following my owner's command.

551
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,860
Uh... exc—

552
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,470
King of Goryeo grabbed me by the collar.

553
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:21,520
If I become Emperor of Yuan, I will return that indignity to him, 1,000 times over.

554
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,410
And you will need to make sure to watch.

555
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,340
I will make him beg me until his hands become as calloused as his feet.

556
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,410
He will cry and wail for me to save him.

557
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:32,640
He is the one who will make our Goryeo powerful.

558
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,530
He will never kneel in front of anyone, no matter what.

559
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:40,140
How nice for you to have such a nutcase as your king.

560
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,350
Even animals can recognize a great deed, they say.

561
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:49,070
So don't forget that the person protecting your life right now is him.

562
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,380
Oh, darn it.

563
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,540
You're working hard.

564
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,960
Is it time to switch shifts already?

565
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:22,560
I wish I had some rice wine.

566
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,070
I have a bottle of soju in my quarters.

567
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,230
And you want me to drink that?

568
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,530
Just leave a little for me.

569
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:32,430
All I have is you. Thanks.

570
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:51,090
Seung Nyang, are you outside?

571
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,790
Bring me some water.

572
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,990
Seung Nyang?

573
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,970
Seung Nyang, boy?

574
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,590
Aren't you sleeping yet?

575
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:08,220
We're going to have a drink. Do you want some, too?

576
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,890
The prince is alone right now.

577
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:11,870
You better go to him, then.

578
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,850
Seung Nyang, this—

579
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:20,870
Stop. That ring?

580
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:28,690
Wasn't that yours, Hyeongnim?

581
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,660
Where have you been? Why are you so late?

582
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:03,050
Go and bring me some water. My throat is burning.

583
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,860
And when you return, bring me some dried persimmons if there are any.

584
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:28,830
Oh, really! Is he deaf?

585
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,360
Who are you?

586
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,040
Seung Nyang?

587
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:50,340
Who sent you?

588
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:55,840
♫ Because I’m dangerous, my love ♫

589
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:02,370
♫ The more you love me ultimately the more
only you may be hurt ♫
