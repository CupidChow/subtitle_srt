1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,720
- Father! Please wake up!
- Prime Minister!

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,690
Please wake up!

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,260
Father! Father!

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,410
Look!

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,370
The servant who tested the wine has died.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,490
That El Temür is surely going to die.

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,930
- That's not all good news right now.
- Why is his death not good news?

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,110
Since His Majesty gave him the wine, who do you think will get blamed?

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,390
You should get away from here for now, Your Majesty.

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,620
That would seem even more suspicious,

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,850
so we should wait and see what happens to El Temür.

13
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,320
Your Majesty, Prime Minister El Temür has barred anyone from entering.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,470
Open the door.

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,170
Hurry up and open the door!

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,230
Your Majesty, you mustn't be here.

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,970
Prime Minister El Temür has collapsed.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,350
What do you mean?

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,270
I think he was poisoned.

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,530
- Is he dead?
- The empress's physician went over, so we should hear back soon.

21
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,670
He's dead.

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,640
I'm certain...

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,140
he died.

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,860
You should go and confirm it yourself.

25
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,350
Please open your eyes, Father!

26
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,600
Why does he keep vomiting?

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,360
It seems that his internal organs have been damaged.

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,970
Do whatever you can to feed him the antidote! Hurry!

29
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,860
Move aside!

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,080
Here!

32
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,880
You must swallow this medicine. That's the only way you'll live, Father!

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,380
- Father!
- Father, please!

34
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,520
Father! You mustn't, Father!

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,300
What's going on, Brother? He keeps vomiting blood!

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,400
Do something, Brother!

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,330
Do you hear that, Father? The man who caused your unnatural death

38
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,090
is vomiting blood right now.

39
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,310
They are crying tears of blood, Father!

40
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,040
Please, Father!

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,790
Go arrest Wang Yoo!

42
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,370
General Bayan! What are you doing?

43
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,620
Hurry up and arrest Wang Yoo!

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,410
Your Majesty.

45
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,290
The wine was switched. Someone poisoned El Temür.

46
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,670
Then he had knowledge of your plans?

47
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,800
Whatever happened, if El Temür dies, it's a good thing for us, too.

48
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,920
But... I'm worried

49
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,890
you might be put in danger.

50
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,870
Don't worry about me. I have my own plans.

51
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,660
Sinner Wang Yoo, accept your punishment!

52
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,170
Sinner?

53
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,520
What sin have I committed?

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,960
Are you asking because you don't know?

55
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,550
Why did you try to kill Prime Minister El Temür?

56
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,200
I have never tried to kill him.

57
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,990
Poison was found in the wine you gave him. Are you denying it?

58
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,930
If I had planned to kill him, I wouldn't have offered him a poisoned wine so foolishly.

59
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,160
Silence!

60
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,820
Hurry up and arrest this deposed king.

61
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,560
Yes, Sir!

62
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,160
Sheath your swords.

63
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,150
They're trying to put the blame on you!

64
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,750
I said, sheath your swords!

65
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,590
Your Majesty!

66
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,590
I'll return soon.

67
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,620
Take him away!

68
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,860
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

69
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,880
Do you want to be an accomplice?

70
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,070
What's the reason for his arrest?

71
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,330
Reason?

72
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,010
If Prime Minister El Temür dies, you would be the happiest person over anyone.

73
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,740
But why are you hell-bent on catching the culprit?

74
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,350
If you're doing this because of me,

75
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,090
it's cowardly.

76
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,930
Don't be mistaken.

77
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,080
Do you think I would go this far because of you?

78
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,450
You will see how powerful I am,

79
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,990
why I am the emperor, you will come to see very clearly.

80
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,950
Your Majesty...

81
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,190
Open it.

82
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,320
I can't let you live any longer.

83
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,410
I was trying to be restored to the throne by helping Prime Minister.

84
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,270
It's impossible that you don't know that I did not do this!

85
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,750
Whatever happened, you're the one who came up with the idea.

86
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,580
Because of your so-called great scheme, my father ended up in that state!

87
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,900
In the end... whether I'm the culprit or not,

88
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,060
you still want to kill me.

89
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,690
And so... you're going to have to die now.

90
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,450
I feel sorry for your father.

91
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,490
What?

92
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,790
The enemy, I'm sure,

93
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,300
is among the people inside the ger. Haven't you thought about the fact that

94
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,340
the moment you kill me, they will be laughing at Prime Minister El Temür?

95
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,430
- Silence!
- If it was up to Prime Minister El Temür,

96
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,960
he would have used me to catch those people.

97
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,780
That's the difference between him and you.

98
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,100
You will never... surpass your father!

99
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,820
Silence!

100
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,160
Stop!

101
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,150
I heard everything. Let him go.

102
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,930
Your Majesty, he—

103
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:29,260
Your trivial feelings don't matter to me.

104
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,290
Will you please help us?

105
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,290
I tried to help and ended up here.

106
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,900
People make mistakes.

107
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,380
Please forgive us for hurting your feelings, Wang Yoo.

108
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,960
First, I would like to meet with Prime Minister.

109
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,570
Come with me.

110
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,970
His pulse has slowed and his pupils are dilated. The chances of him surviving are low.

111
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,820
He was suspicious of the ministers gathered in the ger.

112
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,290
I am aware.

113
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,710
Tell General Tangqishi to follow through with the original plan.

114
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:43,830
If the traitors believe your father is dead, they will show themselves.

115
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,960
I will pretend to help them and find out their plan.

116
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,900
What do I do if I want to meet with you?

117
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,070
I'll meet you at ja-si (11:30 p.m. - 12:30 a.m.) at the hall.

118
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,690
Thank you, Wang Yoo.

119
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,340
I've thought about who could have switched the wine.

120
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,550
Who is that?

121
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,600
Bayan.

122
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,460
Why do you think that?

123
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,870
He disobeyed El Temür and saved the emperor on Daecheong Island.

124
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,580
He looked for the bloodletter under the emperor's orders, too.

125
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:48,040
If this is something only close associates of El Temür could have carried out, Bayan is the most likely.

126
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,390
The Captain of the Imperial Guard was probably killed by Bayan, too.

127
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,260
Then... he is the one.

128
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,530
What will you do with them?

129
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,140
I'll think of ways to exploit them.

130
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,900
How are the ministers in the ger?

131
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,070
I hear they're all watching their words and being careful of their actions.

132
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:23,920
Unless someone takes the lead, the plan of bringing El Temür's family down could all go up in smoke.

133
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:32,530
If we waste time like this, Tanqishi is certain to take El Temür's place.

134
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,980
How about going to the temple for prayer?

135
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,150
You're telling me to pray to Buddha over this matter?

136
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,920
Empress Dowager prays to Buddha every day at dawn.

137
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,280
Empress Dowager?

138
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,230
I didn't know your devotion to Buddha was this deep.

139
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,540
Your Highness the Empress Dowager.

140
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,790
What are you so earnestly praying for?

141
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,270
I was praying for me to meet you.

142
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,020
Do you have something to say to me?

143
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,480
What's the reason you've left El Temür's family alone?

144
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,810
Do you still fear them?

145
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,540
Animals tremble in fear just from seeing the skin of a tiger.

146
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,770
While under Prime Minister's vast shadow, there have been no ministers who have come forward willingly to help me.

147
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:58,240
If the piece of meat in the mouth of a dead tiger is huge, it'll be a different story.

148
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,420
Each minister is dreaming of his own individual goal while working together.

149
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,020
If you exploit their dreams,

150
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,740
making them unsheath their swords for your sake

151
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,430
won't be an impossibility.

152
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:19,120
By chance, the person who wrote the mysterious document was...

153
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,390
It was me.

154
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,150
What's the reason?

155
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,260
To get restored to the throne as King of Goryeo.

156
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,160
For that, it would have been quicker to win Prime Minister El Temür's favor.

157
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,380
King Simyang was Prime Minister El Temür's right-hand man.

158
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,820
But he ended up meeting a miserable end.

159
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:52,310
Rather than helping El Temür, I thought it would be better to fight for that person.

160
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,150
By "that person" you mean...

161
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,870
You, Your Highness.

162
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,810
I will become a source of strength for you.

163
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,080
Please promise to restore me to the throne.

164
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,400
That's General Bang Jin of the privy council.

165
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,660
He's the most loyal of El Temür's faithful servants who helped him in his conquests.

166
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,020
I've seen him once in the Great Hall while I was a court lady.

167
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,940
I heard he holds the most military authority after El Temür.

168
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,390
This is a country we built with all of our efforts!

169
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,690
Of course!

170
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,480
We have to leave this country forever to our descendants.

171
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,900
That's right! You are correct!

172
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,060
Minister of Military Joo Guk Cheong. He's sharp and has a way with words,

173
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,760
so he's gained the full trust of El Temür.

174
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,810
Not too long ago, I saw him raise his voice in front of the emperor with Bang Jin.

175
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,800
They both have an immense desire for power.

176
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,640
- Seung Nyang, I need your help.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

177
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,160
Go meet the empress.

178
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,670
Tonight, I will meet those men with Empress Dowager.

179
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,210
Welcome, General Bang.

180
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,600
Why did you ask for me?

181
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,270
I have something I need to discuss with you urgently.

182
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,300
Please go ahead.

183
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,790
Please take over the Prime Minister post.

184
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,020
We can't place a cane where the pillar has crumbled.

185
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,300
If we need roof support, it needs to have that same length and width.

186
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,640
Then... you're asking me to...

187
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,460
I'm asking you to be Prime Minister of this country.

188
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,420
- Your Highness!
- But you need to do something before that can happen.

189
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,880
Wang Yoo.

190
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,210
Wang Yoo.

191
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,400
Huh?

192
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,560
He must not be here yet.

193
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,570
His Majesty can't come.

194
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,660
Aren't you... a court lady at the Imperial Palace?

195
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,470
I'm no longer a court lady.

196
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,560
I received a great favor from Prime Minister.

197
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,400
Why are you trying to leave the palace?

198
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,120
There's someone I have to meet once I leave here.

199
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,820
That person, was it Wang Yoo?

200
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,070
You're pitiful, too. A one-sided love...

201
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,350
His Majesty's words are,

202
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:52,350
"The privy council's Bang Jin and the Minister of the Military, Joo Guk Cheong, are planning a rebellion by gathering soldiers.

203
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,940
Tell General Tanqishi to inform the Capital Defense Force ahead of time

204
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,420
and get ready to mobilize its troops at any time."

205
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,320
What? A rebellion?

206
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,850
- Did you say the military?
- I'm certain Tanqishi will try to mobilize the Capital Defense Force.

207
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,770
Can you block them?

208
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,930
If it was Prime Minister El Temür, it would be impossible to block;

209
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,260
but Tanqishi, I can definitely block them!

210
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,920
Tell the Defense Force ahead of time not to dispatch its troops.

211
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,440
- I will do so, Your Highness.
- I heard El Temür commands a sizeable private army.

212
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,440
It will be too difficult with only your soldiers, so work with Joo Guk Cheong.

213
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,260
Pardon? Why Joo Guk Cheong of all people?

214
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:47,480
You're the one who will become the Prime Minister anyway. First, we need to make sure we succeed.

215
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,440
I understand, Your Highness.

216
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,580
It's been a while, Lieutenant Joo.

217
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,420
Why did you want to see me at a place like this?

218
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,980
Please become this country's Prime Minister.

219
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,580
- Pardon?
- Bang Jin and Joo Guk Cheong are planning a revolt?

220
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,850
Yes. They're gathering soldiers in secret.

221
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:32,810
They experienced life and death alongside Father. How could you suspect them just because of what Wang Yoo told you?

222
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:37,030
- We'll soon see if it's true or not.
- What do you mean?

223
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,990
I've put a minion on every ministers' tail who were present in the ger.

224
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,180
General, an imperial guard is outside.

225
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,640
Bring him in.

226
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,190
- I'm back, General.
- Did you find out?

227
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,320
I tailed General Bang Jin of the privy council,

228
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,980
and he just went into the Minister of the Military, Joo Guk Cheong's house.

229
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,990
What? General Bang Jin and Joo Guk Cheong?

230
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,820
Aren't they sworn enemies?

231
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:18,370
Wang Yoo was right. What reason would enemies meet in each other's houses?

232
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,330
Watch them even more closely!

233
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,270
Yes, Sir.

234
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,190
Don't suspect Wang Yoo anymore.

235
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,320
It makes me feel ashamed to watch you behave that way.

236
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,530
I need to move Father to the house. Prepare for it quietly.

237
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,850
Yes, Brother.

238
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,810
Where are you going?

239
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,950
Where are you headed to all of a sudden?

240
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,780
I was worried about Prime Minister, so I was headed to the empress' quarters. How is he?

241
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,040
Thankfully, he regained his consciousness, so we were taking him home.

242
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,930
I should give him my good wishes then.

243
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,670
He's sleeping right now.

244
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,200
Sleeping? Not dead?

245
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,890
Even if he's sleeping, I'd like to see him so that I can feel relieved.

246
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:50,560
The air's cold, so maybe next time.

247
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,790
Let's go.

248
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,700
I need to see him with my own eyes!

249
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,140
He's not well yet. How could you be so stubborn?!

250
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,040
Did you forget he locked me up in my room and nailed it shut already?

251
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,840
- Who is being stubborn!
- Your Highness!

252
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,970
What are you doing? Open it up.

253
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,560
Yes, Your Highness.

254
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,890
How dare you draw a sword!

255
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,700
Watch carefully. I'm Prime Minister El Temür's eldest son.

256
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:32,580
Causing me anger means enraging my father! Do you understand?

257
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,520
Let's go!

258
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,020
- Lord Jang.
- Yes, Your Highness.

259
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:00,000
El Temür's dead body's in there. He's being carried out right now.

260
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,350
It seemed that way to me as well.

261
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:09,650
Go and tell General Bang this news. We'll have to move up the day of the revolution.

262
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,990
Understood, Your Highness.

263
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,850
Tonight, everyone, have a drink and get a good rest.

264
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:35,530
Yes, Sire. Our Majesty was promised reinstatement. If we don't drink on a day like today, when would we drink?

265
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,990
Let's drink up before day breaks!

266
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,200
Cheers!

267
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:50,430
When we go back to Goryeo, what is everyone going to do?

268
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,620
Seung Nyang, what are you going to do?

269
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,950
What do you mean? She'll have to get married.

270
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:02,540
Wow. I wonder what bastard would take her as his bride. He's lucky.

271
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,520
It's like getting a giant windfall!

272
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,160
Hey. How can you say... "bastard?"

273
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,540
What? Oh! By chance, do you like her?

274
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,800
- This rascal!
- Since when did you like her?

275
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,180
- I need to go relieve myself.
- Yes, Sire.

276
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,730
What should we eat first?

277
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,050
- What?
- You're so clueless.

278
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,860
- You should just go die!
- I'll pull your mole off!

279
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,590
Why are you ganging up on me?

280
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:05,620
Even when we go back to Goryeo, will you be on my side forever?

281
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,350
I'm on your side already now, Your Majesty.

282
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,390
I don't mean it like that.

283
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:20,670
Even if you abandon me, I'll always be on your side forever.

284
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:31,920
Here, take this. I bought it when we went to the market.

285
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,370
If we end up returning to Goryeo,

286
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,080
will you be my queen?

287
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,630
If you accept, please put that in your hair.

288
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,310
If you can't give me an answer now,

289
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,150
I'll wait until tomorrow.

290
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:01,250
This is something I like. Eat it and tell me if it's okay.

291
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,130
♫  On the solitary moon ♫

292
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,970
Don't go.

293
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,100
♫  I will wish for you ♫

294
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,100
♫ My plaintive words mixed with tears asking just once again just once for you ♫

295
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,200
The first thing I saw was you.

296
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:28,380
♫  Even though they were hard to erase and erase the painful memories  ♫

297
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,950
When I broke out of the shell, to me,

298
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,040
you were my mother bird.

299
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,690
♫  make our sad love sadder ♫

300
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,910
♫  No matter how I try and try to conceal them ♫

301
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,930
♫  the tears keep filling my eyes♫

302
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,670
♫  What can I do about the longing ♫

303
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:01,100
♫ which runs and overflows like tears?♫

304
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:07,790
Cheong Cheon Yoo Wol Nae Gi Si.

305
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:12,810
Ah Geum Jeong Bae Il Moon Ji.

306
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:20,210
The moon in the blue sky, how long has it been there?

307
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,810
I ask...

308
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,350
Are you awake?

309
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,970
Would you like some water?

310
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,400
- Get out.
- Your Majesty.

311
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,280
I said leave.

312
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,570
Your Majesty, General Bayan is coming in.

313
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,660
Your Majesty, have you heard the news?

314
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,990
Emperess Dowager ordered Bang Jin and Joo Guk Cheong to take down El Temür's family.

315
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,070
That's good. Tanqishi was like a thorn in my eye.

316
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,740
What do you mean? The one who killed El Temür was me.

317
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:28,180
People who were standing idly by took all the credit! What do you mean it's good?

318
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,780
I am well aware of all the good you've done.

319
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:36,230
If Bang Jin and Joo Guk Cheong have mobilized, I'm sure the prime minister's seat was promised to each of them.

320
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,190
That position should be mine!

321
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,480
What can I do about something

322
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,610
- the Empress Dowager has done?
- Your Majesty!

323
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,350
- Please leave.
- Your Majesty.

324
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,910
I said I will reward you for your good deeds.

325
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,450
What is His Majesty doing so early in the morning?

326
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,200
I know he's been standing in front of Seung Nyang's room.

327
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,910
Did you sleep well?

328
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

329
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,660
Then, I'll go meet with the empress.

330
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,880
How about bringing in General Bayan, too?

331
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,610
Not him, we can't.

332
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:53,900
He can be very useful. Why are you opposed?

333
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,960
Your Highness, General Bayan is here.

334
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,900
Even a tiger comes when talked about, they say.

335
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,440
Let him in.

336
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,440
I'll take my leave.

337
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,500
All right, Wang Yoo.

338
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,340
What brings you two here?

339
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,470
I heard that the privy council's General Bang Jin is getting rid of El Temür's family.

340
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,330
Who's been talking such nonsense?

341
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,480
We will aid you with our strength. Please trust us, Your Highness.

342
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,850
There's nothing for you to do in this matter.

343
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,880
- Your Highness.
- You may leave.

344
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,300
We killed Prime Minister El Temür.

345
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,190
I was right, just as I thought.

346
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,980
You'll see if you ask His Majesty.

347
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,700
We are the meritorious subjects, Your Highness.

348
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,630
And? Are you asking for the Prime Minister seat?

349
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,820
If you go by merit, more than anyone—

350
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,400
So because you wanted the Prime Minister seat,

351
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,810
you've been controlling His Majesty who doesn't know anything!

352
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,360
He wasn't like that before.

353
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,780
He would ask me about even the smallest things and did what I asked.

354
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,420
That kind of person

355
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:27,040
committed something so unbelievable without a word to me! You made him that way!

356
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,140
That's a misunderstanding, Your Highness.

357
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,530
Anyone who controls His Majesty without my consent,

358
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,980
I will not trust, no matter who it is.

359
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:48,290
Once El Temür's family is gotten rid of, Empress Dowager's world will open up.

360
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,460
Only the person who moves the strings has changed,

361
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,810
the emperor is still a puppet.

362
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,640
Damn it.

363
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,420
I killed a tiger and the fox rises to power.

364
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:04,290
But... isn't it suspicious that Wang Yoo is meeting with her?

365
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,950
There's nothing to be suspicious about.

366
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,760
I was already on her side.

367
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,360
I would like to give you two an opportunity.

368
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,850
I will convince her, so don't worry.

369
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:59,600
I don't think Bayan and Toqto'a will align with anyone else.

370
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,790
How did things go?

371
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,710
We brought Bayan and Toqto'a to our side.

372
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,140
That's good.

373
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,320
Hey, Seung Nyang,

374
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,380
what's that in your hair? It's pretty.

375
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,580
Wow, it is pretty!

376
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,870
Are you that happy to see her wearing a decorative hairpin?

377
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,480
Maybe I should

378
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,530
wear one, too.

379
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,850
Do you want me to stick one in your bald head?

380
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,180
- You call that a joke?
- I'm being serious.

381
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,840
If you stick it in my head, it'll bleed. No wonder you don't have a woman.

382
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,060
Seriously.

383
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,610
Your Majesty!

384
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,500
What brings you here?

385
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,410
I missed you so I came. Are you complaining?

386
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,640
- Y-Your Majesty.
- Stay still.

387
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,150
Now that I think about it,

388
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,600
there's not much I know about you.

389
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,510
How did you...

390
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,380
end up living as a boy?

391
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:16,660
Tell me. What grudge did you have toward King Simyang?

392
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,700
15 years ago...

393
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,970
do you remember releasing the tribute women

394
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,580
in Hwangjoo?

395
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,660
How do you...

396
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,950
know about that?

397
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,810
That's something...

398
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,630
I still remember vividly.

399
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,460
I couldn't forget the young girl who was being

400
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,020
whipped alongside her mother,

401
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,800
so I opened the cell door for them.

402
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,890
Run away. That's all I can do for you.

403
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,780
Sorry.

404
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,760
Open those up, too.

405
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,440
Nyang.

406
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:25,600
The tribute women who ran away at that time...

407
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,460
so many of them died.

408
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,290
That girl's mother, also...

409
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,620
died, I heard.

410
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,810
That girl, too, probably died somewhere.

411
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:51,410
I made a mistake. Because of me, they died.

412
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,890
Back then, if I only hadn't opened those doors...

413
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:04,410
those precious lives could have been...

414
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,280
I killed them.

415
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,860
I did...

416
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,940
It's not your fault, Your Majesty.

417
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,180
She didn't die.

418
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,030
That girl...

419
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,370
is me.

420
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,580
Never once...

421
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,360
have I ever blamed you.

422
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:56,820
I heard you've suffered so much from that incident.

423
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:19,920
You saved my life, Your Majesty.

424
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,330
You were that girl.

425
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,220
That girl lived...

426
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:14,160
♫ Love is such a sad word to me that it's maddening ♫

427
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,070
♫ Even if my heart aches some words must be endured ♫

428
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:27,980
♫ Even if dawn breaks with tears and my heart falls apar ♫

429
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:38,400
♫ I love you are the words I can't say ♫

430
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:48,110
♫ How much more do I have to cry before
you will know how I feel? ♫

431
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:58,120
♫ I can't last even a day without you ♫

432
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:11,350
♫ You are my last person ♫

433
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:15,530
When can the prime minister return to the palace?

434
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,020
He has gotten much better.

435
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:24,320
He insisted on returning right away, but my brothers are stopping him.

436
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:36,070
Your arrogant face will disappear soon from this palace, too.

437
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:43,710
I will take my leave now. Please carry on.

438
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,690
Was it tonight?

439
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:58,190
Yes. Once tonight passes...

440
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:04,420
the emperor who was taunted until now will change.

441
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:08,540
Your Majesty, the world belongs to me now.

442
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:13,710
How I have looked forward to this day. Do you have any idea?

443
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,700
You said it was tonight at hae-si? (9:30 p.m. - 10:30 p.m.)

444
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

445
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:50,270
Please make sure to capture the traitors alive.

446
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:57,530
Those who did that to my father, I will watch them suffer as they die.

447
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:15,030
What are you talking about? The Capital Defense Force cannot come?

448
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:21,290
Someone called Bang Jin of the privy council already got to them and blocked them.

449
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,520
Father, if only you were alive.

450
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,960
Father!

451
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,850
General.

452
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,070
General Bayan has arrived with the Imperial Guard.

453
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,440
Welcome, Bayan.

454
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:48,260
Now that you're here, I feel like we've got 1,000 soldiers and 10,000 horses.

455
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,060
I'm sorry for being late.

456
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:57,160
But in the end, he still passed away.

457
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:04,240
Prime Minister, please forgive me for my disloyalty.

458
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:22,880
How nice for you! I wish I could return to Goryeo, too.

459
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,700
Be good to Court Lady Noh.

460
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:31,020
Don't worry. We Goryeo people are good at sticking together.

461
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,210
I've smelled this scent before. What kind of tea was this?

462
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:49,790
Licorice bean soup. Only Prime Minister El Temür drinks this in the palace.

463
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:53,060
And he drinks it five times a day, at that.

464
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:58,560
He is very particular, so learn it well and avoid mistakes.

465
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,220
Yes, Head Eunuch.

466
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:07,110
To make it, use black beans, wax tree berries,

467
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:11,360
and licorice root. They are brewed for at least one hour.

468
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:18,530
It requires effort and time, so make sure to prepare it first thing every morning.

469
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,160
It's definitely licorice bean soup.

470
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,650
Does the empress drink licorice bean soup?

471
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,880
I think she does. Court Lady Seo makes it and brings it to her every day.

472
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,510
- She doesn't ask any of the palace maids?
- She doesn't.

473
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:57,090
- Since when?
- Not sure. A few days?

474
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,490
Head Eunuch.

475
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:03,280
Yang, what are you doing here?

476
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,330
The empress drinks licorice bean soup, I hear.

477
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:12,240
That cannot be true. Her Majesty gets hives when she eats beans.

478
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,550
What is the effect of licorice bean soup?

479
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:18,840
It is very good for detoxification...

480
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,620
You told me that no one drinks it except Prime Minister El Temür.

481
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:29,480
Prime Minister El Temür drank it often in order to gain the ability to fight poisons.

482
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:34,880
I've also heard that other servants have been forbidden to enter the empress's quarters.

483
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:39,740
Yangyang? Yangyang?

484
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:44,060
No way... Prime Minister El Temür?

485
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,890
It's Danashiri. Do you recognize me, Father?

486
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:19,580
Lower your voice. Come closer.

487
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,850
Prepare an empty coffin.

488
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,470
Father.

489
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:36,210
Winning and losing depends on who fools the enemy first.

490
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:04,890
When they find out that you are alive, Father,

491
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:07,900
they will be scared out of their wits.

492
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,650
Have you heard from Tanqishi?

493
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:16,970
The Capital Defense Force arrived in secret. They're lying in wait for the ambush.

494
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:23,810
The rebel forces won't know what hit them.

495
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:27,380
How could they know unless they were ghosts?

496
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,680
So who is there right now?

497
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,220
General Bayan and Wang Yoo have joined hands.

498
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:42,380
Once they attack, Bayan, Toqto'a, and Wang Yoo's true natures will be revealed.

499
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:48,130
Whether they are jade or rocks, whether they are friend or foe.

500
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,490
Father?

501
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:20,080
Who are you going to see in such haste?

502
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:25,210
Prime Minister El Temür is alive.

503
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,700
A dead person is alive?

504
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:34,130
No one has seen his body, have they?

505
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:42,760
Please go to the empress's quarters and confirm it for yourself. He is definitely alive.

506
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,690
There are many eyes on us in the palace.

507
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:25,830
Since we can't meet often, let's signal each other with ribbons in front of the Imperial Guard.

508
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,830
If Tanqishi found out our plans,

509
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,090
the blue ribbon will be tied.

510
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:38,430
If we find any enemy spies, yellow ribbon.

511
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:49,670
And the white ribbon, let's use it when things are most dangerous.

512
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,630
The most dangerous? What could that be?

513
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:03,270
Consider all unforeseen situations.

514
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:12,570
The most dangerous thing would be if the dead El Temür comes back to life, huh?

515
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,740
Don't you agree?

516
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,000
Don't you think so, Seung Nyang?

517
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,050
Your... M-Majesty.

518
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:40,320
Why are you so shocked? Announce me to the empress now.

519
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,760
His Majesty has arrived!

520
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,820
You must not let him know yet that I am still alive.

521
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:11,530
I dozed off suddenly. What brings you all the way here?

522
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:45,880
I was planning to spend the night here tonight, but you seem very tired.

523
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,780
I lost sleep for a few days, worrying about Father.

524
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:52,800
Then you better get some rest.

525
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:06,370
Then please rest comfortably.

526
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:32,520
Licorice bean soup!

527
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,040
Yes?

528
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:39,090
Yang was correct.

529
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,590
Prime Minister El Temür is in there.

530
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:47,900
Dispatch the elite guard eunuchs now.

531
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,610
But why the elite guard eunuchs?

532
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,940
Prime Minister El Temür must be killed.

533
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:01,310
Your Majesty.

534
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,890
General!

535
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,410
General, they have finally come.

536
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:14,520
The Capital Defense Force?

537
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:19,810
The moment we send the signal, the rebel forces will be annihilated.

538
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:50,980
When the fight begins, behead Tanqishi first.

539
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,890
You can behead Talahai.

540
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,200
Yeom Byeong Soo's neck is mine.

541
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,890
Got it.

542
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:21,130
Children of the traitor, come out now and surrender.

543
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,310
Shut your mouth!

544
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:26,540
Get rid of them!

545
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,210
Seung Nyang.

546
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,930
It's a white ribbon.

547
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:55,930
Does this mean El Temür is alive?

548
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:07,020
♫ No matter how hard I erase them ♫

549
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:11,060
♫ they appear again ♫

550
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:18,050
♫ those painful memories made our sad love even sadder ♫
