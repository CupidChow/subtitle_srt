1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,550
You've come out, Your Majesty?

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,220
What is all this?

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,140
They are things to be put in Heungdeok Palace.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,490
Well, let's take a look. I'm curious to see what you've chosen.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,830
There isn't much to see.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,300
No need to be shy.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,550
Your Majesty.

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,930
Is this something I shouldn't see?

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,520
It's not like that.

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,220
Out of my way.

11
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,160
What's wrong, Emperor?

12
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,090
Hurry and bring these things inside.

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,730
Everyone, move them in now.

14
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,370
What is all this gold for?

15
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,360
Chief Yeon

16
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,920
said she wanted to give it to the emperor for granting an exclusive contract, so I told her to bring it.

17
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,900
I'm sorry. I didn't have a way to request to see you directly.

18
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,620
So I requested Chief Imperial Consort.

19
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,860
Do you expect us to believe this?

20
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,660
If not, just what are you thinking right now?

21
00:01:53,660 --> 00:02:00,650
Emperor, command them to immediately inspect all these things.

22
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,090
If there is gold in the other boxes, this certainly means—

23
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,860
Open the other boxes.

24
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,370
That's enough.

25
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,250
You can stop now.

26
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,340
Just in case, you must not bring in more than one box of gold.

27
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,520
Yang's actions and attitude are not like before.

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,800
It's as if there's a huge wall between us now.

29
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,330
She feels so distant lately.

30
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,980
Her Highness Chief Imperial Consort

31
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,460
was always distant from you, Your Majesty.

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,320
You simply did not see her true self before.

33
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,160
You are only seeing it now, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,570
Without Yang, I would not be here.

35
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,640
But Chief Imperial Consort was very hurt, that much is true.

36
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,800
- Stop.
- Your Majesty, if you keep letting her drag you around,

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,650
you can never truly have her. You must dominate her,

38
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,470
only then can she truly be yours. Your Majesty,

39
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,050
you are no longer that weak, lonely boy.

40
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,520
You must not let yourself get hurt by a mere concubine—

41
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,030
Watch your mouth!

42
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,670
"Mere concubine," how dare you?

43
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,710
I am risking being beaten to death to dare to give you this advice.

44
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,920
Even if Yang hurts me to death, I can never give up on her.

45
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,540
- Your Majesty.
- I told you to stop already.

46
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,620
No matter who it is,

47
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,040
anyone who speaks ill of Yang, I will never forgive him.

48
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,810
I think it will be best to tell the truth to His Majesty.

49
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,430
You must not. He will use it to fund his war.

50
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,880
I will try to persuade him.

51
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,380
I think that is the best we can do for him.

52
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,930
Did you say a war of conquest?

53
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,800
Why are you so surprised?

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,200
Your Majesty, we must not start a war now.

55
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,130
After a famine for many years and plagues among the people, how can we go to war?

56
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:06,620
Please see the heart of the people. A war is unreasonable, Your Majesty.

57
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,620
Prime Minister.

58
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes, Your Majesty?

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,430
If vassals refuse an imperial command, what is the correct course of action?

60
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,090
That is treason.

61
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:26,720
If you command me to, I will behead that traitor's neck right here, right now.

62
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,610
Prime Minister, please read the edict.

63
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,180
"As was achieved by the great emperors before me,

64
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,620
I plan to recover our empire's glory.

65
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,710
And so I plan to pick up my sword and lead the military.

66
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,820
Each magistrate will provide 20,000 soldiers each,

67
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,520
so we can mobilize military forces of 200,000.

68
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,430
In addition, the Yunnan, Lingbei, Shaanxi and Sichuan Provinces

69
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,330
will each provide sulphur, saltpeter (potassium nitrate), iron and copper

70
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,120
and tin for use by the military.

71
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,950
The remaining provinces must also provide allotted amounts.

72
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:16,220
Goryeo will provide 10,000 troops and 2,000 horses.

73
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,770
Please follow my commands in good faith."

74
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,590
When we win, all the glories and spoils of war will be returned to the people.

75
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,120
Prime Minister himself will command our war of conquest.

76
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,110
Interpret his command as an imperial command from me.

77
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,720
I, Prime Minister Bayan, will obey His Majesty's command.

78
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,930
What are you saying?

79
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,410
We need to concentrate on the affairs of the state at hand.

80
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,930
To mobilize the military to relive the glories of the past,

81
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,360
to restructure government to focus on military conquest—

82
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,050
Toqto'a, we Mongols once ruled this world.

83
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,340
This great kingdom was achieved with blood and sweat.

84
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,210
A nation is formed with swords, but it is ruled and maintained with intellect and the study of history.

85
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,730
You...

86
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,630
are my most trusted and precious subordinate and blood relative.

87
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,590
Do not disappoint me.

88
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,060
- Uncle...
- Enough!

89
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,070
Prime Minister, Chief Imperial Consort has come.

90
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,760
Tell her I'm busy so she can see me later.

91
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,720
I don't have time to waste, either.

92
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,850
El Temür in the past

93
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,250
was dogmatic and toxic in that position.

94
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,760
And you, Prime Minister, are no different from him now.

95
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,590
El Temür...

96
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,850
used this position to fulfill his own selfish interests and desires.

97
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,430
But this Bayan's dream is only to

98
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:13,080
recover the glory of this great kingdom and offer it to His Majesty.

99
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,580
Prime Minister, you want to be remembered as the greatest warrior in all of this kingdom's history.

100
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,980
For that, you need a place to conquer, which will be covered with the blood and bodies of your enemies.

101
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:31,860
That is why you are fomenting war by encouraging His Majesty and trampling upon the people.

102
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,550
If this is not a selfish desire,

103
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,100
than what is?

104
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,920
Have you seen what it's like in that Northern frontier?

105
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,740
Eating rats for survival, and feeling your frozen fingers

106
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,650
rotting as the horse reins dig into them.

107
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,860
The moment your horse stopped,

108
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,320
we had to die. So to survive,

109
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,760
anyone who tried to stop our horse,

110
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,260
we had to mercilessly trample over them.

111
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,950
That is the fate of our great Mongol warriors.

112
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:14,360
What is so great about killing and plundering from innocent people?

113
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,270
A wolf cannot be tamed.

114
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,570
In order to survive, they need the flesh and blood of other animals.

115
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:28,430
That is how we descendants of the blue wolves have survived annihilation.
(T/N: Genghis Khan is said to have descended from a blue-grey wolf and a doe)

116
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,020
A woman from Goryeo beyond the frontier where the mountains and waters are good,

117
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,750
could never understand the heart of a warrior. And that is why

118
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,040
I opposed your investiture as empress.

119
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,380
So if I agree to this war of conquest,

120
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,020
do I have the right to become empress?

121
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,850
Chief Imperial Consort, you are a precious person to me.

122
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:58,860
But for this kingdom, my mere personal feelings,

123
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,290
I will cut them out.

124
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,410
Please allow me to protect you, Chief Imperial Consort.

125
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,420
Give up your ambition.

126
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,860
He is more frightening than El Temür.

127
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,580
- General.
- Food! Food.

128
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,860
Yum.

129
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,050
It's been so long since I've eaten like this.

130
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,660
General, please have some.

131
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,590
I'm fine. Go ahead and eat.

132
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,130
Here.

133
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:53,150
But why did we come here all of a sudden?

134
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,450
Leader of Hawk House

135
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,650
sent a message.

136
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,250
Go stay at Yeongak Temple. It is the command of the Leader of Hawk House.

137
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,780
Do you know anything about the Leader of Hawk House?

138
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,280
I heard this from the Yeongyeong Branch leader.

139
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:25,130
The Leader of Hawk House is someone in the palace.

140
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,550
He's in the palace?

141
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,660
Then, there's no way you wouldn't know him.

142
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,020
Is there someone you suspect?

143
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,510
I'm thinking.

144
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,710
If he's the Leader of Hawk House, he must be a high official.

145
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:49,130
So there was a reason that the leader showed you favor.

146
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,750
In any case, this is excellent news for us.

147
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,970
- You greedy beggar.
- I'm sorry.

148
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,190
Since you were speaking, I thought you were done.

149
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,720
Ugh, you.

150
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:19,170
Ah, this bastard. He ate it all just to save himself. I'm starving.

151
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,990
There's no way to stop this war.

152
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:59,240
If we can't stop it, then we need to make it an opportunity.

153
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,670
If things go according to my plan,

154
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,930
Yuan's military and finances will be yours.

155
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,690
And I will also get what I want.

156
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,890
Tell me exactly what you've planned.

157
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:22,090
I will be returning to Goryeo in the morning.

158
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,120
Eunuch Bang and Jeom Bak will stay behind.

159
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,460
The plan is for them to create a new merchant association with Bisoo and Maksaeng.

160
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,160
Seung Nyang?

161
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,550
That Ki bitch is here?

162
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,530
She is planning something with Wang Yoo in the main hall.

163
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,030
Are you crazy? If you leave here, we'll all die.

164
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,960
Please calm down General.

165
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,170
That treacherous wench. She is right in front of me but I can't kill her.

166
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,490
I just thought of a great idea.

167
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,120
Idea?

168
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,240
There's a saying to force out a person's fault.

169
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,250
Find out her weakness no matter what.

170
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,820
What are you saying?

171
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,360
You'll know when it's time.

172
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,690
That wench...

173
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,680
will fall into my trap.

174
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,260
Where have you been at this late hour?

175
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,240
I went to pray at Yeongak Temple.

176
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,580
- So what did you pray for?
- That the blood of this kingdom's people

177
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,580
will not be shed in battle.

178
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,860
You prayed a useless prayer.

179
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,070
Your Majesty,

180
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,460
you can still rescind your command for war.

181
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,100
Why do you oppose everything I do lately?

182
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,700
The people of this kingdom are in misery due to years of famine.

183
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,940
If you begin a war of conquest, their resentments will all be directed towards you.

184
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,600
I asked you to not interfere with this matter.

185
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,610
For one drop of your enemy's blood,

186
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,500
your people will lose ten drops of blood.

187
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,650
Do you really not know

188
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,730
what your people truly want?

189
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,340
Han Feizi spoke of "The King's Wrath."

190
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,390
Do you know it?

191
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:49,700
The upside-down scales on the dragon's chin is called "the king's wrath."

192
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,970
Yes, a dragon is gentle and benevolent. So if you tame it well, you can ride on its back for a long time.

193
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,920
But the moment you touch those scales, the dragon becomes enraged

194
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,480
and can kill that person.

195
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,520
I told you that you can use me as much as you want for your revenge.

196
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,090
You can ride on my back, and you can use my power to rise to the sky.

197
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,690
But there is something you must never touch.

198
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,540
My sincere determination to become a true emperor by making this kingdom fulfill its destiny.

199
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,130
Don't cause the king's wrath. Don't make me into a crazy dragon.

200
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:31,280
Then, will you bite me to death?

201
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,280
If you become a wrathful king, you will kill me?

202
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,490
You were always on my side. You've supported my sovereign power, I could always trust and rely on you.

203
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,390
So, of course, my plan includes you and Ayu.

204
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,080
Please trust me.

205
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,300
So that I can become a true emperor,

206
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,030
please give me strength, Yang.

207
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,280
You will understand one day.

208
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,680
Everything I do,

209
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,070
is for your sake.

210
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:21,090
I heard His Majesty allocated each province to provide materials for military use.

211
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,120
He ordered Yunnan to provide sulfur.

212
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,050
He ordered Lingbei to provide saltpeter.

213
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,870
Sulfur and saltpeter are ingredients for gunpowder.

214
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,720
The other provinces were ordered to provide iron and tin.

215
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,460
Please tell all the provinces to provide the soldiers and food that were asked for,

216
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,620
but sulfur, saltpeter, iron, and tin,

217
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,540
to only provide them in small quantities.

218
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,360
What is your plan?

219
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,410
I will purchase the rest from a merchant association I know.

220
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,670
Come in.

221
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,420
I am Chief Yeon.

222
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,610
Please take good care of me. My name is Bang Shin Woo.

223
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,770
They will purchase the materials from each province

224
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:21,620
and sell it to the military force at a high price.

225
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:27,030
And I will divide the profits and give them to the magistrates.

226
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,930
War profiteering, you mean?

227
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,330
It's the only way we can help the starving people.

228
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:42,700
But if something goes wrong, anyone involved with this will not avoid death.

229
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:49,880
War or anything else, is there any matter in which your life is not at risk?

230
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,150
This isn't so that you magistrates can enjoy riches.

231
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:58,870
Please make sure to use this money to save the people.

232
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,840
Yes, Your Highness.

233
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,750
We will heed your words, deep in our hearts.

234
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,180
You've come?

235
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,860
Why are you holding Maha?

236
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,930
He gets very lonely,

237
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:24,220
so Empress Dowager commanded for us to take care of him often.

238
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,640
The imperial prince seems to want to be held by you, Chief Imperial Consort.

239
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,380
Please hold him once.

240
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,220
Your Highness, do you not like being in my arms? You want Chief Imperial Consort?

241
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,370
Let's be on our way.

242
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,950
Mama...

243
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,400
Did you see her looking at the imperial prince like he was a bug?

244
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,930
I was afraid she might pretend to hug him and throw him down.

245
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,690
Throw him down, huh?

246
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,970
Were you looking for me?

247
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,600
So what did you tattle to Empress Dowager about today?

248
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,070
Tattle? Of course not.

249
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:45,080
I know well that you report to Empress Dowager my every move.

250
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,990
Your Majesty, that is a misunderstanding.

251
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,710
Court Lady Yeon, you brought me this flower tea, didn't you?

252
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,050
You asked me to make it for you.

253
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,500
Poison?

254
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,910
Do you want to die?

255
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,350
I didn't do that.

256
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,230
Your Majesty, please believe me.

257
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,650
But I saw you put this poison in here.

258
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,680
That is unfair. I would never—

259
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,580
You bitch! Are you accusing the empress of lying?

260
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,010
I am sorry.

261
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,580
Please let me live, Your Majesty.

262
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,940
When do you take care of Maha?

263
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,970
When his caretaker court ladies go to eat their meal, I briefly take care of him.

264
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,150
Then from now on, do what I say.

265
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,180
Come closer.

266
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,380
Don't be afraid. I'm just confirming whether you are on my side.

267
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,350
And if you do well, you will be rewarded.

268
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,480
No, no...

269
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,680
No, no?

270
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,920
Empress, what are you staring at so much?

271
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,360
Oh? Yes.

272
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,340
The princes are so adorable.

273
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,910
Chief Imperial Consort, you should request His Majesty so that the empress can bear a son.

274
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,450
Should this kingdom's rightful wife envy your imperial prince?

275
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,220
Empress Dowager, even for just once every few days,

276
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,900
can I take care of Maha and Ayu?

277
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,470
Do you desire children that much?

278
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:13,600
That is a part of it, but I also think brothers should have affection for each other.

279
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,900
Since I never see the princes spend time together, I am afraid they might have conflict when they grow up.

280
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,460
I will take care of Prince Ayu.

281
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,670
But Empress didn't say anything wrong. They are both the emperor's children, aren't they?

282
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:33,890
If that's how you feel, then I will take care of Prince Maha sometimes.

283
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,310
Do whatever you want to.

284
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,030
It seems he is jealous of Prince Ayu.

285
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,330
Just leave him be.

286
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,370
There.

287
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,820
Eunuch Bang is here.

288
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,730
Your Highness, have you been well...

289
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,710
Welcome.

290
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:30,000
This is the list of vassals you will associate with.

291
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,990
Eunuch Bang?

292
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,610
Yes, Your Highness.

293
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:47,480
But why are you holding Prince Maha?

294
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,430
Somehow things turned out this way.

295
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,400
Oh.

296
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,440
Your Highness, I came to get Prince Maha.

297
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,160
Take him.

298
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,110
Yes, Your Highness.

299
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,470
I don't want to.

300
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,380
Your Highness.

301
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,370
Why is he crying all of a sudden?

302
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,030
Please calm down, Your Highness.

303
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,660
I will take my leave now.

304
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,710
When will you reveal that Maha is not the emperor's child?

305
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:46,390
If I reveal it carelessly, it could be harmful to Ayu.

306
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,930
But shouldn't you reveal it before the investiture of the crown prince?

307
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:55,630
Seeing him up close makes me feel pity for him.

308
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,830
What's wrong?

309
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,580
Did you cry?

310
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,770
Her Highness was holding Prince Maha.

311
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,930
They don't recognize each other, do they?

312
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,960
He was trying not to leave Her Highness's arms; I felt so sad seeing that.

313
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,700
Please stop. What can we do about it?

314
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,980
Just thinking about Prince Maha makes my heart break. What can I do?

315
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,450
I'll hurry and eat, so thanks for your help.

316
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,260
Don't worry and enjoy your meal.

317
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,900
It's all right.

318
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,200
Why won't the Prince stop crying?

319
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,260
What happened?

320
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,190
I don't know.

321
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,330
I briefly went to eat my meal.

322
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,860
I don't think he has a fever.

323
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,350
Maybe he's hurt somewhere?

324
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,370
Oh!

325
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,850
Goodness.

326
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,660
What is this?

327
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,050
Bruises.

328
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,870
It looks like someone pinched him.

329
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,590
How can this happen?

330
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,260
I know nothing of it, Your Highness.

331
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,130
Please believe me, Your Highness.

332
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,550
You don't know? If you don't know, who will?

333
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,800
Chief Imperial Consort was with him earlier.

334
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,960
What? Chief Imperial Consort?

335
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,180
Now that I think about it, when I went to get Prince Maha from Chief Imperial Consort, he burst into tears.

336
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,680
How dare... How can she... ?

337
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,280
Could the Chief Imperial Consort do this to the young prince?

338
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,760
Where is the Chief Imperial Consort right now?

339
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,470
She went to visit His Majesty just now.

340
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,400
Your Highness.

341
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,410
What in the world? How can a human being do such a thing?

342
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,360
Your Highness...

343
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,910
I'm right here. You can give him to me.

344
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:08,180
It's fine. Seeing him eat so well

345
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,340
is very fascinating.

346
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,110
This will seem beneath your dignity to others.

347
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:18,590
What is wrong with a father feeding his child?

348
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,900
What brings you here suddenly?

349
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,690
Chief Imperial Consort.

350
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,710
Yes, Empress Dowager?

351
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:41,730
Even if he is Danashiri's son, you cannot do that to a young prince!

352
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,090
Empress Dowager!

353
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,890
Prince Maha's body is covered with bruises.

354
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,710
Chief Imperial Consort physically abused the young prince!

355
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,580
I knew you had a vicious nature,

356
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,200
but just because he's a baby who cannot speak?

357
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,600
If it's not Chief Imperial Consort's doing,

358
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,090
then how will you take responsibility for this?

359
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:07,360
Emperor, did you just shout at me?

360
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,780
What about you? Running into the emperor's quarters and slapping the Chief Imperial Consort?

361
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,500
Do you think that is proper behavior?

362
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,930
Emperor, I am the Empress Dowager.

363
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,110
I took care of you like a mother since you were young.
(T/N: Budashiri is his aunt.)

364
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:26,710
Even if you were my mother, there is no one more important to me than Chief Imperial Consort.

365
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,910
Do you understand?

366
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,200
Chief Imperial Consort abused Maha. Please come to your senses.

367
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,610
Chief Imperial Consort would never do that.

368
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,450
You are completely bewitched by her. This is quite a sight to see.

369
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,750
- Head Eunuch Dok Man.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

370
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,940
All the servants who took care of Maha today...

371
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,840
No, even if they only grazed him with their fingertips, bring them all in.

372
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

373
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,380
Please bring Prince Maha as well.

374
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,250
Since you suspect me so much, let me relieve your suspicions.

375
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,240
How dare she do that to Prince Maha?

376
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,060
Such a wicked person.

377
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,850
I brought Maha. What will you do now?

378
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,510
We must find out who did this.

379
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,430
Imperial Prince, come to me.

380
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:49,790
If I hurt him, would he allow me to hold him?

381
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:59,140
Maha may not speak yet, but he will know the face of the person who hurt him.

382
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,220
Everyone come forward one by one and hold the Imperial Prince.

383
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,110
So it was you.

384
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,870
It was not.

385
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,590
How could I do that to the prince?

386
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,740
This is unfair, Empress Dowager.

387
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,530
Chief Imperial Consort, Court Lady Yeon would never—

388
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,760
What are you waiting for? Drag her away.

389
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,710
- Stop.
- Drag her away.

390
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,500
Chief Imperial Consort, are you ignoring my words?

391
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,760
His Majesty has issued an imperial command.

392
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,500
So what are you doing, not dragging her away?

393
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,150
It wasn't me! This is unfair, Your Highness!

394
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,590
This is unfair!

395
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,090
So it was you who instigated this.

396
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,340
Court Lady Yeon could not have done this alone.

397
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,920
Chief Imperial Consort, are you accusing me?

398
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,690
I know that it wasn't you.

399
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:52,050
If you give me time, I will make sure

400
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,410
to reveal the truth.

401
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,790
I told you, I don't know...

402
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,880
anything.

403
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,850
Your Highness, this is unfair to me.

404
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,090
I am telling you the truth.

405
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:26,060
Everyone, leave now.

406
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,320
How pitiful you are.

407
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:48,610
If you tell the truth that the empress told you to do it, she will kill you.

408
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,960
But if you don't, then I will kill you.

409
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,990
Yeon Hwa, I know you well.

410
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,590
We spent our days as servants together.

411
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,120
Please let me live.

412
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,430
I am sorry.

413
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,700
Don't be afraid.

414
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,050
I will not kill you.

415
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,910
Your Highness...

416
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:33,660
The day Maha was born, you and Court Lady Seo,

417
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,330
you two were the only ones there.

418
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,600
I know Maha is not the emperor's true son.

419
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:52,000
When the time comes, you reveal the truth yourself.

420
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,440
This is the reason I am letting you live.

421
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,790
Do you understand?

422
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,020
Yes, I understand.

423
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,760
Her Majesty the Empress enters.

424
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,860
You've come?

425
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,260
This is all due to my failings.

426
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,670
Did you find out who did it?

427
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,960
Yes, I found out.

428
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,580
You can leave now.

429
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,050
So tell me who did it.

430
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,740
It was Empress Dowager.

431
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,270
Are you going to tell His Majesty?

432
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:18,380
There will be a big disturbance in the palace, so I must cover it up.

433
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:23,190
Chief Imperial Consort, this isn't something that can be solved by covering it up.

434
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:27,760
Someone even tried to poison Prince Ayu recently.

435
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,790
So that was you, too.

436
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:38,340
If Empress Dowager instigated all this, that is truly scary and frightening.

437
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,830
If there is anything I can help you with, tell me.

438
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:48,500
When the time comes, I will ask you for help.

439
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,910
I understand.

440
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:54,890
But what do you plan to do with Court Lady Yeon?

441
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:03,080
She is an important witness who can reveal Empress Dowager's crime.

442
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,290
Please take good care of her, Your Majesty.

443
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,890
I will do so.

444
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,830
Your Majesty, we congratulate your return to your throne.

445
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,880
We congratulate your return to your throne, Your Majesty!

446
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:33,280
I am grateful for your welcome.

447
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,950
Your Majesty, on Yuan's orders, we've prepared

448
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,700
10,000 soldiers, 2,000 military horses, and the food and materials.

449
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,870
If you only issue your command—

450
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,130
We will not provide Yuan with military assistance.

451
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,890
And as long as I am on this throne,

452
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:55,130
we will no longer send tribute eunuchs or concubines

453
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,040
or tribute goods to Yuan. Keep that in mind.

454
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,430
Your Majesty, we must not sour our relationship with Yuan.

455
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,880
You just returned to your throne—

456
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,960
I am not done speaking.

457
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:13,020
Those whose names I call now, step forward.

458
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,250
Prime Minister, Kang Do Hwan.

459
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

460
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,390
Minister of National History, Choi Hwan.

461
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,090
Secretariat-Chancellor, Kim Hee Joong.

462
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,520
Minister Yoon Ji Kyeom.

463
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,630
Minister Hong Seung Ha.

464
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,410
Minister Lee Cheol.

465
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,170
Minister Yoon Seung.

466
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,820
Minister Kwon Byeong.

467
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,390
Minister Park Ui.

468
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,440
All of you, you've carried Yuan's power on your back

469
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,310
and engaged in wicked deeds and tyranny.

470
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:57,710
By doing so, you've plunged the people into misery

471
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:01,680
and weakened the nation's strength and dignity.

472
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:08,590
Your rights as ambassadors to Yuan are terminated, and your assets will be seized.

473
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,320
Your Majesty! How can you do such a thing?

474
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,930
Please retract your command.

475
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,740
Silence!

476
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:31,110
I will also look into your other crimes, and based on the severity,

477
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,500
you will not be exempted from execution by beheading.

478
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,410
Take them.

479
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,520
Drag them away.

480
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,160
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

481
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,610
Your Majesty!

482
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,270
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

483
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,860
Your Majesty!

484
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,740
He will not provide Yuan with military assistance?

485
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,240
That is not all.

486
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,980
He will no longer send concubines, eunuchs, or goods as tribute.

487
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,970
And he got rid of all the vassals who oppose him.

488
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,580
Your Majesty, this is betrayal.

489
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:05,620
Immediately remove Wang Yoo from the throne and annex the Goryeo state into Yuan.

490
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:11,090
We are about to begin a war of conquest. It's not a good time for that.

491
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:18,950
Then shall we just stand by and watch Wang Yoo's arrogance and impudence?

492
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,230
I have a plan.

493
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,420
Tell me.

494
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,910
To block Goryeo's overseas trade.

495
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:37,120
Goryeo's trade with many nations provides significant income.

496
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:42,390
If we block this, it will put them under enormous pressure.

497
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,710
Your Majesty, please do that.

498
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,480
Once our conquest is over, I will invade Goryeo

499
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,250
and bring you Wang Yoo's head.

500
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:00,650
Terminate all Yuan's commerce with Goryeo, and block all boats from entry into Goryeo and cut off their overseas trading.

501
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,370
I will accept your Imperial Command, Your Majesty!

502
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,340
As soon as he was restored to the throne, Wang Yoo has become completely uninhibited.

503
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,430
Got rid of Yuan-friendly high officials and enacted currency reform.

504
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,410
It's almost as if he's been just waiting to revolt against Yuan.

505
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,060
What is your reason for telling me this?

506
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:33,260
Wang Yoo and Chief Imperial Consort, you two were of like minds in the past.

507
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:39,570
All the Goryeo people here were abandoned by their country.

508
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:45,590
So there is no reason for me to be interested in what happens to Goryeo.

509
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:53,090
I hope you will continue to not be involved in Goryeo.

510
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:59,630
I am telling you this, just in case unfortunate events happen to you, Chief Imperial Consort.

511
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:16,140
If they block overseas trade, Goryeo will be severely impacted.

512
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,680
Not necessarily.

513
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:29,980
Your Majesty, Yeon Bisoo enters.

514
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,090
You've come a long way.

515
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,270
Come closer.

516
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,950
Why are you being awkward, as if this is our first meeting?

517
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:52,110
Well, seeing Your Majesty on the dragon throne,

518
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:55,270
we find ourselves suddenly trembling.

519
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:58,000
Don't be that way.

520
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,710
We are friends who've been through so much together.

521
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:09,740
Yuan announced that they will ban our overseas trade.

522
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,360
I heard about it.

523
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,900
Do you remember when you were Baghatur?

524
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,110
Since we have no future,

525
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:23,050
shouldn't we create it together?

526
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,210
Yuan is already dominating overseas trade.

527
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:31,460
The one place they can't infiltrate is the Silk Road.

528
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:37,920
The Silk Road which connects the East and West, for the Turks and Goryeo,

529
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,600
it will become their lifeline.

530
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:46,130
Time has come for you to keep that promise.

531
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:50,190
Open the Silk Road.

532
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:55,810
If Yuan blocks overseas trade, we will trade on land.

533
00:44:55,810 --> 00:45:01,460
Instead of Yuan, we will trade with the West.

534
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,430
And I will give you exclusive rights to trade.

535
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:11,110
Please provide ginseng and fabric from Goryeo.

536
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:16,150
I will use them to trade with the West on the Silk Road.

537
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,730
Your Majesty, our preparation for battle is complete. Please give us your Imperial command.

538
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:36,580
We don't know when this military expedition will end. Must you go yourself, Prime Minister?

539
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,830
How can the commander sit in comfort dressed in silk?

540
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:45,700
Prime Minister, you are the pillar of this kingdom. How can the pillar leave the house?

541
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,270
Your Majesty, the first victories are important.

542
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:54,360
Once I bring the momentum on our side, I will return to you.

543
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,380
Please do that.

544
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:19,170
On the advancing steps of your horses, you are becoming a part of our great history.

545
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:25,500
Make sure to return alive so we can enjoy the glory together.

546
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,790
Your Majesty, we will give our lives!

547
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,210
Loyalty! Loyalty!

548
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:34,520
Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty!

549
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,010
Loyalty! Loyalty!

550
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,860
Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty!

551
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,530
Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty!

552
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,970
Your Majesty!

553
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:58,690
Bayan already captured the six provinces of Ilkhanate.

554
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,450
Is that true?

555
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,910
It's as if Genghis Khan himself came back to life.

556
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:07,260
He is conquering as fast as our military horses can run.

557
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,430
Tell the people this great news. Let us share the joy of victory with them.

558
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,960
Yes, Your Majesty, I will do that.

559
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,150
Early victories are not important.

560
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:29,150
The longer the war goes on, the force fighting far from home is bound to become more exhausted.

561
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,530
Bayan returned to Daedo intoxicated by his victories.

562
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,600
Yet another sign of overconfidence.

563
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,590
What is going on with Yeon Bisoo's merchant association?

564
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:42,160
She is selling the sulfur and saltpeter she received from Yuan magistrates to Ilkhanate.

565
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,540
This is the profit from the merchant association.

566
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

567
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,090
You must use this to help the people suffering from famine.

568
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,780
How could we do anything else?

569
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,970
Do not worry, Your Highness.

570
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,130
Your Majesty.

571
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,020
Please look at this.

572
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,860
It is a secret letter from Wang Yoo of Goryeo to Chief Imperial Consort.

573
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:28,150
The captain of the Imperial Guard intercepted it before it reached Heungdeok Palace.

574
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,230
What does it say?

575
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,430
Make sure to

576
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,340
not let anyone know about this.

577
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

578
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,960
♫ Don't you see me? ♫

579
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,460
♫ By your side ♫

580
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:36,700
Your Majesty, are you not sleeping yet?

581
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:45,410
♫ I guess you don't hear me ♫

582
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:49,060
♫ My love is for you ♫

583
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,960
What letter is that?

584
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,230
Your Majesty?

585
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:59,960
Suddenly...

586
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:01,740
That you...

587
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,560
are by my side,

588
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,940
I'm so grateful...

589
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,190
and it makes me so happy.

590
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,050
What is...

591
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,520
going on with you?

592
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,900
♫ Isn't it enough for you to stay with me? ♫

593
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,100
Don't say anything.

594
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,740
Don't say anything at all.

595
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,690
Just like this, I want us to stay just like this, Yang.

596
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,420
♫ My love for you ♫

597
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,460
♫ does it make you suffer so much? ♫

598
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,660
♫ I'm sorry, I'm sorry ♫

599
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:43,160
♫ I'm sorry that I love you ♫

600
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,500
"Chui-mo-goo-ja."
(T/N: 취모구자 吹毛求疵 - to find any flaw and use it to attack your opponent)

601
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,000
This is quite the plan.

602
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,430
Using fake secret letters to drive a wedge between the emperor and the Ki bitch.

603
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,520
But it's not fake, is it?

604
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,500
Wang Yoo and the Ki bitch do help each other, after all.

605
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,400
Once a ceramic vase is cracked, it cannot be fused together.

606
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,220
So once we separate the emperor and the Ki bitch,

607
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,520
I am sure we will get a chance.

608
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,800
Leader is entering.

609
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,780
Please help me just this one time.

610
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,040
Be careful.
[5 years later]

611
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:43,440
Thank you, Prince Maha.

612
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,330
Court Lady Seo, the Chief Imperial Consort dares to address the eldest son

613
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,610
of this kingdom's imperial family without honorifics. Is this abiding by the law?

614
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,620
Well...

615
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,800
Imperial Prince...

616
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,530
I apologize.

617
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:02,970
I was so proud of you for taking care of your younger brother.

618
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,020
Your Highness.

619
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,750
Our military forces have suffered another great defeat.

620
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:34,560
Welcome, Imperial Prince.

621
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,200
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

622
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,640
I saw the Chief Imperial Consort.

623
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,440
Don't forget.

624
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:56,560
She is the one who cruelly murdered your mother.

625
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,040
She is a very bad person.

626
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,540
Your Majesty.

627
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:17,030
A great defeat? News of yet another defeat?

628
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:20,960
Your Majesty, please calm down.

629
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,720
So, where's the great commander who lost?

630
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,430
He is waiting for you in the Great Hall.

631
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,500
So let's have a look at his face.

632
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,690
You should get up now.

633
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:06,850
Prime Minister, please kill me.

634
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,070
- Please kill us.
- Please kill us.

635
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,910
It was beyond your control.

636
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:14,420
- Prime Minister...
- Prime Minister!

637
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:36,810
Your Majesty, did you drink wine again today?

638
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,490
Yang, my Chief Imperial Consort.

639
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,200
I'm not in the mood for your nagging.

640
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,980
Your Majesty.

641
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:51,130
But seeing my Chief Imperial Consort

642
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:57,540
makes my heart feel lighter.

643
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:05,990
Have you come, Your Majesty?

644
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,770
So it was him?

645
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:34,090
He may have lost, but he fought a force with 20,000 with only 3,000 men.

646
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,800
But he lost.

647
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,250
He is a brave warrior. It's my fault for not sending him reinforcements.

648
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:51,530
But this man

649
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:54,380
made a huge mistake.

650
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,800
A mistake?

651
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,680
This guy...

652
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:33,360
This guy... made my wine taste bad.

653
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:43,590
How dare you ruin the emperor's mood?

654
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:48,400
Of course, you deserve to die, don't you?

655
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,330
Isn't that true, Chief Imperial Consort?

656
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,350
Your Majesty!

657
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:06,300
♫ That day when we loved until we wept ♫

658
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:13,840
♫ That day when we were happy, can't I return to that day? ♫

659
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:20,090
♫ Even if I ache and it was our last moment ♫
