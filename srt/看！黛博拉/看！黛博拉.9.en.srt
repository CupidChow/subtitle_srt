ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,651
<i>I can't.</i>

5
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:11,948
<i>If the boss finds out...</i>

6
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,661
Hi, there.

7
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:15,792
Did you eat yet?

8
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,448
<i>I love you so much.</i>

9
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,830
<i>I love you, too.</i>

10
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,924
Why are they kissing all of a sudden?

11
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,426
That girl was dumped
and couldn't get over her boyfriend.

12
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,180
That doesn't make sense at all.

EP 09
THINGS WE SAY AFTER A KISS

14
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,482
It's not that I like a heart.

15
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,314
Sang-jin, I...

16
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:27,686
like...

17
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,612
It sounds like a confession.

18
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:36,906
What is it?

19
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,661
- What?
- What is it?

20
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,754
What?

21
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,168
{\an8}Anyway, you can go ahead with this.

22
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,014
{\an8}Just schedule the publication date.

23
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,757
{\an8}When are you going to meet Deborah?

24
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,848
{\an8}I am supposed to meet her today.

25
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,518
{\an8}By the way, Sang-jin...

26
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,101
{\an8}I mean...

27
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,896
Boss.

28
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,364
What if...

29
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,031
I say that Deborah's essay

30
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,649
should not be published,
what's going to happen?

31
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:17,407
Don't you know what happens?
We just won't do it.

32
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,869
Is that right?

33
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,659
Nothing serious happens, does it?

34
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,833
Well...

35
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,464
We just pay her a huge penalty
out of our empty pockets.

36
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,375
Our reputation as a start-up publisher
will totally collapse.

37
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,170
That will be it. What else?

38
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:36,047
By the way, have I told you this?

39
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,094
The biggest investor of this company,

40
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,968
who is also the owner of this building
and gave birth to me,

41
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:45,426
is thinking about
kicking us out of this building

42
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,307
to bring in a children's dental clinic.

43
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,526
Another blind-date plot by your mom?
This time, a dentist of the clinic?

44
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,316
Yes.

45
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,357
Why must she...

46
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,413
If I don't like an arranged marriage,
she insists

47
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:04,582
I should return all investments
and move out of here now.

48
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,959
We cancel Deborah's book now?

49
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,129
What do you think will happen?
In the end, I...

50
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,379
may have to get married again.

51
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,422
Do you think I'll just let you be?

52
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,836
And do nothing about it?

53
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,934
No need for such a lengthy explanation.
You can just say no.

54
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,806
Aren't you going to have lunch?

55
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,941
- What would you like?
- No idea.

56
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,033
Let's go to lunch.

57
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,859
What would you like for lunch?

58
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,364
- Tofu stew.
- Tofu stew with rice?

59
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,355
Sounds good.

60
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,911
Have a good lunch.

61
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,065
<i>Did I turn back first?</i>

62
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,365
<i>Or did he grab my shoulder first?</i>

63
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,247
<i>Did I?</i>

64
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,495
<i>Did he?</i>

65
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,969
<i>It was me</i>

66
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:43,549
<i>who turned back first and closed my eyes.</i>

67
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,055
<i>My sister's there, right?</i>

68
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,937
<i>I don't want her to know we're dating.</i>

69
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,533
<i>No worries.</i>
<i>I'll protect our love at all cost.</i>

70
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,104
What an annoying customer!

71
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,931
Only a cup of coffee?
Is this your own work space?

72
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,897
Hey, this is my third cup.

73
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,558
I ate a cake, too, earlier.

74
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,647
Did you? Good girl.

75
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,780
What are you doing?
Why are you taking that?

76
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,698
Are you larcenous?

77
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,238
- There's a thief!
- Hey!

78
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,155
I am taking it, because I need it.

79
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,501
Know what a married couple's
reservation system is?

80
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:02,919
<i>Misunderstanding each other's signals</i>
<i>will cause unwanted situations.</i>

81
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,259
Honey, aren't you gonna take a shower?

82
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,893
I will, after this one.

83
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,805
Why don't you take a shower now?

84
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,232
Why? Let me finish watching this one.

85
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,743
Okay. I got it.

86
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,526
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

87
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,955
Sweetheart,

88
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,006
I am as fresh as new.

89
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,721
I just finished showering.

90
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,601
What are you doing?

91
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,609
What's up? I was sleeping.

92
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,435
Didn't you wanna do it?

93
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,483
Do what?

94
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,608
No breakfast?

95
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,703
Undressing? Why?

96
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:11,872
Nothing.

97
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,373
Oh, now?

98
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,910
I got it.

99
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,326
Quit it.

100
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,254
Babe.

101
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,962
Stop it!

102
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,344
Just a second.

103
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,709
I am busy.

104
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,423
I am off.

105
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,176
That's why couples
need the reservation system.

106
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,550
Unbelievable.

107
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,636
What an effort.

108
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,894
We're just trying whatever may work.

109
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,896
Only because of my efforts,
we have sex once a month.

110
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,149
To barely avoid being sexless.

111
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,032
Do you think I'm lying?

112
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,898
Once you get married,
you're a family, so no sex.

113
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,486
Kiss? Don't even ask.

114
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,370
<i>The moment we make eye contact,</i>

115
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,910
<i>engulfed in lust,</i>
<i>we get crazy about each other.</i>

116
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,745
<i>As if we've starved for days,</i>

117
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,870
<i>as if we're devouring each other,</i>

118
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,958
as if our lips are vacuums,
with our souls...

119
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,457
- I miss such a kiss.
- Yu-jeong!

120
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,799
Let's stop talking about it.

121
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,008
Why? What else can we talk about?

122
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,925
Oh, I'm sorry.

123
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:19,814
Let's stop it.

124
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,935
No. Don't be sorry.

125
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,532
No, I already knew
that you met Ju-wan yesterday.

126
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,108
I wasn't considerate.

127
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:30,985
Are you okay?

128
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,951
Does he keep crossing your mind?

129
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,493
Are you still very sad?

130
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,498
Well, I...

131
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,500
Yeah...

132
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,131
Right. I understand.

133
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,461
"Time heals all wounds."

134
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,206
"A love is replaced by another one."

135
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,548
It's easier said than done.

136
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,182
How can you forget so easily
and find another?

137
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,760
It'd be odd if you can.

138
00:09:55,637 --> 00:10:00,267
Right. Moving on to another love
so easily, that's not right.

139
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,725
What time is it? I need to take off.

140
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,692
What's up? Going somewhere?

141
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,572
Because Su-hyeok's coming.
You don't need me for your meeting.

142
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,701
Why not? Just stay.

143
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,528
No, I need to go to the gym for PT.

144
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,573
Please be here, at least for a bit.

145
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,124
What is this?

146
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,713
Just...

147
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,169
Because I feel awkward to see him alone.

148
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:31,466
Yesterday, Su-hyeok and I...

149
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,718
What about yesterday? Did you get drunk
and do something wrong again?

150
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,931
On the street again?

151
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,012
Hey, do you think I am crazy?

152
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,268
Right. I was crazy.

153
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,853
It was something similar...

154
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,517
So, stay here a little longer.

155
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:51,316
How can I see him? I'm going nuts.
He's gonna be here soon.

156
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,832
I need to go to the restroom.

157
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,542
Now?

158
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,582
But...

159
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,343
- Hi, Su-hyeok.
- How are you?

160
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,671
How are you?

161
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,006
You can sit over there.

162
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,051
- Hi.
- Hi.

163
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,014
Coffee? Tea?

164
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,474
- Coffee, please.
- Sure.

165
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,014
- One cup of coffee.
- Okay.

166
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,228
Bo-ra was expecting you.

167
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,308
Was she?

168
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,813
What a coincidence! She just went to
the restroom before you came.

169
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,937
Actually, Bo-ra told me.

170
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,993
I heard about the mistake made yesterday.

171
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,917
She told you about it?

172
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,549
Friendship between girls are like that.
There's no secrets.

173
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,850
She's so embarrassed that
she was afraid to see you.

174
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,179
She blamed herself saying, "I was insane."

175
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,349
So, do me a favor.

176
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,857
Please, pretend that nothing happened.

177
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,982
Fine.

178
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:18,156
Even if she looks okay,
she still seems sad because of Ju-wan.

179
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,908
She seldom makes mistakes
when she's working.

180
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,121
I fully understood.

181
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,950
Good.

182
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,786
Let's be natural,

183
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,328
as if nothing ever happened.

184
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,636
Here she comes.

185
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,020
Hey, hey, hey.

186
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,559
Do you remember that?

187
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,272
When we were students,
we played King Game where

188
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,903
if the king ordered two people to kiss,
they had to kiss.

189
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,441
And if the king ordered one of them
to kiss someone else, they did it.

190
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,324
We did? Were we that wild?

191
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,315
When?

192
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,525
Don't you remember?

193
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,827
Are we supposed to have
a reason for kissing?

194
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:10,291
If the king ordered me
and Jin-woo to kiss,

195
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,463
then, we would just kiss.

196
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,508
Are you saying you kissed my husband?

197
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,547
No, I didn't mean that.

198
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:23,347
Jin-woo!

199
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,599
- Jin-woo.
- What?

200
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,971
Have you kissed Bo-ra before?

201
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,268
- Is it true?
- Really?

202
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,152
- I did?
- Did you like it?

203
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,149
No way.

204
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,738
You know what?

205
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:46,158
Kissing might seem romantic and all,

206
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,333
but kissing while having your nose covered
is very effective

207
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,002
for hyperventilation syndrome.

208
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:55,091
That's why kissing is used
for emergency care, no?

209
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,380
And...

210
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:01,172
They say lip service is sometimes needed
for harmony and solidarity

211
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,838
within a political party.
Lip service is basically kissing, no?

212
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,850
Please, stop.

213
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,233
Otherwise, you'll embarrass yourself.

214
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,686
You're saying you can kiss anyone,

215
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,232
kissing is like first aid.

216
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,069
I got you, so you can stop.

217
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,487
We both made a mistake yesterday.

218
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,778
You like being frank.

219
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,236
Why beat around the bush?

220
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,160
Okay, then...

221
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,464
Let me be frank and ask,

222
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,882
because we need to keep seeing each other.

223
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,974
- Do you like me?
- No.

224
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,091
No. Right, me neither.

225
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,355
Do you have to do that right now?

226
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,860
What do you mean?

227
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:01,904
My lips are dry.

228
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,953
Are you saying that I am
trying to seduce you with this?

229
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,624
That's very misleading.

230
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,249
What I meant was...

231
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,205
Let's be careful

232
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,924
to avoid such a mistake again.

233
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,006
I will never...

234
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,930
I'll never make such a mistake again.
So don't worry.

235
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,596
Same here.

236
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,610
Let's stop talking about this.
Shall we get some work done?

237
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,574
So, what is your next plan?

238
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:45,863
My next plan is...

239
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,913
Doing nothing at all.

240
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:54,914
Until only the heart-pounding beginning
and fading-away end remain.

241
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:59,076
And until memories about me
are constantly glamorized.

242
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,338
That's my plan.

243
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,419
With only one exception...

244
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,224
Which is getting pretty.

245
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,271
Wait, "getting pretty"
is your final tactic?

246
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:24,483
This may be too cheesy
and anachronic, I am afraid.

247
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,573
In the Auschwitz concentration camp,

248
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,616
where people were dying
on their excrement,

249
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,041
some of them, with a cup of water,

250
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,040
drank half of it and washed
their face with the rest.

251
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:42,293
They even shaved with a piece of glass
using the back of a tray as a mirror.

252
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,837
And they survived.

253
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,681
Taking care of your appearance
and dressing up is a matter of survival.

254
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,854
As I am single,
I should do something to survive.

255
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,808
It looks like you've been
doing some reading.

256
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,058
From Viktor Frankl's
<i>Men's Search for Meaning,</i> right?

257
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,274
I read it in a magazine.

258
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,611
It was an article about waxing.

259
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,740
Do you want to read it?

260
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,072
Sure.

261
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,629
What are you doing?

262
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,427
No way!

263
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,760
Don't make it a dangerous situation.
No need to fasten my seat belt.

264
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,811
Oh, no!

265
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,353
This is why I hesitated
to get in your car.

266
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,687
Going in the same direction,
I'm stupid if I don't.

267
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,863
So I thought
I should ride in the back seat.

268
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,281
But people might think you're
my chauffeur since I give the rich vibe.

269
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,821
Don't do it, please.

270
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,501
Here you go.

271
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,205
I didn't say I was going home.

272
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,791
Can you get off, my lady?

273
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,340
Sure...

274
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,718
Why did you close your eyes?

275
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,013
That's very dangerous.

276
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,100
Honestly...

277
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:22,522
Who? No one closed eyes here.

278
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:26,362
I just looked down like this.
In fact, I looked down on you.

279
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,320
Okay. I wish you luck.

280
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,030
I hope you will get prettier
when I see you again.

281
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,158
Though I doubt that'd be possible.

282
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:50,707
Have a good one!

283
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,165
Welcome...

284
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,468
What? Didn't you leave?

285
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,179
- Jin-woo.
- Yes?

286
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,262
Do I...

287
00:18:59,055 --> 00:18:59,885
Hey!

288
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,808
How am I? Do I look terrible today?
Not good enough?

289
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,475
What?

290
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,732
Did you gain some weight?

291
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,687
Or your face got puffy?

292
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:13,897
Is that right?

293
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,240
- Jin-ho!
- Yes?

294
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,000
How am I?

295
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,421
You are great.

296
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,463
No, as a woman.

297
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,094
Do you want to date me?

298
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,513
No, I don't.

299
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,467
No?

300
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,760
Why not?

301
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,013
Give me three reasons.

302
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,144
If not, date me.

303
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,394
Bo-ra, I'm sorry.

304
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,555
I wish you luck. Go for it!

305
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,274
Where are you going?

306
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,765
I said three reasons!

307
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,857
- Stop it! You are getting scary.
- She's right.

308
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,323
Let's go. Jin-woo, see you.

309
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,863
- Okay. See you.
- Let's go.

310
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,236
- Don't sell me these from now on.
- Okay.

311
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,494
I'm going on a diet.

312
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,410
It's 200,000 won per month,

313
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,576
but with the special promotion,
it's 400,000 KRW for 3 months,

314
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,206
{\an8}600,000 won for 6 months,
800,000 won for a year.

315
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,174
{\an8}Plus, if you register with your friend,

316
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,924
{\an8}there is a one-plus-one promotion.
So you get 50% off.

317
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,137
VAT not included and no refund.
Which one would you like?

318
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,678
The one year option looks good.
I wanna go for the one year one.

319
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,484
We wanna try out first today.

320
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:30,981
Why?

321
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,074
I know you too well.

322
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,228
Who knows? You could quit tomorrow.

323
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,154
Thank you.

324
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,494
Well...

325
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,254
Let's go.

326
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,377
Ma'am, let's do the InBody test first.

327
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,712
- Okay.
- This way.

328
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,547
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

329
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,137
Ma'am, please, look straight.

330
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,682
Grab the handles.

331
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,353
Stay still.

332
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,265
<i>Test initiated.</i>

333
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,313
{\an8}PERCENT BODY FAT

334
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,652
Ma'am.

335
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,533
You are skinny obese
with a lot of visceral fat.

336
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,991
- I'm obese?
- Yes, skinny obese.

337
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,702
You just look slim because of
skinny arms and legs,

338
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,947
but you got no muscle there.

339
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,956
These are all fat. Fat.

340
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,668
Particularly, the abdomen.

341
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,461
You like drinking, don't you?

342
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,384
It looks like it's a beer belly.

343
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,512
Body profile pictures are trending now.

344
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,509
Ma'am, you need to start PT
and take care of your body.

345
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,682
So that you can date and get married.

346
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,681
If you join today,
I'll give you a special...

347
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,433
No thanks. I can take care of my own body.

348
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:52,904
Ma'am?

349
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,034
Two.

350
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,781
Three. Slowly.

351
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,702
Four.

352
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,870
Five more.

353
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:05,779
One.

354
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:10,117
Two. Breathe. You need to breathe.

355
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,254
Three.

356
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,079
Four. Two more.

357
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,843
- And four.
- Excuse me.

358
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,262
Seven. Three more.

359
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,847
- Excuse me.
- One.

360
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,027
It's been a while since I worked out, too.

361
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,688
I'm determined to work out hard
this summer.

362
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:46,874
For summer vacation, on the beach,
I wanna try swim briefs,

363
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,869
not a rash guard.

364
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,082
Would it be possible?

365
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,593
Do you like exercising?

366
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,341
I myself...

367
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:06,391
am thinking about starting
some workout, too.

368
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:07,759
By the way,

369
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:11,095
I agree that wearing rash guards
must be banned from the beach.

370
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,652
Hee-jin, can I expect to see you
in your bikinis this summer?

371
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,692
<i>Aftereffect of breakup number one.</i>

372
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:26,989
<i>I became so needy,</i>
<i>and my self-esteem hit rock bottom.</i>

373
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,033
Hey, what are you doing?

374
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:32,077
<i>I'm afraid that nobody's gonna love me.</i>

375
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,121
What a comedy!

376
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,917
<i>I've suddenly become afraid that I don't</i>

377
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,418
<i>deserve to be loved.</i>

378
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,383
I'm sorry. I wish you luck. Go for it!

379
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,430
- Ma'am.
<i>- I wanna be loved.</i>

380
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,180
<i>I wish everyone likes me.</i>

381
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,313
We both made a mistake yesterday.

382
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,600
- Do you like me?
- No.

383
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:57,524
<i>I wish he likes me.</i>

384
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,483
<i>Even if I don't like him.</i>

385
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,742
<i>His "no"</i>

386
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,108
<i>was hurting.</i>

387
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:22,249
Hi, Yu-jeong.

388
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,550
I would like to make a reservation
for today.

389
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,011
Is it available?

390
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,511
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

391
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,768
We are fully booked for today.

392
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,480
Can you put me on the waitlist?

393
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:41,613
<i>Well...</i>

394
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,689
Same-day booking is not available.

395
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,204
What about tomorrow then?

396
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,619
I'll be very unhappy if I can't
for tomorrow.

397
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,408
For tomorrow...

398
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,332
it's available.

399
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,502
<i>Then, book me for tomorrow, please.</i>

400
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,542
Got it. Thank you.

401
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,496
Okay. Thank you.

402
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,053
Where is it?
It must be too popular to book.

403
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,586
It's a hidden gem in my neighborhood.

404
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,152
{\an8}EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR A DATE

405
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,034
{\an8}<i>White clothes are natural reflectors.</i>

406
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,490
{\an8}<i>They make my face brighter.</i>

407
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,820
{\an8}<i>Complete a neat boyfriend look</i>
<i>with matching blue jeans.</i>

408
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,510
I saw a pretty girl from afar

409
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,218
and realized it was my girlfriend.

410
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,011
{\an8}Ta-da!

411
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,354
{\an8}<i>Never forget a small gift</i>
<i>before your date.</i>

412
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,722
{\an8}- Thanks.
- Too early to say that.

413
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,309
{\an8}Today, just trust and follow me.

414
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,475
{\an8}<i>Don't ask where to go, what to do.</i>
<i>Lead her with confidence.</i>

415
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,199
{\an8}What's wrong?

416
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,319
{\an8}I need to be on the roadside
to protect you.

417
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,406
{\an8}I'll protect my girlfriend.

418
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,661
{\an8}<i>Walk on the roadside.</i>

419
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,332
{\an8}<i>Your kindness will make her tear up.</i>

420
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,671
{\an8}You need to watch yourself first.

421
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,380
{\an8}- Shall I carry your bag?
<i>- Carry her bag.</i>

422
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,340
{\an8}<i>Don't be shy to carry a woman's bag.</i>

423
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,511
Isn't it heavy?

424
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:31,261
This?

425
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,590
Does it look heavy?

426
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,232
{\an8}<i>Pull out the chair.</i>

427
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,017
{\an8}Sorry.

428
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,568
{\an8}- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

429
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,533
{\an8}<i>You deserve more than this!</i>

430
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,453
{\an8}<i>Dine in a fine restaurant!</i>

431
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,372
So this is the place you booked?

432
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,950
It was not necessary. Why on earth...

433
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,207
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

434
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,094
Thank you.

435
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:11,129
<i>So everything was good at the beginning.</i>

436
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,263
<i>- But...</i>
- Why aren't you eating?

437
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,431
Actually, I can't eat sashimi.

438
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,800
- What?
<i>- How silly I was!</i>

439
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,848
<i>From that point on, things got worse.</i>

440
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:33,034
Espresso means "express" in English.

441
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,030
It means fast.

442
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,661
It is an Italian style coffee
brewed in a short period of time.

443
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,532
This is called crema.

444
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,867
The crema is full of coffee flavor.

445
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,202
Smell the flavor first.

446
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,207
Then drink it at once.

447
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,546
How is it?

448
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:53,796
It's good.

449
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,301
Is it? Then shall we go?

450
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,590
Sure.

451
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,232
So hungry. That looks delicious.

452
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:14,112
The most famous place
in Namsan Mountain is Sam-soon Stairs.

453
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,863
It got famous because of the drama.

454
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,025
In the drama,

455
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,454
there is...

456
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:22,282
a kissing scene.

457
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,578
So couples take pictures there
copying the scene from the drama.

458
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:31,586
{\an8}CONSTRUCTION NOTICE

459
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,589
{\an8}It's under construction...

460
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,233
<i>I tried to make it up to her</i>
<i>as much as possible.</i>

461
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:52,523
{\an8}<i>Did I do something wrong today?</i>
<i>I am sorry.</i>

462
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,029
I think I'm screwed.

463
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,873
Maybe she's tired and sleeping.

464
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,580
- Don't worry.
- I can't stop worrying.

465
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,368
She must've been very disappointed.
Does it mean we are over?

466
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:11,627
Am I not supposed to contact her?

467
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:13,883
I believe so.

468
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,303
Jin-woo.

469
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,800
What should I do?

470
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,389
Nothing. Just wait and see.

471
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,557
<i>Jin-ho, it was fun today. Good night.</i>

472
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:34,225
She said it was fun! Jin-woo!

473
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:37,435
Bo-mi said it was fun!

474
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,566
Fun!

475
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:39,572
I lost. Damn it.

476
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,033
Bo-mi said it was fun!

477
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:42,954
Bo-mi?

478
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,866
No... Bom-yi.

479
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,618
Is that right?

480
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,576
We have many similar names in Korea.

481
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,876
- Yes.
- Bo-mi, Bom-yi, Jin-woo.

482
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,250
Jin-ho.

483
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,799
- You made me die. Play again for me.
- Just a sec.

484
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,110
Gently, please.

485
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,067
I'll pay with this.

486
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,034
Here is my card.

487
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,203
Here is my card.

488
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,678
Are you reading it again?

489
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,258
You proofread it three times.

490
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,229
We can't risk any mistakes.

491
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,688
<i>We both should be careful</i>

492
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:55,022
to avoid such a mistake again.

493
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:21,916
It's me.

494
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,166
Can't you tell from my vibe?

495
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,342
What a surprise!

496
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,971
What happened to your face?

497
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,845
You said you will get prettier.

498
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,404
Do we need to cancel our book or what?

499
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,978
You're overreacting.

500
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,937
I just got a facial. That's it.

501
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,316
It's always darkest before the dawn.

502
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,284
You'd better not be blown away later.

503
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,776
Your face is not gonna be redder, is it?

504
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:53,577
If you find out how much I spent
today to be pretty,

505
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,582
you wouldn't be able to say that to me.

506
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,634
That's called splurging.

507
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:01,803
I'm glad I met you here.

508
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,919
Follow me. I wanna show you something.

509
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,100
- Can I get a discount?
- Sure.

510
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,727
Payment, please.

511
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,322
What are you waiting for?
Pull out your card quick.

512
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,364
Here it is.

513
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:26,821
Let me process it.

514
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:30,565
Please, sign here.

515
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,330
Here's your receipt.

516
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,876
- This way, please.
- Okay.

517
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,760
Why should I join this splurge?

518
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,629
There are many reasons.

519
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,717
We get 50% discount
only if we both sign up.

520
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,184
As a publishing planner,

521
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,814
don't you need to inspire
and assist writers by any means?

522
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,103
It's good since this is near our places.

523
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,817
Oh, yeah. Sure it is.

524
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,689
I strongly doubt that
there's any muscle in someone

525
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,107
who just sits and reads books all day.

526
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,316
Take this chance to get some exercise.

527
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,237
Hold on.

528
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:16,293
You think there's no muscle?
How can you be sure about that?

529
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,410
When you see it, you'll be blown away.

530
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,463
Why am I gonna see it?

531
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:27,207
I mean, this type of conversation
can be dangerous.

532
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,007
Didn't we agree to be careful?

533
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:32,181
What part of our conversation
was dangerous?

534
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:35,511
Your expressions make me
imagine your body.

535
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,717
Did you imagine my body?

536
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,978
Even now?

537
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,989
How far have you gone
with your imagination?

538
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,117
Why don't you change, then?
Not gonna work out?

539
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,753
With this face?

540
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,040
I'll do it when my face
settles down a bit.

541
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,924
- I'm leaving.
- Wait.

542
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,631
That's some cheap move.

543
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,091
Who made me end up here?

544
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,131
All right. I will wait then
until you are done.

545
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,969
Don't imagine.

546
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:16,971
I won't!

547
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,740
<i>I did imagine for a brief moment.</i>

548
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,855
<i>Aftereffect of breakup number two.</i>

549
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:38,787
<i>On top of getting needy, my self-esteem</i>
<i>hits rock bottom, I get frustrated,</i>

550
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,749
<i>and I start seeing things.</i>

551
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,014
Yeon Bo-ra!

552
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,425
Oh, hi!

553
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,475
Did you get laser treatment?

554
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,729
- Bingo!
- Did you sign up?

555
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,436
With whom?

556
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:08,613
Him.

557
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,775
Su-hyeok? How come?

558
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,739
He said he needs to work out too.

559
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:24,042
You're trying so hard!

560
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,879
Be honest with me.

561
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,802
You two have something going on?

562
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,545
What do you mean?

563
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:40,505
You were so scared to see him,
but now you work out together.

564
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,967
Isn't it strange?

565
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,727
It isn't.

566
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:47,399
We're bound by the contract and money
for business purposes.

567
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:49,734
Is that right?

568
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,443
It could be more than
a business relationship.

569
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,358
You should be more flexible.

570
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,412
There is a saying,

571
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,490
"When you imagine kissing a man

572
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:05,749
and if it feels okay, you can date him."

573
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:07,707
So...

574
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,470
You just imagined, didn't you?

575
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,144
How was it? Was it good?

576
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,719
Yes, it was.

577
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,016
It was beyond my imagination.

578
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:28,806
Actually, I take it back.

579
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,516
Su-hyeok would never do
something like that with you.

580
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,360
I spoke with Mr. Han over the phone.

581
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:37,073
He thanked me for my help.
So he wanted to treat me.

582
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:39,744
But he was very whiny.

583
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,953
Su-hyeok...

584
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,446
And what?

585
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,287
Why did you stop talking?

586
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,082
Did he talk behind my back again?

587
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:50,751
In fact...

588
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,300
Anyway, you don't care about
things like this.

589
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:58,125
From the beginning, Su-hyeok was against
publishing your book.

590
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,716
He didn't like you,
but Mr. Han persuaded him

591
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,182
to have a meeting with you.

592
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:05,602
Even after agreeing to do it,
he complained about having nightmares.

593
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,941
Not too long ago,
he demanded more shares of the company

594
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:13,439
saying this project is causing
too much emotional labor.

595
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,109
When Mr. Han told me this,
he almost cried.

596
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,993
He really cracked me up.

597
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,775
So I told him you're really something,

598
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,485
and that they shouldn't mess with you.

599
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,502
Well...

600
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,754
Emotional labor?

601
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,786
He wanted this first.

602
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,126
Now he suddenly doesn't want it?

603
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:36,342
He's trying to dump me?

604
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:40,377
"Dump"? You can't say that's the case.
This is just business.

605
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,007
He might hate you because of
personality differences.

606
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,925
Even Deborah, you are no exception.

607
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,523
Then, why...

608
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,518
So, why...

609
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,523
Should I really show him
all my techniques?

610
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:58,025
Major inner reap, major outer reap,
shoulder throw, corner throw.

611
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,530
Which one should I use?

612
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,611
It's me, Deborah.
He picked the wrong person.

613
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,817
He hasn't seen determined Deborah.

614
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,487
Lee Su-hyeok? He's a piece of cake.

615
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,695
Making a man like him fall
for me is child's play.

616
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,922
He is behind me, isn't he?

617
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,275
Oh, no!

618
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,164
Su-hyeok!

619
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,656
I'm so sorry.

620
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,708
Please, accept my sincere apology.

621
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,711
I was so careless.

622
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,514
I didn't mean it. It was a mistake.

623
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:05,009
It was just a casual joke with my bestie.

624
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,684
A mistake again? I should let you off?

625
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:09,774
Why?

626
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,062
Because you were dumped?

627
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,021
Does that justify all your mistakes?

628
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,475
Because your heart is broken,

629
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:21,105
you think it makes it okay
to make mistakes like this?

630
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:24,073
Your feelings are precious,
but mine is okay to mess with?

631
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:27,494
You don't wanna get hurt,
but you don't care about others.

632
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,504
You think apologies
make up for all mistakes?

633
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,326
How can you be so selfish?

634
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,285
And so indulgent.

635
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,425
Do you accept my apology?

636
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,436
Don't act surprised
when I take this to court.

637
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,069
You're joking, right?

638
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,409
Why did you do nothing?
You said you would apologize, too.

639
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,867
I really meant to, but...

640
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,378
Su-hyeok looked so...

641
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:23,761
What do I...

642
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,839
Hi, honey, I am done here.

643
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,216
What?

644
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,563
Despite the reservation,
you are not gonna show up?

645
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,140
<i>At least, it's not a no-show.</i>

646
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,765
<i>Because I am calling now.</i>

647
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,895
You can't cancel or change
the reservation on the day.

648
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,823
I am really sorry.

649
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,569
Young-hoon came to Korea.

650
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,031
He insisted I come see him.

651
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,573
<i>Otherwise, we cannot</i>
<i>see each other for a while.</i>

652
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:51,616
<i>He has no one else. I feel bad.</i>

653
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,744
Okay, then...

654
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,707
Don't be too late.

655
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,829
Be ready to face a no-show penalty.

656
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:04,296
Okay. Thanks, sorry, love you.

657
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,419
TSL.

658
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,468
TSL.

659
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,897
- Hi.
- Hi.

660
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,282
I am gonna make <i>ramyun.</i> Do you want some?

661
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,439
Sure.

662
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,445
No. No way.

663
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,620
I am entering into hard training today.

664
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,196
Sure...

665
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,617
Bo-ra, are you sure?

666
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,379
You mean it, right?

667
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,134
How delicious!

668
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,675
Enjoy.

669
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,760
Hi, Yu-jeong!

670
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:04,439
You must have been very busy!

671
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,942
Just a little.

672
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:07,776
- Hello.
- Hello.

673
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,109
How are you, sir?

674
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,947
Yu-jeong, long time no see.

675
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,947
Young-hoon!

676
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,832
I heard you're back in Korea.

677
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,949
- It's been ages!
- Right?

678
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,790
Where is Jin-woo?

679
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,626
I didn't call. He said he works everyday.

680
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,883
He went out to see someone.

681
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:31,585
Take a seat, wherever you like.

682
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:32,795
Okay.

683
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:40,059
{\an8}RESERVED

684
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,729
<i>Young-hoon is back in Korea.</i>

685
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,563
<i>He insisted I come see him.</i>

686
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:53,856
Hold on.

687
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:56,832
You look better this way.

688
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,027
You're awake.

689
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,525
Yeah.

690
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,412
Did you drink a lot?

691
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:42,451
A little?

692
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,123
Would you like some honey tea?

693
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,212
Sure.

694
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:09,361
Drink this.

695
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,410
- Jin-woo.
- What?

696
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,624
You got anything to tell me?

697
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,081
- Tell you what?
- Just...

698
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,915
Nothing?

699
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:31,752
Nothing.

700
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,884
I see.

701
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,721
You had a good time with Young-hoon?

702
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,267
Yes, I did.

703
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,099
As it's been a while...

704
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,856
He must've looked a lot better
and gained some weight.

705
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:52,729
That's right.

706
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:56,613
Call him and ask if he got home safe.

707
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,784
I bet he did.

708
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,695
Oh, he did. I already called him.

709
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:04,164
Try another call.

710
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,954
I wanna say hello to him, too.

711
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,789
Why?

712
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,422
You can't?

713
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,845
Let me ask again, Jin-woo.

714
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,680
Are you sure you got nothing to tell me?

715
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:29,845
Last chance.

716
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:35,573
If you tell me the truth,
I'll forgive you.

717
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:39,323
What do you want me to say?

718
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,382
Are you really gonna forgive me?

719
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:04,716
Actually...

720
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,020
I didn't meet Young-hoon...

721
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,018
I met Ju-wan.

722
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,740
What?

723
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:22,526
Who?

724
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,529
Ju-wan.

725
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,327
I told you not to meet him.

726
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:30,714
You know I hate him a lot.
But you lied to meet him?

727
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:34,833
You said you'd forgive me
if I told the truth. What's this?

728
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:37,745
Besides, Ju-wan and I
are longtime friends.

729
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,127
How can I not see him?

730
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,634
Then why did you tell me
you wouldn't see him?

731
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:44,796
You intended to lie from the beginning.

732
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:46,636
Because you hate him.

733
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,640
Anyway, I'll keep seeing him.

734
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,733
So you're not gonna change your mind?

735
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:52,481
Pick one.

736
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:54,476
Me or Ju-wan?

737
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,863
Why would you ask something like that?

738
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:00,318
Why can't you answer?

739
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:03,571
If Ju-wan and I are both drowning,
who are you gonna save?

740
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,004
Why is this difficult to answer?

741
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:13,672
But why would you two
be drowning together?

742
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:14,828
That doesn't make sense.

743
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,336
Does it make sense
to deceive me to meet Ju-wan?

744
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,013
I get it.

745
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:24,723
I was wrong.

746
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:31,469
As long as you know, it's fine.

747
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:32,678
Wash up and go to bed.

748
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,423
Su-hyeok!

749
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,795
You haven't skipped a day.

750
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,302
You're not even greeting me back?

751
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,643
I haven't decided on that.

752
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:12,638
For I'm confused whether
you are a witness or an accomplice.

753
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:15,394
Don't be confused at all.

754
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,186
Of course, I am a witness.

755
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:21,731
If you want my testimony, I'm ready.

756
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,451
Can't you do me a favor like last time?

757
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,741
What if I beg for you to overlook
the mistake Bo-ra made?

758
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:34,619
I guess not,
since it's more serious this time.

759
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:35,834
You're right.

760
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,036
The nature of the mistake
is extremely bad.

761
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,252
Think of it as peeing in public
with her mouth,

762
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:44,507
and let her off once more, please?

763
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,336
She's all talk and no action.

764
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,885
It's not like she'll suddenly
kiss you or something.

765
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:52,099
She's not that crazy.

766
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:57,057
Kiss?

767
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:00,809
I mean if she were to do anything,
she wouldn't do that at least.

768
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,000
Hi, Sang-jin.

769
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:24,086
I got it. Okay.

770
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,553
Su-hyeok!

771
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,060
Would you like to grab something
to drink after you're done?

772
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,180
I'd like to apologize again...

773
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,397
No, something urgent
came up at the company.

774
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,070
No?

775
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,697
He might have forgiven me, not you.

776
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:02,956
What is it?

777
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:06,753
I think I know whose leg that is.

778
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,259
You saw something you shouldn't?

779
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,556
Bo-ra, long time no see.

780
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,060
Come on in. Let's have a drink.

781
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:22,312
I don't wanna drink by myself
on a day like today.

782
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:46,376
What are you doing? Where are
all the friends you talked about?

783
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:49,171
They are bastards.

784
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,049
When I got married,

785
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,803
they called me out every night
saying I shouldn't be whipped.

786
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:58,846
Now that they are married,
they seemed okay with being whipped.

787
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:02,313
By the way, why did you call me?

788
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:05,153
You could've gone on a date as usual.

789
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,820
On a day like today,

790
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,744
I don't feel like dating.

791
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,031
Why not? Is today special?

792
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:24,120
Yes. It's my marriage
and divorce anniversary.

793
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:28,628
Didn't want to have two worst days
in a year, so I put them together.

794
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,631
Not sure if it was a good idea.

795
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:33,587
Not sure if I should be happy or sad.

796
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,054
I am confused.

797
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,304
You can do both.

798
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,058
You're smart, Su-jin...

799
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:44,015
You can call me Su-jin only for today.

800
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:48,442
Why only for today?
Just let me call you that from now on.

801
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,316
Su-jin, stop harassing me, please.

802
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,896
By the way, Chief Editor,

803
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:58,366
what made you treat her like this?

804
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,779
Ask Yu-jeong.

805
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,294
I did. She has no idea.

806
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:06,332
You really have no idea?

807
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:11,249
You are the culprit
who is responsible for my marriage.

808
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:13,762
Why me?

809
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,340
You introduced him to me.

810
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,684
And kept saying,
"Love is around the corner."

811
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,180
"Call and ask him out."
"He is your perfect match."

812
00:52:20,263 --> 00:52:23,853
"Such a man can be your perfect husband."
"Attractive and perfect for you."

813
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,643
You spitted out all fancy words.

814
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,766
My marriage was the final product
of you gaslighting me.

815
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,190
What are you talking about?

816
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:35,855
Did I introduce him?
You guys just clicked.

817
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:37,695
I acted like that, because your husband...

818
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:42,491
No. Mr. Han...

819
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:45,367
asked me to help him with
his relationship with you.

820
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,164
So I was just cheerleading.

821
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:48,618
This is nonsense.

822
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:51,168
Am I the culprit? Do you really think so?

823
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:54,462
That's why you've been
hating me after your divorce?

824
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,974
I guess you've gone too far.

825
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,141
You're right.

826
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,215
I know you are not the culprit.

827
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:08,852
But back then, I needed someone to blame.

828
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,060
It was too hard for me to admit that was

829
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,280
the consequence of the choice I made.

830
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,447
I almost...

831
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,459
got married because of Yu-jeong too.

832
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,708
Let's make a toast.

833
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,369
- Hey...
- Watch her.

834
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:31,998
And the men she introduces.

835
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,304
I've never introduced one.

836
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,718
You're happy with your husband.
Can't you just be generous and let us be?

837
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:38,928
She's right.

838
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,760
Happy?

839
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,310
You'll never know the true story
of a couple.

840
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:48,228
As of today, we have
officially become a sexless couple.

841
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,936
Because of the no-show yesterday.

842
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,441
So...

843
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:56,694
They used to make love once a month.

844
00:53:56,776 --> 00:54:00,736
This couple has a kind of booking system.

845
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,321
But there was a no-show yesterday.

846
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:04,411
Oh, my.

847
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:06,791
It's okay.

848
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:12,959
Cheers!

849
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:18,344
One out of three
married couples is sexless.

850
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,376
One out of three married
couples get divorced.

851
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,596
One out of three women
in their 30s is single.

852
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:29,599
Therefore, we just belong to
below average, lower 30%.

853
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,274
But we're not the worst.

854
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:33,772
You're right. Right.

855
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:35,605
Yes, right.

856
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:41,863
Let's go out and do something.

857
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,656
We can't just sit here today.

858
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,619
- Are we going out?
- Let's go.

859
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,530
Let's go.

860
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:49,373
Let's go. Today can't be like this.

861
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,163
I am leaving my bag here.

862
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:52,917
<i>Guess where I am now.</i>

863
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,039
Good idea!

864
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:56,836
<i>Where are you?</i>

865
00:54:58,796 --> 00:54:59,876
Okay.

866
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,799
<i>In front of Woo Bar. Come out.</i>

867
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,342
Sounds fun!

868
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,759
- My heart is pounding.
- Thanks.

869
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:15,064
- See you.
- Where to? No more drinks?

870
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:16,766
No. We're gonna have some tea.

871
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:18,896
She might not come home tonight.

872
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:20,323
Right. I lied.

873
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:21,611
I'll be home very late.

874
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,447
Be safe!

875
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:33,581
Hey. What brought you here?

876
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:37,248
Oh, I knew you were here.
I wanted to go home with you.

877
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,672
Hey, welcome! Join us.

878
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:40,844
She's Bo-ra's sister.

879
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,341
Good for us.

880
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:46,093
We need one from the MZ generation
to lower our age average.

881
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,337
No, you can't.

882
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,058
You go home now.

883
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,849
- Let's go.
- Why not?

884
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:52,852
Join us.

885
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,983
- Where are we going?
- WSP.

886
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:56,691
"Women's Secret Party."

887
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,820
Which one?

888
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:07,195
Where shall we go?

889
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,991
Su-jin, you can choose the location.

890
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:12,288
A hot place among younger guys?

891
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,329
You want to go to that kind of place?

892
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,501
What is this?

893
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,420
Are they lining up for this place?

894
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,166
I know what this place is for.

895
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:26,926
It's for picking up a date.
It'll be fun. Shall we go in?

896
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:31,175
<i>Damn it! They're going to</i>
<i>one of those bars for singles.</i>

897
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,225
- Jin-woo.
- What?

898
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,518
I think Yu-jeong went out to
really enjoy herself. You okay with that?

899
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:43,323
What if she goes to
one of those bars for singles?

900
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,570
She won't go to a place like that.

901
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:46,653
Clean up!

902
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,699
Four girls wanted!

903
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:55,785
I'm doing it. Here's four girls!

904
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:58,081
Don't do this.

905
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,415
Sorry, but I need to check your ID.

906
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:05,382
I never had my ID checked even in my 20s.

907
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,514
God bless you!

908
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,591
What year were minors right now born in?

909
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:11,347
I think 2002 or 2003.

910
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:15,717
Wait, 2002?
The year World Cup was held here.

911
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:18,268
Do you remember?
Let's go, let's go, Korea!

912
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:31,323
Sorry, but we can only admit
patrons born in or after 1993.

913
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,720
- This place is nice.
- Tell me about it.

914
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:58,015
Now we are in the right place for our age.

915
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,690
Today is for WSP.
So let's have fun with women only.

916
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,230
Let's not make
the same mistake we did earlier.

917
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,895
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

918
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:07,402
For WSP...

919
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,404
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

920
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:14,333
Su-jin, is this who you really are?

921
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:15,948
Hey, let's dance!

922
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:18,155
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

923
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:20,785
You're going to regret it.

924
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:22,293
Here's your drink.

925
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:23,464
Thank you.

926
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,047
Cheers! How old are you?

927
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,930
If you have no boyfriend,
how about we have a drink?

928
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,428
I am 40...

929
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,469
and divorced.

930
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:38,925
I am here to find my soulmate
who can spend his life with me forever.

931
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:40,725
Thank you for asking.

932
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:42,559
- My number is...
- Excuse me.

933
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:55,742
You wanna join me?

934
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,329
Are you with friends?

935
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:10,092
It's not a sin to fall in love
even if you're married.

936
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:13,723
It's not a sin, but there are punishments.

937
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:15,261
From heaven.

938
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:23,064
I like your style.

939
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:25,313
What do you do?

940
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:27,398
Pardon?

941
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:30,356
You...

942
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:33,145
Right! You are...

943
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:35,778
...you!

944
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:43,746
My gosh...

945
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,420
How do you do?

946
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,130
Would you like a drink?

947
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:50,878
Come on.

948
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:52,797
I have company.

949
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:53,921
Where are you from?

950
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,045
- How old are you?
- Leave me alone.

951
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:59,474
Excuse me.

952
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:00,965
What about me?

953
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,386
- Me, me.
- Excuse me.

954
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:05,636
I told you. You should dance too.

955
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,823
Do you like these kind of places?

956
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:19,156
Do you feel better now?

957
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,655
Hey, we didn't come here just for me.

958
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:25,035
You look very stressed these days.

959
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,002
That's why I brought you here.

960
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,962
Should I be thankful?

961
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:30,746
Yes, you're very welcome.

962
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:32,206
Just wait and see.

963
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:35,546
You're gonna really appreciate something.

964
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:38,965
I will...

965
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:42,255
bring amazing ladies.

966
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:43,718
Just sit tight.

967
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,883
My offer to buy you a drink would be

968
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,594
such a boring pickup line, wouldn't it?

969
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:18,837
Why don't you buy me a drink?
Then, I will...

970
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,393
Hi, Mr. Han.

971
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:29,099
I reviewed the project proposal.

972
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:34,729
Why don't we go upstairs and discuss it?

973
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:38,695
The project proposal?
Now, all of a sudden?

974
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,157
Yes. Let's go.

975
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:46,792
By the way, I have company.

976
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,540
Yu-jeong...

977
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:50,576
She went to the restroom.

978
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:54,289
Is that right? It's fine.

979
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,548
I was going to treat Yu-jeong as well.

980
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,130
I can treat you both!

981
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,086
Let's go.

982
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:02,762
Is that so?

983
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:04,555
Let's take a look at the proposal.

984
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:13,271
Come on in.

985
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,320
Is this for real?

986
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:18,990
Seriously...

987
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,773
TRUE TO LOVE

988
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:30,808
Good night.

989
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:33,392
{\an8}<i>- "Are you sleeping?"</i>
<i>- What's this?</i>

990
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:36,307
{\an8}<i>What do you think it is?</i>
<i>It's the typical text from your ex.</i>

991
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:37,516
{\an8}It doesn't mean anything.

992
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:38,976
{\an8}<i>Marriage is about trust.</i>

993
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:39,896
{\an8}What the...

994
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:40,823
{\an8}How dare...

995
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:42,741
{\an8}<i>Yu-jeong, whose side are you on now?</i>

996
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,109
{\an8}- Are you okay?
- Yu-jeong.

997
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:45,736
{\an8}<i>Do you really believe in destiny?</i>

998
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,122
{\an8}<i>Honestly, I'm not sure.</i>
<i>But I decided to believe in it.</i>

999
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,030
{\an8}I love you.

1000
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,037
{\an8}Bo-ra!

1001
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,499
{\an8}When I decided on my marriage,
"Deborah says!" played a decisive role.

1002
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:57,211
{\an8}<i>I thought I would give</i>
<i>the first invitation to him.</i>

1003
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,632
{\an8}<i>I wish he would cry very hard.</i>

1004
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,461
{\an8}Revenge? Lingering affection?

1005
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:04,757
{\an8}Not sure. I guess I wanna
shake him up one last time...

1006
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,051
{\an8}- Right.
<i>- Something like that, I guess.</i>

1007
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,425
{\an8}<i>Congrats.</i>

1008
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:10,182
{\an8}<i>Did you really love me?</i>

1009
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:11,274
{\an8}<i>Yu-ri.</i>

1010
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:15,768
{\an8}<i>So, Su-hyeok is Yu-ri's ex-boyfriend?</i>
