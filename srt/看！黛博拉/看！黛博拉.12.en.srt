LIKE A SCENE FROM A DRAMA

6
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,946
Would you like to go to a movie with me?

7
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:54,615
Shall we then?

8
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,211
Attention.

9
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,089
Why don't we wrap it up early today?

10
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,966
- Really?
- Sounds great.

11
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,050
Sounds good!

12
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,343
- Yes!
- Sounds good.

13
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,427
All right.

14
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,305
Let's all wrap it up early then.

15
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,557
And let's

16
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,643
all go to a movie together in the evening.

17
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,772
- Pardon?
- Why?

18
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,695
Today is "Culture Day."

19
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:37,032
As people in the culture industry,
we need to do our share.

20
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,327
U-ri.

21
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,123
Please gather opinions on
which movie to watch today

22
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,749
and book tickets.

23
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,127
Sure.

24
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:54,758
Isn't it nice?
All of us watching a movie together.

25
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,594
Yes.

26
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,311
U-ri.

27
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,897
I'm expected to pass out
with a severe stomachache later.

28
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,315
No need to buy mine.

29
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,819
I'm expected to help my co-worker
who has a severe stomachache.

30
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:16,614
I'm expected to give my co-worker
with a severe stomachache

31
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,991
and another one who's helping him
a ride to the hospital.

32
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,743
I see.

33
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,412
<i>I'm feeling under the weather.</i>

34
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,830
<i>I have a previous engagement.</i>

35
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:25,956
<i>Same here.</i>

CULTURE DAY: JINLEE RSVP LIST
DECLINE, NO RESPONSE

37
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,344
Did you meet the aunts?

38
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,596
Right now?

39
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,556
I have plans today.

40
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,516
<i>It won't take long.</i>

41
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,061
<i>Come and say hi to them just briefly.</i>

42
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,063
<i>I bragged about my son so much.</i>

43
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,315
<i>If you don't come, I'd be so embarrassed.</i>

44
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,652
<i>Play a good son like this at least.</i>

45
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,654
Okay.

46
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,323
I'll just pick up the bill and take off.

47
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,950
- That's it, okay?
<i>- Sure.</i>

48
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,382
Sang-jin. I booked movie tickets.

49
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,634
By the way, where are you off to?

50
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,012
I'll head there straight away.

51
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,889
I have somewhere to be right now.

52
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,349
Text me the ticket information.

53
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,977
I see. You'll really come, right?

54
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,270
Of course I will.

55
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,151
This way, sir.

56
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,790
<i>She runs a pediatric dentistry.</i>

57
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,711
<i>She was briefly married and divorced,
just like you, so...</i>

58
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,920
Mom, please...

59
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,756
I said I don't want to get married.

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,634
<i>Who told you to get married?</i>

61
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:04,555
<i>Just sit down and have a meal with her,
for my sake.</i>

62
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,516
<i>After that, I won't butt in anymore.</i>

63
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,907
Hello.

64
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,163
I'm sorry I'm so late.

65
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,581
I was stuck in traffic.

66
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,958
It's okay. I just got here, too.

67
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:40,758
MOTHER

68
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,495
Please enter Theater 3.

69
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,671
<i>Sang-jin. I'm running out of battery.</i>

70
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,174
<i>I'll be waiting in front of the theater.</i>

71
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:27,930
What a coincidence.

72
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,264
I know.

73
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,432
Did you come alone?

74
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,977
No, I have company.

75
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,314
She's been looking at us.

76
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,398
What's that?

77
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,363
Bo-ra.

78
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,454
They watched the same movie as us.

79
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,332
- This is...
- Nice to meet you. I'm Su-hyeok's mom.

80
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,251
This is my husband.

81
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,253
Pleasure to meet you.

82
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,171
Hello, ma'am.

83
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,381
Hello, sir.

84
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,175
I didn't know you were on a date, son,

85
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,844
with such a beautiful lady.

86
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,930
Thank you so much.

87
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,683
But you look more beautiful.

88
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,436
Oh, my, that's so sweet of you.

89
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,065
I've never seen him with a woman before.

90
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,402
That's why I thought you were into men.

91
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,737
Honey...

92
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,116
Not that I would mind that at all.

93
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,367
You know that, right?

94
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,370
No matter what you say,
I'm always here to listen to you.

95
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,330
I'm always waiting for you
to reach out to me.

96
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,125
If you have a hard time
and need some comfort,

97
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,460
come running to me whenever, okay?

98
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,546
All right, Mom.

99
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,840
- Father.
- Right.

100
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,302
A-young, let's stop interrupting his date.

101
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,429
Shall we go on with our own date?

102
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,181
All right.

103
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,600
- It was great meeting you.
- Same here.

104
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,852
I wish we could have a meal today.

105
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,812
But I know
you two must have your own plan.

106
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,107
- Let's have a meal when you're available.
- Sure.

107
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,442
When are you available?

108
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,695
- For me...
- You should go.

109
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,614
Let's go.

110
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,449
- Take care.
- Let's go.

111
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,411
Shall we go now?

112
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,455
Okay.

113
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,753
You don't take after your father.

114
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,879
What's that?

115
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,923
He's incredibly sweet.

116
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,385
They seem like such a sweet couple.

117
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,138
I was actually surprised.

118
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,265
I can't believe a married couple

119
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,643
like in a drama
actually exists in reality.

120
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,978
A married couple who still hold
each other's hands,

121
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,356
call each other by first names,
and enjoy a date.

122
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,611
By the way, why do you call her Mom

123
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,738
and call him Father, instead of Dad?

124
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,074
Men usually call their fathers just "Dad".

125
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,533
Is that how you were taught?

126
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,994
That's true.

127
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,829
I called my mom "Mom"

128
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,915
and my dad "Father."

129
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,669
My mom got divorced when I was little.

130
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,545
She married again

131
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,299
probably when I was in 5th grade.

132
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,010
So my current father is my stepfather.

133
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,723
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

134
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,434
No need to be sorry.

135
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,144
Of course you didn't know.

136
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,815
Now that I think of it,
I've never talked about this

137
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,900
to anyone other than Sang-jin.

138
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,699
My father fell in love with my mom
at first sight.

139
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,784
He wanted to marry her right away.

140
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,495
Little did he know that

141
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,248
she was six years older and had a son.

142
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,791
Until they got married,

143
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,961
the opposition from their parents
was so severe

144
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,546
that it was quite dramatic.

145
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,551
It really sounds like
a story from a drama.

146
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,554
Fearless, romanticist
younger man's love story.

147
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,392
A child who witnesses his parents' divorce

148
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,478
learns something first
before figuring out what love is.

149
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,441
"People who were in love
could no longer love each other."

150
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,901
"Love can change."

151
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,156
That's the reason why I feel uncomfortable
showing my emotions

152
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,160
and surely have a problem
with my love life,

153
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,245
according to my mom's analysis.

154
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,083
As a child,

155
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:29,212
I hardly cried or smiled.
I had my nose in a book all the time.

156
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,381
She was so curious
what was going on in my head.

157
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,885
So she started studying
child psychology late in the day.

158
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,513
She got a PhD in child psychology.

159
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,518
So does she say
she can understand you now?

160
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,356
Nope.

161
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,734
She said she can understand other kids,
but it's still hard to understand me.

162
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,404
It's always like that.

163
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:59,368
Same here. Others' romances are easy,

164
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,161
but my romantic relationship is hard.

165
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,374
The mind of a loved one
is always complicated.

166
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,462
As a child,

167
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:15,300
when you see your parents being at
each other's throats but not divorced,

168
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,760
you know what they learn?

169
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,723
"Revealing the very deepest emotions
between a man

170
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,850
and a woman is ugly."

171
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,311
"It's very meaningless and sad."

172
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,817
That's perhaps why it's so hard for me
to be honest in a romantic relationship.

173
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,071
That's based on my analysis.

174
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:41,326
Anyways, that is why I loved dramas.

175
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,870
At first, I turned the volume up on the TV

176
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,747
'cause I was just sick of
hearing them fight.

177
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,768
Seeing the characters slap each other
on the face, throw water on the face,

178
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:53,547
scream, or run each other over with a car,
was somewhat comforting to me.

179
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,966
I thought, "This is how people live."

180
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,428
"My family is relatively normal."

181
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,766
Only later did I realize
that it was called "soap opera."

182
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,795
<i>Sang-jin. I'm running out of battery.</i>

183
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,423
<i>I'll be waiting in front of the theater.</i>

184
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,507
U-RI

185
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,761
<i>The phone is off.</i>

186
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:45,307
<i>You'll be connected to a voicemail
and be charged after the beep...</i>

187
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,529
- Hey.
- Is the movie over? Did you guys have fun?

188
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,282
What? Yeah.

189
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,618
<i>I'm tired. I'm going to turn in early.</i>

190
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,497
<i>Let them eat something nice, my treat,
and say bye to everyone for me.</i>

191
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,665
No, I'm not with them.

192
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,210
<i>I checked U-ri's message late.</i>

193
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,046
<i>And all the others replied
that they couldn't make it.</i>

194
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,130
What?

195
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,341
Where are you now?

196
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:20,884
Me?

197
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:23,595
I'm...

198
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,722
Okay, anyways... I'm hanging up.

199
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,408
U-ri.

200
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,626
Sang-jin.

201
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,003
You're very late.

202
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,091
Something came up out of the blue.
I checked your text late. I'm sorry.

203
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,969
But why did you just keep waiting?

204
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,555
You should've left
if I didn't come on time for the movie.

205
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,015
While waiting,

206
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,020
it crossed my mind that
you might not be coming.

207
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,191
Still, I just waited.

208
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,120
U-ri.

209
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,456
Do you know I'm divorced?

210
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,375
Yes.

211
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:40,755
I heard Su-hyeok mention it
many times, so I'm aware of it.

212
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,216
U-ri.

213
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,303
I like you very much.

214
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,014
Yes, so do I.

215
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,767
No, what I mean is,

216
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:54,978
I...

217
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,564
don't deserve it.

218
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,819
I don't deserve to receive your heart.

219
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,281
Don't worry.

220
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,658
Everyone deserves to be loved.

221
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,119
Because we were all born to be loved.

222
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,831
That's right.

223
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:21,379
I want to work with you for a long time,

224
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,299
as co-workers who feel comfortable
and have fun

225
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,842
with one another, on good terms.

226
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,010
Like we are now.

227
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,763
Do you understand what I mean?

228
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,810
Yes.

229
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,440
But...

230
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,569
I haven't even told you
my feelings about you.

231
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,531
That's why I'm bringing it up first.

232
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,910
'Cause if you do tell me,
I'd have to say no.

233
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,871
And I'll have to see your face
at work tomorrow.

234
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,082
Saying, "Good morning!" or "Good job!"

235
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,501
We might not be able to do
all that, as it'd be awkward.

236
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,002
I'm being considerate of you.

237
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,092
That's awfully considerate of you.

238
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,804
You should have let me say
how I feel about you.

239
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,139
Even if I get rejected,

240
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,768
I've been wanting to tell you

241
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,272
that I've come to have feelings for you.

242
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,448
You can probably never imagine

243
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,245
how much courage I mustered up today.

244
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,590
Cheers.

245
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,315
You are aware that
you're pretty nice-looking, aren't you?

246
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,156
You give a compliment
with quite an offensive tone.

247
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,324
Thanks.

248
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,244
That wasn't a compliment.

249
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:21,040
That is a very big weakness,

250
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,417
according to my analysis.

251
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:27,005
That is why having romances
was possible for you, despite all that,

252
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,383
because they put up with you.

253
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,512
So your dating skills have not improved.

254
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,348
So then,

255
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,559
are you good at romances?

256
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,227
Seriously?

257
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,480
Are you kidding? I'm Deborah.

258
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,733
Though I have to admit I got dumped too.

259
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:49,986
I mean,

260
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,988
I'm quite a catch.

261
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,951
If we go out together,
who do you think will be dumped?

262
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,453
Aren't you curious?

263
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,331
That's pointless.

264
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,625
Why is it pointless?

265
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,669
In the World Cup, the third-place match
is the most ruthless.

266
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,631
If losers have a match and lose again,

267
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,842
there is really no going back.

268
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,429
Let's say you're the dumper.

269
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,097
Because I don't care.

270
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,599
Are you sure?

271
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,184
- Promise?
- Yes.

272
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,481
But it's not possible anyway.

273
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,317
You and me?

274
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,904
Well, it's not entirely impossible.

275
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,490
You said you hate me.

276
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,828
You said, "I don't hate you."

277
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,122
- That's...
- No need to explain.

278
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,250
I knew it all along anyway.

279
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,879
When we met for the first time...

280
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,090
Rings have no use in the first place,

281
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,092
but I guess it needs a purpose.

282
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,095
<i>It was written all over your face.</i>

283
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,557
"I despise you.
I really despise a woman like you."

284
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,853
The first four seconds
decide a first impression.

285
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,980
To reverse that,

286
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,482
it takes an impression
that's 200 times stronger,

287
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,777
or more than 60 encounters.

288
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,364
So it still should be the same.

289
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,741
You see...

290
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,328
I said that wasn't the first time we met.

291
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:29,460
Where then, at a wedding hall, me in
a black dress, walking in slow motion?

292
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,547
Unbelievable...

293
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,340
You're making up complete fiction.

294
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,342
You could write a scenario.

295
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,470
I'm not that creative.

296
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,807
You really don't remember it.

297
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,434
Cheers.

298
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,147
By the way,

299
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,734
what kind of woman is "a woman like you"?

300
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:53,943
I'm really curious.

301
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,904
"A woman like you" is a woman like me.

302
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,072
Me...

303
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,618
A woman like me...

304
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,287
Maybe I'm needy.

305
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,417
I just hope everyone likes me.

306
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,338
I'm sure you already know
that I'm an attention seeker.

307
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,759
I'm pretty shallow.

308
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:21,262
If an expensive clothing
is missing a logo,

309
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,764
I feel so, so disappointed.

310
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,098
Disappointed?

311
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:29,437
And this glass is not half-full.

312
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,189
It is half-empty.

313
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,024
"Oh, no! I have to fill it up."

314
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,902
I get anxious and pessimistic.

315
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,863
I fret about even the tiniest things.

316
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,282
That's what I am.

317
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,327
Not that attractive, right?

318
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,791
Some might find it attractive.

319
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,542
Some might like you for it.

320
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,757
What kind of
irresponsible consolation is that?

321
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,385
You mean something like this?

322
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,179
"I love you just the way you are."

323
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,265
How magical.

324
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,727
There might be at least one person.

325
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,105
You don't need many.

326
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,524
All you need is one person.

327
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,569
So where in the world is that one person?

328
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:19,904
Where?

329
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:23,783
Perhaps,

330
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,285
not that far away?

331
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,710
I mean,

332
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:39,424
he might be closer to you than you think.

333
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,761
<i>Don't be fooled by those romantic eyes.</i>

334
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,642
Why are you looking at me like that?

335
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,146
How did I look at you?

336
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,066
Dangerously?

337
00:21:58,693 --> 00:21:59,694
Did I?

338
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:12,665
<i>The day when I oddly didn't get drunk
no matter how much I drank.</i>

339
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,960
<i>The day when I felt okay
sitting in silence.</i>

340
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,380
<i>The wind felt pleasant,</i>

341
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:22,508
<i>and the night that got longer felt short.</i>

342
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,761
<i>It was the last day of autumn,</i>

343
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,846
<i>and the first day of winter.</i>

344
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:31,642
Is it too late for another drink?

345
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,853
Well...

346
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,356
One drink wouldn't hurt, I think?

347
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:41,069
Then where should we...

348
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,572
I'll tell you what.

349
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,991
How about a drink at my place?

350
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,625
<i>Don't get ahead of myself.</i>

351
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,169
<i>Don't be fooled by those romantic...</i>

352
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,379
Shall we then?

353
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,437
No.

354
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:20,274
That was such an inappropriate suggestion.

355
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,111
Right?

356
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,365
Alcohol at night,
privately alone in the house.

357
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,034
That's such a cliché.

358
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:34,163
Of course, it won't affect us though.
Because we are Mulder and Scully.

359
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,833
Still, just to play it safe.

360
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,292
Right.

361
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,212
- I'll get a taxi.
- Okay.

362
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,338
Sounds good.

363
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,843
Taxi.

364
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,390
Get in. No, I'll get in first.

365
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:06,237
No wonder, I suddenly felt drowsy
and low on energy.

366
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,447
It was because it's bedtime.

367
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,703
Bo-mi must be waiting for me.

368
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,290
- What's that?
- What? My sister.

369
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,834
Oh, Bo-mi...

370
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,276
This is me.

371
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,363
I'm off.

372
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,781
Okay, get home safely.

373
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:51,908
Okay.

374
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,416
Thank you.

375
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,051
Here.

376
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,304
I said we should just grab a beer.

377
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,265
Why did you feel like wine?

378
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,016
To get in the mood.

379
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:03,062
Jin-woo. We left out something important.

380
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,940
Flirting. That's the most exciting part.

381
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,277
So you want to flirt with me?

382
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,237
- Now? Isn't it too late?
- We can do this.

383
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,699
This is our blind date.
We've never met before, got it?

384
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,201
I heard men are attracted
to a woman they first met.

385
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,663
Do I have to have a blind date?

386
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:24,375
All right.

387
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,419
Start.

388
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,839
Hi.

389
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:30,965
Hello.

390
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,718
I'm Lee Yu-jeong.

391
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,261
Your name is...

392
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,514
I'm Yang Jin-woo.

393
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,516
Jin-woo.

394
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:48,357
What are you into? Like hobbies.

395
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,361
Well...

396
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,156
I like to...

397
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,950
rip it up,

398
00:26:58,034 --> 00:26:59,660
wash it,

399
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,163
heat it up,

400
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,832
and make it seethe vigorously?

401
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,302
I mean cooking.

402
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:21,307
Jin-woo. What were you thinking of?

403
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,477
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

404
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,481
Hold on.

405
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,358
But if your hobby is cooking...

406
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,861
Well, technically,
you didn't say you're good at it.

407
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,863
What's your secret ingredient
that makes food

408
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,615
taste like metal and cosmetics?

409
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,662
For crying out loud...

410
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,832
Jin-woo, is this the best you can do?

411
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,127
You're so out of character.
It's so hard to focus. Am I right?

412
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,588
Even you don't eat
what you cook, 'cause it's bad.

413
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:56,342
Get into it. We've never met before.

414
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,513
Here.

415
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,143
So good.

416
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,481
It gets discarded after its sell-by date?

417
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,899
Though it's perfectly fine?

418
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,193
Yes, that's why I eat it all up.

419
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,611
You want some more?

420
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,737
Yes.

421
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:18,823
Hold on.

422
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,034
BO-RA

423
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,371
Why aren't you picking up?

424
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,998
No need. I know what she'll say.

425
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:30,042
She'll tell me to come home soon.

426
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,002
She's gotten worse these days.

427
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,339
I'm sure she's just worried about you.

428
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,049
Whose side are you on?

429
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,718
I'm on your side, of course.

430
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,223
You're right.

431
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,600
She's worried about me all the time.

432
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:51,313
"What is she going to do with her life?"
"Until when is she going to be like this?"

433
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,274
She thinks I'm really pathetic.

434
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,317
Why wouldn't she?

435
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,153
Even I think I'm pathetic.

436
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,490
What on earth made you think that?

437
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,117
It's just...

438
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,911
I thought I'd become something.

439
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,414
But this is it.

440
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,000
This is what I've become.

441
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,962
There's nothing I'm particularly good at
or I want to do.

442
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,923
I find myself kind of pathetic and lame.

443
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:21,594
You're not lame. If you were lame,
why did I fall in love with you?

444
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,097
You were just out of the army.
You weren't thinking straight.

445
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:27,141
You would have fallen for any woman.

446
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,225
No, I wouldn't have.

447
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:31,854
For two years, all I saw was girl groups.
My standards for women are so high.

448
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,857
You haven't tried anything yet.
That means you can do anything.

449
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,859
You're pretty, so you can model.

450
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,944
You can be an actress, and...

451
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,863
Since you're a great dancer,

452
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,073
you can be in <i>Street Woman Fighter...</i>

453
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,742
Went too far.

454
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,245
You can drink really well,
you're great at cursing,

455
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,580
you're good at arguing.

456
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,831
You'd make a good killer.

457
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,459
When you said,
"I'll kill you if you follow me."

458
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,587
You were so charismatic...

459
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,880
Jeez...

460
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,134
To be honest,

461
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:07,097
sometimes I don't like myself.

462
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,849
But when I'm with you,

463
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:11,268
I somehow feel like I can do anything.

464
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,231
So...

465
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,400
I hope you feel the same way.

466
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,700
You're making me cringe.

467
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,713
You got cream here.

468
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,050
Where? Here?

469
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,261
This side.

470
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:47,638
- Here.
- Where?

471
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:13,872
What was that?

472
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,457
Did you hear the thud?

473
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,876
I don't know. I heard nothing.

474
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:19,378
Yes, I did.

475
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,755
I heard a thud from downstairs.

476
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,258
Yu-jeong.

477
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,387
We should finish our talk.

478
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,681
Out of my way. Maybe later.

479
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,809
Body talk.

480
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,897
Call 911.

481
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:42,860
Tonight, there will be
a big fire in our house.

482
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,363
So sexy!

483
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:56,999
Bo-mi.

484
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,959
You can sit here.

485
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,419
Yes, there.

486
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,096
What's with you all of a sudden?

487
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:16,685
Remember what I always tell you?
I'll protect you.

488
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,439
I will really keep that promise.

489
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,150
I protected my country for two years.

490
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,111
Of course I can protect the woman I love.

491
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,868
Fine, good luck with protecting.

492
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,953
Okay.

493
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,170
By the way, who are you protecting? Me?

494
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:45,798
Yes.

495
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,132
From what?

496
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,217
From you?

497
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:50,928
I think so.

498
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,012
Sort of.

499
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:57,226
So are you protecting me from yourself?

500
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,561
Who wins in that fight?

501
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,481
See, it's...

502
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,318
me who loves you

503
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:09,405
versus me who loves you more.

504
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:14,993
If you ask me who wins...

505
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,037
Is that so?

506
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,374
Then whom should I root for?

507
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:30,759
You can do it.

508
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,224
I will count to three.

509
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:43,397
One.

510
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:45,899
Two...

511
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,793
Good morning, Bo-ra.

512
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:46,960
You came early.

513
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:48,754
Hi.

514
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,882
What's up? You look chipper.

515
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,510
I feel happy.

516
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,844
Let me get you some coffee.

517
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,388
Sure.

518
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,807
Jin-ho.

519
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,891
Yes?

520
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:03,352
What was your last name?

521
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,603
I'm Yang Jin-ho.

522
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,813
Yang Jin-ho...

523
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,692
They say the Generation MZ

524
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:15,697
do "SFDA."

525
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,575
"Sleep First Date After."

526
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,411
What's your take on this?

527
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,081
Sleep first date...

528
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,918
How can they sleep first before dating?

529
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,004
Really?

530
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,841
Here's what I think.

531
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,093
Even though things have changed,

532
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:41,431
taking it so lightly is not so desirable.

533
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,976
Love without responsibility
is mere self-indulgence.

534
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,561
Self-indulgence.

535
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,778
Being irresponsible and doing
as one pleases is called self-indulgence.

536
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:52,609
Pursuing only pleasure
and satisfying one's needs is not love.

537
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:56,572
If you love someone, you should protect
and take care of that person...

538
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,615
Young boomer!

539
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,784
Jin-ho, run.

540
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,327
Jin-ho...

541
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,037
I'm not done yet.

542
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,164
To protect my employee, you can't do this.

543
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:09,269
If he quits because of you, what will
you do? It's hard to find a part-timer.

544
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,461
I wouldn't do this if I didn't have to.

545
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,760
He keeps making her stay out late.

546
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,221
Hey, Bo-mi has always been like that.

547
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,765
Don't you think you feel that way

548
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,102
because you're such a homebody these days?

549
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,437
Nonsense.

550
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,982
I watched a movie, drank last night.

551
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,151
I got home late after doing all that.

552
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,194
With whom? With Su-hyeok?

553
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,781
Hold on.

554
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,491
I'm all ears.

555
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,162
Do tell me. I'm getting dizzy.

556
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,289
You saw a movie and drank, and then what?

557
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,460
Nothing...

558
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,838
Here's the material you requested.

559
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,259
As for my project proposal
that I gave you yesterday,

560
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:00,969
I haven't received any feedback.

561
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:03,680
If there's nothing to revise,
may I proceed as is?

562
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:06,183
Oh, this?

563
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,769
I looked through this.

564
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:11,688
You did a lot of preparation. Good.

565
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:13,899
Very good,
if you make a bit of corrections.

566
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,151
I marked the corrections here.

567
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,362
Have it confirmed again
after the corrections.

568
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:19,446
Yes, sir.

569
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,931
Dear my Daddy-Long-Legs.
As you said you'd accept my heart,

570
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,100
this is my heart.
With love, Judy.

571
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,285
Why did he invite you over
in the first place?

572
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,788
What's so inappropriate
about that suggestion?

573
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,873
It's not like you are having an affair.

574
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,250
That Mulder and Scully thing?

575
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,043
Can't they sleep together?

576
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,087
They might have slept together,
at least once.

577
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,715
I don't know. Go ask them yourself.

578
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,343
Well, I don't know about Su-hyeok.

579
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:25,387
- How about you?
- About me?

580
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,515
Did you want to sleep with him?
Would you have if he wanted to?

581
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,229
At that moment,
were you trying to remember

582
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,148
if you were wearing
matching underwear or not?

583
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,653
You did.

584
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:43,572
Then what's the problem?

585
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,407
You said making him fall for you is easy.

586
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,908
You can just seduce him.

587
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,286
I can't.

588
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,205
He knows too much about me already.

589
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,710
Well, it has its own merits.

590
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,131
So it's something like this...

591
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,092
"When I'm with him,
I can be my true self."

592
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,681
Sort of.

593
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,226
What do I do with you?

594
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,937
This is even more dangerous
than wanting to sleep with him.

595
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,236
By the way,
if it works out between you two,

596
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,739
remember I set you up with him.

597
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:30,494
Then I'd get Cha, Cha, Cha?

598
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,163
Unbelievable.

599
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,123
You're so persistent.

600
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,292
Yeon Bo-mi.

601
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,170
Why are you here?

602
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,922
You think this is your store?

603
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,216
I'm here for a part-time job interview.

604
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,425
Part-time job?

605
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:46,802
Hello, sir.

606
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,678
Bom.

607
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:52,057
I came for a part-time job interview.

608
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,435
I often heard that I could land
any part-time gig.

609
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,271
Am I hired?

610
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,608
What would you like? Iced vanilla latte?
Enjoy and have fun.

611
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:02,859
If you hire me,

612
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,947
I'll kick out nuisance customers

613
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,990
and share Yu-jeong's whereabouts,

614
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,826
setting you free, sir.

615
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:14,621
And?

616
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,706
And...

617
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:20,919
I know Yu-jeong's weak spots.

618
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,005
Okay. You're hired.

619
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,258
Jin-woo!

620
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,260
I agree!

621
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,139
First off, one iced vanilla latte, please.

622
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,682
I'll just go with the flow today.

623
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,808
How are sales?

624
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,560
Does it get busy on weekends?

625
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,186
Jin-ho.

626
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,354
Come here, Bo-mi.

627
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,235
This is the secret room.

628
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,822
Looks like Bo-mi is better at dating.

629
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,409
How cute. They make a good couple.

630
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,494
Right.

631
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:56,705
Pyramid scheme and
voice phishing scam victims.

632
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,707
Indeed, they're a match made in heaven.

633
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,508
How's it coming along?

634
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,221
Why are you hiding it?

635
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,059
Can't I check on how far along you are?

636
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:22,898
- Did you come to push me to hurry?
- No, I didn't.

637
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,775
It's my job to support
and encourage your creative activity.

638
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:29,279
When are you going to show me?
Don't you need some feedback?

639
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,156
Not yet.

640
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,491
I'll show you when it's more organized.

641
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,369
Okay.

642
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,250
You see...

643
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,337
I might move soon.

644
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,590
I've been packing,
so my house is a total mess.

645
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:51,843
What's that?

646
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,973
That's why I couldn't invite you that day.

647
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,062
Sure, I understand.

648
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,067
Am I right? A house is a private space.

649
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,362
It's not so easy to invite someone.

650
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,781
Also, I thought it'd be rude of me

651
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,950
if I ask you over without any preparation.

652
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,078
Okay, I do understand that.

653
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,622
Can we not talk about it now?

654
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,751
Okay.

655
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,925
I'll properly invite you
once I'm done with moving.

656
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,594
I could invite many people,
like you did before.

657
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,763
Like my co-workers from the company.

658
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:40,558
Or you could come over alone.

659
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:45,522
But would that be too boring?
There's not much we can do alone.

660
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,357
I get it. You can stop.

661
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,733
I'm not coming.

662
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,736
I'm not dying to be invited.
I won't go, even if I'm invited. Okay?

663
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:55,699
Okay.

664
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,165
I'm sorry, but we have a rule of
one order per person.

665
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,834
Please order first.

666
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:09,462
Oh, my!

667
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:10,547
Hi, Su-hyeok.

668
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:12,924
Do you work here?

669
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,843
I started today.

670
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:16,837
What would you like to drink?

671
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,596
I'll have an iced Americano.

672
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:21,599
You heard him.

673
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:24,728
Please order at the register, ma'am.

674
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:29,149
You've been holding this seat
with two drinks all day long.

675
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,817
It's quite frowned upon.

676
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,530
Okay.

677
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,698
I get it.

678
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,035
I'll go order then.

679
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,207
- Su-hyeok.
- Yes?

680
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,127
- What do you think of my sister?
- What?

681
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,009
- She's nice.
- I know, right?

682
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,635
What a relief.

683
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:01,264
In that case, can you hang out with her
till late, please?

684
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:03,850
She's always either here or at home.

685
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:07,729
She feels lonely and cries every night.
Don't you feel sorry for her?

686
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,482
Okay.

687
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,068
You're such a good sister
to care about her.

688
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,070
I know, right?
I'm such a good sister, right?

689
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,407
Happy now?
I hope you will at least serve it.

690
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:22,952
Hope you have a great time.

691
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,831
Jeez...

692
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,057
What are you going to do on the weekend?

693
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:47,060
You have a wedding to go to.

694
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,063
Your ex's wedding at that.

695
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:55,402
Are you really going?

696
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,742
I haven't decided yet either.

697
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,830
I did get the invitation,
and I told her I'd definitely be there.

698
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:13,753
You want to go with me?

699
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:14,921
What?

700
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,966
You're asking me to go
everywhere with you.

701
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,843
Why would I go there with you?

702
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,429
The thing is...

703
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,764
I guess you two were very close
back in school.

704
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:27,559
It's strange I've never heard about you.

705
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:30,937
Anyways, see you at the wedding.

706
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:34,482
- Sure, I'll be there with my girlfriend.
- Okay.

707
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:39,446
But why are you asking me?

708
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,953
Because it's not entirely wrong.

709
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:50,999
Girlfriend.

710
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:55,128
Female friend.

711
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,968
Right.

712
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,678
Right, we're friends.

713
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,640
Why? I mean,

714
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,726
if you feel uncomfortable to go with me...

715
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,436
No. Sounds good.

716
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,230
I should just act like
I'm your girlfriend.

717
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,774
Brace yourself.

718
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:19,277
I have a knack for method acting.

719
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:34,667
Do you have some
specific plan of action today?

720
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,711
For what?

721
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,964
What do you mean? A plan for revenge.

722
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,592
That's why we're here today.

723
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,594
No, I just...

724
00:46:58,691 --> 00:46:59,734
Congratulations.

725
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,319
- Thank you, Su-hyeok.
- Thanks.

726
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:03,947
Hello, I'm Su-hyeok's girlfriend.

727
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:06,658
Oh, hello.

728
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:12,830
We're in a committed relationship,
with marriage in mind.

729
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,749
We met not that long ago,

730
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,502
but we fell in love, real deep.

731
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,672
We're thinking of next spring.

732
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,006
Right, honey?

733
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,008
That's right.

734
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,260
Congratulations.

735
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,804
But it's not a shotgun wedding.

736
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,931
Was it too much information?

737
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:31,474
So funny.

738
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:33,851
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.

739
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,770
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

740
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,857
Thank you. I'll give you meal coupon now.

741
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,025
Okay.

742
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,278
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

743
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:53,079
Chief Editor, how are you? You're here.

744
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,872
Look who it is. Chief Editor.

745
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:56,708
I know.
We run into each other quite often.

746
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,044
I didn't expect to see you two here.

747
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,131
Here's your meal coupon.

748
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:07,260
Su-hyeok!

749
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:34,871
I really did not expect for the four of us
to see each other again like this either.

750
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,875
Your wedding was also here...

751
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:42,754
Right, Topaz Hall on the second floor.

752
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:46,841
Yes, the food was better there.

753
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,052
<i>- Galbitang,</i> right?
- Right.

754
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,429
I remember that day.

755
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:55,433
You know, terrifying experiences
get ingrained in your mind vividly.

756
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,978
<i>The ceremony will begin shortly.</i>

757
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:02,231
<i>I'd like to invite all the guests
to be seated.</i>

758
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:05,860
The ceremony's about to start.
Let's get inside.

759
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,243
You should go

760
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:15,828
to the bride's waiting room.

761
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,830
If not now,
you won't be able to talk to her.

762
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,049
Then go inside first.

763
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:43,981
BRIDE'S WAITING ROOM

764
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:59,539
- Okay, good.
- You look so pretty.

765
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:02,250
- See you in a bit.
- See you in there.

766
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:19,392
How do I look?

767
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,476
Awkward, right?

768
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,896
You look pretty.

769
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:27,442
Pretty enough to make you regret?

770
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,408
I'm thinking about shouting out,

771
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,244
"I object to this wedding!"
later in the hall?

772
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:41,748
You can make a joke like that?

773
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,841
I feel sorry

774
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,512
and thankful.

775
00:50:58,014 --> 00:51:00,767
But I feel more sorry than thankful.

776
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,019
A little more.

777
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:12,987
I'm thankful and sorry too.

778
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,327
But I'm more thankful than sorry.

779
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:20,912
Way more.

780
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,624
You made me realize

781
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,210
that I should have no regrets.

782
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:32,006
I'll take a picture of you two.

783
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,716
- No.
- No thanks.

784
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:37,678
- Just take nice pictures of her.
- Sure.

785
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,676
Where's Sang-jin?

786
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,826
Here comes the bride.

787
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,051
Kyung-sik called off his wedding.

788
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,302
- He did?
- Yes.

789
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:24,887
- Out of the blue?
- Hey.

790
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:26,639
Are you okay?

791
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:28,474
It's okay, man.

792
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,184
Being divorced isn't a flaw these days.

793
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,353
Why did you get divorced, Sang-jin?

794
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,897
Did you have women problems by any chance?

795
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:36,774
I heard you had a lot of women.

796
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:39,193
What are you talking about?

797
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,653
Was there any other reason?

798
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:42,697
No, I...

799
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,865
Or was it bad chemistry in bed?

800
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:48,619
That's nonsense.

801
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,663
It's nothing like that.

802
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,748
- Tell us.
- Why can't you tell us?

803
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,083
Then when will you remarry?

804
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,459
Do you have someone already?

805
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:58,295
Do we have to give him
a monetary gift again, if he does?

806
00:54:58,379 --> 00:54:59,672
Hey, go for it. Get remarried.

807
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:01,650
You're divorced
as I couldn't go to your wedding.

808
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:06,095
I'll give you a big check
reflecting the inflation. So go ahead.

809
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,430
Do you really have someone?

810
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:09,682
Let me ask her directly.

811
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:12,309
Su-jin.

812
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:14,186
What's there to ask? Cut it out.

813
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,480
What is wrong with you?

814
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:19,066
Why are they so curious about that?
Are you?

815
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,569
It's rude to ask that.

816
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:23,779
Well...

817
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:24,905
But...

818
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:27,033
I am curious, too.

819
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,579
I like your honesty.

820
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:34,915
- Su-jin, why don't we catch up...
- Stop.

821
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,209
I can't stand this. Seriously...

822
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,836
Let's catch up in a while.

823
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,296
- You should just...
- What?

824
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:42,715
- How have you been?
- Hello.

825
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,511
There was no special reason
for our divorce.

826
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:49,680
It was just personality differences.

827
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:53,893
Each person has a different level
of tolerance for their partner.

828
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,729
A couple who holds out
till the 10-year mark

829
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:59,607
to benefit in alimony payments,
longing for the day,

830
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:02,026
or a couple who only texts
under the same roof

831
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,736
and acts like lovebirds

832
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:06,530
only during family events
or social gatherings.

833
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:07,948
Or a couple who had no guts

834
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,493
to divorce and chose to
be a long-distance, weekend couple.

835
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,328
We could have lived like those couples.

836
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:15,456
But we just made the choice
that was available for us.

837
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:19,043
I do not think it's fair to ridicule us
or make a mockery of us for that

838
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:20,920
for a very long time.

839
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:24,215
I hope you will never divorce

840
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,509
and stay married
till death do you part. Okay?

841
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,555
Aren't you getting up?

842
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:33,891
You feel like eating that roll?

843
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,686
Let's go.
I know a great steak place nearby.

844
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,940
- I'm off.
- Bye.

845
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:42,024
Hurry up.

846
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,194
Oh, our go-to for our anniversary...

847
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:48,280
Not sure if I can make a reservation.

848
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:51,742
- Bye.
- Take care.

849
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,078
Personality differences.

850
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:56,539
She's overbearing.

851
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,917
We're all dressed up,
shouldn't we make the best of it?

852
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,627
The first floor is a great photo spot.

853
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,711
Bo-ra!

854
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:05,214
Are you still here?

855
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,383
We waited to talk with you.

856
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:10,386
Tell me, haven't you made a decision yet?

857
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,724
I thought about this a lot.

858
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,108
Since it was the first show
with your name,

859
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,861
I thought you were really
attached to our program.

860
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,028
I guess I was mistaken.

861
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:31,198
I'm getting a little upset.

862
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:34,160
You know that's not what it's about.

863
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:39,331
I'm so attached to it

864
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:42,877
that it's harder to make a decision.

865
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:46,255
- Is that what it is?
- Yes.

866
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,549
Then think about it.

867
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:51,844
I'm really grateful.

868
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,679
We can't wait for long.

869
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:58,142
- Call me.
- Bye.

870
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,817
- Let's go to the first floor.
- Let's go.

871
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,542
Give it to me.
Let me take pictures of you.

872
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,545
Make me look good.

873
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:28,964
Here.

874
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:37,848
Are you taking it?

875
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:39,266
No...

876
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:41,894
Not when I'm looking at the camera.

877
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:44,271
- Take a natural shot. Naturally.
- Okay. So...

878
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,191
Look toward the other side.

879
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,196
No, you're just looking at the other side.

880
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,405
Look toward it.

881
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:55,824
- I am looking at the other side.
- Okay, okay.

882
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:59,370
This way. Turn your whole body.

883
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,956
No, left is my good side.

884
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,333
So take pictures of my left side.

885
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,127
Stand over here.

886
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,674
Yes, right there.

887
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,054
Your right side looks good. Just trust me.

888
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,723
Trust me just once.

889
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:22,142
- Your right side looks nice.
- I'll delete them all.

890
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:27,481
See? This is more natural.

891
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,857
- Is it?
- Yes.

892
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:38,075
You're not the type
who likes flowers, are you?

893
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,285
I thought you weren't.

894
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:42,955
You are so clueless.

895
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,873
All women like flowers.

896
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:51,297
So,

897
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,883
how did you feel seeing
your ex-girlfriend's wedding?

898
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,678
Were you happy to at least see her?

899
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:00,514
What, am I filming a movie?

900
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,808
I know that's why you went.

901
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,810
That's not it.

902
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:07,521
When I met Yu-ri's fiancé that day,

903
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,440
I made up a story that
I was friends with her

904
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,942
from school and I was meeting her
to get an invitation.

905
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:15,279
Had I not gone to their wedding today,

906
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,115
he would have felt
something was fishy for a long time.

907
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,534
Men are always like that.

908
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:24,079
Men act cool on the outside,

909
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,123
but inside, we're petty and pathetic.

910
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:33,047
So you went there
for the happiness of your ex?

911
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,969
But you know what?

912
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:43,932
Yu-ri probably doesn't know
how hard you tried

913
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:47,519
and how thoughtful you were.

914
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:49,938
She'll never know all her life.

915
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:52,024
Women are like that.

916
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:54,526
We never in a million years know
if we don't hear it.

917
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,322
Where should we go now?

918
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,910
I don't want to go home early today.

919
01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:18,384
I wasn't actually asking you to dinner.

920
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:20,719
I don't want to eat alone.

921
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,723
I was cursed by someone

922
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:28,018
to eat alone for the rest of my life
and to die out of loneliness.

923
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:32,898
That's why I feel uncomfortable
when I see you.

924
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,068
You regret that you married me?

925
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:43,158
I was a beat-up car, right?

926
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,369
No?

927
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,414
I know, when women talk about their ex,
they call him a beat-up car.

928
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,249
Indeed, I was a beat-up car.

929
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:51,417
The crappiest beat-up car.

930
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,751
I'm eating here.

931
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,255
Good thing you got out of that car.

932
01:01:56,713 --> 01:02:02,428
I just realized that I'm such an awful,
worthless human being these days.

933
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:05,013
I think I'm getting even worse.

934
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:07,599
Not getting any better.

935
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,268
So?

936
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:10,811
You want some comfort?

937
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:13,272
- From me?
- No.

938
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,942
I want you to give me an earful,
"Didn't you know you were awful?"

939
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,445
No.

940
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,530
If I did,
I'd feel even more uncomfortable.

941
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:26,660
Back then,

942
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:28,745
I had some problems.

943
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:31,457
Can't you see I'm holding a knife?

944
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,376
I feel uncomfortable, too. That's why.

945
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,961
Hear me out just once.

946
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:48,599
When I was starting
the publishing company,

947
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,394
everyone around me said
it wouldn't work out.

948
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:56,023
But it was easy-breezy for me.
Everything was going well.

949
01:02:56,899 --> 01:03:00,194
So I wanted to make it big,
and I aimed too high.

950
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:04,907
With a series of distribution companies
going bankrupt,

951
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,076
mid-sized publishing companies like us
went bankrupt one after another.

952
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:13,040
I was in over my head.

953
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:16,001
After my father passed away,

954
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:20,255
I soon lost all the money from my mom
who was sick of running a business.

955
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:23,634
I had loans from everywhere,
and even borrowed money from my friends.

956
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:26,470
I couldn't put an end to it,
even though I wanted to.

957
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,765
I ran around everywhere to figure out
a way out in any way I could.

958
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:36,313
I wasn't in my right mind to
muddle through it. I don't remember it.

959
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:38,899
And eventually,

960
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:43,737
I had to tell you
that we'd have to vacate our first house.

961
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,783
But I couldn't possibly tell you that.

962
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:56,583
That was what happened.

963
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:00,587
That was why.

964
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,428
Why didn't you tell me?

965
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:10,597
Because you were ashamed?

966
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:13,267
Maybe I was.

967
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:18,981
I guess...

968
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,111
I wasn't someone you could rely on.

969
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:36,498
You must have felt very lonely.

970
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,626
Back then...

971
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,924
I thought letting our marriage end
was the least I could do for you.

972
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,135
But now I realized

973
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:52,014
that I just didn't have guts
and I was a coward.

974
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:58,812
I'm so sorry.

975
01:05:06,028 --> 01:05:07,029
Okay.

976
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,033
That does it for me now.

977
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:14,202
It's good enough for me.

978
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:25,631
I don't regret that I married you.

979
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:29,384
Thanks to you,
I realized I want to stay single.

980
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,932
I thought you were a crappy car,
but that might not be the case.

981
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,353
Maybe I was a crappy car.

982
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,064
I'm sorry

983
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,817
that I blamed you for everything.

984
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,945
Still, throughout all that,

985
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:52,449
you said, "It's all my fault.
You were good for me."

986
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:57,663
And you put up with all my family's
resentment. Thank you for all that.

987
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,001
Now, let me lift my curse.

988
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:05,462
Now go out and meet someone.

989
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,840
Although we were crappy cars
for each other,

990
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:12,386
we might not be so for someone else.

991
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,994
Am I a dachshund or what?

992
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,708
What's with this proportion?
There is no good shot at all.

993
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:43,959
I said left is my good side.

994
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:46,628
Why did you have to snap
the right side the whole time?

995
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:50,465
By the way,

996
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:53,385
did you decide not to do the radio show?

997
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:56,972
You're changing the subject.

998
01:07:00,392 --> 01:07:01,393
Well,

999
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:03,729
it's hard

1000
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:05,188
and I did that for a long time.

1001
01:07:06,732 --> 01:07:08,442
And I don't want to be hated.

1002
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,694
- Why?
- Nothing.

1003
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,822
You seemed to put in a lot of thought.

1004
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,324
So I thought you wanted to do it.
Am I wrong?

1005
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:18,785
I want to,

1006
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,288
but I can't.

1007
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,416
I'm sure I was a huge letdown.

1008
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,626
What they expected was Deborah, but...

1009
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:27,794
But...

1010
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,423
they got just Bo-ra instead.

1011
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:34,134
I don't have the courage.

1012
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:41,433
You know what your problem is?

1013
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:47,773
You don't see yourself objectively.

1014
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:51,151
The right side of your face is so pretty.

1015
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,570
But you believe
only the left side is pretty.

1016
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:55,781
I'm not buying that.

1017
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:01,077
You don't even give a chance.

1018
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,706
You haven't really revealed
what kind of person Bo-ra really is.

1019
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,292
They might like Bo-ra better than Deborah.

1020
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,544
I'm not falling for that.

1021
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:12,130
I mean it.

1022
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:16,134
From when did you start
doubting what I say?

1023
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:19,471
Probably since your method acting?

1024
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,516
That story you told
about love at first sight,

1025
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,185
you made all that up so naturally.

1026
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:29,314
Anyways, I like Bo-ra better than Deborah,

1027
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,734
and the right side of your face
than the left.

1028
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:36,196
See?

1029
01:08:36,947 --> 01:08:38,448
How pretty.

1030
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:44,037
Why do you keep doing this?

1031
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,247
Doing what?

1032
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,332
Why do you keep...

1033
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:51,002
doing that?

1034
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:56,132
Why do you keep seducing me?

1035
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:03,306
Would you be seduced if I do?

1036
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,814
How would I know?

1037
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,610
Right.

1038
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:21,867
Shall we

1039
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:24,828
go for a walk?

1040
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:28,540
- Sure.
- Okay.

1041
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,381
No way.

1042
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:39,676
You're so little.

1043
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:42,387
Now I'm not, right?

1044
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,848
Are those invisible high heels?

1045
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:47,934
I like this height better.

1046
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,603
Because it's better for you?

1047
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,438
Let's go this way.

1048
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,023
Okay.

1049
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:57,110
Now I'm not little, right?
I'm taller than you.

1050
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,904
You're still little.

1051
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:01,114
You're a little kiddo.

WEDDINGS

1054
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:33,104
<i>As for the first time I met her,</i>

1055
01:10:33,188 --> 01:10:36,691
<i>we ran into each other at a wedding
of our mutual friend a few years back.</i>

1056
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,346
<i>I still vividly remember it.</i>

1057
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:11,184
<i>Bo-ra was in a black dress
and turned toward me.</i>

1058
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:17,399
<i>That moment, it felt like time
passed slowly. It was in slow motion.</i>

1059
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,625
<i>Then when our eyes met,</i>

1060
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,545
<i>she took my breath away.</i>

TRUE TO LOVE

1062
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,910
<i>I want to start over.</i>

1063
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,162
<i>Don't worry. You'll do great.</i>

1064
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,621
<i>This story is from 6958.</i>

1065
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:15,373
Hello, listener 6958.

1066
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:16,958
<i>Hello, Deborah.</i>

1067
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:18,918
<i>Bo-ra, let's start over.</i>

1068
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:21,755
<i>I want you to give me a chance
to get to know you better.</i>

1069
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,423
<i>Did you talk with him?</i>

1070
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:25,050
<i>I talked with him all right.</i>

1071
01:12:25,133 --> 01:12:27,886
- You're dating him, right?
- Me and Sang-jin?

1072
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:29,971
U-ri, you must've watched too many dramas.

1073
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:31,389
<i>Or is it more like</i> Cinderella?

1074
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:34,559
It was just me. I had a crush on Sang-jin.

1075
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:37,812
<i>So you've been
letting Jin-ho stay downstairs all along?</i>

1076
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:39,439
Why couldn't you tell me?

1077
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:41,232
'Cause you have a girl hiding in here?

1078
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:44,986
<i>I heard from Bo-ra
that you became close through work.</i>

1079
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:47,351
<i>I thought you were dating.
It was just a wrong impression.</i>

1080
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:48,823
Do you have feelings for Bo-ra?

1081
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:50,747
<i>Does an ex-boyfriend
have the right to do this?</i>

1082
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:53,161
<i>I congratulate you on starting over.</i>

1083
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:54,913
<i>Your radio show and relationship.</i>
