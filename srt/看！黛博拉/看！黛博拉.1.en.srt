ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND

EP 01
SOMETHING SMALL AND SPARKLY

6
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,987
Dating is no longer a necessity
in this day and age.

7
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,283
<i>Difficulty of getting a job,</i>
<i>soaring house prices,</i>

8
00:01:57,243 --> 00:02:02,081
<i>harsh reality and uncertain future</i>
<i>are causing anxiety these days.</i>

9
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,165
Hold on, please!

10
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,387
<i>So many people think dating</i>
<i>is no longer a good idea.</i>

11
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,807
<i>It has become the first thing</i>
<i>we put off or give up.</i>

12
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:26,188
<i>I'm sorry, but please</i>
<i>breathe out through your mouth.</i>

13
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:35,030
<i>Among five million unmarried adults,</i>
<i>those who are in a relationship</i>

14
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,616
<i>account for less than 30%.</i>

15
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:42,371
<i>People in their twenties have sex</i>
<i>as less often as those in their sixties.</i>

16
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,666
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?

17
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,710
Lats and biceps.

18
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:55,843
<i>Instead, we indulge ourselves</i>
<i>in romances on TV</i>

19
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,637
<i>or live vicariously through TV dramas.</i>

20
00:02:58,721 --> 00:02:59,638
<i>That's natural.</i>

21
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,307
<i>For today's generation...</i>

22
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,642
<i>Insane. Please start dating.</i>

23
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,604
<i>...dating requires</i>
<i>money, time, emotions, and energy,</i>

24
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,106
<i>with a big chance of failure.</i>

25
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,482
Poongsil.

26
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,445
I love you.

27
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,655
<i>I love you too.</i>

28
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,452
{\an8}It's nothing but a luxury
that one can hardly afford.

29
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,414
{\an8}It's definitely not cost-effective

30
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,542
{\an8}considering the risk of getting hurt.

31
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,504
{\an8}We come to think,
"Dating? Not necessarily needed."

32
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,925
{\an8}"Still, maybe? Well, I wouldn't bother."

33
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,094
{\an8}"I got no time for this.
I should just focus on work."

34
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,971
{\an8}Like that, we just give up.

35
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:45,726
{\an8}Give up on dating and choose work,
based on cost-effectiveness...

36
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,271
Sounds about right.
'Cause you can't have both.

37
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,439
How about you?

38
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,733
Work or love, what would you choose?

39
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:57,321
Me? Well, work or love.

40
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,075
Between work and love, my choice would be

41
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,118
both?

42
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,538
I won't miss out on anything.

43
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,877
Why give up when you can have it all?

44
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:15,589
You need to get what you want.
And I already did.

45
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,884
This side, please.

46
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,803
No, no, this side. No.

47
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,180
No, to this side.

48
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,891
Sir.

49
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:28,227
I'm sure I told you before.

50
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,646
You should take it from my left side.

51
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,481
But we need various angles...

52
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,108
Nope.

53
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,110
Left is my good side.

54
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,319
I know better.

55
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,782
And why are you taking pictures
while I'm talking?

56
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,410
For more natural shots...

57
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:48,038
We can stage it
like a natural conversation.

58
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,873
You should know better.

59
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,584
Please do me a favor.

60
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,128
Noted.

61
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,257
Are you ready?

62
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,466
- Yes.
- Okay.

63
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,634
Work and love.

64
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,137
As someone who has both,

65
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,305
I can say with confidence

66
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:10,644
that fail-proof strategies
for romantic relationships do exist,

67
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:14,356
and you don't need to sacrifice anything.

68
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,860
I'm really curious about those strategies.

69
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,820
You're curious, right?

70
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,241
It's all in this book.

71
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,710
<i>What, Deborah? That sounds familiar.</i>

72
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,128
Yes, Deborah.

73
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,463
Look her up.

74
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,887
She started sharing
her love life on her blog,

75
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,639
and began writing dating advice
for <i>La Bella.</i>

76
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,350
She also appears on TV
as a dating columnist.

77
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,436
The radio show...

78
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,481
I know. What do they call her? Dating...

79
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,067
A renowned dating coach and influencer.

80
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,278
WHAT YOU GOT WRONG ABOUT YOUR LOVE LIFE

81
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,863
That's some title...

82
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,283
And most importantly for us,

83
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,995
she's a best-selling author
with three top sellers in a row.

84
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,041
Her publishing contract expired recently.

85
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,128
I heard she's looking for
another publisher.

86
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,464
Do you see where I'm going with this?

87
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,676
She's perfect for this spot.

88
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,719
I'm not feeling it.

89
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,141
Not into it.

90
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,311
I wasn't even done.
How could you already say no?

91
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,648
I was just being thoughtful
so you don't waste your time.

92
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,985
Dating columnist, TV figure, author,
influencer and what? A dating coach?

93
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,780
{\an8}Her identity is ambiguous.

94
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,075
{\an8}Can we expect sincerity as an author
from a person like this?

95
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,746
{\an8}"Gone are the days
when one job for life existed."

96
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,456
"It's the era of multiple jobs."

97
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,208
What a good book, right?

98
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,211
Who's the editor? It's...

99
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,212
Lee Su-hyeok.

100
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,552
And her identity?

101
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,680
She's a dating coach.

102
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,973
She's an expert, a pro.

103
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,516
Dating coach, so what?

104
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,935
Does she have foolproof seduction skills?

105
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,687
That's pickup artists...

106
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,898
Is she so stunningly charming
that anyone instantly falls for her?

107
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,360
I haven't checked
if she's that attractive yet.

108
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,320
But she gives dating advice.

109
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,031
On others' romances?
It's nobody's business.

110
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,159
She should mind her own love life.

111
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,911
People like her poke their noses
into others' business

112
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,289
when they can't even cover their own rear.

113
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,836
Lastly, we got many questions
about your love life.

114
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,340
You mentioned in your column that
you're in a relationship with a man.

115
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:50,470
Can you tell us about this man
who won your heart?

116
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:55,559
He's always caring and understanding.

117
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,352
He's a consistent person.

118
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,854
And...

119
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,147
And...

120
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,609
He's an ordinary guy who loves his job.

121
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:09,114
Then can we look forward to
hearing good news from you this year?

122
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,201
Well...

123
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:16,788
Marriage is not the goal
of a romantic relationship.

124
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:20,500
Am I in a relationship
where I'll have no regrets later?

125
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,252
I think that's what matters.

126
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,048
Then what's your secret
to a relationship without regrets?

127
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:32,054
I think it's unwavering support and trust

128
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,388
between each other.

129
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,389
Trust.

130
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,814
Support and trust.

131
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,193
<i>Yeah, sure you do.</i>

132
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,987
<i>What an extraordinary</i>
<i>celebrity we have here.</i>

133
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,156
<i>All she cares about is her photos.</i>

134
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,000
DATING COACH DEBORAH'S LOVE LIFE

135
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,460
KEYS TO MY HAPPY LOVE LIFE

136
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,380
Here.

137
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,883
She has a very happy love life.

138
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,051
Is that enough?

139
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,262
Is dating a great achievement to her?

140
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:17,057
Imagine the fuss if she gets married.
That'd be like getting a doctor's degree.

141
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,978
What about divorce?

142
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,562
What's divorce then?

143
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,733
Degree revocation? Fake work experience?
Work experience gone bad?

144
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,653
It doesn't make sense.

145
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,115
You call marriage a success
and divorce a failure these days?

146
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,450
No. Don't you agree?

147
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,664
Oh, your divorce...

148
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,582
- Sorry.
- Hey.

149
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,419
Why bring up divorce here?

150
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,463
You just got on the wrong side
of all divorced people.

151
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,757
There are actually a lot around us.

152
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:51,842
Not to be crude,

153
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,012
but you're very likely
to join the club, you brat.

154
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,307
You're not even married.
Who are you to talk?

155
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,274
AUTHOR DEBORAH

156
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,708
What?

157
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,961
These two are the same person?

158
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,508
Who is she really?

159
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,136
They screwed me over, right?

160
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,471
Look at this.

161
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,391
They took pictures for an hour
and picked this of all photos.

162
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,643
You should've said something interesting.

163
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,773
Did you read your responses? I get
why they chose a bad photo of you.

164
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,484
I did fine.

165
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,235
Everyone responds like this.

166
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,864
Seriously. Shall we do some fact-checking?

167
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,368
"Marriage is not the goal
of a romantic relationship."

168
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,245
He said he'll marry you this year.
Why be so mysterious?

169
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,082
Hey.

170
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,291
Getting married?

171
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,711
If I told them about that,
what would they ask me naturally?

172
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,838
Well...

173
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,967
How did he propose?

174
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:20,597
{\an8}A MONTH AGO

175
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,599
{\an8}- Congrats, Young-jun.
- Congratulations.

176
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,142
Thanks. You'll come, right?

177
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,727
Of course.

178
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,271
You guys should get married.
When will you?

179
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,023
Us?

180
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,030
Within this year.

181
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,832
Hey, so you'll live in the same place?

182
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,166
We moved to Daechi-dong.

183
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,836
- You've succeeded.
- For your future kids?

184
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,046
You got it planned out.

185
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,299
<i>That can't count as a marriage proposal.</i>

186
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:01,513
It's extremely minimalistic and unique,
but it's not that bad.

187
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,014
Hey.

188
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,102
If it's for Deborah, not bad isn't enough.

189
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:11,398
Wouldn't it have to have
something a little more special?

190
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,859
It is a letdown
for a renowned dating coach.

191
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,488
By the way, if you like things special,

192
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,740
why did you say Ju-wan is an ordinary guy?

193
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,326
If Ju-wan is an ordinary man...

194
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,662
Seriously, are you being modest or what?

195
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,750
It's embarrassing to say it myself.

196
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,586
Someone else could say it.

197
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,966
"Deborah, soon to tie the knot,
groom-to-be turns out to be..."

198
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,593
- Something like this?
- Sure.

199
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,344
That's not too shabby.

200
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,555
And that's when I come in, right?

201
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,432
According to her close friend,

202
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:49,644
"The groom-to-be, known as
just an ordinary guy, is actually..."

203
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,940
There's nothing I can do
if my close friend insists on saying that.

204
00:12:54,608 --> 00:13:00,071
Anyway, until I get a proper proposal,
I will never get married.

205
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,781
Sure thing.

206
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,410
But really, nothing more
happened since then?

207
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,788
If you were to wed this year,
he should've said something by now.

208
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,249
Well...

209
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,376
He'll probably say something tomorrow.

210
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,629
Tomorrow is our third anniversary.

211
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,340
I think he will.

212
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,176
JU-WAN

213
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,930
It's him.

214
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,097
Pick it up.

215
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,774
- Hey, finished work?
<i>- Not yet.</i>

216
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:39,528
I'm going to have some coffee
then get back to the meeting.

217
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,530
You must be so tired.

218
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,074
Bo-ra.

219
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,785
<i>About our plan tomorrow.</i>

220
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,036
Ju-wan.

221
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,830
If you're busy tomorrow,
we can meet on the weekend.

222
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,166
We don't have to meet tomorrow.

223
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,962
<i>That's nonsense.</i>
<i>Tomorrow is such a special day for us.</i>

224
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,215
No matter how busy I am, I should see you.

225
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,133
There's something I need to tell you.

226
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,388
<i>I called to tell you</i>
<i>to be on time tomorrow.</i>

227
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,224
The reservation was hard to get.
Look forward to it.

228
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,561
Okay, see you tomorrow.

229
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,979
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

230
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,524
What did he say?

231
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:21,236
There's something
he wants to tell me on our special day.

232
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,242
He's definitely going to do it!

233
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,327
You remember your promise to me?

234
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,121
I set you up with him.

235
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,831
You said if you get married...

236
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,917
Okay. Let's go get you that designer bag!

237
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,338
Hey, I want a bag from Cha...

238
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,553
<i>Every love story has an ending.</i>

239
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,514
<i>For a happy ending in our love story,</i>
<i>what do we need?</i>

240
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,809
<i>Popping the question.</i>

241
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,597
Bo-ra, are you up?

242
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,358
Take this off and sleep.

243
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:58,458
<i>Now, Chicken Prince,</i>
<i>please uncover your mask</i>

244
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,835
<i>and reveal your identity.</i>

245
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,673
<i>Deborah's groom-to-be.</i>

246
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:05,965
<i>It's none other than...</i>

247
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,468
<i>None other than...</i>

248
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,179
<i>None other than!</i>

249
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,098
<i>A twist nobody saw coming.</i>

250
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:17,560
<i>The heir of Mom's Chicken,</i>
<i>Korea's famous chicken franchise.</i>

251
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,146
<i>Noh Ju-wan.</i>

252
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,992
In the phase of the 4th
industrial revolution, Jinlee Publishing

253
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,746
will create an environment
to nurture better communication.

254
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:41,793
We'll call each other by our first names
and not by our titles or positions.

255
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,295
By doing this,

256
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,841
we can have free-flowing communication.

257
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,012
How did Guus Hiddink
work his magic in the 2002 World Cup?

258
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,932
He changed the way
the players addressed each other.

259
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,392
No hierarchies on the field.

260
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,520
Myung-bo, pass. Jung-hwan, this way.

261
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,855
- Pass.
- Sang-jin.

262
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,191
Enough with the meetings.
When can we ever work?

263
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,069
- That's right.
- That's right.

264
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,320
Let us focus on our work.

265
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,204
Damn it. Why did you do that?

266
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,873
Sang-jin, watch your language.

267
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:26,463
This name change you're going for,
I don't like it. It sounds satirical.

268
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,131
That's because of your tone.

269
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,718
So did you think it over? Deborah.

270
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,803
I thought I was clear. I'm not feeling it.

271
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,682
Our communication isn't free-flowing.

272
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,352
You should at least give it a thought.

273
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,859
It's confidential information
from her close friend.

274
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,069
Don't.

275
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,406
She'll get married soon.

276
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,200
You know whom she'll marry?

277
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,953
The son of the owner of Mom's Chicken.

278
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,622
So what?

279
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,999
Now she's Dr. Dating, not dating coach?

280
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,960
What's the point of that?

281
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,462
The point?

282
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,715
It's the completion of a story
of the character Deborah.

283
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,093
"Dating coach Deborah strategically

284
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,637
wins the man she wants

285
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,973
and achieves success
in both work and love."

286
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,769
It's like a modern-day fairy tale.

287
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,354
This story will sell well.

288
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,563
So you're saying,

289
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,691
"And Deborah married the prince
of Chicken Land

290
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,860
and they lived happily ever after."

291
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,363
Is this what you want me to publish?

292
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,365
Yes, that's a perfect ending.

293
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,200
Let me be clear about one thing.

294
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,370
As a publisher,
if I'm not convinced, I can't go with it.

295
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,039
If I'm unconvinced,
how can I convince the readers?

296
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,458
What's so unconvincing to you?

297
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,418
Convince me first, then.

298
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,296
Okay.

299
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,423
Romantic relationships need strategies?

300
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,635
Hide yourself and deceive the person
by acting and lying?

301
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,389
Being true to your feelings

302
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,267
and sincerity is
what a relationship needs.

303
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,895
At least that's what I believe.

304
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,272
You're done, right?

305
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,530
Well...

306
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,534
I was just true to my feelings.

307
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,911
No calculating or playing games.

308
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,746
I always poured my heart out.

309
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,207
But what has come out of it?

310
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,751
He once fell for me
and was crazy about me,

311
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,170
but then he wanted time apart to think.

312
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,131
He's been ignoring my calls.

313
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,515
Why do I always end up
in relationships like this?

314
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,393
Why?

315
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,648
Hold on, put that down.

316
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,276
Sorry, I got a bit worked up.

317
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,527
Yeah.

318
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,198
Am I the type men get easily tired of?

319
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,328
Am I too old? I got fat, right?

320
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,204
Not at all.

321
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,081
You're amazing as you are.

322
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:12,086
But there were some
problems with your methods.

323
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,256
What I mean is...

324
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:22,263
Let's say romantic relationships
were like job interviews...

325
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,848
APPLICANT ID
NAME: LEE YONG-BUM

326
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,269
Please introduce yourself.

327
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,104
Hello.

328
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:33,107
I'm Lee Yong-bum,
I'm enthusiastic in every matter.

329
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,026
When it comes to dating...

330
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:39,030
<i>He applied, because he really</i>
<i>liked her, aka "the company."</i>

331
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,158
Being this enthusiastic in a relationship
is my true...

332
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,661
<i>He really wants to be accepted</i>
<i>by the company.</i>

333
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,913
<i>So he must have certain hopes and dreams.</i>

334
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:47,997
Be my girlfriend.

335
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,960
<i>But...</i>

336
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:55,630
Babe, why are you in love with me?

337
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,091
Because I'm pretty?

338
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,594
Yes, of course.

339
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,846
<i>But the interviewer is prying.</i>

340
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,306
What's with the look?

341
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:06,849
Who is she?

342
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,184
Just an acquaintance.

343
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,229
You leave likes and comments
for just an acquaintance?

344
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,271
Give me your phone.

345
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:16,025
<i>Asking why he applied,</i>
<i>where else he had applied,</i>

346
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,444
<i>how he liked his previous job,</i>
<i>how he quit,</i>

347
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,738
<i>if he has feelings</i>
<i>for the previous company.</i>

348
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,448
It is your ex-girlfriend.

349
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,075
Why did you break up?

350
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,911
I bet you miss her
and still have lingering feelings.

351
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,746
<i>Not only that.</i>

352
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,665
<i>They gets suspicious of his résumé,</i>

353
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,127
<i>yammers on how previous applicants</i>
<i>lied and tricked them.</i>

354
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,380
<i>Then they talk about how it's hard</i>
<i>to trust anyone,</i>

355
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,257
<i>so they ask for assurance.</i>

356
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,383
Babe.

357
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:41,968
Yeah?

358
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,345
Do you love me?

359
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,180
Of course.

360
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:49,642
Then how come
you haven't asked me to marry you?

361
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,644
<i>And they say they're tired of hiring,</i>

362
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,314
<i>and wants a person who'll</i>
<i>work with them forever, like family.</i>

363
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,028
<i>Now he's no longer happy about</i>

364
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,904
<i>getting accepted to the company.</i>

365
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,741
<i>Now he wants to quit.</i>

366
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,328
What's worse,

367
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,999
he gets calls from work
asking when he'll come to work.

368
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,043
Even from a different number or DM.

369
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:18,838
The company pays a visit
and asks for a valid reason.

370
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,132
Stop.

371
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,053
I'm the worst, right?

372
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,345
That's why

373
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,433
you shouldn't lay all your cards
on the table.

374
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,476
Think about it.

375
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:36,439
Was the man's well-crafted résumé
100% truthful?

376
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,858
You should protect yourself.

377
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:43,237
You need to be strategic
in a romantic relationship.

378
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,615
So how do I do that?

379
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:50,745
Think about what he expected from you.

380
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:56,751
Is it your insecurity, desperation,
anxiety, or pathetic love stories?

381
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,129
Or a sexy, witty, talented, cute,

382
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:03,007
attractive and confident woman
like yourself?

383
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:07,178
Live up to the expectations
but be unexpected.

384
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:13,142
Coach, then
what do I have to do from now on?

385
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:19,774
From here on out,
don't call him, if he doesn't pick it up.

386
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,235
Don't call with another phone
or his workplace.

387
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:28,157
Instead, pick up the phone delightfully.

388
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,409
Pick up the phone delightfully.

389
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,411
Kind of like this.

390
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:36,624
Oh, I forgot about you and my phone.

391
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,960
I was so busy enjoying my fun life

392
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,503
that I forgot to call you.

393
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,047
What's up, baby?

394
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,257
You know?

395
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:47,468
Yes.

396
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:48,928
Keep in mind.

397
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,431
Don't get ahead of yourself.
You're in control of the relationship.

398
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:53,808
I'm in control.

399
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,602
There are plenty of applicants.

400
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:57,979
There are plenty.

401
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:03,526
Now, get it together and back to work.

402
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,654
Look forward to it.

403
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,865
I'll make you the prettiest woman.

404
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,409
Really? Go ahead.

405
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,619
Close your eyes.

406
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:34,015
<i>Don't get ahead of yourself.</i>
<i>I'm in control of this relationship.</i>

407
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,936
You're here.

408
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,939
I should have picked you up.

409
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,065
Was there traffic?

410
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,275
It was okay.

411
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:54,702
What is it?

412
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:59,165
It's just that
you look so beautiful today.

413
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,834
I do?

414
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,669
I came out in a rush.

415
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,176
Here's the wine you ordered.

416
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,385
Pour some, please.

417
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,890
I know you don't like drinking,

418
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:20,686
but today is a special day
and we have a reason to celebrate.

419
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,081
Now that I'm about to tell you,

420
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,792
I feel so nervous.

421
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,377
<i>Don't be nervous, you fool.</i>

422
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:51,384
I'm afraid you'll hear my heartbeat,
so I can't go near you.

423
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,802
<i>Okay. Say it.</i>

424
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,995
I can't believe I get to say this to you.

425
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,414
<i>You want to marry me, right?</i>

426
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,042
- It moved.
- It moved.

427
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:26,919
It moved.

428
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:30,881
Oh, my.

429
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:34,719
Today's a special day.
I really wanted to tell you this.

430
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,388
At last...

431
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,725
<i>I'm ready.</i>

432
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:41,851
- Honey.
- Here?

433
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:42,935
Come here, kiddos.

434
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:48,941
Bo-ra.

435
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,151
<i>Yes.</i>

436
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:51,569
Hang on to your hat.

437
00:26:58,409 --> 00:26:59,368
Finally...

438
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,245
<i>Finally?</i>

439
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:03,414
We did it.

440
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,132
What?

441
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:18,929
Mom's Chicken succeeded
in acquiring Pizza University.

442
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,022
Congratulations.

443
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,109
Now if you order...

444
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:35,696
Vroom, vroom. Ding-dong.

445
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,992
Mom's Chicken and pizza
will be delivered together.

446
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,456
From half fried, half spicy
to half chicken and half pizza.

447
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:49,668
It's a paradigm shift
and brings a sensation to K-food culture.

448
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,966
It's amazing.

449
00:27:58,594 --> 00:27:59,428
So...

450
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,556
That's what you wanted to tell me.

451
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,101
Right.

452
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,644
Wanted to tell you yesterday.

453
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:10,064
I resisted, so I could tell you in person
on our special day.

454
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:15,903
Oh, my.

455
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:22,284
My father built Mom's Chicken
from the ground up

456
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,537
with ten chicks he got
from my mom's family.

457
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,915
Under the pressure
that I should become like my father,

458
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,042
I had to keep proving myself.

459
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,293
You know what I mean?

460
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,842
Finally, boom! I proved it.

461
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,803
In the saturated chicken market,

462
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,931
when everyone said
further growth is impossible,

463
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,850
do you know what crossed my mind?

464
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,234
That's right. Elon Musk said that.

465
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,737
Through the Internet,
electric cars, hyperloop,

466
00:28:58,821 --> 00:28:59,989
space travels

467
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,158
and terraforming Mars, Elon Musk continues

468
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,951
his innovations to save the world.

469
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,413
Now Mom's Chicken sets out to innovate.

470
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,373
Everything will change except the name.

471
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:13,419
We'll switch to
100% eco-friendly packaging.

472
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,587
Why is this important?

473
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,798
<i>'Cause it's for a sustainable future</i>
<i>and low-carbon.</i>

474
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:19,008
It saves the planet.

475
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:22,887
<i>For two hours,</i>
<i>while a nine course meal was served,</i>

476
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,433
<i>he never said what I was hoping to hear.</i>

477
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:31,687
<i>Then I finally realized</i>
<i>that he wasn't going to propose.</i>

478
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,773
<i>It was Mom's Chicken's vision statement.</i>

479
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,360
<i>I had to admit.</i>

480
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:43,949
<i>This man I love</i>
<i>is so remarkably busy saving the planet</i>

481
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:46,911
<i>that he doesn't intend to</i>
<i>pop the question at all.</i>

482
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,329
...will change everything.

483
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:52,791
Mom's Chicken
has conquered the era we live in.

484
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,255
I know this calls for celebration,

485
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,382
but you're going over your limit.

486
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,052
Oh, am I?

487
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,139
Hang on.

488
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,141
Hello?

489
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:11,352
Yes.

490
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:16,524
Okay, I see.

491
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,654
I feel terrible.

492
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,115
I'm afraid I need to
go back to the office now.

493
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,909
Okay. Let's go.

494
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,202
I'm so sorry.

495
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,454
It's for work. No worries.

496
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:32,623
Should I not go?

497
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,084
If you tell me not to go, I won't.

498
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:43,008
So that I'd become a clingy girl
when her boyfriend needs to work?

499
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,052
That's a total turn-off.

500
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,389
I knew it.

501
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,224
You're not like other women.

502
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,810
You're the only woman who understands

503
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:53,894
a workaholic like me.

504
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,939
No wonder I fell for you.

505
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:00,943
Let's go.

506
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:10,119
Bo-ra. Aren't you coming?

507
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,203
Coming.

508
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,882
So he had to say that on your special day.

509
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:29,346
Lots of places deliver
chicken and pizza together.

510
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,347
That's no innovation.

511
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,934
Whatever. At that rate, he's ready
to send chicken to Mars.

512
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,607
Hey, you might as well drink soju.

513
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,026
Why doesn't this place serve soju?

514
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,111
Why look for soju in a wine bar?

515
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:46,905
Here you go.

516
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,035
You want <i>jjamppong?</i>

517
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,161
Come on.

518
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,204
You should kick out rude customers.

519
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:55,914
Is this how you run a business?

520
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,417
It's for Bo-ra.

521
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:03,005
You're the best.

522
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,715
You're so sweet.

523
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,301
Why? You want him?

524
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,886
But guess what?

525
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,889
This ugly guy is no longer available.

526
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,725
You're making me want him more.

527
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,479
We finished this bottle.

528
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,566
Where's Ju-wan? He seems busy these days.

529
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,153
Ju-wan is busy saving the planet.

530
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,905
- Hey!
- What?

531
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:30,407
I'm serious.

532
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,538
All he thinks about
is half chicken, half pizza.

533
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,875
He's not as busy now,
so he'll propose to you soon.

534
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,169
What if he doesn't?

535
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:45,923
If you give up on a proposal early on,
you know what's next?

536
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:49,218
You'd have to give up on
all anniversaries and holidays.

537
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,969
Then what?

538
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:55,099
You end up having rice
in cold water with radish kimchi

539
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,767
on an anniversary saying,

540
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,644
"Can't believe that's my husband."

541
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,896
"I should've known
when he didn't propose."

542
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,940
I'd become a nagging wife like that.

543
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,650
Story of my life.

544
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,198
Just tell him and get it over with.

545
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,119
If I tell him, he won't do it.

546
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:17,913
What moves a man is not nagging or orders.

547
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,290
You have to nudge them to do it.

548
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,794
Nudge him to ask you out,
nudge him to say sorry,

549
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,130
nudge him to pop the question.

550
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:27,756
What will you do?

551
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,431
Hey, take it easy.

552
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,391
You have a live radio show tomorrow.

553
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:46,984
That's right.
I have a live radio show tomorrow.

554
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,906
All right.

555
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,870
I'll throw a ball
he has no choice but to hit.

556
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,123
Really? Are you sure?

557
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,624
I'll really pick a bag then.

558
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,878
You haven't? Pick one already.

559
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:15,971
If you've been single your whole life
and know romance only as theory,

560
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:20,893
if you're frustrated to be stuck
in the friend zone,

561
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,937
if you're struggling to balance
a relationship dynamic,

562
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,147
listen up.

563
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,524
We'll help you succeed in your love life.

564
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:30,319
Dating coach Deborah,
coaching "almost" everything on love.

565
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:35,115
<i>We have lots of stories today.</i>

566
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,911
<i>The first story awaits Deborah's advice.</i>

567
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,289
<i>I'm a career woman in my thirties.</i>

568
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:47,252
<i>My boyfriend and I went to the same school</i>
<i>and we've dated for four years now.</i>

569
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:51,924
But these days,
I doubt that we are actually

570
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,509
in a romantic relationship.

571
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:57,554
Technically, he never asked me
to be his girlfriend.

572
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:01,266
<i>That's why we have</i>
<i>no anniversary, obviously.</i>

573
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,145
<i>No matching rings, no lovey-dovey posts</i>
<i>on our social media accounts.</i>

574
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:07,022
I was okay with all of that.

575
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,734
But when I saw my friends
naturally picturing their future

576
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:15,948
with their boyfriends,
I realized something was wrong.

577
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:20,786
Looking back,
I never talked to him about marriage,

578
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,206
and he never told me that he loved me.

579
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:28,293
Instead, he said,
"I hope our baby takes after you."

580
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:31,380
<i>"If you want to see another guy,</i>
<i>wait till I approve."</i>

581
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:35,384
"Why don't you move in with me
instead of going back and forth?"

582
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,220
He also said, "Marriage is a crazy thing."

583
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:41,807
"I won't gift you anything
for your wedding,

584
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,227
<i>because I'm broke."</i>

585
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:49,898
<i>I still believed he loved me, and he was</i>
<i>just not good at expressing his feelings.</i>

586
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,318
But I'm getting tired of
dating a guy who won't commit.

587
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,154
Why do you think he's doing this?

588
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:58,824
Do you think it's okay
to keep dating this guy

589
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,535
who won't even commit to a relationship?

590
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,623
Says things that make you confused,

591
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,417
makes your heart flutter,

592
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,794
flirts with you, but won't commit.

593
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,588
His every word and action

594
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:16,383
brings you heaven one day
and hell another.

595
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,679
He's what we call a typical "bad boy."

596
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,390
<i>Remind yourself of</i>

597
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,435
the countless excuses you made
to justify his actions.

598
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:30,939
He always hated cheesy stuff.
He's bad at expressing his feelings.

599
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:33,525
He has no sisters.
He went to an all-boys school,

600
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,652
majored in science. Parents are strict.

601
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:38,322
His MBTI is INFJ. What else?

602
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:42,534
More than a sweet-talker,
a softie inside is more attractive, right?

603
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:43,994
Well...

604
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:47,289
That's not a softie inside,
it's more like Jekyll and Hyde.

605
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,833
<i>If he's committed,</i>
<i>he'll still gift something</i>

606
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:51,585
<i>- small and sparkly</i>
<i>- "Jekyll</i> and Hyde"?

607
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,796
<i>but just act nonchalant about it.</i>

608
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,259
<i>When in love, all one can think about</i>
<i>is saying the words, "I love you."</i>

609
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,304
But this guy didn't even
define the relationship.

610
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,141
<i>You know how dating</i>
<i>this kind of guy ends up?</i>

611
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,685
If you tell him you want to end things,

612
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:11,772
it'd be no surprise
to hear him say something like,

613
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,274
"Sorry, but were we in a relationship?"

614
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:15,525
Even while in bed together,

615
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,694
he might hand you a wedding invite saying,

616
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:22,074
"Come if you have time."
Even then, you have no right to be angry.

617
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,200
Isn't it ridiculous?

618
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,203
You're open enough
to see each other naked,

619
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,289
but he's too shy to
talk about the relationship?

620
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:33,043
At a restaurant, he'll shout,
"One kimchi stew, please!"

621
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,711
"Extra bowl of rice, please!"

622
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:38,465
If he bumps his leg,
he'll probably scream loudly in pain.

623
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:41,969
Why? Because that's what his mouth is for.

624
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,889
<i>The hard truth is, even that bad boy</i>

625
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:49,101
would pluck up courage to kneel
before someone he truly loves

626
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,605
and confess his feelings while
giving something small and sparkly.

627
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,233
Well said.

628
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,487
Now, what does
Deborah want to say to this listener?

629
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,448
It's simple.

630
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:06,868
You're not in a relationship
unless it's been verbally defined.

631
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,622
Seriously, what's she talking about?

632
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:12,833
"You're not like other women."

633
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,876
"You're the only one who understands me."

634
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,837
"No wonder I fell for you."

635
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,716
<i>"We're going to get married.</i>
<i>I want to marry you."</i>

636
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,677
<i>"If we get married someday..."</i>

637
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,970
<i>None of that matters.</i>

638
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:28,432
<i>It's like when you cannot marry someone</i>
<i>unless they give you</i>

639
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:31,018
<i>something small and sparkly asking,</i>

640
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,562
<i>"Will you marry me?"</i>

641
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:35,981
It's a similar situation.

642
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,902
Of course, the choice is yours.

643
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,740
<i>It's time to give a song prescription.</i>

644
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,408
<i>That's right.</i>

645
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,326
"Special Day"

646
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,786
<i>by WISUE.</i>

647
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,748
<i>We'll be back after a break.</i>

648
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,467
You really hit where it hurts
with facts today.

649
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,094
I can even feel the pain.

650
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,472
The story was so frustrating.

651
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,724
I got a little worked up.

652
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,601
You bet.

653
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,812
Dating a guy who never
asked you out for four years?

654
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,023
Isn't this story made-up?

655
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,650
Can one be this desperate to date a guy?

656
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:21,818
Why bother?

657
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:24,446
There are all kinds of people out there.

658
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,156
It didn't seem made-up.

659
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,240
Maybe this.

660
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:30,744
Guys want to wait
till they get their ducks in a row.

661
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,955
Maybe it takes longer
to be sure about their feelings.

662
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,458
Things can change if you wait.

663
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:41,922
Don't you think?

664
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,381
That's cute.

665
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,134
Come on, tell her the harsh truth.

666
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,261
She's just never been there.

667
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:51,306
There's only one ending
with a guy who won't commit.

668
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,976
It'll be over without a word,
not knowing when or why.

669
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,228
Nothing more.

670
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,395
The end.

671
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,564
That's so harsh.

672
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,483
Just as he could date without asking,

673
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,735
he could end it without saying anything.

674
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:06,154
It's a perfect situation for a bad boy.

675
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,240
So petty.

676
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,659
Being the one who loves more is to blame.

677
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,454
Relationships are meant to be
petty and unfair.

678
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,039
See you tomorrow.

679
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,333
Good work.

680
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,585
Great job today.

681
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,093
I'd like to order one kimchi stew.

682
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:32,097
<i>At a restaurant, he'll shout,</i>
<i>"One kimchi stew, please!"</i>

683
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,182
I want bulgogi

684
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,685
and a bowl of rice, it's not included.

685
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,520
<i>"Extra bowl of rice, please!"</i>

686
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,313
Order it yourself!

687
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,368
Even if I look young for my age,

688
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,453
you should show some respect.

689
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,289
It's not that.

690
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,209
I listened to the radio on the way.

691
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:04,212
What a load of utter nonsense
with no sense of shame.

692
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:05,797
It was ridiculous.

693
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:07,424
Who was it?

694
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,259
Deborah.

695
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,220
She acts as if
she can read people's minds.

696
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,431
As if she can read them like a book.

697
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:18,977
It was complete rubbish.

698
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,605
"You're in a relationship
only when it's defined."

699
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,649
"Dating involves something
small and sparkly."

700
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,109
What nonsense...

701
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,777
What nonsense?

702
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:30,530
That's an irrefutable fact.

703
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,574
Like, "Koreans like kimchi."

704
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,452
"Men like pretty women."

705
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:38,163
Despite some exceptions, it's irrefutable.

706
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:45,837
Don't tell me you've never given Yu-ri
something small and sparkly.

707
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,676
You did ask her out, right?

708
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,138
You told her, "I love you,"

709
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,515
at least once, right?

710
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:02,354
Wow, are you sure
you guys are in a relationship?

711
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,397
Or did you already break up?

712
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:07,776
I wondered why you guys don't
talk on the phone or meet.

713
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,277
What are you talking about?

714
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:13,073
She had a hangover or a cold,
so I told her to rest for a few days.

715
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,532
We have plans later today.

716
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:18,119
Just like me,
Yu-ri doesn't care for cheesy stuff.

717
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,455
That useless small and sparkly...

718
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,915
She wouldn't like it?

719
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,793
Did you ever think maybe she acted like

720
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,337
she hates it, as she knows
she won't get it?

721
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:34,261
The song lyrics,
"Mom said she didn't like <i>jjajangmyeon."</i>

722
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,345
Don't you know?

723
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:36,972
She didn't hate <i>jjajangmyeon.</i>

724
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,307
It means she wants sweet and sour pork.

725
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,309
You know nothing about women

726
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:42,477
and relationships.

727
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,982
I feel bad for Yu-ri.

728
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,527
What about you?
You knew women so well that...

729
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,489
I did, so I got married.
What's wrong with that?

730
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,118
I'm an experienced applicant,
while you're unexperienced.

731
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,161
Who do you think will get a job first?

732
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,998
You were sick of marriage.
Now you want to marry again.

733
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,082
Hey...

734
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,377
That's ridiculous.

735
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,546
You jinxed it. Take it back.

736
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,423
- Fine! I take it back.
- Seriously...

737
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,305
That's your power trip
in a relationship with Yu-ri.

738
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,850
You know Yu-ri likes you no matter what.

739
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,935
So you do nothing.

740
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,732
I'd like to recommend a book for you.

741
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:32,444
<i>What You Got Wrong About Your Love Life.</i>

742
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,827
<i>If he bumps his leg,</i>
<i>he'll probably scream loudly in pain.</i>

743
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,956
<i>Why? Because that's what his mouth is for.</i>

744
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:51,963
<i>"What You Got Wrong About Your Love Life."</i>

745
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,471
<i>Don't love,</i>
<i>be in a romantic relationship instead.</i>

746
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:05,518
<i>Standing him up and having her own way</i>
<i>is a privilege of a beloved woman.</i>

747
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:11,608
<i>A crying baby gets the milk first.</i>

748
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:16,112
<i>You should cry first and the loudest</i>
<i>and be on his top priority.</i>

749
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:22,452
<i>Rather than being disappointed about</i>
<i>not getting a gift after gifting him,</i>

750
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,288
<i>don't give him anything,</i>
<i>just receive what he gives you</i>

751
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:26,831
{\an8}<i>and smile.</i>

752
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:32,295
{\an8}<i>Relationships are a matter of charm</i>
<i>and value, not sincerity.</i>

753
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,677
<i>Even to a love story's antagonist,</i>
<i>a diamond symbolizes their love.</i>

754
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:56,986
Welcome.

755
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:16,089
Can I take a look at this?

756
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,173
Sure.

757
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:25,640
<i>Even if he doesn't care for</i>
<i>the value of diamonds,</i>

758
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:30,728
<i>if he recognizes that it is</i>
<i>a universal symbol of love,</i>

759
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:34,607
<i>he will willingly buy it</i>
<i>and place it on your finger.</i>

760
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:37,444
<i>If that's not a firm expression of love,</i>
<i>then what is?</i>

761
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,327
I'll get off work now.

762
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:49,247
<i>Did you check out the book I recommended?</i>

763
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,791
About Deborah,

764
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:54,669
shall we have a meeting?

765
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,297
<i>What? Really?</i>
<i>You're sure about this, right?</i>

766
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:02,927
<i>- But why all of a sudden?</i>
- Well, I'm oddly convinced.

767
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:05,722
See you tomorrow.

768
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:12,103
Something small and sparkly.

769
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:20,361
Is something wrong with the product?

770
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,200
My nail polish color is wrong.

771
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,076
This vivid color.

772
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,121
Pale colors would match this better.

773
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:31,748
What will work?

774
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:37,295
No.

775
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:41,633
Pale baby pink,
with two drops of strawberry milk.

776
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,176
Oh, my.

777
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:48,097
I'll come back with my boyfriend.

778
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:50,058
And when I do...

779
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,184
I know.

780
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,561
I should naturally
recommend this item, right?

781
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:55,813
That'd be much appreciated.

782
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:58,608
Is there a design you have in mind?

783
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,569
Not really.

784
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,071
Is it for you?

785
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,157
Or for a gift, matching rings,
or a wedding band.

786
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,534
How may I help you?

787
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,372
Rings have no use in the first place,

788
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,332
but I guess it needs a purpose.

789
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:18,962
It's just a gift.

790
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:23,049
These have differences?

791
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,093
Pardon me?

792
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:28,972
There's no such thing as
just a gift in a relationship.

793
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,849
"I want to go out with you."
"Sorry about yesterday."

794
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:33,935
"Let's stay together tonight."

795
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,982
"I'll eventually marry you,
so don't be hysterical."

796
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:42,443
There must be some message
you want to deliver.

797
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,406
If there's no message,
can you call it a gift?

798
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,417
Were you speaking to me?

799
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,170
You were staring at the ring,

800
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:04,007
so I thought you were
talking to an object.

801
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,676
You give a gift with no strings attached.

802
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,136
If it's quid pro quo,

803
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,054
that's bribery.

804
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:21,232
You don't get it.
How can you possibly have a relationship?

805
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:25,361
You might come back to
get a refund tomorrow.

806
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,323
When wrapping,
don't tie the ribbon tightly.

807
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,907
Gently.

808
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:38,750
I'll take that one.

809
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:42,170
But sir...

810
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,463
It's not sold, right?

811
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,384
In that case...

812
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,597
I was going to...

813
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,854
<i>This design is the last item left</i>
<i>in Korea.</i>

814
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,981
<i>There's no plan to restock this item.</i>

815
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,988
- She'll like it, right?
- Sure thing.

816
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,907
- Let me wrap it up for you.
- Thanks.

817
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,034
Yes.

818
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,038
Publishing company?

819
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,833
<i>I told you before.</i>
<i>The one that wants a contract with you.</i>

820
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,877
<i>They want to meet. What should I say?</i>

821
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,962
Well, what should we tell them?

822
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,631
<i>Why are you so down?</i>

823
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,511
I'm at a mall, and...

824
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:32,428
<i>Mall?</i>

825
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,682
I should have asked you,
I'm in the mall too.

826
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:36,849
<i>You are?</i>

827
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:40,186
I came to pick a bag.

828
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:47,652
What's wrong?

829
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,697
Do you know what I'm looking at right now?

830
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,367
What kind of bag did you see?
You're scaring me.

831
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,334
He bought a ring.

832
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:08,339
Ju-wan just bought a ring and left.

833
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:09,424
What?

834
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,592
I really need to go pick a bag now. Bye.

835
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:14,512
Oh, what do I tell the publishing company?

836
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,222
So...

837
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:19,016
this means I was proposed to.

838
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,730
My answer is, "Yes, I do."

839
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:56,072
It's mine.

840
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,451
Good luck.

841
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,207
What the...

842
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,968
<i>He has a ring in his pocket,</i>

843
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:20,513
<i>and I'm ready to say yes.</i>

844
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:24,475
<i>Our happy ending was approaching.</i>

845
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:26,769
Yu-ri.

846
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:30,565
<i>Dating a guy who never</i>
<i>asked you out for four years?</i>

847
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,609
<i>Maybe it takes longer</i>
<i>to be sure about their feelings.</i>

848
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:36,070
Things can change if you wait.

849
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,657
There's only one ending
with a guy who won't commit.

850
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:44,453
It'll be over without a word,
not knowing when or why.

851
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:45,788
<i>The end.</i>

852
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,150
Were you on a date?

853
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:16,694
Why so pretty, all dressed up?

854
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:21,949
How did you know that I had a date today?

855
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,995
What? Are you getting married?

856
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:30,416
Yes.

857
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,460
I plan to.

858
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,089
We should

859
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,595
stop seeing each other.

860
00:53:51,646 --> 00:53:53,564
I've come to my senses.

861
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:58,361
I want to meet someone
to get married to before I get older.

862
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,530
Someone who is

863
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,574
warm,

864
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,242
nice,

865
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,996
relaxed and steady,

866
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:12,083
sometimes a little boring.

867
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,877
Someone who doesn't know all about me.

868
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:18,005
Someone who likes me.

869
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:25,471
What? Did you think
you're the only man in my life?

870
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,853
I feel sorry.

871
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,065
I came on too strong, didn't I?

872
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:38,776
I shouldn't impose on you.

873
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,737
I know you're not into me,

874
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:47,118
but I was clingy and upset for no reason.

875
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,079
What did I expect from you...

876
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:58,796
- Yu-ri...
- I acted cool, like I don't care.

877
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:01,924
To be honest, I'm not cool at all.

878
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:04,719
I'm absolutely pathetic.

879
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:09,306
Your every word and action

880
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,642
brings me heaven one day and hell another.

881
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,687
<i>His every word and action</i>

882
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:18,899
<i>brings you heaven one day</i>
<i>and hell another.</i>

883
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:22,570
<i>He's what we call a typical "bad boy."</i>

884
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,908
If you truly love someone,

885
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,997
you'd kneel down and give her a ring

886
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:40,171
saying, "I love you," right?

887
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,011
That's just not me.

888
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:52,433
<i>The hard truth is, even that bad boy</i>

889
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:55,936
<i>would pluck up courage to kneel</i>
<i>before someone he truly loves</i>

890
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:00,775
<i>and confess his feelings while</i>
<i>giving something small and sparkly.</i>

891
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:05,780
Did you write that story
that came out on the radio show today?

892
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:08,949
You listened to it?

893
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:11,952
You're right.

894
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:13,079
It was my story.

895
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:19,001
I was curious as to where we stand.

896
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:25,424
It was always hard dating you.

897
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,844
If I didn't reach out to you first,

898
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:30,638
you never would.

899
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:36,185
If I tell you my feelings,
I wouldn't be able to see you.

900
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,187
I was always anxious.

901
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,358
Still, after sleeping with you,

902
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,403
I wondered,

903
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:50,658
"Does he love me?"

904
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:57,540
You're really bad.

905
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,126
Very mean.

906
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:05,548
You're a coward and you're selfish.

907
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:09,510
You're a jerk.

908
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:15,349
You make me petty and small-minded.

909
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,830
Maybe it's because of my cold.

910
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,915
I keep getting a runny nose.

911
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:47,381
I don't think it's from your nose,
you dummy.

912
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,263
How can you be so okay?

913
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:59,518
I feel sorry for myself
for going crazy about a guy like you.

914
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,163
Stop drinking. You have a fever.

915
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,180
Yu-ri.

916
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:46,899
Eat and sleep well.

917
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,659
Please get going.

918
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:20,993
TRUE TO LOVE

919
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,411
<i>Shall we have a date?</i>

920
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:24,580
{\an8}<i>- Today?</i>
<i>- I just want to see you all of a sudden.</i>

921
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:27,416
{\an8}<i>Ju-wan just bought a ring and left.</i>

922
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:29,460
{\an8}<i>- I love you.</i>
<i>- Do I need to say it?</i>

923
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,086
{\an8}<i>How else would she know?</i>

924
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,047
{\an8}<i>She was totally fine, then suddenly...</i>

925
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,965
{\an8}- Deborah.
<i>- Do you need to stay in</i>

926
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:36,675
{\an8}<i>this miserable relationship?</i>

927
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:37,718
{\an8}Break up with him.

928
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,136
{\an8}<i>I won't work with Deborah.</i>

929
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,430
{\an8}How can love change?

930
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:44,433
{\an8}<i>- It's boring here, right?</i>
<i>- It's fun.</i>

931
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,602
{\an8}<i>Do you believe in destiny?</i>

932
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:49,146
{\an8}<i>Deborah? She's famous,</i>
<i>but everything she says is crap.</i>

933
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,482
{\an8}- I'm Deborah.
- I'm Lee Su-hyeok.

934
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:54,360
{\an8}<i>Lot of people wants to do it</i>
<i>with me. You don't?</i>

935
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:56,111
{\an8}<i>How about you? Do you?</i>

936
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:58,447
{\an8}<i>While we're at it,</i>
<i>shall we do it properly?</i>
