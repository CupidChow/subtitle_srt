1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,963
TRUE TO LOVE

2
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,956
TRUE TO LOVE

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,501
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,889
Once again, let me make this clear.

5
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:58,434
I have no inclination
to make a fool out of myself again.

6
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,102
I'm financially stable enough.

7
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:03,147
I don't need to use my past,
stories, or tears to make a living.

8
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,191
There's no chance I'll work with you.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,528
<i>Why did I have to go that far?</i>

10
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,282
We don't need to
see each other again, right?

11
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,496
<i>If I don't sign this contract today,</i>
<i>I'll end up on the streets.</i>

12
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:21,332
<i>Let's focus on that.</i>

13
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:25,544
<i>Today I, Deborah, have no shame.</i>

14
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,136
Knock, knock, this is Deborah.

15
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,305
Please put your bad-mouthing on hold.

16
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,224
I'm opening the door right now.

17
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,856
I suddenly really want to do it.

18
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,361
Why don't we do it together?

19
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,299
{\an8}U-ri, I'll take that.

20
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,969
{\an8}EP 07
SHALL WE?

21
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,764
{\an8}So, what's your angle?

22
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,393
{\an8}You think I'm doing this
because I want to?

23
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,936
{\an8}Then why are you doing this?

24
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,565
{\an8}Are you really asking?

25
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,609
{\an8}Seriously...

26
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:38,158
{\an8}I believe you will not sabotage this
because of a personal grudge against me.

27
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,662
{\an8}If you won't be of help, don't say a word.

28
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,457
Okay?

29
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:49,795
Here.

30
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,672
Thank you.

31
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,841
Well...

32
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,555
I heard that
you strongly rejected the deal.

33
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,182
How did you change your mind?

34
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,564
I see that's what you heard.
That is not what I meant.

35
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:15,988
<i>If I don't sign the contract today,</i>
<i>I'll end up on the streets.</i>

36
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,157
<i>Let's focus on that.</i>

37
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:23,078
<i>However, Donald Trump,</i>
<i>a mean but gifted negotiator, once said,</i>

38
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:27,166
<i>"The worst thing you can possibly do</i>
<i>in a deal is seem desperate to make it."</i>

39
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,628
<i>"That makes the other guy smell blood,</i>

40
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,338
<i>and then you're dead."</i>

41
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,215
<i>I must not show how desperate I am.</i>

42
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,302
No matter how good the deal was,

43
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,263
I thought it'd be courteous
to turn it down once.

44
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:45,225
There was a bit of a misunderstanding
in the process of communication.

45
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,858
Wasn't it too clear and simple?

46
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:53,859
"I don't need to

47
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:56,695
use my past, stories, or tears
to make a living."

48
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,739
"There's no chance I'll work with you."

49
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,949
That's what you said.

50
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,495
I'm not saying I didn't say that.

51
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,872
You should have read between the lines.

52
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,457
Well...

53
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:12,378
You know what they say.
When a woman says "no", it means "yes."

54
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,674
What am I saying?

55
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,300
That's totally absurd.

56
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,468
I was just joking.

57
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,472
Okay, you're right.

58
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,391
I did turn it down.

59
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,309
But a few days ago,

60
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,645
I belatedly stumbled upon the email

61
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,065
"An offer you can't refuse"
that Mr. Han sent me.

62
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,566
Then I realized

63
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,196
how tremendously you have
respected me as a writer.

64
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,449
I thought it was rash of me

65
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,785
to turn down that offer so easily.

66
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:49,999
I want to start a project
with someone who appreciates my worth.

67
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,751
I felt motivated.

68
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,215
So, let me read between the lines
based on what you just said.

69
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,635
The terms of the contract
changed your mind. That's what you mean.

70
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:05,806
It's not simply the terms of the contract.

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,942
What Mr. Han said before

72
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:21,447
got stuck in my head.
It was so unforgettable.

73
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,200
You said my failure could inspire someone.

74
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,914
You also said,
"A dating coach who got brutally dumped."

75
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,168
"She got knocked down,
showing her panties to all."

76
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,712
"She gets back up and has a return match."

77
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,299
"She wins in the end."
That <i>Rocky</i> kind of touching ending.

78
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,926
I was quite intrigued by that.

79
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,930
In other words, you're my muse in a way.

80
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,477
I'm so flattered.

81
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,271
Anyways, thank you.

82
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,241
<i>What is it?</i>

83
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,535
<i>Those eyes. It can't be...</i>

84
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:12,664
<i>Rejection?</i>

85
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,438
But we're in a tight spot.

86
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,443
We've come quite far along with
other projects already.

87
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,487
There's a publication schedule issue.

88
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,741
It's a shame, but we need to
take a rain check with you.

89
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:50,953
What?

90
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,959
By taking a rain check,

91
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,254
do you mind me asking you
when it would be specifically?

92
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,049
I don't know, maybe...

93
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,887
At an unspecified time in the future?

94
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,391
<i>Busted. He smelled blood.</i>

95
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,908
That's a real shame.

96
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,913
Artists find inspiration
when they are in need and desperate.

97
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,750
That's actually how I am now.

98
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,420
I'm in dire need of something.

99
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,339
And I'm extremely desperate.

100
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,968
That's why I'm getting
these creative ideas

101
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,845
coming across my mind.

102
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,931
Too bad we need to take a rain check.

103
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,981
I promised myself to do my very best

104
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,567
and put my heart and soul
into this project

105
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,111
if I get one more chance.

106
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:09,823
"I'm Shakespeare, I'm Walt Disney,"

107
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:13,285
I was brimming with such confidence.

108
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,789
Hang on.

109
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,961
As for creative ideas,
can you elaborate on that?

110
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,088
What?

111
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,051
<i>It's my last chance.</i>

112
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:33,597
<i>I have to take out a wild card</i>
<i>that can turn the tables.</i>

113
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,724
<i>Think.</i>

114
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,602
There are so many, like...

115
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,398
An...

116
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,235
Antonio?

117
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,070
Anton Chekhov once said,

118
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,573
"If there's a gun in the first chapter,
in the third, it must go off."

119
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,992
Andante?

120
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,664
Anton Chekhov...

121
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,165
"Antan" Chekhov.

122
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,251
"Antan" Chekhov once said,

123
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,711
"Shoot. If there's a gun
in the first chapter,

124
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,089
in the third chapter,
it must go off." Bang!

125
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:10,550
I was shot in the heart. Two shots.

126
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,519
I'm so sick and tired of you!

127
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,899
These are my gunshot wounds.

128
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,776
I have two.

129
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,073
Now, I will take the gun

130
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,158
and shoot.

131
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,869
I will shoot.

132
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,496
Calm down, wait.

133
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,459
Bang!

134
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,382
Don't make me pretend to be shot.

135
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,138
Bang!

136
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,264
Please, just once.

137
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,490
In my three books
about romantic relationships,

138
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,951
there was something missing.

139
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,787
That's failure in love and breakups.

140
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:26,251
I thought about the ending that
the broken-hearted would desire the most.

141
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:32,007
In my case,
first of all, I'd want to win again.

142
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,844
I'd have to make the person
who broke my heart

143
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:40,015
come back and beg me on his knees
for my love again.

144
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,601
He'd have to crawl at my feet

145
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,479
and lick my shoes.
I'd have to make him beg for it.

146
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,523
So what happens next?

147
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,109
Revenge? Or make up?

148
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:56,490
The choice is to be made afterward.

149
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,577
Whether to be like him
and disappear for revenge,

150
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,997
or to regain the upper hand
in a relationship

151
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,291
and mend the relationship.

152
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,211
That is exactly
Deborah's victorious relationship,

153
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,421
how to be a winner in a relationship!

154
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:21,556
So you're saying you'll write an essay
about the actual story

155
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,227
of how a dating coach
actually overcomes her breakup?

156
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,689
And about the tips on how to
win back your ex after a breakup.

157
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,361
Yes! Exactly.

158
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,737
On top of that,

159
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:40,117
Deborah's tips on
how to cope with a breakup.

160
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,870
Like, how to take presents from an ex
off your hands for a profit.

161
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,916
And how to succeed
in a diet after a breakup.

162
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,502
Tips on taking a profile picture

163
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,380
for your messenger app
that will blow him away.

164
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,888
The content is substantial
and has a unique selling point.

165
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,723
Can't wait to buy it, right?

166
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:04,891
How much is it?

167
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:07,978
President Han.

168
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,609
How is it?

169
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:18,155
I think the final decision
has to be made by the planner.

170
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,198
The planner...

171
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,124
I like the idea of
changing the original concept

172
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,169
of Almost Everything About Love
from dating to marriage.

173
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,545
There was...

174
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,840
a certain turning point.

175
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,259
It's hard to stick with
the original concept.

176
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,888
That is a much more
considerate expression than

177
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,474
"a dating coach being dumped like trash."

178
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,725
"A turning point."

179
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,438
Please keep going.

180
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,150
Also, the previous one
was kind of predictable,

181
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,943
this sounds much more interesting.

182
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,779
But I have one concern.

183
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,574
To turn it from a self-help book
on relationships

184
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,284
to an autobiographic essay,

185
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:08,038
personal details about your relationship
will end up in the book.

186
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:13,084
Can you handle that?
You didn't want to sell your stories.

187
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,671
That's not that big of a deal.

188
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:21,676
I was embarrassed and humiliated already.
I don't mind selling some stories.

189
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,720
At a fair price if possible.

190
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,266
I see. So the answer is?

191
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,101
You're up for it, right?

192
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,853
You like it, right?

193
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,734
There.

194
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,404
Here it is.

195
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,870
Now we're really working together.

196
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,915
Looks like it.

197
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:58,505
If we're doing it,
let's do it properly. Shall we?

198
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,809
{\an8}PRESIDENT: HAN SANG-JIN

199
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:11,893
Okay.

200
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,272
All done.

201
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,315
Thank you.

202
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:21,194
I wish I could take you out for dinner
on a special day like this.

203
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,363
But we have a staff dinner today.

204
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,658
I'll treat you to dinner properly later.

205
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,953
Mr. Han, I'm disappointed.

206
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,539
If it's a staff dinner,
I should definitely be there.

207
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,208
Really?

208
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:39,421
I'm clearly a member of
the Jinlee Publishing family.

209
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,341
- Okay, let's go together.
- Sure thing!

210
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,177
Oh, right.

211
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,723
Before that, I need to
have a word with you.

212
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:52,892
With me?

213
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,521
Yes, well...

214
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,078
Please step out for a bit.

215
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:15,749
Okay.

216
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,176
Now she's part of our family.
Speech, please.

217
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,011
Me?

218
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,430
Let's remember these members!

219
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:37,604
Let me present an award
for the king of communication

220
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,356
in Jinlee Publishing group chat.

221
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,068
Bang U-ri!

222
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,863
A 100,000 won gift card.

223
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,743
All I did was leave an emoji
for Sang-jin's great advice

224
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,120
in our group chat.

225
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,165
I will keep actively
communicating with you.

226
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,001
Congratulations!

227
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,795
Congrats.

228
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,963
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

229
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,216
- Welcome.
- How about a toast?

230
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,134
- Shall we make a toast?
- Okay.

231
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:12,639
So good.

232
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,105
Why are you doing this?

233
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,023
You don't know?

234
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,068
Now, I am the payee
and he is the financier.

235
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,238
I'm demonstrating
good social skills to be paid.

236
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,615
Don't you have alcoholic gastritis?

237
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,159
You do notice
you're drinking alcohol, right?

238
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,540
You have awfully good memory.

239
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,792
That's why I'm drinking beer.

240
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,044
It should count as a soft drink.

241
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,716
No one here will force you to drink.

242
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,552
No need to drink if you don't want to.

243
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:56,933
I didn't say anything.
It's just that I can't stand being sober.

244
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,564
I feel like I sold my soul to the devil.

245
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:04,899
Well...

246
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,737
I briefly mentioned this earlier.

247
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,615
It's about the desperation of an artist.

248
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:13,825
Well...

249
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,287
By saving an artist
who's in a desperate situation,

250
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,540
there's a way to maximize her creativity.

251
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,542
There is a great way...

252
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,586
That's what I wanted to...

253
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,965
What does that mean?

254
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,010
For example, giving an advance...

255
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,940
May I get an advance against royalties?

256
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,108
I'm desperate.

257
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,998
What a shame.

258
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,251
In negotiation, timing is everything.

259
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,588
If you were a little patient,

260
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,425
you could have sold your soul
to the devil more gracefully.

261
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,768
She checked the contract just recently.

262
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,480
- Did you keep track of it every day?
- Well, not every day.

263
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,610
Anyway, since she saw the contract,
wouldn't she have a change of heart?

264
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,197
You should reach out to her
and talk her into it.

265
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,575
I think she might accept the deal
if we adjust some conditions.

266
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:40,829
Stop being so clingy.
Even an ex wouldn't be this clingy.

267
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,288
She said no.

268
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:46,042
Hey, what do we do then?
Shin Yu-seon's next book is delayed.

269
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,169
We need to provide for our employees.

270
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,382
You said Deborah lost
40 million won to a scam.

271
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,468
She might have a change of heart.

272
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,220
She'd want to recover the loss.

273
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,639
That's human instinct,
don't you know that?

274
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,307
Whatever. I can't.

275
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,518
Where are you going?

276
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,645
Knock, knock, this is Deborah.

277
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,730
Please put your bad-mouthing on hold.

278
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,672
We've come quite far along with
other projects already.

279
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,632
There's a publication schedule issue.

280
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:38,303
It's a shame, but we need to
take a rain check with you.

281
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:44,684
"HIDE YOUR DESPERATION AND BE HESITANT"
BY DONALD TRUMP

282
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,940
Drink. Let's drink.

283
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,153
Why are you telling me all that now?

284
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,448
You told me not to utter a word earlier.

285
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,049
Cheers!

286
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,759
- Mr. Han.
- Yes?

287
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,677
You know we respect you, right?

288
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,429
Respect, you don't need...

289
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,599
So let's speak casually for a bit.
No formalities.

290
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,311
- Casually?
- For three minutes.

291
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,773
You're the boss!

292
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,442
Just for three minutes.

293
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,735
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

294
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,195
Okay, no honorifics.

295
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,406
Okay. Start.

296
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,492
The youngest should go first.

297
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,035
Me? To Sang-jin?

298
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,244
Go ahead.

299
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,704
Hey, Sang-jin.

300
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,583
It's always so nice
to see your bright smile.

301
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,752
Let's get along.

302
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,837
Okay, sounds good.

303
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,297
Hey, Han Sang-jin!

304
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,926
You always tell us,
"You know what I mean?"

305
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,427
I really have no idea.

306
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,929
Do I?

307
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,598
Why do we have meetings?
You do as you please anyway.

308
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,725
- It's super annoying.
- I see.

309
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:13,648
Sang-jin, I know you peek at us
hiding behind the wall in your office.

310
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:14,857
Stop that.

311
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,026
So naughty.

312
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,404
You're so naughty.

313
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:24,117
You always nag us for not communicating
in the group chat.

314
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,912
We have our own group chat,
you had no idea, right?

315
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,164
We communicate a ton.

316
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,041
Group chat?

317
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,795
- If you guys fight, you lose, right?
- He takes a beating.

318
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,840
Sang-jin is about to cry.

319
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,383
No, I...

320
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:46,264
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry.

321
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,726
Let's go for another round, Mr. Han.

322
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,270
Here.

323
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,106
- Thank you.
- Take a taxi.

324
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,816
Take a taxi.

325
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,527
- Bye.
- Good night.

326
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,783
That's unusual.

327
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:06,701
Is he that drunk?

328
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,370
Whatever. Let's go for
another round with this.

329
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,122
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

330
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,165
Let's go.

331
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,505
- Yeah.
<i>- Hey.</i>

332
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:22,717
Are you in there?
That group chat you guys made without me.

333
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,094
That's not the problem.

334
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:28,473
What about Ms. Yeon?

335
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,434
She's not up yet.

336
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,644
Make sure she gets home safely, okay?

337
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,688
Okay. Bye.

338
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,913
I thought you were drunk.

339
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,499
I just put my head down and took a rest.

340
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,835
Beer can't get me drunk.

341
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,923
One bottle of beer, please.

342
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:02,965
Okay.

343
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,343
You should stop drinking.

344
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:07,553
Don't worry.

345
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:11,265
I'm not going to do
anything irrational anymore.

346
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,561
Can't you trust me?

347
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,980
Yes, I can.

348
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,108
It means you're really fine now.

349
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,527
Here.

350
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,531
No doubt.

351
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,452
Out-of-body experience.

352
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,039
I left my physical body and saw myself.

353
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,713
I got to observe me
and the situation objectively.

354
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:48,219
He no longer loves me.

355
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,054
That can happen.

356
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,307
Is there a reason
to prolong that relationship?

357
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,600
No, there isn't.

358
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:59,147
Do I want him so badly
that I could destroy my ego?

359
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,107
No, I don't.

360
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:06,529
Breaking up between a man and woman,
is it unacceptable or impossible?

361
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,613
No.

362
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:12,243
I pulled myself together
and I was able to shake it off in no time.

363
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,210
The beer tastes a bit bland.

364
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:26,883
That's a good thing.

365
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,221
Now, can you tell me?

366
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:37,768
What is your secret to getting an ex back
and making him swoon over you again?

367
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:46,360
With your big talk about winning him back,
you must have had a good plan.

368
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:52,617
No way.

369
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:56,621
Don't tell me you just blurted it out
and will make something up?

370
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,000
You didn't sell your soul
to the devil with no plan.

371
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,462
I didn't.

372
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,716
First off,

373
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,971
before getting the plans up and running,

374
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,599
I need to analyze the cause of defeat.

375
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,768
Cause of defeat?

376
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,063
I liked him before he did.

377
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,065
And liked him more than he did.

378
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,609
It felt like it had to be him,
no one else.

379
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,112
So I wasn't interested in any other guy.

380
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,531
And I wanted to marry him.

381
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:38,579
I tried hard to hide it,
but he sensed my desperation.

382
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,457
That's the cause of your defeat?

383
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,502
In hindsight, I think

384
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,173
that might have made him feel suffocated.

385
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,013
He said he felt suffocated with me.

386
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,475
He said the air felt thick.

387
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,195
But it's kind of unfair.

388
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,864
That was what he liked about me.

389
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:17,243
He found it attractive and special.
What was that then?

390
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,789
I bet he meant it.

391
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,294
He meant it in that moment.

392
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,547
Though it was not everlasting.

393
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,721
Sincerity in a fleeting moment.

394
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,519
Now it's your turn.

395
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,188
What was the cause of your defeat?

396
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,234
I just

397
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:54,155
did not define our relationship.

398
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:59,285
I did not tell her that I loved her
or that I wanted to marry her.

399
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:03,456
I thought she'd know
even if I didn't tell her.

400
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,251
Why did you have to be so stingy?

401
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:11,380
I waited till I was ready to be committed
and be sure of my feelings, I guess.

402
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:15,468
I didn't want to blurt out
those words spontaneously.

403
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:20,097
And when I felt like
it was the right moment,

404
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,727
she said goodbye to me.

405
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,522
Why didn't you tell her how you felt then?

406
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,067
Tell me about it.

407
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,404
Because it wasn't enough.

408
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:41,285
You didn't love her enough
to swallow your pride.

409
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,293
That might be it.

410
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,814
Beer's a soft drink?

411
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,192
Can't believe I fell for it again.

412
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,917
What are you doing?
Get on the bus already!

413
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,293
Aren't you going home?

414
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:35,423
I'll walk you home. 'Cause I live nearby.

415
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,637
She remembers that even when she's drunk.

416
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,498
Damn it.

417
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,836
There is only one reason for my defeat.

418
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,045
Age.

419
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,882
That's what makes me inferior to her.

420
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,010
I'm old.

421
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,680
She's still wet behind the ears.

422
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,726
That's the only reason.

423
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:32,229
I look quite young for my age.

424
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,649
People usually think
I'm younger than my age.

425
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:42,615
I couldn't buy cigarettes without my ID.

426
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:47,495
I could never convince them
that I am not a student.

427
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:48,954
They demanded my ID.

428
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,917
That was such a pain, so I quit smoking.

429
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,337
- Then...
- Excuse me.

430
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,229
Why are men like that?

431
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,483
Don't they know they get older, too?

432
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,235
Don't they age?

433
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,529
With so much of an age gap,

434
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,198
how can you even communicate
with each other?

435
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,534
People about the same age can.

436
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:29,286
You like younger women that much?

437
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:31,830
No?

438
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,716
You always had something to say.

439
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,010
You always pick on little things.

440
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,929
Now you're quiet.

441
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:50,558
Tell me. Are all men like that?

442
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,602
You want the truth?

443
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,229
You'll be disappointed.

444
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:57,648
Okay.

445
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,279
Men are...

446
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,365
By nature, it is very likely that...

447
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,909
Stop. I don't want to hear it.

448
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,677
Get some fresh air and sober up.

449
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,388
Please.

450
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,268
What should I do?

451
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,440
I need to pee.

452
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,778
I need to pee.

453
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,561
- Bathroom...
- Are you okay?

454
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:51,655
Why are you following me?
Keep watch for me. Hurry.

455
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,116
Don't look this way.

456
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,826
<i>It was the first time</i>

457
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,787
<i>waking up without thinking about him</i>
<i>in a long time.</i>

458
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,291
<i>What should I do?</i>

459
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,002
I need to pee.

460
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,723
I'm out of my mind.

461
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,812
I must be crazy!

462
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,858
What do I do?

463
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,904
<i>- Almost there, I hit every red light.</i>
<i>- My cat turned off my alarm.</i>

464
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,031
<i>The subway is way too slow today.</i>

465
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,784
<i>I left home on time,</i>
<i>but the bus won't come.</i>

466
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,661
<i>I just woke up.</i>

467
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,343
<i>I'm here.</i>

468
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:19,428
<i>Sang-jin is...</i>

469
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,222
- Good morning, U-ri.
- Hello.

470
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,060
{\an8}<i>Sang-jin is here already.</i>

471
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,438
Looks like they're running late today.

472
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,481
Looks like it.

473
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,115
<i>Good morning.</i>

474
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:43,493
<i>Now that you're late anyway</i>
<i>enjoy the view outside.</i>

475
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:44,870
<i>Look up at the sky too.</i>

476
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,623
{\an8}<i>Please take your time.</i>

477
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,920
Good morning.

478
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,881
Go ahead. The subway had traffic, huh?

479
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,007
Go ahead.

480
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,181
You're here. Keep drinking.

481
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,682
Morning coffee is a must.

482
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,476
- Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

483
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,064
Oh, my.

484
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,317
Getting on time to work
after a get-together...

485
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,446
That's a basic workplace ethic.

486
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,369
You know what I mean?

487
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:26,620
Oh, right.

488
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,456
You always tell us,
"You know what I mean?"

489
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,749
I really have no idea.

490
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,293
You said you have no idea.
You have no idea, huh?

491
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,462
You're late, 'cause you have no idea!

492
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,881
Can a president give a positive evaluation

493
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:39,967
when a basic rule is ignored?

494
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,971
You said I'm an askhole
and I'm super annoying.

495
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:47,057
You do as you please.
You askhole. It's super annoying.

496
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,977
Here I am asking a question
when I won't listen anyway.

497
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,520
Is it my fault?

498
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:55,482
You're not going to be upset
because I said this?

499
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,526
After this is over, will you be upset?

500
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,111
No, I won't.

501
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,946
It's okay to be late.

502
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,700
But you should at least have
the manners to let me know.

503
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,785
That's why communication matters!

504
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,454
Right.

505
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:13,250
You talked already in your group chat.
I'm just talking by myself.

506
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,877
We have our own group chat,
you had no idea, right?

507
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:20,841
Please communicate with me.
I love to communicate.

508
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:24,177
I love communicating.
That's my favorite thing to do, okay?

509
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,596
Su-hyeok.

510
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,348
Why are you so late?

511
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:30,434
Right.

512
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,314
Why?

513
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:39,735
Because I'm tired.

514
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:45,157
Because you're tired?

515
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:51,121
Su-hyeok, we need to talk in my office.

516
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,124
Everyone is tired here.

517
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:55,959
Because you're tired?

518
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:57,878
How could...

519
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:01,131
<i>Is he yelling for us to hear?</i>

520
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:05,635
That's extremely irresponsible.

521
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:09,806
Hey.

522
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:11,892
You're the VP...

523
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,727
<i>He can really hold a grudge.</i>

524
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,646
<i>I told you we should</i>
<i>take it easy during the casual talk.</i>

525
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,815
<i>Killjoy is resentful again.</i>

526
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,694
This is not our group chat!

527
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:26,490
Submit a report explaining
why you were late!

528
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:36,500
What is this?

529
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,004
It's all deleted.

530
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:43,924
Are you curious?

531
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,593
You want me to tell you?

532
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,470
Forget it.

533
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:54,476
You're making it so obvious.

534
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,521
- Why did you have to go that far?
- They said it was obvious?

535
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:01,483
What else could I do?
Employee discipline is at its lowest.

536
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,026
I have to set it right.

537
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,529
Why did you have to be late?

538
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,532
Want me to tell you again?
'Cause I'm tired.

539
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,493
I was so exhausted that I had nightmares

540
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,286
and had sleep paralysis.

541
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,163
Why are you so tired?

542
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,833
Did Deborah get really drunk last night?

543
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:18,959
Did she make a scene?

544
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:23,797
Forget it.

545
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,550
Just give me a raise, at least.

546
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,260
Or give me more shares.

547
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:32,430
Su-hyeok, I know
you and I are close friends,

548
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:37,477
but you can't just bombard me with
a request for a pay raise or more shares.

549
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:41,731
Whatever, give me a raise
of 50,000 won at least.

550
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,317
It's so emotionally draining.

551
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,778
Well then...

552
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:56,163
<i>Who said embarrassment lasts</i>
<i>only for a moment?</i>

553
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:22,522
Look at that.

554
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:25,942
It's what I told you about.
It's so gorgeous in person, right?

555
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,242
Did you wash down the street?

556
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,579
You didn't have to. Thank you.

557
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,040
Some dogs peed everywhere at the entrance.

558
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,666
I wish they peed in one spot.

559
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,210
What could we do?

560
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,630
They're dogs after all.
If they peed in a potty, they'd be human.

561
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,846
What do I do, Yu-jeong?

562
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:58,016
I became a dog.

563
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,310
What do I do?

564
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:05,815
<i>So what?</i>

565
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:09,736
- "So what?"
- He kept watch for you, he didn't see you.

566
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:13,990
He must have thought
you were throwing up in the corner.

567
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,326
You think so?

568
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,123
Hey, that's ridiculous.

569
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,833
Are you insane?

570
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,461
How drunk were you?
How can you pee on the street?

571
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,132
Jeez.

572
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,009
I didn't drink that much...

573
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:34,761
I just...

574
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:37,347
That's because you were upset.

575
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,100
Forget it, there's no use
crying over spilled urine...

576
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:42,560
There's no use.

577
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:45,146
Just think that
the worst is over before moving.

578
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,482
But how?

579
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,277
How can I ever face him again?

580
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,947
You must be insane.

581
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:56,283
What?

582
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,577
JINLEE PUBLISHING
LEE SU-HYEOK

583
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,665
Just pick it up.
It's even worse if you don't.

584
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,917
No, I can't.

585
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,085
No.

586
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,171
What if he calls me again?

587
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,967
Right, I'll just text him in advance
that I can't talk on the phone, right?

588
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:17,220
What should I say?

589
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:20,765
- Just be professional and say...
- Hang on.

590
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:22,225
- I...
- I...

591
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:24,394
- am...
- am...

592
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:31,067
<i>I am still sleeping,</i>
<i>so I can't answer the phone.</i>

593
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:33,111
<i>I'll call you back when I'm available.</i>

594
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:42,412
By the way, if I'm sleeping,
how did I text him?

595
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:43,955
That's the point.

596
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:45,415
What?

597
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:51,296
Lee Yu-jeong!

598
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,050
Hey, it's okay.

599
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:58,428
It should be enough for him
to understand how embarrassed you are.

600
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,681
He'll take a hint
and won't call you for a while.

601
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,434
He can't take a hint.

602
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:07,896
He doesn't seem like the type.

603
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,526
<i>Called to confirm the meeting schedule.</i>

604
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,945
<i>I know you can't check this</i>
<i>as you're sleeping.</i>

605
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:17,697
<i>Please call me back.</i>

606
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,498
You're right.

607
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,335
You have no choice.

608
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:33,254
You'll see him at some point.
How long can you avoid him?

609
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,382
I'll avoid him as long as I can.

610
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:38,468
I'm going nuts.

611
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:46,226
I didn't know embarrassment
can be so powerful.

612
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:50,980
I woke up this morning,

613
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:54,359
and for the first time,
I didn't think about Ju-wan.

614
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,948
My heart used to sink
every morning when I woke up.

615
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,951
I could barely move.

616
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,162
Had I known this,

617
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:09,082
I would have peed on the street
sooner for closure.

618
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,042
Good for you.

619
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:13,336
Good for you. You did amazing last night.

620
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,047
How about peeing again today?

621
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,299
Together this time?

622
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:23,847
- You're crazy.
- Let's do it.

623
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,349
So crazy.

624
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:30,353
Anyways, you're seriously
jinxed these days.

625
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:33,690
For moving, pick a day when evil spirits
don't wander around.

626
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,109
You know the drill.
Take your rice cooker first.

627
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:39,237
There's no such thing as evil spirits.

628
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,448
I think there is.

629
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,825
Haven't you ever had that feeling?

630
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:51,791
A feeling like there is
somebody else with us.

631
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:54,627
I can feel it.

632
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,297
Somewhere really close...

633
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,506
Is that real?

634
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,431
Since when were you here, Iron Squad?

635
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,767
Well... Just now.

636
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:10,935
Just now?

637
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,689
By the way, can I ask you a question?

638
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:16,941
What is it?

639
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,655
Dating advice? I don't do that anymore.

640
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:28,995
Just hear him out once.
He met the girl he's destined to be with.

641
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:42,592
When we first met, I knew it was destiny
that brought us together.

642
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:43,760
<i>I went to a club.</i>

643
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,137
<i>Everything got dark. I could see only her.</i>

644
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:48,473
I've never seen such a beautiful person.

645
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,476
My heart was pounding like crazy.
I didn't know what to do.

646
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,102
Can I get your phone number?

647
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:56,814
She gave me her number.
So I got it, I got out of the club alone.

648
00:46:56,898 --> 00:47:00,235
<i>I saw her arguing in front of a motel</i>
<i>with some guy.</i>

649
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,820
<i>We ran into each other twice.</i>

650
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:04,280
<i>I knew it was destiny.</i>

651
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:06,115
<i>I kept reaching out to her.</i>

652
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,409
<i>You're one more text away</i>
<i>from being blocked.</i>

653
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,577
Still,

654
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:12,038
I still have one more chance.

655
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,749
That was her last message.

656
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,042
Okay.

657
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:21,256
So this girl you're destined to be with
gave you her number at the club.

658
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,759
She said she'd block you
if you text her one more time.

659
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:30,098
And you interpreted that
as having one chance left?

660
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:31,349
Yes.

661
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:37,397
You're one rare happy boy, Iron Squad.

662
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:41,693
One last chance.

663
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,404
How can I express my feelings to her?

664
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:49,993
Well...

665
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:56,583
How about we do not use
that one chance and save it?

666
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,418
What?

667
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:01,963
If it's really destiny,
you're bound to meet again, right?

668
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,968
But I think I should still reach...

669
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:12,098
Drawn by irresistible destiny,
you get closer,

670
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,309
and end up meeting each other.

671
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,352
That is real destiny.

672
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,438
Right.

673
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,356
Yes.

674
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:22,442
That is true.

675
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:26,487
So, don't try anything. Nothing at all.

676
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,447
Please.

677
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:37,457
- What?
<i>- Are you going to be late?</i>

678
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,375
<i>I'm about to order tteokbokki.</i>

679
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,712
I'll be back in a bit.

680
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,923
Understood?

681
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:49,135
Your destiny is always nearby.

682
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:51,429
I see.

683
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:06,402
<i>She said she had a feeling that</i>

684
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:10,365
there's somebody else here.

685
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,158
Yu-jeong did?

686
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,159
Yes.

687
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:16,788
Can't I just tell her that
I've been living here?

688
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,248
I'm so anxious.

689
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:25,088
To tell her you live here,
we'd have to reveal this space.

690
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,096
Still, I think we need to tell her.

691
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,014
If we get caught, then...

692
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:36,849
I know, right? I have to.

693
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:40,728
I'm going to wait
till she's in a good mood and tell her.

694
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,107
- When would that be?
- So...

695
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,822
- Goal!
- Goal!

696
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:12,051
- Isn't it heavy?
- No.

697
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,179
This is everything, right?

698
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:16,556
- Yes.
- Yes.

699
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:20,184
A NICE DAY TO MOVE

700
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,697
<i>Something moving and breakups</i>
<i>have in common.</i>

701
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:39,203
<i>Though I want to procrastinate,</i>
<i>the day comes near anyway.</i>

702
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,832
<i>There are endless things</i>
<i>I have to get rid of.</i>

703
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,753
<i>It's hard to say goodbye</i>
<i>to the things I'm used to.</i>

704
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:49,714
<i>It's sad to see memories disappear.</i>

705
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:53,593
<i>It's scary to adjust to</i>
<i>what I'm not used to.</i>

706
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:03,478
Let's go now, Bo-ra.

707
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:05,188
Let's go.

708
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,124
That's your room.

709
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,794
<i>I have to think about</i>
<i>how to fill the space</i>

710
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:30,713
<i>after working hard to empty it out.</i>

711
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:32,173
- TV, right?
- Yes, it is.

712
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,966
Please put it right there.

713
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:34,884
Okay.

714
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,136
- Where does the desk go?
- To the left...

715
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,138
<i>Even if I get help from someone,</i>

716
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:41,808
<i>- it is my job to do after all.</i>
- Oh, yes, there.

717
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:51,609
<i>And once I manage to get it done,</i>

718
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,153
<i>I don't want to</i>
<i>go through the trouble again.</i>

719
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:05,748
Yu-jeong.

720
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:07,708
Are you done moving?

721
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,710
<i>There's no end in sight.</i>

722
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:13,506
There are so many things to do
and so much stuff to buy.

723
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,176
What is it?
Are you asking for a moving day gift?

724
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:18,845
What do you need?

725
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:21,305
<i>Don't worry about it. It's you and me.</i>

726
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,057
- Clean up when you're done.
- Okay.

727
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,268
<i>If you need an excuse,</i>
<i>have a housewarming.</i>

728
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:27,937
<i>- That could work.</i>
- I didn't buy this house.

729
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,230
A housewarming, my foot.

730
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:34,527
Right, if you want a present,
you need an event to justify it.

731
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,903
Right?

732
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:40,283
That was genius of me, right? Bye.

733
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:42,994
Hey.

734
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:44,871
What was that?

735
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,832
I'm going out to meet a source,
then I'll go straight home.

736
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:48,749
Okay.

737
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,710
- Tell them if anyone asks.
- Okay.

738
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,011
I'm back.

739
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,971
Hey, come on over.

740
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,056
Let's have dinner.

741
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:09,228
JUNE 13, YU-JEONG'S BIRTHDAY

742
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:11,772
OCTOBER 9, WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

743
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:13,232
FEBRUARY 9, FIRST KISS

744
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:16,152
BUT TODAY IS OCTOBER 7TH...

745
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,656
What's the occasion?

746
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:26,746
You forgot what it is?

747
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,667
Today is that day.

748
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,212
Today is...

749
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:41,969
Right, today is the day
when we bought matching T-shirts

750
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,429
before our first trip.

751
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,682
Right, the day
we bought matching T-shirts.

752
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:48,517
You remember that?

753
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:53,147
It was our first time buying
a matching item.

754
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,566
It's so meaningful.

755
00:53:56,025 --> 00:54:00,321
That's why I put this party together.

756
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,116
What do I do?

757
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,661
I didn't prepare anything.

758
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,497
The bar was so busy today.

759
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,123
Don't worry.

760
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,043
I figured that...

761
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:20,091
So I bought a present myself.

762
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:21,842
What is it?

763
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,053
Did you buy a purse?

764
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:25,721
Yes.

765
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:28,474
I bought a knockoff.

766
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:32,228
The real one is too expensive.
Even a knockoff is expensive.

767
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,605
Eat up already. It's going to get cold.

768
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:35,690
A knockoff?

769
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:39,402
Why would you buy a knockoff?
Give it to me, I'll throw it away.

770
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:40,778
I'm okay.

771
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,489
- How could you buy this?
- Hang on!

772
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,116
- No!
- I'm so sad.

773
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,076
Don't touch my bag!

774
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,211
You said it's a knockoff.

775
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,048
Fine!

776
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:03,551
I bought one because I wanted it.

777
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:06,262
Others get one
for their wives every so often.

778
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:09,348
You never did, so I bought it myself!

779
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:12,184
I do make money, too.
Can't I buy this as I please?

780
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:14,395
Should I walk on eggshells for this?

781
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,899
No, you did well.

782
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:22,194
You deserve it.
I should have bought one for you.

783
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:23,988
I'm sorry.

784
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,198
Let me see. Let's try it on.

785
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:29,785
So pretty.

786
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:32,121
Try it on. Like this?

787
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:37,960
Looks great on you.

788
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:40,212
Wear this on our date on the weekend.

789
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,299
Come on...

790
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:45,509
Jin-woo.

791
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:47,845
Do you have anything you want?

792
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:51,223
You are all I need.

793
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:52,600
I'm really okay.

794
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:57,063
You look so handsome today.

795
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:58,230
Babe.

796
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,524
Shall we clean up the table?

797
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:01,525
Do it here?

798
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:05,237
I'm hungry. Let's eat first.

799
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:06,155
Okay.

800
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,157
Let's eat.

801
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,077
- It's so cute, right?
- Super cute.

802
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:14,497
- Here.
- Okay.

803
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,334
Help yourself. You can have it all.

804
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:20,377
I will.

805
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,255
What should I eat first?

806
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:25,800
Jin-woo, then...

807
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,636
She must be in a good mood today.

808
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,638
Not just good.

809
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,181
She looked so happy.

810
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:33,182
Really?

811
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:40,689
Did you tell her that I live here?

812
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:42,358
Nope.

813
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:43,901
What?

814
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:47,696
She looked so happy
that I couldn't ruin it.

815
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:52,076
- Really?
- Yeah.

816
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:57,456
<i>Young Radish!</i>

817
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:05,047
{\an8}<i>I think I'll be 15 minutes early.</i>

818
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:06,882
<i>I'll be waiting for you.</i>

819
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:08,300
<i>Okay.</i>

820
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:42,209
Are you Young Radish?

821
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:43,919
- No.
- I see.

822
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:08,110
Was it you who bothered me
to get a discount?

823
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:09,153
Yes.

824
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:10,863
Now, do you believe it?

825
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,532
I told you. We are destined.

826
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:15,159
Destined, my foot.

827
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,622
Did you think a lot about me?

828
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:22,291
I did.

829
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,919
Every time I pass by this bus station,

830
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:29,006
and from time to time,
all day long on some days.

831
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,591
- Hey.
- Here.

832
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:31,550
Whatever.

833
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:33,344
This is done. I'm leaving now.

834
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,387
And I have a boyfriend.

835
00:58:35,763 --> 00:58:37,389
You don't have a boyfriend.

836
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:41,268
You said you're selling this
at a bargain after a breakup.

837
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:42,186
What?

838
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:43,938
You said so.

839
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:48,317
Wait.

840
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:52,905
When will you believe we're destined?
If we meet again, will you believe?

841
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:54,865
Why would I meet you again?

842
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:57,910
I mean, if we run into each other again,

843
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,829
then you must go out with me.

844
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:03,457
Because it means
we're meant to be together.

845
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,293
Don't talk to me like we're close.

846
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,588
Why not?

847
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,131
Whatever.

848
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:13,676
Promise me, okay?

849
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:17,137
If we do, you must go out with me, okay?

850
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,514
Suit yourself.

851
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:23,560
Don't follow me, or I'll kill you.

852
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,275
Slow down. You're going to fall.

853
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:30,442
I won't follow you.

854
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:33,904
Because we're going to meet again
through destiny.

855
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,281
See you soon!

856
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,954
What's wrong with him?

857
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:55,884
{\an8}WRITER DEBORAH

858
01:00:00,556 --> 01:00:02,975
What kind of excuse will she make today?

859
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:06,562
<i>Ms. Yeon...</i>

860
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:07,938
<i>Due to moving,</i>

861
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:10,774
<i>I think I'm going to be busy</i>
<i>for a few days.</i>

862
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:12,693
I see.

863
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:13,986
Moving is important.

864
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,321
Ms. Yeon?

865
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,825
<i>I think I'm coming down with something</i>
<i>after moving.</i>

866
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:25,122
Okay, I understand.

867
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:28,042
<i>My mom sent me kimchi.</i>

868
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:32,838
<i>I have to wait for the package</i>
<i>so it's not over-fermented.</i>

869
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,382
Sure, kimchi is important.

870
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:38,093
Okay. I understand.

871
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:40,804
You pulled a muscle in your neck?

872
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,849
I knew that'd happen around today.

873
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:45,851
In that case...

874
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:50,981
A virtual video conference?

875
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:55,027
We don't need to meet in person
for a meeting.

876
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,947
Right.

877
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,867
<i>I will call you back via my laptop.</i>

878
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,285
Right now?

879
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:06,872
Oh, boy.

880
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:12,628
What do I do?

881
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,226
Did you get badly hurt?
What did the doctor say?

882
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:29,853
No need to speak.

883
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:32,272
We can postpone our meeting if it's hard.

884
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:37,736
So talking doesn't bother me,

885
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,780
but I look like a mess, right?

886
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:49,706
<i>It's a big house!</i>

887
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,543
Why are you together?

888
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:53,585
We met out front.

889
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,090
I brought tons of stuff you like.

890
01:01:58,465 --> 01:01:59,633
<i>Wait a moment, please.</i>

891
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:05,472
You did some legwork. What a nice house!

892
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,266
It's a lucky day too.

893
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:10,102
How much legwork did you do to get this?

894
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:11,979
What's all this?

895
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,982
What do you think it is?
We're having a housewarming.

896
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,526
<i>Housewarming? No way!</i>

897
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:19,153
<i>I quit drinking.</i>

898
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:22,489
As if. A skunk can't quit farting.

899
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:25,242
Did you hear how your sister
got drunk like a skunk?

900
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,035
- No. What happened?
- That's your room?

901
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,579
Goodness.

902
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,330
So nice!

903
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:32,958
I can't do a housewarming.

904
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,587
- I was in the middle of something.
- What is with you?

905
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:38,630
What?

906
01:02:38,714 --> 01:02:39,965
What were you doing?

907
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:46,763
You were watching some good stuff
by yourself again.

908
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:49,266
<i>Let's watch it together.</i>

909
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,059
- No!
- Let's see.

910
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,897
This actor looks familiar.

911
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:58,358
<i>Hello.</i>

912
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,153
Su-hyeok.

913
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,075
You're the guy
from the police station, right?

914
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:08,702
<i>Hello.</i>

915
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:11,038
How are you doing?

916
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,956
I'm doing well.

917
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,542
- Hello.
- What's wrong with you?

918
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:18,337
<i>We're having a housewarming today,</i>
<i>you should come.</i>

919
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,796
<i>Yes, please do.</i>

920
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:24,176
He looks really nice on-screen.

921
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:25,719
Well...

922
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:29,097
This won't work today. Bye now.

923
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:31,183
Why? What do you think you're doing?

924
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:35,229
<i>Su-hyeok, sorry to interrupt your meeting.</i>
<i>Silly me again.</i>

925
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,898
<i>Why are you wearing this here?</i>

926
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,358
<i>There you go.</i>

927
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:43,445
<i>Want to eat something?</i>
<i>Continue your meeting.</i>

928
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:45,489
<i>What should we eat?</i>

929
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:53,956
I've got a bad connection.

930
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:37,749
TRUE TO LOVE

931
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,042
<i>Do you have a girlfriend?</i>

932
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,794
{\an8}- How about my sister...
- Hey.

933
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,212
{\an8}<i>Thanks for coming today.</i>

934
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:43,714
{\an8}<i>- And for the gift.</i>
<i>- How's it?</i>

935
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,716
{\an8}<i>Fun. Weird in a fun way.</i>

936
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,968
{\an8}I'm going to tell her on our first date.

937
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:50,053
{\an8}- Tell her what?
<i>- That I love her.</i>

938
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:51,597
{\an8}<i>How about an event in public?</i>

939
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,806
{\an8}<i>Singing in public...</i>

940
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,516
{\an8}<i>Don't women hate that?</i>

941
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,351
{\an8}- What's your next plan?
- Plan 1.

942
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:57,603
{\an8}I'll break up with him.

943
01:04:57,686 --> 01:05:00,355
{\an8}<i>You'll break up again</i>
<i>and change the last impression?</i>

944
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:02,816
{\an8}<i>I bump into my ex-boyfriend</i>

945
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,359
{\an8}<i>- in a black dress.</i>
- Thanks.

946
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:05,569
{\an8}<i>I look back and smile.</i>

947
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,779
{\an8}<i>I'm having the time of my life</i>
<i>without you.</i>

948
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:09,615
{\an8}- Hi.
<i>- Ever since I met you,</i>

949
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:11,742
{\an8}<i>tough moments passed by before I knew it.</i>

950
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,328
{\an8}<i>Thanks to you, I think I lost gracefully.</i>

951
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,913
{\an8}<i>I think it was kind of fun, thanks to you.</i>

952
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,832
<i>- Am I?</i>
<i>- Are you not?</i>
