1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,961
TRUE TO LOVE

2
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,956
TRUE TO LOVE

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,499
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,226
{\an8}Yes.

5
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,691
{\an8}<i>I've been trying to reach you
since yesterday.</i>

6
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:04,192
{\an8}<i>You just woke up?</i>

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,360
{\an8}Yes.

8
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:09,072
{\an8}<i>You know today's
an important event, right?</i>

9
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,613
{\an8}<i>You have to do well.
Everybody worked hard on it.</i>

10
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,117
{\an8}Huh? On what?

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,500
{\an8}<i>On what? Hey!
Tonight is the Golden Night party.</i>

12
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,368
<i>Don't tell me you forgot.</i>

13
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,133
No.

14
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,880
I just woke up,
so I wasn't thinking clearly.

15
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,802
Okay. See you later.

16
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:48,315
'Cause you're garbage!
You're stinky, disgusting garbage!

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,780
The garbage is being loaded.

18
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,030
That's right, I'm garbage too.

19
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,872
You are toxic waste
that can't even be recycled.

20
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,369
You really stink.

21
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,121
I'm garbage myself.

22
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:17,814
- Good morning.
- Hello, Sang-jin.

23
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,600
What is this?

24
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,943
What happened?

25
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:27,982
Sang-jin. Despite its great intention,

26
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,935
we reached an agreement
it has many inconveniences.

27
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:31,936
Right, Sang-jin.

28
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,527
We need to focus on work,
but the open plan is too distracting.

29
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:39,825
And it felt weird
facing each other without the partitions.

30
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,620
You know how awkward it is to make
eye contact while yawning?

31
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,509
It's not been long since
the partitions were removed.

32
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,301
How inconvenient could it have been?

33
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,224
How'd you find time to reach an agreement?

34
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:03,175
When you adapt to changes,
you go through a transition period.

35
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:06,516
U-ri?

36
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,481
You agree? Was it uncomfortable?

37
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:13,235
No, I really, really loved it.

38
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,779
Without the partitions,
it was easier to ask questions.

39
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,035
It was easier to catch up
with how everything was going.

40
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,579
Right, U-ri?

41
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:28,212
Hey, that's the benefit I was hoping for
when I got rid of all those with our U-ri

42
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,592
covered in sweat,
but you put it all back up.

43
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:34,262
And when the CEO suggests something,

44
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,760
you are supposed
to be supportive sometimes.

45
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,512
It's like, "You can say your piece,
I'll go my way."

46
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,755
Go where? You got so many places to go?

47
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,980
When I was your age,
I was unconditionally obedient,

48
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,350
did whatever I was told
without a question.

49
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:52,977
You are having it all too easy now.
This is like heaven, you know that?

50
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,899
Have the CEO's office. I'll sit here.

51
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,406
You should work comfortably
in the CEO's office.

52
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,951
I'll go work. Get some rest here.

53
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,457
If you're hungry,
eat or whatever you want.

54
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,999
I'm off. Just lie down.
I'll be standing up.

55
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,974
VP, I need to talk to you.

56
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,799
Why am I so out of breath?

57
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,304
Sit down. Why are you up?
Your legs must be tired.

58
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,599
He meant well, right?

59
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,725
Sit, sit.

60
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,225
He meant well.

61
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,445
"Our U-ri."

62
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,338
You were like a condescending geezer.

63
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,750
Those who hold a grudge

64
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,968
for something they made the person do.

65
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,588
Exactly like that.

66
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,675
"When I was your age,
I was unconditionally obedient."

67
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,811
That was so off-putting.

68
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,638
Seriously?

69
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:09,314
You wanted me to remind you
when you act like one.

70
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,103
That's why I'm telling you.

71
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:15,016
Okay, I'm a condescending geezer.
That's me. So what?

72
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,324
I thought you didn't know.

73
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,742
Seriously...

74
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:31,123
By the way,
we need to take it as a "no," right?

75
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,917
When you have a blind date,
no call for three days is a "no."

76
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,133
Look at how many days it has been.

77
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,637
"An offer you can't refuse"?

78
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,902
What is this? Spam mail?

79
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,400
That's how confident I feel
about the contract.

80
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,903
But that's not the point.

81
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,855
She told me to send a contract
as if she'd sign it right away.

82
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,827
She doesn't check emails.
She's unreachable.

83
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,405
Goodness.

84
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,365
You can't get a hold of her?

85
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,415
She ignores my texts,

86
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,789
her phone was off
when I called after email.

87
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,626
And she hasn't called me back.

88
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,841
She's straight up ghosting me.

89
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,183
She must have her own reasons.
Wait a little longer.

90
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,894
What is it?

91
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,637
Hey, you know something, right?

92
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:37,233
You followed her to give her phone back.
Did something happen that day?

93
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,855
Like what?

94
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,318
Bo-ra, Bo-ra...

95
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,953
Wipe your lips first.

96
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,462
<i>You saw everything, right?</i>

97
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:01,166
Any signs of backstabbing

98
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,548
or...

99
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:08,175
- Did you do anything wrong?
- I didn't.

100
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,352
We switched the phones and I came back.

101
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,941
For now, it is a "no."

102
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,572
But is it because
she's testing the waters?

103
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,110
Or is it because she already signed
with another company?

104
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,565
I need to know to plan my next step.

105
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,791
I'm getting a headache.

106
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:37,618
Seriously. Yeon Bo-ra.

107
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,748
It's a "no" either way.

108
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,955
Let's move on and try something else.

109
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,796
No.

110
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,929
{\an8}It's been a while
I felt challenged like this.

111
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,598
{\an8}I will get her signature no matter what.

112
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,518
Let's go.

113
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,685
Go where?

114
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,750
It's tonight.

115
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,308
Champagnes are provided by the sponsor.

116
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,651
- Make this straight.
- Okay.

117
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,569
Did you check the cue sheet?

118
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,741
Yes, all checked.
We're checking up on Deborah.

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,460
You look so gorgeous today.

120
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,753
I thought there was an actress in here.

121
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,877
Right back at you.

122
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,126
Anna Wintour would be intimidated by you.

123
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,468
You look really stylish.

124
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,642
Give it to me.

125
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,678
I heard you got proposed to.

126
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,187
Congrats on your engagement.

127
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,349
Congratulations.

128
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,896
Congratulations.

129
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,492
Of course, marriage is a crazy thing.

130
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:35,117
But, it won't hurt
to do a crazy thing once in your life.

131
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,870
It calls for a celebration.

132
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,156
I appreciate it.

133
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:45,093
Oscar de Rang wants to do
a wedding dress shoot with you.

134
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:49,258
Among the dresses you try in the shoot
they'll sponsor the one you like.

135
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,129
You know, Oscar de Rang, right?

136
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,140
- I'm so jealous!
- Awesome.

137
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,680
Really?

138
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,603
I'll be really honored.

139
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,143
How did I land this?

140
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:05,896
I was talking with the PR manager,
who turned out to be your fan.

141
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,901
So I mentioned that you...

142
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,986
Was I not supposed to mention it
before the announcement?

143
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,912
No, I don't mind that at all.

144
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,083
Right?

145
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:24,503
Once this issue is out,
everybody will know anyway.

146
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,298
Now, before the party begins,
shall we have a toast?

147
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,628
Sounds good.

148
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,856
It's time to go.

149
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,357
- Let's go.
- Okay.

150
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:51,692
Good luck, Bo-ra.

151
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,777
- I'll look forward to it.
- Thanks.

152
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,112
You can do it.

153
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,009
Did you eat anything?

154
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,595
Did you take some medicine
after eating something?

155
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,939
Did you get any sleep?

156
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,400
Yu-jeong, can't you
just say, "nice dress"?

157
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,315
You look nice.

158
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,485
Good luck.

159
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,966
Our concept today is classy best friends.

160
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,434
Let's look mannerly
and politely offer champagne.

161
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,805
You know what I mean?

162
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,482
You do know why we are here
and who invited us?

163
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,232
I do.

164
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,320
What are you doing? Let's go.

165
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,415
- She smiled at me.
- Who?

166
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:26,176
Looks like you forgot the dress code
as you were busy looking stunning.

167
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,974
I see no champagne gold.

168
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,061
I do have champagne gold.

169
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,027
I missed that, since you are so gorgeous.

170
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,831
Behind you.

171
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,130
Long time no see, Su-hyeok.

172
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:10,602
People are staring at us to see
how the divorced couple say hi.

173
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,351
Smile and say hi.

174
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:21,356
It's been a while. Have you been well?

175
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,907
Thanks for inviting us.

176
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,119
Well...

177
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,369
You think it was me who invited you?

178
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,667
Anyway, you took the trouble

179
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,877
to come all the way here. Thank you.

180
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,176
No problem.

181
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,506
You look well. You look really pretty.

182
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,507
Don't.

183
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:51,849
Yes, ma'am.

184
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,829
Deborah, please standby.

185
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,834
- Okay.
- Okay.

186
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,455
Golden Night, a party for Gold Misses.

187
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,927
Tonight, we have a guest speaker
who'll give the Gold Misses tips

188
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,469
on how to win in a relationship.

189
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:31,222
The dating expert that is winning
in her own relationship!

190
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,016
She is Korea's first and top dating coach.

191
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,850
Please welcome to the stage Deborah.
Music, cue!

192
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,686
Deborah, please standby.

193
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,526
Okay.

194
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,822
EP 04
CRAZIER THAN JOKER

195
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,053
<i>At that moment,
I felt a strong urge to tell those</i>

196
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,880
<i>who believed that Santa
will come on Christmas</i>

197
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,007
<i>if they are nice and don't cry...</i>

198
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:39,676
<i>that Santa Claus does not exist.</i>

199
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,813
Deborah?

200
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:53,985
<i>As long as I am worthy,
as long as my mojo is still present,</i>

201
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,158
<i>nothing will go wrong with my love life.</i>

202
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:02,924
<i>Even if that's not the case,
it's okay to break up or be alone.</i>

203
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:09,962
<i>And someday, I'll be recognized by someone
and love less and be loved more.</i>

204
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,719
<i>He'll eventually
get down on one knee with a ring</i>

205
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,683
<i>and we will have a happy ending.</i>

206
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,314
<i>I ought to tell
those who have this belief,</i>

207
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,559
<i>there is no such thing as Santa
nor happy endings.</i>

208
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,816
JU-WAN

209
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:41,701
<i>Your call has been forwarded to voicemail
and will be charged after the beep.</i>

210
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,630
JU-WAN

211
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,839
<i>After all, promises get broken,</i>

212
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:57,505
<i>love changes, and men leave.</i>

213
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:02,225
<i>A woman is a woman's worst enemy,
a woman you know at that.</i>

214
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,653
<i>I have to tell the truth.</i>

215
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,765
<i>I ought to.</i>

216
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,575
A party for Gold Misses...

217
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,080
Welcome to Golden Night,
ladies and gentlemen.

218
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:30,269
By the way,
what's the point of being a Gold Miss?

219
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,775
It's no match for a Diamond Miss.

220
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,200
Why don't we be honest here?

221
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,535
Wearing a ring on a ring finger
on the left hand,

222
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,619
having a diamond ring there

223
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:53,585
means there's nothing to worry about
even if you go broke or lose your job.

224
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:58,545
It also means you're free from
guy problems or the pain of breakups.

225
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,215
Still, we haven't been able to do that

226
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,563
and are still called "Gold Miss."

227
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,730
We are losers.

228
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,310
We need to admit our failure first, right?

229
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,229
What?

230
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,935
Is this not what you were
expecting to hear?

231
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,985
Then what is it that
you wanted me to tell you?

232
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:28,204
It's okay to be alone?

233
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,368
You're so okay with being alone,

234
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,996
you wear high heels,
holding your head up high

235
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,044
curving guys with lots of attitude.

236
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:39,258
Then why do you highlight things
in my books, read my column,

237
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,550
cry and lose sleep over a guy all the time

238
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,215
and send me your stories seeking advice?

239
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,184
"Is this flirting?"

240
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,805
"Is it just me?"

241
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,851
"Does he even love me?"

242
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,912
You're okay being alone? As if.

243
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:11,254
You're scared and lonely 'cause
you think you might end up alone forever.

244
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,378
If not, why don't you extend your lease
no longer than a year?

245
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,840
You can't have a haircut as you like,
you reluctantly attend all the weddings,

246
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,842
you can't cut ties with friends.

247
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:27,354
Why do you keep holding off big decisions?

248
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,390
'Cause he will show up one day
and put a diamond ring on your finger?

249
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,936
Are you waiting for that?

250
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,732
Gold Miss, my foot.

251
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:41,319
Until we get married,
we just live an incomplete life.

252
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,492
An incomplete life
awaiting a complete life!

253
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,789
What else?

254
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,626
What else do you want to know?

255
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,011
How to hit on a guy?

256
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,009
When you think it's too late,
it's already too late.

257
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:07,012
You should have found a guy
when you were younger.

258
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:12,385
All the decent guys
are already taken by younger ones.

259
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,055
We got nothing.

260
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:20,074
So if an unattractive,
ugly, old guy likes you,

261
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,899
just date him.

262
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,395
Go date him.

263
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,533
- What's she doing?
- Or...

264
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,615
Or...

265
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,410
get plastic surgery, facial fillers,
or shave down some bone.

266
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,076
Do something.

267
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,207
Now!

268
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:43,259
Shall we talk about men?

269
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,470
Men.

270
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,601
All men are...

271
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,154
bastards!

272
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,645
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

273
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,395
Let me try again.

274
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,949
Deborah says!

275
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:16,747
Men are bastards!

276
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,831
What is she saying?

277
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,126
Get her off stage!

278
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,209
Why do you call men bastards? Why?

279
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:29,085
At first, they follow you around
like a little puppy,

280
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:33,757
but when another girl is nice to them,
they smooch that girl, those bastards.

281
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,349
- Did I cross the line?
- Turn off the microphone.

282
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,436
- Turn it off.
- There.

283
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,770
Guess what they call us
if they feel unheard!

284
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,816
They call us bitches. Bitches!

285
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,990
Don't just stand there. Go do something.

286
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,649
Come on, do something.

287
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:51,618
Even a pro dog trainer
can't fix those bastards.

288
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,489
Put on some music! Louder!

289
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,946
Bastards.

290
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,078
The most terrible bastard was...

291
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,326
Music, cue!

292
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:05,167
Everybody is leaving. Do something!

293
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,755
Louder!

294
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,025
<i>I thought my life was a tragedy,</i>

295
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,448
<i>but it was a comedy.</i>

296
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:29,012
<i>I wish someone would come
and take me to anywhere but here.</i>

297
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,217
<i>I wish I could become smaller than an ant</i>

298
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,762
<i>and be carried outside.</i>

299
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:08,938
Put me down, please.

300
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,161
Don't follow me.

301
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,724
It's my second time seeing that back.

302
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,103
Yes, Yu-jeong.

303
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:15,355
It's near the back door.

304
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,526
Yes.

305
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:31,122
- Hello.
- We're terribly sorry.

306
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,289
- We'll take the...
- Yes, sir...

307
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh, that was...

308
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,125
The incident was something
we failed to expect.

309
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Once again,
we apologize for the inconvenience.

310
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,217
We're sorry.

311
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,260
I'm going nuts.

312
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,688
You're here, ma'am.

313
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,194
You look like Meryl Streep today.

314
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:04,067
Yes, I think I'm going to be the devil.

315
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:06,866
Gather around, everyone.

316
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,529
Come along.

317
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,463
So what's the status?

318
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,960
We're jammed with complaints,

319
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,961
not only from the guests
but also the sponsors and advertisers.

320
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,005
Fortunately, no one said
they'll pull back their ads.

321
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,256
Just not yet.

322
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:29,432
These days, even a small incident
instantly leads to a boycott.

323
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,523
What kind of advertiser would put an ad

324
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,439
in a magazine
with column of a controversial figure?

325
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,560
I just checked.

326
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,815
The next issue has already been printed.

327
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,531
Deborah.

328
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,202
How can she screw me over?

329
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,332
I let her jump on the bandwagon,

330
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,410
but she repays me by ruining everything?

331
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,844
Why did she do that?
Let me hear the reason.

332
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,259
Why are you all looking at me?

333
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,353
What do you mean? You're her best friend.

334
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,008
Is it because she was drunk?

335
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,346
Or has she gone insane
preparing for the wedding?

336
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,353
Are you sure she was drunk?
She wasn't high?

337
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,356
How would I know?

338
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:24,033
There are various kinds
of friendship between women.

339
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,239
You know, it could be
just shallow and superficial.

340
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:31,371
We aren't close enough
to pour our hearts out to each other.

341
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,553
What the fuck...

342
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,513
<i>Good morning.</i>

343
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,637
Don't put anyone through.
Call the security manager stat.

344
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,109
Sir.

345
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,240
Amp up the number of security guards,
if needed,

346
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,948
to prevent outsiders from entering. Okay?

347
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,870
And remember this photo.

348
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,489
This person.

349
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,871
{\an8}- Call right away if you see her, okay?
- Yes, sir.

350
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,506
{\an8}Even I feel hurt.

351
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,130
{\an8}- This isn't the end.
- Really?

352
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:31,926
{\an8}Who do you think it is?

353
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,260
{\an8}- Vice president?
- It is. It's Su-hyeok.

354
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:40,893
So manly.

355
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,571
A knight in shining armor.

356
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,951
- So cool.
- And handsome.

357
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,909
Amazing!

358
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,319
<i>A flasher's big picture
to show her panties?</i>

359
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:55,328
<i>Not impressive.</i>

360
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,751
<i>She's a parasite obsessed with a man.</i>

361
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,712
The video is going viral,
the Internet is flooded with articles,

362
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,759
and the intensity
and speed of the hate comments...

363
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:12,089
{\an8}Even a traitor
wouldn't be criticized this much.

364
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,256
{\an8}And it's so cruel.

365
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,974
Even if she did something wrong,
how can they bash one person this hard?

366
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,726
Like what they say
in the comments isn't crass.

367
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,609
She makes a living
by using her celebrity status.

368
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,188
It's the price for fame.

369
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,227
That's not fair.

370
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,437
She works hard too.

371
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,816
Why are her tax
and exchange rates different?

372
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,414
Rightfully so.

373
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,449
'Cause she touched an extremely
sensitive issue in Korea.

374
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:42,917
Hey, why did you jump on the stage
all of a sudden?

375
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,923
'Cause a person collapsed.

376
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,750
She didn't collapse, she just fell.

377
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,745
And when you see a woman fall,

378
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,167
it's good manners to pretend
you didn't notice.

379
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,716
It's super embarrassing.

380
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,394
So what now?

381
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,006
- What?
- Deborah's book.

382
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,556
What are you going to do?

383
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:03,984
As for that...

384
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,734
we need to keep an eye on things for now.

385
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:16,657
How can she come back from this?
It's safe to say she's finished now.

386
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,367
If Deborah calls you, don't answer it.

387
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,254
It'll only make things awkward
for each other, right?

388
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,584
Jeez.

389
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,760
It's not like I said something wrong.

390
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,466
Did I do something wrong?

391
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,790
INFLUENCER DEBORAH

392
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:09,462
UNDER FIRE FOR FOUL LANGUAGE
UNDER THE INFLUENCE IN PUBLIC

393
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,803
{\an8}HURLING OFFENSIVE REMARKS AT THE GUESTS

394
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,300
{\an8}THAT WERE AS INFAMOUS AS POLITICAL BRAWLS

395
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:17,383
DREADFUL DEBORAH SAYS

396
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,257
SAYING MEN ARE BASTARDS AND MOOCHERS

397
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,644
PROVOKING OUTRAGE AMONG MEN

398
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:28,154
<i>Saying there's no Santa
came at a bigger price than I thought.</i>

399
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,686
ALL SPINSTERS THERE
GOT A DAGGER IN THEM.

400
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,981
OTHERS' LOVE STORIES
WAS HER MONEY-SPINNER.

401
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,407
Who is it?

402
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,042
It's me.

403
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:30,578
Hey.

404
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,293
How is she doing?

405
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,707
I don't know.
She won't come out of the room.

406
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,352
You still hungover?

407
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,561
Get up already.

408
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,650
Hey. Come on.

409
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,532
Did you see the articles?

410
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:03,615
In the morning.

411
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:10,964
They say I hate men
and I hate women as well.

412
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:16,344
I was thinking what kind of person I am

413
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,970
if I hate both men and women.

414
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,927
What could it be? A public enemy.

415
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,930
It's not the time for this.
It's really serious.

416
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:29,772
Signing a petition?

417
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,814
Look how far it got in just half a day.

418
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:36,614
This is blowing out of proportion.
At this rate...

419
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:42,952
When you say one word wrong
you get buried in no time these days.

420
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,660
And you didn't say just one word.

421
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,834
I should have dragged you
off the stage yesterday.

422
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,251
I should have knocked you
in the head and made you pass out.

423
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,714
I shouldn't have let you say all that.

424
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,798
Yes, you should have.

425
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,127
Hey.

426
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,795
New articles keep coming up in real time.

427
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:07,095
MOM'S CHICKEN F&B'S FULL STATEMENT

428
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,179
What is it?

429
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,215
What?

430
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,687
In this situation?

431
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,440
- What?
- How can he do this in this situation?

432
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,726
He didn't even call you, right?

433
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,952
{\an8}<i>Our company and Deborah
are connected by a model contract.</i>

434
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,743
{\an8}<i>We confirm that our company
has nothing to do with her.</i>

435
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,207
<i>As a way to take responsibility
for the incident,</i>

436
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,748
<i>we inform that we decided</i>

437
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,962
<i>to terminate the contract
with Deborah effective today.</i>

438
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,884
The company probably decided
to dodge the bullet.

439
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,343
But who caused all this mess?

440
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,851
Whatever, now you have to do something.

441
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,889
First off, post an apology right away.

442
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,932
If you don't do it now,
you'll be dragged to do it later.

443
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,437
What should I write?

444
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,479
"My boyfriend cheated on me
and even dumped me."

445
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,824
"I was drunk, out of it,
and made a scene."

446
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,280
Should I say that and ask them
to go easy on me?

447
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,241
Or to curse at him with me?

448
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,199
You can say that. That's a fact. Why not?

449
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,405
At least people will feel sympathetic.

450
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:15,786
Let's focus on you.

451
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,082
We have to prevent this
from getting worse.

452
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,528
<i>Hello, this is Deborah.</i>

453
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:50,866
{\an8}<i>I am deeply sorry</i>

454
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:55,829
{\an8}<i>for my inappropriate and insensitive words
under the influence at the event.</i>

455
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,752
<i>I would like
to sincerely apologize to those</i>

456
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:00,752
<i>who were offended by my remarks.</i>

457
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:06,506
<i>I recently came to part with my boyfriend</i>

458
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,880
<i>whom I had dated for quite a long time.</i>

459
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,301
<i>As a dating coach,</i>

460
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,637
<i>I've indirectly experienced
countless relationships and breakups.</i>

461
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,643
<i>But when I went through it myself,</i>

462
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:22,226
<i>I had a dreadful time
going through the breakup</i>

463
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,614
<i>and was hardly able
to control my emotions.</i>

464
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:28,195
<i>Though I was physically
and emotionally drained,</i>

465
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,448
<i>I could not cancel the event.</i>

466
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,950
<i>As a result of pushing through it,</i>

467
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,285
<i>I ended up getting on the stage drunk,</i>

468
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,789
<i>and saying awful things
that were inexcusable.</i>

469
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,667
<i>Unlike some people suspected,</i>

470
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:46,212
<i>drugs nor alcohol abuse were involved.</i>

471
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,465
<i>From the incident,
I completely realized how emotional,</i>

472
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,800
<i>vulnerable, and irresponsible
I am as a person.</i>

473
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,136
<i>I take full responsibility for my actions,</i>

474
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:01,188
<i>so I will stop all the activities
planned for the future</i>

475
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,939
<i>to take the time to reflect on who I am</i>

476
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:08,942
<i>and how I can become more mature
in the future.</i>

477
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,068
<i>Thank you for taking
the time to read this.</i>

478
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,779
<i>Sincerely, Deborah.</i>

479
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:23,080
<i>I actually had a slight hope
as I was making the confession</i>

480
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,842
<i>that maybe this can
act as mitigating factors.</i>

481
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,012
<i>However, reality hit...</i>

482
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,425
<i>and there's nothing like Santa
in this world.</i>

REASON FOR BREAKUP?
ALCOHOL? DRUG? NETIZENS' COLD RESPONSE!

486
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:54,362
<i>A woman in her thirties,
self-pity party after being dumped.</i>

487
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:58,155
<i>She made such a fuss all the time.</i>

488
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,459
<i>Long story short.
She got dumped, drunk, humiliated herself.</i>

489
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:04,919
<i>She has so many excuses.</i>

490
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
<i>A woman who loses control of her emotions</i>

491
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,625
<i>sickens me as a woman myself.</i>

492
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:10,712
<i>She's crazy like Joker.</i>

493
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:15,388
<i>Deborah's ex-boyfriend
is the real winner in the relationship.</i>

494
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,388
<i>She's a real "K-ex-girlfriend."</i>

495
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,930
<i>Are those who unlike the comments
Deborah's friends?</i>

496
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:34,821
<i>She's a dating coach,
but she got dumped. How pathetic.</i>

497
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,494
<i>I saw that coming
as she was being a know-it-all.</i>

498
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:38,874
<i>A total smarty pants.</i>

499
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,160
<i>If she thinks about
what she's said so far,</i>

500
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,544
<i>she'd cringe really hard.</i>

501
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,581
<i>Deborah the Liar, isn't this a lie too?</i>

502
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:49,085
<i>Will she turn on the waterworks now?</i>

503
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:06,347
{\an8}ACCOUNT PRIVACY
ACCOUNT SWITCHED TO PRIVATE ACCOUNT

504
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,815
<i>I went from a crazy and horrible bitch,</i>

505
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,204
<i>to a pathetic and a little weird bitch.</i>

506
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,370
<i>I also got nicknames like Pet Peeve,
Deborah the Liar, and Korean Joker.</i>

507
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,212
<i>A complete failure.</i>

508
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,539
<i>A complete downfall, indeed.</i>

509
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:37,973
<i>God never gives us
more than we can handle.</i>

510
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,051
Isn't that amazing?

511
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:44,216
I must be a really remarkable bitch.

512
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:52,689
You overestimated me!

513
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,610
You see, I can't handle this much.

514
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:01,365
Hey.

515
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,485
You're drunk.

516
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:05,745
I'll bring more.

517
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:07,079
I'll bring more.

518
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,631
We're out of beers.

519
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,338
I'm good.

520
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:16,673
Then we can drink wine.

521
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,428
Wine.

522
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,226
PLEASE ALWAYS SPEAK TO ME NICELY

523
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,353
Nicely? How?

524
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:31,727
It's all ruined!

525
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:33,733
You want to hear nice words?

526
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,225
You did wrong,
but you don't want to be blamed?

527
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,567
You think someone will comfort you?

528
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,363
Get it together.

529
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:44,737
In this cold, harsh world,
no one is on your side!

530
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,946
{\an8}People waited on your downfall.

531
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:49,826
People are gloating
'cause you became miserable.

532
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,504
Let's put her to bed.

533
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:55,086
Let's go to bed. Come on.

534
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,586
- Put it down.
- It's not the time for nice words.

535
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:02,676
All right.

536
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,010
- Seriously...
- Give it.

537
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,693
Yu-jeong, I'm really...

538
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,228
I'm sorry, Yu-jeong.

539
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,404
I'm sorry.

540
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,653
Thank you, I mean it.

541
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:24,446
Bo-mi. My Bo-mi.

542
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,492
Bo-mi, I'm really sorry.

543
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,037
I love you.

544
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,091
Next item.

545
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,640
"If you're not sincere, don't come near."

546
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,929
"If you're meant to pass me by,
please just pass me by."

547
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,684
"To deal with more heartbreaks...

548
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,015
<i>tteokbokki</i> is too spicy."

549
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,861
This is written in Korean, right?

550
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:00,902
I don't get it. What is it?

551
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,695
It's an excerpt from
a famous writer on social media.

552
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,280
The concept is a book you read at
3:00 a.m. while having a beer by yourself.

553
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:11,868
These kind of sentimental books
are in high demand these days.

554
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:16,165
On top of sentimental illustrations,
if we add some calligraphy,

555
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:21,171
it can be a sentimental illustrated essay,
which can draw readers' attention.

556
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:27,262
How does it sound?

557
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,216
Well...

558
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:30,604
Not bad.

559
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:34,812
An expensive book cover,

560
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:38,274
pretty illustrations and calligraphy,
comforting sentiments.

561
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:42,651
Shoving everything that could work
into one book to make money,

562
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,025
that superficial goal is clearly noticed.

563
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:47,493
It'd be a relief
if it sells well at least.

564
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,160
You could have just said
it's a bad idea, Su-hyeok.

565
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,115
No, it's not bad.

566
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:58,464
The thing is,
planning what's hot now is pointless.

567
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:00,882
We should take the initiative.

568
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,132
We can't be an imitator,
albeit third-rate.

569
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:07,684
Let's just say
this proposal was a bad one.

570
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,521
No, what I meant was...

571
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,769
Okay, then. Let's move on.

572
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:19,652
So not this one. What's next?

573
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,692
That's it?

574
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,951
That's really it?

575
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:30,525
Right.

576
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:32,701
It had to be this.

577
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,337
This was the best option.

578
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,045
You said no, why are you so hung up on it?

579
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,300
It's better to be hung up on work
than on a girl like someone.

580
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,894
Where's this coming from?

581
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,270
You mean me?

582
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:58,849
Do you still stare
at Yu-ri's profile photo?

583
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:01,855
Didn't I always tell you?

584
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,279
I know.
Women are half of the world population.

585
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:05,899
I have no objection to that.

586
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,065
Really?

587
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,403
Then how about tonight?

588
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:12,238
Let's go on a double date
with the models we met at the party.

589
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,082
You said you got over her.

590
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,998
It's not because I'm not over her.

591
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:21,582
How can I meet someone else
right after a breakup?

592
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:23,798
It's not good manners to my ex.

593
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:27,973
You got it wrong.

594
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:33,096
It's good manners to forget
someone who left you.

595
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:47,244
I'm so sick and tired of it.

596
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,494
You said you got over her.
Are you a stalker or what?

597
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,452
You got something wrong too.

598
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:56,699
It's true that women
are half of the world.

599
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,828
But there's only one Yu-ri.

600
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:03,536
Hey, why is Yu-ri only one?

601
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,553
There's Sung Yu-ri, Lee Yu-ri,

602
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:09,343
- Yu-ri in Girls' Generation.
- Stop joking.

603
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:13,592
Sang-jin.

604
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,104
If I call her now, she'd be asleep, right?

605
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:22,772
Yes, with another man, maybe.

606
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,444
Seriously...

607
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,323
She's not that kind of woman.

608
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,150
Hey, what's that kind?

609
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,645
You guys broke up.

610
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:32,857
She said that she'd meet someone else.

611
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,277
You didn't stop her. And?

612
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,115
I'm trying to win her back now.

613
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,870
It's too late.

614
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,702
How can you win her back now?

615
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:47,004
She's probably waiting to hear from me.

616
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:50,632
The song was played again today.

617
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,045
The song she chose
when she told me she likes me.

618
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:57,809
So what you mean is

619
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,561
she picked the song in the radio show

620
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:05,153
to send a message that
she's not over you yet?

621
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,569
Like some kind of spy code?

622
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:13,154
You're so seriously deluded
that I don't know what to say.

623
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,500
I'm telling you this
because it seems like you'll call her.

624
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,538
I'm sure she has a new boyfriend.

625
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,502
If you'll call her, just know that.

626
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:28,091
What are you talking about?

627
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,709
Who told you that?

628
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:31,166
And how do you know?

629
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:33,383
What is it?

630
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:34,426
Huh?

631
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,346
Look.

632
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,653
Count. One, two, three, four
five, six, seven.

633
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:51,572
Look at these fingers in the back.

634
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,451
It's a man's hand around her shoulder.

635
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:56,449
Don't you know where this is?

636
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:58,121
It's in Gangneung, where we went

637
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,579
to catch squid.
It's the hottest café there.

638
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,500
And two cups of coffee.

639
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,578
On top of that. Here.

640
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:07,038
"Heart fluttering."

641
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,377
Okay, forget about everything.

642
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:13,458
Look at her face.

643
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:17,008
Her makeup and facial expressions,
all point to her having a boyfriend.

644
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:18,643
Hold on.

645
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,643
How can these be a man's fingers?

646
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:28,311
Look carefully. It's a man's fingers.

647
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,686
No. Forget it.

648
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,283
You're talking nonsense.

649
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,034
Okay. All right then.

650
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:37,411
Yu-ri has seven fingers. Happy?

651
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,954
<i>Hello?</i>

652
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:42,494
<i>What is it?</i>

653
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,964
<i>A messenger voice call. I answered.</i>

654
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,578
<i>Who's Sang-jin?</i>

655
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,455
<i>Sang-jin?</i>

656
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,248
<i>Hello?</i>

657
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:54,209
<i>Sang-jin?</i>

658
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:56,717
Yu-ri.

659
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:02,974
I meant to call a different Yu-ri.

660
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,603
<i>So you called the wrong number.</i>

661
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,061
Yeah.

662
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:12,936
You know, Yu-ri.

663
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:15,404
I know so many people with the same name.

664
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:20,566
<i>You haven't changed. I'm doing well.</i>

665
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:23,866
Okay. Glad to hear that.

666
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,621
<i>How's the publishing business going?</i>

667
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,084
It's going well. Sure.

668
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:32,205
So sorry to bother you at night.

669
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:35,253
Good night, and be happy.

670
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,220
I told you.

671
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:47,055
It's good manners to forget
someone who left you.

672
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:52,805
Look at her.
She's got great manners, dude.

673
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:27,846
Sir, I'm sorry,
but please go to Yongsan Forest Town.

674
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,406
Thank you.

675
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:07,764
When do we meet again?

676
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:10,885
I'll come again tomorrow.

677
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,305
Really? Okay.

678
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,110
You got something in your hair.

679
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:17,308
Thanks.

680
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:20,284
- Call me when you get home.
- Okay.

681
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:22,107
Head inside.

682
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:24,695
- Okay.
- Hang on.

683
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,453
- Get home safe.
- You too.

684
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,405
- I'm really going.
- Okay.

685
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,714
- Bye.
- Bye.

686
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,673
Bye.

687
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,390
<i>So how's your sister doing?</i>

688
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:47,799
<i>Does she eat well?</i>

689
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:49,717
Yes, she does.

690
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,641
So Mom, don't worry about her.

691
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:54,185
And visit later on, okay?

692
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,848
<i>She's so carefree.</i>

693
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:58,606
<i>How can she eat anything
in this situation?</i>

694
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:01,979
<i>After she got drunk, talked rubbish,
and made such a big scene.</i>

695
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:05,698
<i>I'm so embarrassed
that I can't hold my head up.</i>

696
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,320
<i>Why's she not getting married
all of a sudden?</i>

697
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,237
<i>There's no one like Ju-wan for her.</i>

698
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:12,496
<i>Why is she so fickle-minded...</i>

699
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,910
I wouldn't know.

700
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,626
<i>She's driving me crazy.</i>

701
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,748
Hang up.

702
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,344
Where are you going?

703
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,971
Just to get some fresh air.

704
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,509
You want me to go with you?

705
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:29,351
Why?

706
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,601
Are you worried about me?

707
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:38,975
I'm such a bad sister, making you worried.

708
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:47,112
I'm okay now. Don't you worry.

709
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:49,066
- Okay.
- See you later.

710
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,827
Don't be too late.

711
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:54,325
Watch out for cars.

712
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,701
Come home early.

713
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,248
Okay.

714
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,052
That makes me more worried.

715
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:14,604
<i>The sky didn't fall in,
and everything on earth was there.</i>

716
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:17,562
<i>The world was the same as yesterday.</i>

717
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,983
<i>The only thing that has changed is me.</i>

718
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:02,223
{\an8}<i>Every day, you smile at me</i>

719
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:09,063
<i>Every night, you call me</i>

720
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:16,107
<i>Trying to be someone else
Who you want</i>

721
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,410
{\an8}<i>Though it's hard...</i>

722
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:23,041
{\an8}ONE DAY, 2 YEARS AGO

723
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:31,129
You're listening.
I picked this song for you.

724
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:32,841
<i>You like it, right?</i>

725
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,551
But to me, ballad songs
all sound the same.

726
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,183
The lyrics are nice.

727
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,180
It's something I want to tell you.

728
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:43,771
What do you want to say?

729
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,057
That I will be waiting for you here

730
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:54,817
till you come to me,
unless you tell me not to...

731
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:55,902
<i>Don't.</i>

732
01:00:58,697 --> 01:00:59,987
What?

733
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:01,664
<i>You don't need to.</i>

734
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:18,929
Stop waiting for me.

735
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,430
From now on, I will do that.

736
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:39,697
What's wrong?

737
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,370
Yu-ri, what's wrong? Get up.

738
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:44,156
What's wrong?

739
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:46,333
You scared me.

740
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,825
Were you scared? I'm sorry.

741
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,301
- Did I scare you a lot?
- Yeah.

742
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,255
All right, I'm sorry.

743
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,533
I was super cool back then.

744
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:21,167
What the...

745
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:24,181
Why is she crying like that?

746
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:43,201
She thinks there's no one outside?

747
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,159
TRUE TO LOVE

748
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:36,164
{\an8}<i>You know what always happens
to the key witness, right?</i>

749
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:38,128
{\an8}- Why are you crying?
- Smile.

750
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:41,088
{\an8}<i>They die. Are you trying to
warn me or something?</i>

751
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:44,259
{\an8}<i>- By the way, why do you hate me so much?
- I don't hate you.</i>

752
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:47,089
{\an8}<i>I thought we'd be different from
other married couples,</i>

753
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:51,005
{\an8}<i>but after getting married,
I realized that we're not any different.</i>

754
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,556
{\an8}Did my boobs get smaller?

755
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,230
{\an8}<i>"Dating coach Deborah
failed in her relationship?"</i>

756
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:58,100
{\an8}<i>So you can't write books about love?</i>

757
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,226
{\an8}<i>What would they want to hear about love?</i>

758
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:02,444
{\an8}Just be satisfied with seeing my panties.

759
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,484
{\an8}<i>Why can't you just let it go?</i>

760
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,068
{\an8}<i>You can't get over disappointment
or your ex.</i>

761
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:08,614
{\an8}<i>How can I make you stop?</i>

762
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:10,487
{\an8}<i>I hate you. I hate you like crazy.</i>

763
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:13,043
{\an8}<i>Let's not see each other again.</i>

764
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:17,118
{\an8}<i>Even if you see me crying, falling,
or even hit by a car, just pass me by.</i>

765
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,865
<i>Sure. I will.</i>
