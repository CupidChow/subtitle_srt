1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,963
TRUE TO LOVE

2
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,956
TRUE TO LOVE

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,501
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,520
Sang-jin, are you crazy?

5
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,900
I get why everyone else is here,
but why would you bring your ex-wife?

6
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,695
Do you think I knew?

7
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,410
You said you received
an urgent call from the company.

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,246
Did he?

9
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,626
You must have really wanted to go out.
But how could you lie?

10
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,712
That's why you
insisted on coming to this place.

11
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:37,807
By the way,
I've never met the lady next to you.

12
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,725
She's my sister.

13
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,101
Oh, is she?

14
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,437
She is very beautiful too.

15
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,649
Let me pour you a drink.

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,569
Here.

17
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,322
Hold it!

18
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,075
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,002
<i>We're with some guys they know.</i>

20
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,879
<i>The older one keeps talking to me.</i>

21
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,214
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

22
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:12,132
- Jin-woo.
- What?

23
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,510
Are you sure
you don't need to call Yu-jeong?

24
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,929
To ask where she is, what she's doing?

25
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,975
Jin-ho.

26
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,353
Marriage is about trust.

27
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,189
To trust means
just believing in each other

28
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,483
without checking and knowing everything.

29
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,360
You probably don't understand.

30
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,403
So cheeky.

31
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:33,988
Jin-woo!

32
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,200
Do you know why Yu-jeong
always complains about you?

33
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:42,788
You're too generous
and completely clueless.

34
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:46,667
- What's wrong with you?
- Yu-jeong is at a club! And with a guy...

35
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:53,007
I didn't know you two were
working out together.

36
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:56,635
Right. That's why
your shoulders got wider.

37
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,178
I only work on my lower body.

38
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:05,394
In case someone tries to knock me down,
I should make my lower body stronger.

39
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:09,982
I need some fresh air.

40
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,029
Let's follow. Come with me, please.

41
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,870
You need me?

42
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,506
Su-hyeok, let's talk.

43
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,300
Later.

44
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,218
It won't take long.

45
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,433
Okay. Go ahead.

46
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,395
- Let me apologize.
- You already did.

47
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,564
You didn't accept it.

48
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:53,692
Let me apologize again formally.

49
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,087
Go on.

50
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:22,471
I sexually objectified you
and made sexually harassing comments.

51
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,348
I sincerely apologize.

52
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:28,310
If I were you,
I would've felt insulted and upset.

53
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,853
I was very wrong. You're right.

54
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,440
But...

55
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:39,363
Do you know what crossed my mind
first after we kissed?

56
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,201
I was relieved it was just a kiss.
Nothing more than a kiss.

57
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,786
I was relieved

58
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,956
when I opened my eyes
and saw that we were not in bed together.

59
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,043
And glad that we didn't sleep together.

60
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,211
Let me summarize it.

61
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,382
As you had no intention to sleep with me,

62
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,217
you didn't mean everything you said.

63
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,136
Therefore, you are innocent.

64
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,596
- Is that your point?
- Not exactly.

65
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,598
If we had slept together,

66
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,643
we wouldn't have been comfortable
hanging out like this.

67
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,521
I don't want to lose you.
You're somebody to...

68
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,110
To me...

69
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,156
I thought...

70
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,910
I thought something formed between us.

71
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,955
Like friendship, comradeship,

72
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,207
teamwork, something like that?

73
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,335
And...

74
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,672
And we are...

75
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,305
We're like Mulder and Scully...

76
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,900
For me...

77
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,989
Your nonchalant consideration
and heartfelt consolation

78
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,993
really uplifted me.

79
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:15,250
I was so grateful, and I counted on you.

80
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,758
I talked to you about things I wouldn't
tell my friends and family.

81
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,220
You saw me at my worst,

82
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,973
but I was relieved
that it was you, Su-hyeok.

83
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,018
From some point on, I was glad to see you

84
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,687
and pleased to work together.

85
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,984
So I thought that's why we...

86
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,278
We did it.

87
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,157
But I heard that

88
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,244
you hated working with me
because it's emotional labor.

89
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,955
That's...

90
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,415
I understand if you say you don't like me.

91
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:59,419
But I was so upset
to hear that you hated me.

92
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,674
So I made those rude comments. I'm sorry.

93
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,888
But you have been avoiding me
as if you don't want to see me again.

94
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:13,183
I really don't know what to do.

95
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,065
Are you crying?

96
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,111
You aren't, are you?

97
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,617
I got it. I really got it.

98
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,621
I understand everything now.

99
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,126
And between us,
there is nothing to clear up.

100
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:40,878
As such, we are...

101
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,008
We are...

102
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:01,607
in a relationship like
DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.

103
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,108
That's what you mean, right?

104
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,157
Exactly. DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.

105
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,408
Exactly.

106
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,881
Let's go inside, Scully.

107
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:27,716
Sure, Mulder.

108
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,774
Sang-jin, what are you doing here?

109
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,364
She's giving me a mean look.
I don't wanna go in there.

110
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,075
I'm waiting for Su-hyeok
so that I can go in with him.

111
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,453
You should've treated her better.

112
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,581
Do you know how harshly
she teases me because of you?

113
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:03,335
She makes me call her "boss", and I can't
even bring up your name in front her.

114
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,589
It's all my fault.

115
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,941
Bastard! Who are you?

116
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,609
- Who are you?
- Jin-woo!

117
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,194
- How dare you!
- What's wrong?

118
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,280
- You touched her!
- What's going on?

119
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,906
What are you doing?

120
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,366
Calm down, please!

121
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,285
My precious Yu-jeong!

122
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,705
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

123
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,165
Why did you hit him? Why?

124
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,084
He could've been hurt!

125
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:45,877
Sang-jin, are you okay?

126
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,214
- Yu-jeong.
- What?

127
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,175
Who are you worried about?

128
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,220
Whose side are you on?

129
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,264
What are you talking about?

130
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,475
Choose one.

131
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,020
Me or that bastard?

132
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,772
Me or that bastard?

133
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,611
Why can't you answer? Why?

134
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,825
I will...

135
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,786
I will...

136
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,249
If you and Ju-wan are drowning,
no doubt, I'll save you.

137
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,419
If it's my dad and you, I'll save you.

138
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,755
If my mom...

139
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,010
If it's my mom and you, I'll save you.

140
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,807
I don't care if people call me
a terrible son.

141
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,184
What more can I do?

142
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,858
Jin-woo.

143
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,028
- Bo-ra.
- You're mistaken.

144
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,321
What?

145
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,448
You are mistaken, Jin-woo.

146
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,407
You okay?

147
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,201
Jin-woo.

148
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,869
It's not like that.

149
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,163
Sang-jin, I'm sorry.

150
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,794
So sorry.

151
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,921
This is embarrassing! I'm out!

152
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,469
<i>Just like that, Women's Secret Party</i>

153
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,639
<i>came to an end as an uproarious party</i>
<i>thanks to the couples.</i>

154
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,568
Today, can I make a reservation?

155
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:39,950
Please?

156
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,622
No reservation is available.

157
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,333
You're blacklisted now.

158
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,171
Please...

159
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,386
By the way, how did you know
we were there?

160
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,805
Jin-ho told me.

161
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,393
<i>One couple confirmed their love...</i>

162
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,354
Here!

163
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,899
<i>...while another couple's love</i>
<i>was just starting to blossom.</i>

164
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,484
Where are we going now?

165
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,403
Today, just trust me and follow me.

166
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,447
- Really?
- Yes. Let's go.

167
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,700
<i>Another couple was reunited.</i>

168
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,579
Actually, I wanted to reach out.

169
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:28,957
Su-jin...

170
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,001
Did I ever apologize to you?

171
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,505
When we got divorced,

172
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:40,594
I shouldn't have acted like that.
I mean it.

173
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:46,266
<i>And the singles surrounded by the couples</i>
<i>were not lonely.</i>

174
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,521
<i>He is too precious for me</i>
<i>to think of sleeping with him.</i>

175
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,608
<i>He is my savior who came to ruin my life.</i>

176
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,903
It's really nice living in the same
neighborhood, isn't it?

177
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,780
Yes, it really is.

178
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:04,409
<i>Now I have my Mulder and my DiCaprio.</i>

179
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,002
Back then,

180
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,173
it was not easy for me to face
and accept the situation as is.

181
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,719
Are you dying?

182
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,514
Do you want me to die?

183
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,016
I mean, are you terminally ill?

184
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,144
It's nothing like that.

185
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,482
People remember the last impression
when parting ways.

186
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,987
It's late but I wanna apologize.
I am so sorry.

187
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,451
I see.

188
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,915
My mother was too hard on you.

189
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,792
Thus, we got divorced after all.

190
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,419
I apologize for everything on her behalf.

191
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,714
What did you just say?

192
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:05,637
Are you saying we got divorced
because of your mother?

193
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,306
Is that what you really think?

194
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,183
Or did you just choose to believe so?

195
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,936
Well, that's why...

196
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,564
That's why we got divorced.

197
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,191
If not, why did we get divorced?

198
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,735
Excuse me. Please pull over.

199
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,404
Wait.

200
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,123
You were and still are the worst.

201
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,671
Seriously...

202
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,272
No. I didn't mean anything by it.

203
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,232
Lips are really dry.

204
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:01,818
I know.

205
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,362
No more misunderstandings between us.

206
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,454
By the way...

207
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,583
I'm asking just out of curiosity.

208
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:18,877
At the time, we...

209
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,299
Did I turn back first?

210
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,218
Or did you grab my shoulder first?

211
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,807
Technically speaking,

212
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,519
I can't tell who made the first move.

213
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,485
It's the worst.

214
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,321
It's so romantic.

215
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,452
It was very romantic.

216
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,583
Let's just say
I grabbed your shoulder first.

217
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,252
No. I turned back first.

218
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:05,507
As an independent modern woman,
that sounds better.

219
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,386
And...

220
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,765
I want to apologize too.

221
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,935
For kissing you without permission

222
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,355
and talking carelessly about you.

223
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,482
I am sorry.

224
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,196
It was back then when I hated you.

225
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,825
I meant I did back then.

226
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,159
Now...

227
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,334
Now...

228
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:43,628
I don't hate you.

229
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,135
What a relief.

230
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,429
I didn't kiss a guy who hated me.

231
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,152
Drive safe.

232
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,031
It's really possible.

233
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,701
What's possible?

234
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,247
You said you'd get prettier
and here you are.

235
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,668
Oh, my.

236
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,378
What a compliment.

237
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,713
I'm flattered.

238
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,674
You don't seem to realize it.

239
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,306
Good night.

240
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,469
It's nice eating street food while
looking over the Han River like this.

241
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,429
Very romantic.

242
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,812
Jin-ho.

243
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,271
You've never dated. Right?

244
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,864
I have...

245
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,200
I'm old enough.

246
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,496
How did you know?

247
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,248
It was obvious.

248
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,126
Anyway, Jin-ho,
do you really believe in destiny?

249
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,045
Is that really a thing?

250
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:53,258
Honestly, I'm not sure.
But I decided to believe in it.

251
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,176
Otherwise, I couldn't find the courage.

252
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,136
Courage for what?

253
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,933
When I first saw you,
I took a chance lest I should regret it.

254
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,978
And I tried to talk to you,
but I was so nervous.

255
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,191
So I decided to believe that
we're destined to be together.

256
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,819
Did you? Were you very nervous?

257
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,195
Yes.

258
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,156
Very much.

259
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,451
Then, what about now?

260
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,619
Now...

261
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,913
A little.

262
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,164
A little?

263
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,545
What about now?

264
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,009
What if I do this?

265
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,763
I love you.

266
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,142
Shut up!

267
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,769
I love Yeon Bo-mi!

268
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,898
Stop it.

269
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,112
You said you'd get prettier
and here you are.

270
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,744
I got prettier? What is he talking about?

271
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,372
I was always pretty.

272
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,207
He just pretended he didn't notice.

273
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,546
You don't seem to realize it.

274
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,300
Why did he suddenly talk
casually like that?

275
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,845
He's really stirring.

276
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,809
Is he back home safely?

277
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,791
<i>I appreciate the comfortable rides.</i>

278
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,084

282
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,449
"I wasn't satisfied at first,

283
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,995
but I began to like that word."

284
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,791
"Beady eyes, beady tears,

285

beady dews, beady waves."

286
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,423
"Wherever the word was
attached, it shone."

287
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,637

He's leaving me on read?

00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,329
Why?

00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,233
<i>Don't jump to these conclusions,</i>

300
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:26,072
<i>He might've been caught up in</i>

00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:30,952
<i>At the very moment he is about to reply,</i>

302

<i>He may be asleep,</i>
<i>in a fire, in a car accident,</i>

<i>or even dead.</i>

304
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:42,171
<i>So, don't overreact and say,</i>
<i>"Is there anything wrong?"</i>

305
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,340
<i>It's an obsession disguised as care.</i>

306

EP 10
CATFISH MAKES WAY, SARDINE MAKES A MOVE

317
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:57,455
In the past,
Deborah was very active on SNS,

318
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,873
wrote columns and appeared on shows,

319
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,334
so she didn't need
a marketing strategy for promotion.

320
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,878
But she stopped all those activities now.

321
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,422
It's difficult to set up marketing plans.

322
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:11,093
I agree.
It's best she returns to these activities.

323
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,596
However, we can't ask a writer

324
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,307
to do her own promotions.
That's our responsibility.

325
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,062
Su-hyeok.

326
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,522
Who says we'll ask her to do
her own promotions?

327
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:24,815
That's not my point.

328
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:25,942
Once the book's out,

329
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,236
interviews and book concerts
should follow.

330
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,030
She'll need to
appear before the public anyway.

331
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:35,743
So, maybe she can resume
her activities before publication.

332
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,120
At least we can ask her.

333
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,456
That's the same story after all.

334
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:44,252
The incident was controversial,
with huge malicious comments.

335
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,879
This cannot be an easy task.

336
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:50,758
Since you work out with her,
just ask her casually

337
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,637
and persuade her to resume her activities.

338
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,722
That's what I meant.

339
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:57,932
No way.

340
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,017
We don't have that in the contract.

341
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,769
I won't discuss it with her.

342
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,313
- That's it.

343
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,150

Excuse me, Sang-jin.

00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:17,159

00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,724
For sure, at least once. But...

361
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,895
This is too soon. What does this mean?

362
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:26,937
What do you think?

363
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,650
What a surprise! Look who it is!

364
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:34,612
The true lover and macho of our time.

365
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,156
And the terrible son!

366
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,826
Who said women's jealousy is scary?

367
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,578
Oh, my. So scary!

368
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,962
What was that? How come he
turned so cold in just one day?

369
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,591
He begged me for a reservation yesterday,
but I refused.

370
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,762
He must've been freaked out.

371
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,348
I know how to play hard to get
and lie too.

372
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,977
Did he lie? About what?

373
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,646
Yesterday, Jin-woo...

374
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,735
Oh, I just found out why Ju-wan
sent you the message.

375
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:15,653
<i>How is Bo-ra?</i>

376
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,446
Is she doing well?

377
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:18,989
She is.

378
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,202
She seemed to be with someone.

379
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,870
Really? Who?

380
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:25,788
No idea.

381
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,999
I even saw him on Yu-jeong's Instagram.

382
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,627
That picture with you and the others...

383
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,964
Oh, Lee Su-hyeok?

384
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,258
- Is he dating Bo-ra?
- Is he?

385
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,551
You just said so.

386
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,681
I heard they're working together.

387
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,725
But... he came to Bo-ra's place,

388
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,602
and he comes to my bar often, too.

389
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:51,981
I guess they are seeing each other.

390
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,400
Good for her.

391
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,901
He looks decent.

392
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,237
That's right.

393
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,990
I agree it's good for her.

394
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,534
I got it instantly.

395
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:07,455
Ju-wan is super bothered by Su-hyeok.
It's my hunch.

396
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:22,845
I feel for him. He's almost crying.
Just forgive him.

397
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,764
He deserved that.

398
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,104
Hi, Eun-ju.

399
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,982
Yes, Friday...

400
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,360
I didn't forget. No worries.

401
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:40,946
Bo-ra?

402
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,742
What about Bo-ra?

403
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:48,496
<i>I didn't tell Bo-ra.</i>
<i>Make sure you don't either.</i>

404
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,456
Why not?

405
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,834
<i>Because Ju-wan's coming.</i>

406
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,171
<i>I wanted Bo-ra to come.</i>

407
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,882
<i>But my boyfriend is very close to Ju-wan.</i>

408
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,551
<i>And he'll be the MC at my wedding.</i>

409
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,678
<i>Besides...</i>

410
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,222
<i>Among us, you got married and now</i>

411
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,432
<i>I'm getting married while Bo-ra is single.</i>

412
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:11,644
<i>It'd be too mean to ask her to come</i>
<i>to our pre-wedding photo shoot.</i>

413
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,064
<i>What if she curses me</i>
<i>instead of blessing me?</i>

414
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:19,068
<i>But her viral video is crazy.</i>

415
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,403
<i>The group chat exploded!</i>

416
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:26,242
<i>Actually, even in school,</i>
<i>she was a weirdo.</i>

417
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,327
<i>By the way, is Bo-ra...</i>

418
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,788
Hey, Eun-ju, you're on speaker.

419
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,623
Bo-ra's here too. Say hi to her.

420
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,833
<i>Hi, Bo-ra!</i>

421
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,420
<i>How have you been?</i>

422
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,006
Hi, Eun-ju! How are you doing?

423
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,133
I am doing excellent.

424
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,969
<i>I was about to call you.</i>

425
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,638
<i>Our pre-wedding photo shoot is on Friday.</i>

426
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,141
<i>I hope that you will be able to join us.</i>

427
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:52,810
Oh, Friday?

428
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,646
Sorry. I have another appointment
that day.

429
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,398
<i>Busy, right?</i>

430
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,941
<i>I figured.</i>

431
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,068
<i>What a busy girl!</i>

432
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,737
<i>You're so successful and famous.</i>

433
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,906
<i>You probably can't come to my wedding.</i>

434
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,741
<i>I will definitely miss you.</i>

435
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,868
<i>Anyway, let's get together someday.</i>

436
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,787
<i>I miss you, Bo-ra!</i>

437
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,415
Eun-ju, hold on!

438
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:18,669
Although I have some work to do,
you miss me so much,

439
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,296
so I think I should come.

440
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,589
<i>No, no.</i>

441
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,132
<i>You don't have to.</i>

442
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,009
No, I am okay.

443
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,094
I'll be there. See you then, Eun-ju.

444
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,345
Bye!

445
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,017
Are you really going to go?

446
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,644
Are you gonna be okay
with Ju-wan and the others?

447
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,499
Hey! You came.

448
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,632
What's up with you? You saw me.

449
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,217
I saw you,

450
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,887
but ignored you. What's wrong with that?

451
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,513
It's exactly what you did to me.

452
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,514
What?

453
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,687
Oh, yesterday...

454
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,231
I thought about replying.

455
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:25,235
But I had nothing to say,
and it wasn't a question either...

456
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,449
You won't reply unless I ask a question?

457
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,914
You were disappointed, weren't you?
Did you wait for my reply?

458
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:41,001
You could've just called me.

459
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:42,586
That's not a big deal.

460
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,755
I didn't say that. The fact is...

461
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,841
I'm upset about being left on read.

462
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:50,594
Instead of leaving it on read,
just pretend you never read it.

463
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,222
Or...

464
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,391
Just as I did,

465
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,353
don't press read and just ignore it.

466
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,566
What? "Are you sleeping?"

467
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,111
- What's this?
- Did you see it?

468
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,529
You showed it to me.

469
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,366
What do you think it is?
You'd know since you're a guy.

470
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,243
It's the typical text from your ex.

471
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,871
"Are you sleeping?" "What are you doing?"
You know what they mean.

472
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,958
Yes, I know it well.

473
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,376
They are all meaningless.

474
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:26,922
Why didn't you reply then?

475
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,300
Because...

476
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,845
I chose to do nothing.

477
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,182
Yeah. Well done.

478
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,351
Don't reply to him.

479
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:42,062
If it's bothersome, just block him.

480
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,737
But I have a problem.

481
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,405
This coming Friday,

482
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:56,493
a couple I'm close to
will have a pre-wedding photo shoot.

483
00:33:56,577 --> 00:34:00,289
All our friends will come there
including Ju-wan.

484
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,666
What should I do?

485
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,171
Why are you concerned?

486
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,797
Just say you will not go.

487
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,261
- Why should I?
- Why?

488
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,682
Do you wanna ruin their day of happiness?

489
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,810
A broken-up couple could make
them uncomfortable.

490
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,854
You should know better.

491
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,898
How dare you go there?

492
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,399
Besides...

493
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:28,859
Don't forget our plan.

494
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,403
Do nothing and get prettier.

495
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:35,282
You can't just show up there
in this condition.

496
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,284
"This condition"?

497
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,829
Didn't you say I got prettier?

498
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,833
I said it only to motivate you.

499
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,376
If you show up like this,

500
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,921
you will make him wonder
if you want him back

501
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,465
or if you wanna cut the cord completely.

502
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,342
Absolutely not.

503
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,264
What can I do then?

504
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:01,391
I told her I would come no matter what.

505
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,519
Should I go to cut the cord?

506
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,865
So, you're going to go no matter what?

507
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,829
I am concerned you're gonna mess up again.

508
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,960
Because scandals tend to follow you.

509
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,589
Who knows? I might just keep talking
to feel less awkward,

510
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:35,926
or just get drunk and fall,
talking bullshit.

511
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,678
Whatever. Why?

512
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,514
Is that confusing you? "Are you sleeping?"

513
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,976
It doesn't mean anything.

514
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,645
- Men tend to...
- I know.

515
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,272
That means nothing.

516
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,316
It's just a kind of catfish effect.

517
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,068
Catfish effect?

518
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,405
I heard he asked about you, Su-hyeok.

519
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,324
And then, he messaged me out of nowhere.

520
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,747
Oh, you're saying I am a catfish?

521
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,332
Look out!

522
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,798
Are you okay?

523
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,758
I tried to protect you.

524
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,677
Not intentional?

525
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,515
Your things got scattered.

526
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,810
Why do you carry garbage in you car?

527
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,729
Do you want me to throw them out later?

528
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,314
Leave them there.

529
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,694
Can I have this one?

530
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,613
- Is it fun?
- Just leave it there.

531
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,286
It's no fun.

532
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:04,139
- Good night.
- See you.

533
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,613
Why is he so serious about it?

534
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,615
Still not over her?

535
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,953
Why does he still
carry them around in his car?

536
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,087
<i>I can't help it.</i>

537
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:41,385
Let me read it and totally ignore it.

538
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,555
What does it mean?

539
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,019
"I can't help it."

540
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,731
"I can't help confessing?"

541
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,775
"I can't help wanting you and only you."

542
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,319
"I can't help thinking about you."

543
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:06,868
JINLEE PUBLISHING LEE SU-HYEOK

544
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,038
Hello.

545
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,415
<i>Why aren't you replying?</i>

546
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:14,084
I left you on read. Don't expect my reply.

547
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,045
You can't help what?

548
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:21,091
I can't help it.
I can't let you go there alone.

549
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,801
<i>So...</i>

550
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,219
<i>Don't go there?</i>

551
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:26,680
Let me go with you.

552
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,976
Why do you wanna go there?

553
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,061
You talked about catfish effect.

554
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,313
Let me be the catfish you need.

555
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,734
<i>The more I provoke him,</i>

556
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,360
greater the effect.

557
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:43,113
So you're gonna act like my boyfriend?

558
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,240
That's it!

559
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,034
<i>So, just use me.</i>

560
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:53,623
Good night.

561
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,671
Why is he so excited?

562
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,632
And so enthusiastic.

563
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,095
How impatient.

564
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,681
<i>"I'll buy you coffee next time."</i>

565
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,892
<i>That's the last thing you said to me.</i>

566
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,810
<i>So when are you buying me coffee?</i>

567
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:15,145
<i>How about tomorrow?</i>

568
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,690
Let's go, let's go, Korea!

569
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,902
Let's go, let's go, Korea!

570
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,613
Let's go, let's go, Korea!

571
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,115
Are you with the Red Devils or what?

572
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,408
Did you lose a bet?

573
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:30,869
You got terrible taste.

574
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,872
Doesn't it look nice?
It makes my face look lively.

575
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,416
I am into the color red now.

576
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,879
What do you think, U-ri? Looking good?

577
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,923
You look awesome in it!

578
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:43,840
Right, U-ri.

579
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:47,177
Only a few can look awesome in this color.

580
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,845
How funny.

581
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:01,691
Bo-ra!

582
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,819
Oh, my.

583
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,237
It's been a while!

584
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,030
How serious is it?

585
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,282
Nothing serious. I'll be okay soon.

586
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,076
Long time no see!

587
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,202
You got prettier.

588
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:13,453
How dare you!

589
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,581
I caused damage to the show.

590
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,792
I was so sorry that
I couldn't even call you.

591
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,752
That's why I called first.

592
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,630
Not because we wanted your apology.

593
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,091
Did you listen to our program lately?

594
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,720
I was too upset to listen to it.

595
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,850
Then, I guess you didn't know
we never found a replacement.

596
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,562
We once considered
getting rid of the segment.

597
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,856
We have guest hosts for now.

598
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,899
So, when will you return?

599
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,652
Me?

600
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:54,411
Don't think too much,
but seriously consider it.

601
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,622
- I will.
- Okay.

602
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,541
We can't wait too long.

603
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,460
Yes, ma'am.

604
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:03,795
See you.

605
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:17,809
Bo-ra.

606
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:19,936
Oh, Yu-ri.

607
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,858
I'd like to give you this.

608
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,448
Are you getting married?

609
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,659
How pretty!

610
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:41,249
When people hand me an invitation,
they are scared that I will curse them.

611
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:44,961
I appreciate your courage.
I will attend your wedding.

612
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,671
I would appreciate it.

613
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:51,009
I have something else to thank you for.

614
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:57,307
When I decided on my marriage,
"Deborah says!" played a decisive role.

615
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,352
Do you happen to remember the story

616
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:03,939
about a relationship with a man
who never confesses his feelings?

617
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,982
That was my story.

618
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:13,031
I was confused between two men,

619
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,991
one who never confesses

620
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,993
and one who gave me a sense of trust.

621
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,163
The moment I listened to
"Deborah says!", I woke up.

622
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:24,668
Then...

623
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,420
This invitation is...

624
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,130
Yes, you're right.

625
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,925
For marrying the man
who gives me a sense of trust.

626
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,802
It's kind of a happy ending.

627
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,346
Congrats!

628
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,015
I am glad I was helpful.

629
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:42,018
Not just helpful, but decisive.

630
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:48,441
So, I thought I would give
the first invitation to my ex.

631
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:51,152
But as I met you today
I wanted to give it to you first.

632
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:55,865
Dumping a wedding invitation
on an ex-boyfriend?

633
00:42:56,825 --> 00:43:00,453
Yu-ri, I never thought you were
such a scary person.

634
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:04,374
By the way, you like this book, too?

635
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:09,462
I can't say I like it yet.
I haven't read half of it.

636
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,549
This is my favorite book.

637
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,135
You know, there are books like that.

638
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:20,515
You don't want to just borrow it from
a library, but have it on your bookshelf

639
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,892
to read it whenever you like.

640
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,686
Each reading feels different.

641
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:29,399
So this book is that kind of book.

642
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,527
Someone told me straight out
this book was no fun.

643
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,529
I wondered if I should read it.

644
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,825
What? It can't be.

645
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:39,951
Who told you so?

646
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,871
Someone.

647
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,498
He tells a joke keeping a straight face.

648
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:47,792
He seldom grins.

649
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,253
Unless I send a question,
he never replies.

650
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:54,799
And he replies with "maybe," "probably,"
or "likely" and so on.

651
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,264
That reminds me of a man.

652
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:03,058
So...

653
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,352
What is the book like these days?

654
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:07,937
Currently...

655
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,650
As it is in this book,

656
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:19,074
I wish when I show him the invitation,
he would cry very hard.

657
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,827
I wish he would collapse into my arms.

658
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,456
I wish while I live a happy life,

659
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:30,960
he would stay there forever
getting blind gradually,

660
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,713
waiting for me forever.

661
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:40,845
That's my innermost feeling
that I want to hide.

662
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,853
That sounds scarier than that
famous line, "I will destroy you."

663
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:49,938
What is it?

664
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:54,109
Revenge? Or lingering feelings?

665
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:55,944
Not sure.

666
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,364
I though there was nothing left at all.

667
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:05,829
I guess I wanna shake him up
one last time to check if there is.

668
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:08,081
I may still have such desire.

669
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:16,548
KANG SANG-JUN, LIM YU-RI

670
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,802
This is not a genuine invitation.

671
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:25,098
You would've found out anyway.

672
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,309
But I didn't want you
to hear it from others.

673
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,774
So I decided to let you know myself.

674
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:47,579
I got it.

675
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:49,998
Congrats.

676
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,546
And back then...

677
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,342
I am sorry I was too harsh on you.

678
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,928
I didn't mean what I said.

679
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,764
I was grateful to you for many things.

680
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,060
We had wonderful times, too.

681
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:15,440
But I...

682
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:19,652
Don't be.

683
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,571
I was sorry too.

684
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:28,244
After we broke up, I regretted
not making good memories together

685
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:33,166
and just spending time drinking.

686
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,338
I should've treated you better.

687
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:46,596
I'm also sorry I didn't notice
you were having a hard time.

688
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:03,071
How is he?

689
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,658
Does he treat you well?

690
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:09,869
Yes.

691
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:11,829
He is a good man.

692
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:20,505
What I was eager for
and what you had a hard time doing,

693
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,842
he can provide them easily.

694
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,428
He loves me a lot.

695
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:30,390
I can notice it without asking him.

696
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,935
So I feel comfortable with him.

697
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:36,354
Everything is good.

698
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:41,651
Good for you.

699
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:47,532
Everything worked out well.

700
00:47:56,708 --> 00:48:00,169
I must sound funny if I ask this.

701
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:04,882
But it's important to me.

702
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:12,599
Did you really love me?

703
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,777
Why can't you answer?

704
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:31,075
Did I mean anything to you?

705
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,162
A girl you slept with and had fun with?

706
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,540
A comfortable and easy girl?

707
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,376
- Yu-ri.
- So...

708
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:44,547
did you never regret our breakup?

709
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:52,972
I am not sure what you
want to hear from me.

710
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,267
But I have nothing to say.

711
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:59,437
We're done for good.

712
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:06,027
Even if we got hurt from each other,
arguing about it, apologizing for it

713
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,320
and regretting it...

714
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,407
Everything's meaningless.

715
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,873
- So...
- I changed my mind.

716
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,335
Come to my wedding.

717
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,546
Come and see

718
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:28,508
how happy I am,

719
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,303
and what chance you missed.

720
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,064
What are you doing alone?

721
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,112
I just wanted to be alone.

722
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:34,157
By the way, Mr. Han called to see me.

723
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,117
So, I am on the way to his company.

724
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,161
Let me buy some coffee.

725
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:39,579
I hope everyone's there.

726
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,038
How many cups should I buy?

727
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,209
<i>Ms. Yeon, I'm really sorry.</i>

728
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,086
<i>I need to check on something today.</i>

729
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,796
<i>Let's reschedule our appointment.</i>

730
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,091
But he has some other business
to attend to.

731
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:53,801
Money saved.

732
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,221
What's this?

733
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:03,561
Do you know Yu-ri?

734
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:17,867
<i>Can I have this one?</i>

735
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,160
Just leave it there.

736
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:22,538
<i>By the way, you like this book, too?</i>

737
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,332
This is my favorite book.

738
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:27,919
I thought I would give
the first invitation to my ex.

739
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:40,431
So, you are...

740
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:43,559
Yu-ri's ex-boyfriend?

741
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:56,906
DEEP HOUSE
DRINK FROM DAY TO NIGHT

742
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,574
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

743
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,036
Here.

744
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,120
Here you go.

745
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:05,748
Why should I drink in daylight?

746
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:11,712
Your ex-girlfriend handed
a wedding invitation to you.

747
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:14,715
Coffee would taste too bitter.

748
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:17,218
What about soju then?

749
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,557
Is it bitter?

750
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,560
If soju tastes bitter, we can add beer.

751
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:28,813
I just...

752
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,941
want to console you.

753
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:34,777
Cheers!

754
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,145
Then, why did we get divorced?

755
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,106
You haven't answered yet.

756
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:17,653
We used to get along well.

757
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:19,906
No big fights either.

758
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:21,490
We got along well?

759
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:24,285
Because we didn't fight?

760
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,455
Did we have time to fight face-to-face?

761
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,624
That's because...

762
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,251
Then, I had to focus on the company.

763
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:34,086
We both were busy.

764
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,340
But I don't think
that's the reason for our divorce.

765
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:41,844
When we got back from my parents',
you suddenly asked for a divorce.

766
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:42,762
That's why...

767
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:47,558
I thought that's the reason
for our divorce.

768
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,810
But you say it's not. Then what is it?

769
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:57,944
I have a question.

770
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,155
"Did you really love me?"

771
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:05,743
What does this question mean?

772
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:13,626
The answer determines
whether it's a good memory, a scar,

773
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,964
a lingering old love,
or a bitter past you want to forget.

774
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:22,426
By the way,

775
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:24,595
what was your answer?

776
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,849
I said, "We're done for good.

777
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:32,228
"Everything's meaningless."

778
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:37,817
Why? Was I wrong again?

779
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:40,987
They call it Zeigarnik effect.

780
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,448
It's unanswered,
so it lingers within you longer.

781
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:48,995
Because she didn't get an answer from you,
she can't forget about it.

782
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,841
The reason for our divorce?

783
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,511
Because we didn't love each other.

784
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,264
I realized it on that day.

785
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,725
I was there for the memorial service.

786
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,185
With your relatives,
we were eating facing each other.

787
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:14,812
At the moment, I realized that

788
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:19,066
we hadn't eaten together in two weeks.

789
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,777
"Are you busy these days?"

790
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:24,071
"Yes. It's him that I am concerned about."

791
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:25,531
"Any plans for a baby?"

792
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,534
"Maybe next year."
Sitting there laughing...

793
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:32,747
and just pretending like
nothing was wrong.

794
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:36,125
I couldn't stand it anymore.

795
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,962
After we came back home,

796
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:41,839
I told you that I wanted change

797
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,550
and said we should make effort.

798
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,180
But you said you didn't love me.

799
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:54,643
Did I? When?

800
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,645
I didn't say that.

801
00:55:57,897 --> 00:56:00,399
You did. Clearly.

802
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,825
So what do you want me to do?

803
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:14,914
What do you want to do?

804
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,000
I'll do as you say.

805
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:24,924
I want a divorce.

806
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,807
Okay. Let's do it.

807
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:39,105
<i>And I realized</i>
<i>that you had been waiting...</i>

808
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:42,942
<i>"You say it, you say it."</i>

809
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:47,113
You were waiting for me to say it.

810
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:52,535
What are you talking about?

811
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,453
When did I say that?

812
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:56,455
Don't make excuses. It's too late.

813
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:08,843
Let me take you home today.

814
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:12,763
No thanks.

815
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,226
Let's say bye here.

816
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:21,313
I want to walk a bit.

817
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:25,025
You do?

818
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:31,031
Okay, then.

819
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,323
Don't just send money. You should come.

820
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,243
In return, I will attend
your second wedding.

821
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:22,791
By the way, where is Su-hyeok?

822
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,335
Why?

823
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,712
You're gonna give it to Su-hyeok?

824
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,465
I gave it to him already.

825
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,260
And to Su-jin, too.

826
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:38,224
Now that I'm closer to her than you,
I had to invite her too.

827
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:42,311
So, you guys talk and decide
who is coming.

828
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:46,023
Okay.

829
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:47,441
Well done.

830
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:52,446
You know Deborah, the writer, don't you?
She hosted your radio show.

831
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:54,657
Very well.

832
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,576
I met her to ask her
to return to the show.

833
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,245
Did you?

834
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:03,457
We're working on Deborah's new book.

835
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:11,465
Then, is Su-hyeok working on it?

836
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,343
Yeah.

837
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:22,810
<i>Someone told me straight out</i>
<i>this book was no fun.</i>

838
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,979
I wondered if I should read it.

839
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:26,480
Who told you so?

840
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,898
Someone.

841
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:30,276
He tells a joke keeping a straight face.

842
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:31,902
He seldom grins.

843
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:35,197
<i>Unless I send a question,</i>
<i>he never replies.</i>

844
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:39,910
And he replies with "maybe," "probably,"
or "likely" and so on.

845
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:52,589
Bo-ra.

846
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,092
Hi, Yu-ri.

847
00:59:57,303 --> 00:59:59,722
You're visiting Jinlee Publishing?

848
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,141
Well... Yes.

849
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,268
What brought you here?

850
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:07,354
I was here to see someone.

851
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,274
Go ahead now.

852
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,191
Okay.

853
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:18,991
Yu-ri.

854
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:25,706
By the way...

855
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,751
You asked the wrong question.

856
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:30,669
What?

857
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:34,631
You should've asked me
whether to choose a man

858
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,009
who never confesses his feelings

859
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:39,178
or a man who gave you a sense of trust.

860
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,680
But you didn't ask me like that.

861
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:45,976
I was about to tell you that.

862
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:49,813
You lied by not telling me.

863
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:52,858
Lies mixed with truth could be
more dangerous.

864
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:55,486
You can deceive your partner and others.

865
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,279
But you must've known yourself

866
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,324
whether you're cheating, two-timing,

867
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,117
or moving on right away.

868
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:07,081
And how unfair and petty you were.

869
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:08,999
Am I right?

870
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:12,169
You are.

871
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:16,590
But...

872
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:22,679
Relationships are meant to be
petty and unfair.

873
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:28,769
<i>So petty.</i>

874
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:32,481
Relationships are meant to be
petty and unfair.

875
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:43,283
I myself am thinking about the offer
to return to the show.

876
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:45,702
Are you? Oh, mine!

877
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:48,038
Even you're trying to
come up with something.

878
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:52,292
He told me we shouldn't ask a writer
to do her own promotions.

879
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:54,753
What?

880
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:56,296
It's Su-hyeok.

881
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,424
He didn't wanna burden you.

882
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:01,093
So he refused to talk to you about it.

883
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:10,310
Where is Su-hyeok anyway?

884
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:12,896
He took a day off, which is unusual.

885
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,275
He is not in good shape these days.

886
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:27,703
What? He didn't even come to work.

887
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:36,378
<i>I dropped by, but you're not here.</i>

888
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:38,422
<i>Are you very sick?</i>

889
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:11,497
<i>Are you eating well?</i>

890
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,458
<i>You're not drinking</i>
<i>and crying alone, are you?</i>

891
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,460
<i>I don't have to worry about you, do I?</i>

892
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,795
<i>You're not jumping</i>
<i>in front of cars, are you?</i>

893
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:21,006
<i>Why are you not replying?</i>

894
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:23,717
<i>I'm not supposed to get upset now, right?</i>

895
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:28,931
<i>Let me know anytime</i>
<i>when you need a free hug.</i>

896
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:32,226
<i>And this is not a question.</i>

897
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,852
<i>You don't need to reply.</i>

898
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:46,657
What?

899
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:48,617
Hello.

900
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,077
<i>What are you doing?</i>

901
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,328
What am I doing?

902
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,747
I'm going to the pre-wedding photo shoot.

903
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,040
<i>With whom?</i>

904
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:57,626
Someone is supposed to go with me.

905
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:59,670
He didn't show up. I'm going alone.

906
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:04,174
What the heck?

907
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:07,469
Why are you so late? I waited for a while.

908
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:11,348
I thought you forgot.
Are you really going with me?

909
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:14,309
I told you. You can use me.

910
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:19,231
You should've called.
Thank you for the ride.

911
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:30,242
- Can I drink this?
- Sure.

912
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:33,829
Are you okay?

913
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:36,832
There are some tissues inside.

914
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:00,188
YU-RI

915
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:20,834
YU-RI

916
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:30,677
<i>Su-hyeok.</i>

917
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:38,727
<i>I am at the place in front of your place</i>

918
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,270
<i>where we met every day.</i>

919
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:43,774
So what?

920
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:47,527
<i>I just miss you.</i>

921
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:52,157
<i>What should I do?</i>

922
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,118
<i>I can't do this, Su-hyeok.</i>

923
01:05:57,245 --> 01:05:58,872
<i>Can you let me go like this?</i>

924
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,832
<i>Can I just leave like this?</i>

925
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,169
<i>Are you sure you're okay?</i>

926
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:09,591
<i>I can't do this.</i>

927
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:10,550
Yu-ri.

928
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:13,762
I'll call later...

929
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,639
<i>Can you come here right now?</i>

930
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:21,853
<i>I miss you, Su-hyeok.</i>

931
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:54,803
I'm sorry.

932
01:06:57,556 --> 01:06:59,391
I need to drop by somewhere.

933
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:02,310
I can't go with you.

934
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:05,814
What?

935
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,535
Do you really have to go?

936
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:06,750
<i>I wish while I live a happy life,</i>

937
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:11,546
he would stay there forever
getting blind gradually,

938
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,257
waiting for me forever.

939
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:18,178
<i>I though there was nothing left at all.</i>

940
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:23,475
<i>Maybe I wanted to</i>
<i>shake him up one last time.</i>

941
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,353
<i>I may still have such a desire.</i>

942
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:54,506
<i>The catfish begins to make way,</i>
<i>so the sardine begins to make a move.</i>

943
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:37,257
TRUE TO LOVE

944
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,467
<i>- Bo-ra!</i>
<i>- Don't go.</i>

945
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:40,468
<i>What are you saying?</i>

946
01:09:40,552 --> 01:09:43,638
<i>A clingy ex who talks about</i>
<i>revenge or lingering love.</i>

947
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:45,640
<i>She just wants to see her ex</i>
<i>regret it and cry.</i>

948
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:46,683
Did she say that?

949
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:49,269
- That I two-timed and moved on right away?
- She didn't.

950
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:50,937
Weren't you going with Su-hyeok?

951
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:51,938
<i>I don't know.</i>

952
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:53,398
<i>- He ran away.</i>
- Hi, Ju-wan.

953
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:55,150
<i>- Ju-wan's here.</i>
<i>- Where's she going?</i>

954
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,943
<i>Isn't she going to</i>
<i>go head-to-head with Ju-wan?</i>

955
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:58,862
Where were you at dawn?

956
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,864
- You were not in bed.
- You think she knows?

957
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,407
She sensed something's off.

958
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:05,035
<i>So, from now on,</i>
<i>you shouldn't come downstairs.</i>

959
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,162
<i>So what's going on with you and Bo-ra?</i>

960
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:08,914
<i>There is something going on.</i>

961
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:11,917
<i>I don't want you to get hurt anymore.</i>

962
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,251
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

963
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:15,837
- Cute.
<i>- He is a very good man.</i>

964
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:17,547
I like Bo-ra a lot.
