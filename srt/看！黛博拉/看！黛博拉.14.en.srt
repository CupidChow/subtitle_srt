1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,961
TRUE TO LOVE

2
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,956
TRUE TO LOVE

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,499
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,718
When you were good to me,
you were just being kind and nice.

5
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:54,008
When you gave me a hug, it was a free hug.

6
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,966
When you kissed me, it was... a mistake?

7
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:01,307
When you expressed your feelings about me,
it was an act. Right?

8
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,975
Who is the dishonest one here?

9
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,565
Was I the only one in that kiss?

10
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,699
Didn't we agree that
it was mutual and simultaneous?

11
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:12,529
And who said it was a mistake first?

12
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:13,775
Then why did you invite me...

13
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:17,826
This is why
I persistently banned office romances.

14
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,042
I didn't feel you out!

15
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,502
If not, what was it then?

16
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,432
I really can't work on this book.

17
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,684
An ingenuine ending that refuses growth
can't give any inspiration to the readers.

18
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,603
No, let me be clear. I quit.

19
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,895
I can't work with a planner
who doesn't even try to

20
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,229
understand the writer's intentions
and easily gives up.

21
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,109
Let me know the penalty.

22
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,105
I'm willing to pay
whatever amount you like.

23
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,663
Wait...

24
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,294
- Take care.
- Take care.

25
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,325
Hey... Hey! You...

26
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,666
How...

27
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,500
Did you really...

28
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,553
Did you kiss her?

29
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,179
Here.

30
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,314
{\an8}What are you doing?
You want me to drink all this and die?

31
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,516
{\an8}Just drink it.

32
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,863
{\an8}It's a revenge for lying to me all along
and punishment for botching the project.

33
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,208
{\an8}So what's the problem?

34
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,586
I don't want beer.

35
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,172
Pour me soju. I'm full.

36
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,353
You're not a divorcÃ© like me.

37
00:02:58,429 --> 00:02:59,809
And from what I saw earlier,

38
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,769
Bo-ra clearly has
some feelings for you too.

39
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,018
Is it because of her ex-boyfriend?

40
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,942
He's only an ex-boyfriend.

41
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,191
- You chickened out, right?
- No, I didn't.

42
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,898
Perhaps I was convinced by him.

43
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:15,912
Like you said,

44
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:20,373
I'm afraid I might be the bad guy
in their love story with a happy ending.

45
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,620
That's what crossed my mind.

46
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,328
He seemed quite sincere,

47
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,550
and if what Bo-ra really wanted
was getting back with him,

48
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,130
maybe it's not right for me to keep going.

49
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,596
What if...

50
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,392
how she feels about me
is just out of gratitude...

51
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:48,848
after her breakup?

52
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,608
If that was just it,

53
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,070
she may regret it in the long run.

54
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,028
So...

55
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,742
It's difficult and complicated.

56
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,123
Why is it so complicated?

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,080
Stop overthinking. Think simple.

58
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,790
Do you know why you're like this?

59
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:08,541
Because you always
try to be cool all by yourself.

60
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,671
When you're in love,
you should swallow your pride

61
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,672
and do some embarrassing stuff...

62
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,175
Oh, well.

63
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,974
If you don't have the guts, just give up.

64
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:23,604
You think I want to be like this?

65
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,016
I hate being like this.

66
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,270
Hey, enough.

67
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,522
Enough, let's forget everything.

68
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,864
Let's forget. Just forget about it!

69
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,409
Maybe it's for the best.

70
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,530
In my opinion,

71
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,326
Bo-ra is quite a talker.

72
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,706
She's kind of like a pit bull.
You saw her in a tense situation.

73
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,579
She's too overwhelming.
Way too overwhelming.

74
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,208
Not really.

75
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,094
She's not the talkative type.

76
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,841
And though she comes off tough,

77
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,891
she's really soft and vulnerable inside.

78
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,354
Hey, what do you mean?

79
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,520
I don't believe you.

80
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,732
Anyways, she's not right for you.

81
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,230
Stop it.

82
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,066
Stop what?

83
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,492
Stop talking about her.

84
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,866
It's making me miss her.

85
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,457
And stop making me drink.

86
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,671
It makes me miss her more.

87
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,524
Didn't I...

88
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,481
Didn't I tell you I won't do it?

89
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,532
I told you from the very beginning!

90
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,569
I said I wasn't up for Deborah
from the start.

91
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,960
I'll schedule a doctor's appointment
tomorrow, come with me.

92
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,542
Why would I go with you?

93
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,001
Because I'm your legal guardian.

94
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,133
Bo-mi.

95
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,641
There's no need to get married
just because you're pregnant.

96
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,561
You have the right to make a choice.

97
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,230
You think I don't know that?

98
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,518
Am I a minor?
Why are you treating me like one?

99
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,812
I'm just saying think carefully.

100
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,266
What's there to think about?

101
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,437
We were going to get married anyway.

102
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,526
We can just go ahead with it.

103
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,124
So...

104
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,490
because you like each other,
you live together,

105
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,866
because you love him, you marry him,
you're pregnant, so you have a baby,

106
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,164
you'll just live like that?

107
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,707
What about it? What's wrong with that?

108
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,792
You think everyone is like you?

109
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,955
Not everyone splits hairs
over everything like you.

110
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,172
You think I'm pathetic, right?

111
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,587
Jin-ho doesn't.

112
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,967
He never says, "You're so clueless"
or "What will you do with your life?"

113
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,234
Instead, he says, "You're doing great.
We can do anything if we're together."

114
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,771
I'm terrified already.

115
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,515
I don't expect your support,
but how could you do this to me?

116
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,992
How are you going to face our Su Su later?

117
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,164
Bo-mi...

118
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,122
<i>I'm sure she was just worried about you.</i>

119
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,365
Who asked her to worry about me?

120
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,247
Who is she to say that?
She drives me nuts.

121
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,384
<i>Stop crying.</i>

122
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,092
<i>If you cry, our Su Su will feel sad, babe.</i>

123
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,295
<i>Open the window.
Looks like it's snowing outside.</i>

124
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,474
Snow?

125
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,071
No way.

126
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,939
I'm grounded. Why did you come?

127
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,397
I'm going to jump out the window.

128
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,697
<i>Don't cry. Let's see each other like this.</i>

129
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,412
I'll be here.

130
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,832
Let me know when she's asleep.

131
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,615
I'll bring these to you.

132
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,118
What is that?

133
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,626
It's cake and strawberries that you like,

134
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,418
and folic acid?

135
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,172
<i>I heard you have to take it
during pregnancy.</i>

136
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:07,344
I read it on the Internet. And vitamins.

137
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,678
Aren't you cold?

138
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,589
Go somewhere inside.

139
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,683
<i>I'm not cold if I do this.</i>

140
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,243
You're no different from everyone else.
Always just acting cool.

141
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,881
If this doesn't work,
then I don't know what to do.

142
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,885
He can't resist calling her
when he's that drunk.

143
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,124
U-RI

144
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,156
<i>It will never happen again.</i>

145
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,325
I got over you now.

146
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,415
And I'm cool.

147
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,134
Han Sang-jin.

148
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,669
Let's act my age.

149
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,064
JINLEE PUBLISHING
LEE SU-HYEOK

150
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,743
I'm not picking up.

151
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,715
Yes.

152
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,840
<i>Hello?</i>

153
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,683
<i>Hello...</i>

154
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,352
<i>This is Su-hyeok.</i>

155
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,177
The thing is...

156
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,348
I want to go home now.

157
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,265
<i>You should take me home.</i>

158
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,734
<i>It's just that I want to go home now.</i>

159
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,073
You're drunk.

160
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,151
I'm hanging up.

161
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,606
<i>No.</i>

162
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,065
Why can't you?

163
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,776
Take me home please.

164
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,077
<i>I took you home too.</i>

165
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,446
<i>Of course, you should take me home.</i>

166
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,038
Right? Take me home.

167
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,576
<i>Take me home.</i>

168
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,918
Let's talk when you sober up.

169
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,343
<i>Take me home.</i>

170
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,839
<i>Sir, sir.</i>

171
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:58,966
<i>Are you okay, sir?</i>

172
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,722
<i>Sir, get up.</i>

173
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,176
You're very drunk.

174
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,141
Are you all right?

175
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,055
- The address...
- Come again?

176
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,564
Please take the call.

177
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,645
Call?

178
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,489
- Hello? Is this "Kiddo?"
- What?

179
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,486
KIDDO

180
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,911
It says so on the phone.

181
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,029
Anyhow, he is very drunk.

182
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,157
<i>It's almost our closing time.</i>

183
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,124
<i>I'll send you our address.</i>

184
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,794
<i>I think you need to hurry here.</i>

185
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,217
Honey, turn off the light
when you're done.

186
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,223
Why did you come upstairs?

187
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,643
Stop being mad, honey.

188
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,601
We've fought enough yesterday.
I said I was sorry as well.

189
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,312
When did you say sorry?
You said you did nothing wrong.

190
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,401
Yu-jeong... I'm so exhausted today.

191
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,481
Please?

192
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,247
He's over there.

193
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,502
Please hurry and take him.

194
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,848
Su-hyeok.

195
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,974
Wake up.

196
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,808
Su-hyeok, get up.

197
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,024
Su-hyeok. Try getting up.

198
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,980
Are you all right?

199
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,042
Don't get back with him.

200
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,054
Get up already.

201
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,010
Come on. Get up. Hold my arm.

202
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,559
Get in. Careful!

203
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,693
Sorry.

204
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,935
Could you take us to Yeonseo-ro?

205
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,153
Seongsu River Castle, please.

206
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,364
To where?

207
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,241
Hold on. Where?

208
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,317
Seongsu River Castle.

209
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,287
- Can you take us to Seongsu River Castle?
- Sure.

210
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,496
Let me help you.

211
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,881
How much did you drink?

212
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,886
Don't...

213
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,772
Don't get back with him.

214
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:02,943
Don't...

215
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:06,874
Don't get back with him.

216
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,832
Please?

217
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,036
Okay.

218
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,667
You won't remember anything anyway,
'cause you're drunk.

219
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,761
Give me a hug.

220
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,510
What?

221
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,059
Give me a hug.

222
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:40,768
All right.

223
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,041
Don't ask me why later
when you remember this.

224
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,787
I'll insist that it was just a free hug.

225
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,400
Thank you.

226
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:21,935
Is it here?

227
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,572
<i>When I met him,</i>

228
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,787
<i>he always said he lived nearby
and took me home,</i>

229
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,457
<i>and turned around to head back home alone.</i>

230
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,246

233
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,364
<i>I think I know how it feels.</i>

234
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,567
<i>Because I'm in the lavender haze now.</i>

OUTGOING CALL: 3 MINUTES

241
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:38,045
You really don't remember a thing?

242
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,636
Not even how you got home?

243
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,471
No, I don't.

244
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,978
I drank too fast last night.

245
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,522
I drank over my limit because of you.

246
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,611
Good thing you got home safely.

247
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,649
And you came to work as usual.

248
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,983
But the problem is...

249
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,188
I checked my call history.

250
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,108
Turns out I called Deborah.

251
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,949
But I'm don't remember what I said at all.

252
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,911
What did I say?

253
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,419
It's all for the best.

254
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,958
If you black out,
it'd better be a complete blackout.

255
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,843
When you have spotty memories,
that's super irritating.

256
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,881
You always say it's for the best!

257
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,554
It's the worst.

258
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,137
If you're that curious,
why don't you call and ask her?

259
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,600
You need to apologize to her anyway.

Don't get back with him.

266
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:31,168
Can I come in? I want to talk to you.

267
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,839
Forget it. I got nothing
to talk to you about.

268
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,416
I'm sorry.

269
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,174
Please? You need to eat something.

Let's...

271
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,928
Why did you lock the door, Bo-mi?

272
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:48,023
Just leave me alone.

273
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,309
I want to be alone right now.

274
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,914
<i>U-ri, would you like to
have coffee with me later?</i>

275
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,952
Why did you want to have coffee with me?

276
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:52,539
I have questions

277
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,212
and I have something to tell you.

278
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,921
About what?

279
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,674
Are you going to ask me

280
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,673
why I still have a crush on you
when I acted cool

281
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,384
and said I was over you?

282
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,139
You're going to tell me

283
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,929
that I should stop having
feelings for you, right?

284
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,939
The thing is, I really tried.

285
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,779
But it's not something I can control.

286
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,566
That's not what I was going to say.

287
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,406
I'm not sure how I can put this.

288
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,986
You should have let me
confess to you that day.

289
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,464
One can get over a crush

290
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,996
only after confessing the crush.

291
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,418
If I was allowed to confide in you
and then face rejection,

292
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,215
it may have been over already.

293
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,177
Then do it now.

294
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,761
What?

295
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,011
I will help you get over your crush.

296
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,807
Okay.

297
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,693
I've come to

298
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,569
have feelings for you.

299
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,953
I think it started from
the first moment we met.

300
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,198
In the morning,

301
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,462
saying "good morning" to each other,

302
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,921
eating lunch and having coffee together,

303
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,748
I loved doing all that.

304
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,644
Then I heard that having a meal,
coffee, and seeing a movie together

305
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,889
is what romantic relationships are like.

306
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,774
I hoped to do that with you.

307
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:41,306
That is why I asked you out
by asking you to go to a movie with me.

308
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:49,566
But I really didn't know
that would make you uncomfortable.

309
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:53,075
So I tried acting cool, but...

310
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:57,871
But...

311
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,170
To be honest,

312
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,051
I still like you a lot.

313
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,718
U-ri, you are very cheerful,

314
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,480
pretty, cute,

315
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,814
smart, and brave.

316
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,096
You're a really good person.

317
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,147
But I'm the head of the company.

318
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:31,033
And you're a valuable employee
of my company.

319
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,701
I'm a divorcÃ©. You're not.

320
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,369
I'm older. You're young.

321
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:42,247
So I thought, over time,

322
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,632
you may regret and probably wonder,

323
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,052
"Why did I like that old guy?"

324
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,219
That's why I acted like that.

325
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,772
But on second thought,

326
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,358
even if that happens,

327
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,358
if you're okay with it...

328
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,368
- Shall we...
- Yes!

329
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,041
What did you say "yes" to?
You didn't even hear the sentence.

330
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,129
I'd love to do anything with you.

331
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,803
It's a "yes" no matter what.

332
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,136
Then shall we go to a movie together?

333
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,095
We can have coffee after that

334
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,475
and dinner together.

335
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,189
I would love to!

336
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,160
Hey.

337
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,122
You didn't make up with him yet?

338
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,285
If this is where you end up
after you ran away,

339
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,962
would he be even worried?

340
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,921
It's so obvious.

341
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,301
Then we shouldn't let him
know that I ended up here.

342
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,128
Order something for dinner.

343
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,679
What do you want to eat?

344
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,181
Bo-mi.

345
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,766
Dinner is in front of the door. Eat some.

346
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,105
It's just like that scene from <i>Oldboy.</i>

347
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,991
- How long has she been in there?
- Since last night.

348
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,953
Hey, then you can't just
leave her like that.

349
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:40,161
Pregnancy causes hormonal changes
and suddenly makes you depressed.

350
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,163
She'll feel more depressed.

351
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,370
You can't leave her alone.

352
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,286
- Really?
- Bo-mi.

353
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:53,128
Bo-mi. It's me.

354
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:54,264
Open the door.

355
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,130
I don't want to eat. I said I'm fine!

356
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,505
Come on, open the door.

357
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,426
Don't come in, I'm serious.

358
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,595
If you keep doing this,
we'll unlock the door.

359
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,484
No, please don't come in!

360
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,481
For crying out loud, leave me alone!

361
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,856
Hey, bring a chopstick. I know the drill.

362
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,068
Okay.

363
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,278
Here.

364
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,490
Bo-mi, I'm unlocking the door.

365
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,374
No, no! Don't come in!

366
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,543
Bo-mi.

367
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,004
I want to be alone. Just get out!

368
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,085
I don't want to eat!

369
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,170
Still, you need to eat something.

370
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,716
You shouldn't get stressed out.

371
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,799
I'm okay. Get out!

372
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,425
I'm not going to eat!

373
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,599
You should get out, too.

374
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,181
Okay, I will.

375
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,056
Get out already.

376
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,153
Goodness gracious!

377
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,441
You bastard!

378
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,989
What is it?

379
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,567
You!

380
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,071
Hey!

381
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,660
You...

382
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,911
Bo-ra, listen.

383
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:09,003
He came to drop some folic acid
and some vitamins.

384
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,791
He missed his timing to get out.

385
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,419
Bo-ra, can't you just allow us to love?

386
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,177
- Please?
- Get up, Jin-ho.

387
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,099
No, Bo-mi.

388
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,928
Until I get your approval,

389
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:30,185
I will sit here without moving an inch,
no matter how long it takes.

390
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,809
You wanted to go to the bathroom.

391
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,056
Come on, get up.

392
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,397
I'm okay.

393
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,944
Then I'll kneel down instead of you.

394
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,567
Happy now?

395
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:40,703
Unbelievable.

396
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,949
You guys chose to kneel down.
Why are you looking at me like that?

397
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,791
Bo-mi, don't.

398
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,449
Even if I end up peeing myself here,

399
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,207
I will never budge.

400
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,289
You trust me?

401
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,833
Yes, I trust you.

402
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,384
Then can you hold my hand?

403
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,261
These hands,

404
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,801
let's never let go.

405
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,216
Till death do us part.

406
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,845
Of course. I can never let go.

407
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,932
- Protect our love, no matter what.
- Yes.

408
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,233
Unbelievable.

409
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,271
You guys wrecked someone's marriage,

410
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:16,935
and here you are, declaring
the greatest love of the century.

411
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,819
So, who in the world
is opposed to their love

412
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,202
that even death can't do them apart?

413
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,243
I don't know.

414
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,872
I get it now. Come on, get up.

415
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,581
Don't you dare pee yourself here. Get up.

416
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,662
So do we have your approval?

417
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,210
I've never disapproved.

418
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,383
Get up already.

419
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,755
Hey, Jin-ho.

420
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,342
Sit down to pee.

421
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,347
- Don't forget your manners!
- Okay!

422
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,175
Seriously...

423
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,055
You made me worry!

424
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,687
I'll get going then.

425
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,069
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

426
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,228
Bye.

427
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,316
See you.

428
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:04,111
Jin-ho, don't bother
to tell him that I'm here.

429
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,196
All right?

430
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:06,621
Got it!

431
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:10,373
Hey, you think he'd get what you mean?

432
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,542
She means you should let it slip.

433
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,873
Got it!

434
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,046
Go now, please.

435
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,299
I'll call you.

436
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,920
- I'll get going.
- Bye.

437
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,335
Can't take their eyes off of each other.

438
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,763
How adorable.

439
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,219
Right. I understand
he needs some alone time.

440
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:36,685
He set up a store to work when he wants
and chill out when he wants.

441
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,189
He can't rest on the weekends
or go on a vacation when he wants.

442
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:43,822
I'm sure he has his share of difficulties.

443
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,494
I do know that.

444
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,275
But we even decided to
postpone having a baby

445
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,081
to spend more time just the two of us.

446
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,419
We wanted to have spontaneous getaways,

447
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,208
drink together all night,

448
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,797
and do everything we want.

449
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,509
But spontaneous getaways?

450
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,383
Drink all night?

451
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,932
None of that happened.

452
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,684
We never even had a proper date.

453
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,556
I just wonder
how we ended up like this already.

454
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,940
I thought marriage would end
relationship issues, but I guess not.

455
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,735
- It's the same.
- It's not the same.

456
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,909
On top of all the worries
dating brings about,

457
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:31,528
doing the dishes, recycling, cleaning
the toilet, paying credit card bills...

458
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,616
There are more reasons to fight.

459
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,921
Yang Jin-woo, he's really changed.

460
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,665
By the way, Jin-woo.

461
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,343
Don't you need to go bring Yu-jeong?

462
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,295
You'd better go.

463
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:47,684
Not yet.

464
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,183
Times like this require
a more careful approach.

465
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,510
You should just hurry
and say sorry to her.

466
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,020
I should figure out what to say
after I say I'm sorry.

467
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,354
The answer to, "What are you sorry for?"

468
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,516
If I don't get it right at once,
it gets really serious.

469
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:13,994
IS THIS A REASON FOR DIVORCE?

470
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,044
Why would you ask there?

471
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,291
What is it?

472
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,335
Personality differences.

473
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,966
I'm not sure if this could
be a reason for divorce.

474
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,306
But I don't feel mad anymore,
I don't even want to fight.

475
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,726
It feels like we've become disconnected
at some point.

476
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,685
This is a first for me.

477
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:50,281
Feels like I'm the only one trying hard.
Something like that.

478
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:55,203
You can go for it, if you want.
Why would you need others' approval?

479
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,753
I know, right?
That's the way it is, right?

480
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:02,169
Even if you do, listen to him for once.

481
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,915
It's not too late
to make a decision after that.

482
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,502
That's the one thing I regret.

483
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:10,053
I should have asked him at least once.

484
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,390
I should have heard him out.

485
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,898
I wondered if you still had a hangover,

486
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,112
or if your fingers were broken,

487
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,197
or if you couldn't speak
due to vocal cord nodules,

488
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,989
or if you had amnesia
after a car accident.

489
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,660
But none of those were the case.

490
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,829
What a relief.

491
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,796
I've waited for your call.

492
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,764
How come I feel like I'm always waiting?

493
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,552
I was going to call you, but...

494
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,272
Right, it's all excuses.

495
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,306
I'm sorry I'm always late.

496
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,194
Let me apologize first.

497
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:48,311
The truth is...

498
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,235
I don't have any memory of that day.

499
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,945
If I made mistakes of any kind,

500
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,411
it was because I was so drunk.

501
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:05,373
It was because you were drunk.
I expected that.

502
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,416
I assumed that might be it.

503
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:10,459
But you don't have any memory,
that's a letdown.

504
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,838
I even took you home.

505
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,135
Turns out your house wasn't
in the same direction as mine at all.

506
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,511
That said, let me ask you this.

507
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:26,808
Besides an apology,
don't you have anything to tell me?

508
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:30,765
For instance?

509
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,488
Like, you missed me,

510
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,584
or you're happy to see me,

511
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,075
or...

512
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,595
Fine.

513
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,020
I'm not here to ask you questions today.

514
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:14,024
I'm here to tell you something,
so let me do the talking.

515
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,242
Unlike you,

516
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,826
I'm not one to do someone favors.

517
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,082
It's a pain
to be involved in others' business,

518
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,673
so I don't care about others.

519
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,628
I feel uncomfortable
getting comfort from others.

520
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,254
In business relationships,

521
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:36,705
I never share anything personal
that could be used as my flaw.

522
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,760
In that type of relationship, a kiss?

523
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:44,046
And of all places, at a coin karaoke
where teenagers hang around?

524
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,975
That is something that
I would never allow to happen.

525
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,646
But it was different with you.

526
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,690
Because I didn't mind any of it.

527
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,605
So what I'm saying is...

528
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,700
I like you.

529
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,454
I like you a lot, Su-hyeok.

530
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,464
And do you know what it's like now?

531
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,085
Everything is a mess.

532
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,007
Still, you have nothing to tell me?

533
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,414
It's embarrassing to confess my feelings
that won't be reciprocated.

534
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,280
But I couldn't help but tell you.

535
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:54,165
I'm always the side of the relationship
that loves first,

536
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,079
loves more, and gets my feelings hurt.

537
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:59,245
I'm sick and tired of
repeating this pattern of mine.

538
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,510
But let's face it, it is who I am.

539
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,811
But I don't want a man

540
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,272
who can't say he likes me,
and instead says that

541
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,942
the right side of my face is prettier

542
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,071
and he feels like
he's in the lavender haze.

543
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,938
I don't want a man
who says things like that.

544
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,646
That's why this is not working out.

545
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:28,164
This is not working out.

546
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:40,714
Thanks for keeping your promise
that you'd let me dump you first.

547
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,215
I'm off.

548
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,603
You said it's all messed up.
What can I say to that?

549
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,523
I don't know

550
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,859
what's for the best.

551
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,529
I can't just put my emotions first.

552
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,870
You are just not that committed.

553
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,406
You aren't committed enough
to swallow up your petty pride.

554
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,335
And back to business.

555
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,510
I've been flip-flopping so many times.

556
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:30,847
Now I'm really ready to write the ending.

557
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,509
I can finish the book.

558
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,977
Tell President Han
I'm very willing to finish the project.

559
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,056
Bye.

560
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,638
<i>It was technically a sad ending.</i>

561
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,143
<i>Because it wasn't an ending I'd hoped for.</i>

562
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,101
<i>Still, I was okay,</i>

563
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:19,765
<i>because it was a choice I made</i>

564
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,773
<i>and it was the ending I could accept.</i>

565
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,654
<i>Still, I can't help but feel sad.</i>

566
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:28,284
<i>What did I expect out of this?</i>

567
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,793
Hey.

568
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,745
<i>Are you available tomorrow evening?</i>

569
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,125
- Ju-wan.
<i>- Let's have dinner.</i>

570
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,337
<i>Just once. Let's have something nice.</i>

571
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,097
Okay, let's do that.

572
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,944
Let's have something nice.

573
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,229
It's on me.

574
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:47,438
Okay.

575
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:53,318
<i>He deserved a chance to say goodbye.</i>

576
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,946
<i>That'd be only fair.</i>

577
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,140
That movie was real fun.

578
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,766
Shall we have coffee now?

579
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:26,475
Yes, sounds great!

580
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,693
Is there anything else you want to do?

581
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:32,032
Coffee, meals, movies, besides those.

582
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:37,034
There are so many
that I'm forgetting out of the blue.

583
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,276
I'll think about it.

584
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,420
LIST BY DISTRICT
MONTHLY RENT

585
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:01,311
You got hyped up after Bo-ra's approval,

586
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,429
now you're down?

587
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,234
Why? Is it hard?

588
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,481
I have to get a place for us.

589
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,773
I'm at a loss.

590
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,516
Your parents said they'll help you out.

591
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,068
And Bo-ra will help, too.

592
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,861
You can start off like that for now.

593
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,034
I wanted to manage it
on our own, without getting help.

594
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,198
Hey, that's not possible
for your generation these days.

595
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,794
Don't beat yourself up.

596
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:27,834
But remember one thing.
Propose to her before marriage.

597
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:28,916
It's a must.

598
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,880
Celebrate your anniversaries
as well. So...

599
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,759
Get married on Christmas or something.

600
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,929
It's perfect.
You can celebrate two things at once.

601
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,135
Marriage takes a lot of planning.

602
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:41,349
Everything seems so complicated
all of a sudden.

603
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,599
Bo-mi would be really disappointed
if she knew.

604
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,100
That's common. I've been there.

605
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,361
All right, I will hear you out
just for once.

606
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:08,415
I was daunted by the idea of marriage,
so I thought I'd never marry.

607
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,578
- How did you come to get married?
- What?

608
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,338
Because Yu-jeong asked me to.

609
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:15,417
That's your reason?

610
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,665
Yes. If it was someone else,
I wouldn't have.

611
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,967
She uses five towels for a shower.

612
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:24,012
She always loses her wedding ring
or cell phone and then finds them.

613
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:27,807
Her food tastes like metal and makeup,
but cooking makes her the happiest.

614
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,102
I said yes only
because it was Yu-jeong who asked.

615
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,770
Jin-woo, I'm a little confused.

616
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,279
You do love her, right?

617
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,779
No doubt.

618
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,283
Why? Can't you tell?

619
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:43,156
Yu-jeong keeps asking me that.

620
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,655
Your expressions are a bit...

621
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:51,246
Love is like air.

622
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,464
You die without it.
The problem is you can't see it.

623
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,966
But I can tell
even if Yu-jeong doesn't tell me.

624
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:01,758
How?

625
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,930
When I fall asleep on the couch,

626
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,183
I'm covered with a blanket.

627
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,890
You call that love?

628
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,306
Of course, that's love.

629
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:13,475
How warm is that?

630
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,272
You'll understand later.

631
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:20,896
Jin-woo.

632
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:22,451
That's so cool.

633
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,531
If you tell her that,
I think you can make up with her.

634
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:27,698
Really?

635
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,119
But what did I just say?

636
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:33,999
- Love is...
- Hang on.

637
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,086
Love is

638
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:39,341
like air.

639
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,647
Why are you here? Come inside.

640
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,572
No thanks.

641
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,030
You hate me.

642
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,924
Cover yourself with this at least.

643
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:20,922
- Honey.
- What's with you?

644
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:29,683
I'm sorry.

645
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,349
Not that.

646
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,266
I was wrong.

647
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,058
Not that.

648
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,146
I love you.

649
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,365
Yu-jeong.

650
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,043
I didn't change.

651
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,159
I got used to you.

652
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:55,535
I didn't cool off at all.

653
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:57,254
I'm getting warm.

654
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,631
But I can promise you one thing.

655
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,049
I will always be warm.

656
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,272
So, Yu-jeong...

657
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:22,609
Would you trust me

658
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,242
and stay with me for life?

659
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:31,908
Jeez.

660
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,041
When did you hide this?

661
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,334
I didn't. It was on the sink.

662
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,576
Really?

663
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,957
I had no idea.

664
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,920
It's okay.

665
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,969
I'll always look out for you.

666
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,314
Things are going to be heated tonight.

667
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,108
Call 911.

668
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,441
Tonight, in our house,

669
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,815
there's going to be a really big fire...

670
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,417
TRUE TO LOVE
DEBORAH

671
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,754
Deborah sent this to me.

672
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,495
I won't force you
if you insist on not doing it.

673
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,758
You don't mind someone else taking it?

674
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:35,894
I will.

675
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:38,225
I'll do it.

676
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,772
A SAD ENDING?
A HAPPY ENDING?

677
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:24,022
<i>Every love story has an ending.</i>

678
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,990
<i>We were reaching the ending
of our stories.</i>

679
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:36,077
<i>"That's how a man looks
when he buys a ring."</i>

680
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:42,583
<i>I wanted to shout out
"good luck" to his proposal.</i>

681
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,587
THE WITNESS OF MY MOST HUMILIATING MOMENT

682
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:54,223
<i>After a while,
I ran into him at a publishing company.</i>

683
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,180
<i>The man who witnessed the most tragic</i>

684
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,675
<i>and humiliating moment of my life.</i>

685
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,484
Are you all right?

686
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,232
<i>In a situation
where it's obviously not okay,</i>

687
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:08,855
<i>he asks me if I am all right.</i>

688
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,321
Smile.

689
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:19,081
<i>He grants a favor pretty easily.</i>

690
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,120
- Smile.
- Okay.

691
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:24,537
<i>At face value.</i>

692
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:35,804
<i>He's generous in showing his kindness.</i>

693
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:37,005
You want a hug?

694
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,180
Why?

695
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,266
'Cause you're shaking so much.

696
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,981
<i>A free hug wouldn't hurt.</i>

697
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:00,372
How's it coming along?

698
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:04,037
<i>I can't reveal my heart to him yet.</i>

699
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:06,331
Why are you hiding it?

700
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,093
<i>Like Mulder and Scully did,</i>

701
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:12,168
<i>I don't want to just flirt
with him for nine years.</i>

702
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:14,585
<i>Like DiCaprio and Kate Winslet,</i>

703
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:18,054
<i>I don't want us to remain friends
for over two decades.</i>

704
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:28,102
"I love you just the way you are."

705
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,647
How magical.

706
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,566
There might be at least one person.

707
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:37,241
So, where in the world
is that one person? Where?

708
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:39,446
Perhaps,

709
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:41,576
not that far away?

710
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:44,913
<i>I hoped for falling in love
as my genuine self,</i>

711
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:49,174
<i>with someone who, perhaps,
would love me for the way I am.</i>

712
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,127
<i>I never expected something
like a drama would happen.</i>

713
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:57,011
<i>I wanted to know how he feels about me.</i>

714
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,181
- Do you like me?
- No.

715
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,100
No. Right, me neither.

716
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,928
You said you hate me.

717
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:08,274
You said, "I don't hate you."

718
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,772
Why do you keep seducing me?

719
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:13,482
<i>So I waited</i>

720
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:16,146
<i>for his drama-like confession.</i>

721
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:23,204
<i>I was going to let myself like him
if he says he likes me.</i>

722
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,701
<i>I was going to love him
if he says he loves me.</i>

723
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,422
<i>I wanted to get reassurance.</i>

724
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,750
<i>Because I didn't want to be hurt.</i>

725
00:53:35,171 --> 00:53:37,841
When a writer can't decide an ending,
in most of the cases,

726
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:41,304
it's because the ending doesn't
seem convincing to readers.

727
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:44,641
<i>But...</i>

728
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:47,273
<i>I think I know now.</i>

729
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:52,228
<i>I don't need reassurance from someone else
for the choices I make.</i>

730
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:55,269
<i>Whether it's a happy ending or a sad one,</i>

731
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:58,068
<i>I have to write my own ending.</i>

732
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:19,586
I like you.

733
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:22,514
I like you a lot, Su-hyeok.

734
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,515
Still, you have nothing to tell me?

735
00:54:50,413 --> 00:54:51,413
Welcome.

736
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,751
JINLEE PUBLISHING
LEE SU-HYEOK

737
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,765
- Hey.
- Hi.

738
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:28,276
Su-hyeok.

739
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,617
Yu-jeong.

740
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:35,997
Didn't Bo-ra come here?

741
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,960
I really need to see her,
but she's not answering my calls.

742
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:42,875
If you know where she is...

743
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,261
If I tell you,
do you think you can do this?

744
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,433
Yes.

745
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:57,060
I've been such a workaholic these days
because of the brand renewal project.

746
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,731
We changed everything up,
like our brand name and logo.

747
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,650
Now, we're not Mom's Chicken,

748
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,662
- British accent suits well...
<i>- The fact that people don't change</i>

749
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:13,043
<i>can be this horrible.</i>

750
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,540
We'll do high-end marketing.
Buying chicken like luxury goods.

751
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:19,536
We'll issue a guarantee card to sell only
a limited amount of chicken each day.

752
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:22,297
It'll be delivered by carriers
not on motorcycles,

753
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,419
but in electric limos.

754
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:27,644
Ding!

755
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,429
<i>I didn't know I'd hear
his vision statement yet again.</i>

756
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,809
<i>- But it's the last time.</i>
- We'll use high-end ingredients.

757
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,353
Now it won't be
half spicy, half fried chicken.

758
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:41,233
It's half caviar and half truffle chicken.

759
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:43,185
<i>Fried chicken is the best.</i>

760
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:45,398
Fried chicken is the best.

761
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:47,152
What?

762
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,736
Well, someone said that.

763
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,239
I see, anyhow,

764
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,961
do you remember what I said last time?

765
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:01,711
That our packaging will be
100% eco-friendly.

766
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,553
The sample came out today.

767
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:06,304
Would you take a look at it?

768
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:08,466
Sure.

769
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,178
Hold on.

770
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:15,345
Let's move that.

771
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,276
Open it.

772
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:30,608
Cool packaging.

773
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,962
Chicken goes in here.

774
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:51,260
And pickled purple beet will go in here.

775
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:56,929
You always need radish with chicken.

776
00:57:58,184 --> 00:57:59,894
Likewise, I always

777
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,977
need you.

778
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:09,946
Bo-ra.

779
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:14,366
I know I have let you down before.

780
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:18,871
But I know now I can be good to you.

781
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:29,013
I thought about the best way
to give you reassurance.

782
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,126
I thought this is the only way.

783
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,346
Will you marry me?

784
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:50,534
<i>If I tell you,
do you think you can do this?</i>

785
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:54,033
Then you have to hurry, because...

786
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:26,857
I can't take this.

787
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:29,903
You know better.
How am I supposed to take this?

788
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,284
Bo-ra.

789
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:37,284
I love you so much. I really do.

790
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,945
And I will love you forever and ever.

791
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:44,503
Though we've faced many difficulties,
we got over them well.

792
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:47,922
All this can be part of
our good memories over time.

793
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:52,461
I have confidence in our future together.

794
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:55,298
Ju-wan.

795
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:58,642
What are you doing here?

796
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:03,234
What's this ring for?

797
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:07,348
Da-mi, how did you find me?

798
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:08,898
What do you mean "how"?

799
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,573
You think I can't plant a bug?

800
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,110
I even installed a tracking device.

801
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:15,283
How can you do this to me?

802
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:22,294
So you mean...

803
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:26,248
you suspected me. Right?

804
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:28,832
I'll take off.

805
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:32,802
Bo-ra.

806
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,470
Don't you have self-esteem?
How can you see him again?

807
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,691
I don't think I'm the one
you should be mad at.

808
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,105
Because I've never loved you,

809
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:52,779
nor lied or hurt you.

810
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,781
Do you get it?

811
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:59,655
So the person you should be
looking at right now is...

812
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:15,586
What the hell!

813
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,522
It's this way you should be
looking at now.

814
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,116
Now is the time
to hold your wrist and exit.

815
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:26,445
For Pete's sake!

816
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:33,711
Where are we going?

817
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:37,134
What are you going to say?

818
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,050
Listen to me carefully.

819
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:52,313
By any chance...

820
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:55,151
Do I like you?

821
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:57,982
What?

822
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:01,824
Do I...

823
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:04,355
like you?

824
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,951
How would I know?

825
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,174
You are...

826
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:19,045
in here.

827
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,183
Are you kidding me?

828
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,143
Is this why you came? To mess with me?

829
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:35,154
No, you wanted me to
do something like a drama.

830
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:39,106
Drama...

831
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:42,363
"Like" a drama.
It's just a figure of speech.

832
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:43,824
Did I tell you to do impressions?

833
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,912
Is it that hard to tell me straight out?

834
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,791
If you like me, just tell me you do.

835
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,328
Tell me straight out why you like me.

836
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:55,076
You think that's easy for me?

837
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:59,001
To say that I love a woman
who pees on the street?

838
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,415
Is that why you love me?

839
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,180
Because I peed on the street?

840
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:08,179
I guess that's what you expect.
It happened only once in my life.

841
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:09,642
And it's never happening again.

842
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:11,561
What are you talking about?

843
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,350
What is it then?

844
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,733
Why do you love me?

845
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:19,734
I wouldn't know.

846
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:27,073
Did I fall in love when you cursed
at the Golden Night party?

847
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,779
Because I cursed?

848
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,576
You like cuss words?

849
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,785
That's not what I meant.

850
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:38,253
I can't believe you
until you say something convincing.

851
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:52,809
When you put a curse on me,
saying it's seduction,

852
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:55,234
it was sexy.

853
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,769
Telling lies that'd obviously get caught,

854
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,611
cackling like a witch
as though you're mad,

855
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,187
gritting your teeth when you fight,

856
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,360
being skinny fat...

857
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:10,906
I just...

858
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:12,830
like you for all that you are.

859
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,369
Your singing,

860
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,580
or your weird poses for a camera.

861
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,589
I don't understand either,
so I can't explain anymore.

862
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:33,811
So...

863
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,929
You like me no matter what I do.

864
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:39,308
Is that what you mean?

865
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:43,114
I have tried not to,

866
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,860
but I just cannot resist.

867
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:47,074
Whatever you do,

868
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:51,658
nothing can make me stop liking you.

869
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:02,962
After something like this,

870
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,669
what do they usually do in a drama?

871
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,053
You know what they do.

872
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:27,283
<i>I regret that I used to judge couples</i>

873
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,489
<i>kissing on the streets.</i>

874
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,526
{\an8}<i>For those who are in love,</i>

875
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:36,155
{\an8}<i>there are moments
when they can see nothing</i>

876
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:37,703
<i>but themselves in the world.</i>

877
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:39,446
<i>I finally realized that.</i>

878
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:43,536
<i>After that hot summer was over,</i>

879
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:46,665
<i>the chaotic autumn was gone, too.</i>

880
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,713
<i>Then our winter came.</i>

881
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:52,554
<i>A winter that is so warm
that it feels like spring.</i>

882
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:11,819
By the way, why am I "kiddo"?

883
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,700
Because you're little.

884
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,698
No, I'm not little, I'm not a kiddo.

885
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:18,914
Oh, yes, you are.

886
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:22,044
You're so teeny-tiny that
I want to put you in my pocket.

887
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:25,076
No, I won't go in there.

888
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:26,537
I won't go in there.

889
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,496
You're going to fit perfectly in here.

890
01:07:28,587 --> 01:07:30,337
No, no.

891
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:31,552
Yes, you will be in there.

892
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:34,131
- I won't.
- Yes, you will.

893
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:35,717
No, I won't.

894
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:45,145
I can't believe we have to
keep seeing that.

895
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:49,069
At least, we can live together now.

896
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:55,164
Don't get hit!

897
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,026
Oh, yeah!

898
01:07:58,116 --> 01:07:59,446
Killer move!

899
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:05,248
I won!

900
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:07,832
Excuse me.

901
01:08:07,918 --> 01:08:10,088
I was watching you play
and thought you're very attractive.

902
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,170
Could I get your number?

903
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:12,962
Oh, my.

904
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:14,757
I'm sorry.

905
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,591
I'm married already

906
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,974
to a very sexy man.

907
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,481
He's one lucky guy.

908
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:24,728
But what do I do?

909
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:26,813
I can't give up.

910
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:30,185
Then would you beat me in the game?

911
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:35,816
I don't mind if I do.

912
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:42,912
You need to pick a character carefully.

913
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:45,004
I'll go with this one.

914
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:56,878
{\an8}TRUE TO LOVE

915
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:05,683
Sang-jin.

916
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,137
I mean, President Han.

917
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:11,728
I did some planning
for our next publishing project.

918
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:13,822
Yes, what is it?

919
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,779
Who's the writer?

920
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:24,618
Just...

921
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:26,195
Give it a read.

922
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:31,333
<i>Love, I Bo-ra You.</i>

923
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:35,009
It's like wordplay.

924
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:37,585
"I Love You, Bo-ra."

925
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,724
That'd be too direct.

926
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:44,471
<i>"I love you." A phrase
that's casual like morning greetings,</i>

927
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:46,266
<i>holy like the Lord's Prayer,</i>

928
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,599
<i>more whole-hearted than
the Pledge of Allegiance.</i>

929
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,860
I think it's too soon
to evaluate at this stage.

930
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:56,534
But I think the title
needs to be changed first.

931
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,990
This one won't resonate with many people.

932
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:00,953
Really?

933
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:04,029
What do you suggest then?

934
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,954
Well, let me think.

935
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,041
"Ridiculous."

936
01:10:13,043 --> 01:10:14,753
Hey, "Ridiculous" would be perfect.

937
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,460
You're really ridiculous.

938
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,835
How ridiculous.

939
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,114
Sang-jin.

940
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:36,019
May I have your approval on this?

941
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:47,369
<i>Taking pictures in a photo booth.
Taking a walk holding hands at sunset.</i>

942
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:49,702
<i>Kissing on the emergency stairs
of the company.</i>

943
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:55,000
Meals, movies, coffee.

944
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:58,795
You asked me what else
I want to do with you.

945
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,258
Then I'd pick...

946
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:06,638
this one.

947
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,236
It's not been long
since we published the book.

948
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:27,283
Wait, hold on.

949
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:29,407
It made it to a second printing last week,

950
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,664
and in two days,
there will be a third printing.

951
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,129
- This is unbelievable.
- Congrats.

952
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,539
It's all thanks to you.

953
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:38,667
Ms. Yeon.

954
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,505
We have to discourage him
from working on that book.

955
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:44,719
If this goes south, I can't get back up.

956
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:46,891
- It should work, too.
- What's the title?

957
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,720
"Love, I Bo-ra You."

958
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:51,223
- Outrageous.
- Seriously?

959
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,307
Better to save it, Su-hyeok.

960
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,313
What do you think, U-ri?
"Love, I Bo-ra You."

961
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:56,435
What do you think, U-ri?

962
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,685
To be honest, I really love it.

963
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:02,816
Say "thanks" to her.

964
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,152
She loves it.

965
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:05,527
My goodness.

966
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:06,783
So strange.

967
01:12:06,865 --> 01:12:07,905
- Jin-woo.
- Yeah?

968
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:09,201
Where are they?

969
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:10,454
Beats me.

970
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:12,035
Where are they off to?

971
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:18,535
- What?
- What is it?

972
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:20,707
What is it?

973
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:24,381
What is going on?

974
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,179
What's going on?

975
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:35,385
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to our wedding.

976
01:12:35,477 --> 01:12:37,057
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

977
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:38,609
Wedding?

978
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:40,732
Out of nowhere? Right now?

979
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:44,355
After discussing when we should
have a wedding,

980
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:48,448
we thought setting a date
on Christmas would be extremely romantic.

981
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,161
So we're having a wedding today.

982
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:51,701
Without even telling me?

983
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:53,155
Look at you.

984
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,620
We'll live happily with Su Su as well.

985
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,089
I have a question.

986
01:13:00,168 --> 01:13:01,628
Why is it Su Su?

987
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:07,509
Because the baby was conceived
while I was having tiramisu.

988
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:11,222
Bo-mi really loves tiramisu.

989
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,597
Congratulations!

990
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,602
- Take a seat.
- Sit!

991
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:17,891
Ta-da!

992
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:20,557
What is this?

993
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:21,687
How do you like it?

994
01:13:21,773 --> 01:13:23,533
It's so pretty.

995
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:25,742
Give me your hand.

996
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:31,570
So pretty.

997
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:33,157
Thank you.

998
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:37,833
My turn.

999
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:43,213
Are we going on a trip?

1000
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:22,711
You want to turn me into a tiger?

1001
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,209
Exactly.

1002
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,379
What is it?

1003
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:30,925
PREMIUM ROOM
1 NIGHT

1004
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:36,144
Wear these there?

1005
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,562
Got it.

1006
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:40,597
Su-hyeok.

1007
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,645
Surprise!

1008
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:54,158
How's it? You said you like it.

1009
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,704
- You don't like it?
- How did you get this?

1010
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:00,749
I remembered and bought it.

1011
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:04,174
You like it?

1012
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,960
It's what I really wanted.
Thank you so much.

1013
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:12,881
I wonder what it is.

1014
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:14,466
Ta-da!

1015
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,095
Mittens?

1016
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,265
How cute.

1017
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:26,522
Looks like the mittens
I used to have as a child.

1018
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:29,151
Thank you.

1019
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:33,148
<i>Just like anyone who is in love,</i>

1020
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:36,028
<i>we also shared this common belief.</i>

1021
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,615
- Hold on...
- What?

1022
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,620
<i>That we will reach</i>

1023
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:42,752
<i>a perfect happy ending</i>

1024
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:45,210
<i>like, "And they lived happily ever after."</i>

1025
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,291
What is this?

1026
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:51,673
<i>Like we come to believe again
that Santa may be real.</i>

1027
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,338
For real?

1028
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:57,354
<i>But our love is
neither a perfect happy ending</i>

1029
01:15:57,428 --> 01:15:58,888
<i>nor a sad ending.</i>

1030
01:15:58,972 --> 01:16:01,392
<i>It's an open ending.</i>

1031
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:06,441
<i>There's no such thing
as a strategy for love that never fails.</i>

1032
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:10,321
<i>Promises will be broken,
love will change in the course of time.</i>

1033
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,110
<i>Some may say, "After making all that fuss,</i>

1034
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:14,203
<i>you guys ended up splitting up,"</i>

1035
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:16,739
<i>when our relationship ends
at some unknown point.</i>

1036
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,700
<i>Still, we will not regret that.</i>

1037
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:26,288
<i>Like we live
though we know we'll die someday,</i>

1038
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:29,706
<i>and like we buy flowers
though we know they'll wilt,</i>

1039
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:33,264
<i>like we sadly say goodbye though
we'll see each other again tomorrow,</i>

1040
01:16:33,965 --> 01:16:36,715
<i>like we make promises
that we can't keep sometimes,</i>

1041
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:39,011
<i>like we buy stuff that is useless,</i>

1042
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:43,931
<i>we are true to love every possible moment</i>

1043
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:46,057
<i>from the bottom of our heart.</i>

1044
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:48,234
<i>We are true to love.</i>

1045
01:16:51,149 --> 01:16:52,899
TRUE TO LOVE

1046
01:16:54,736 --> 01:16:57,946
<i>He's what we call a typical "bad boy."</i>

1047
01:16:58,031 --> 01:16:59,911
<i>Rings have no use in the first place.</i>

1048
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:02,411
<i>Or should I just call you
a know-it-all in romance?</i>

1049
01:17:02,493 --> 01:17:03,543
<i>You're rude.</i>

1050
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,829
<i>- Am I?
- Aren't you?</i>

1051
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,162
<i>It's not what you think.</i>

1052
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,457
<i>Wipe your lips first.</i>

1053
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,670
<i>You saw everything, right?</i>

1054
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:09,880
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1055
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:11,459
<i>With Bo-ra, marriage is unlikely.</i>

1056
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:12,924
<i>I tried harder.</i>

1057
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:14,634
<i>But you ruined everything.</i>

1058
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,514
<i>Trying is not love.</i>

1059
01:17:16,591 --> 01:17:17,761
<i>The garbage is being loaded!</i>

1060
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,392
<i>Shall we talk about men?</i>

1061
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:22,889
<i>Men. All men are...</i>

1062
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,272
<i>This is like the common cold.</i>

1063
01:17:24,349 --> 01:17:27,229
<i>Everything will be all right
as if nothing happened.</i>

1064
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:30,150
<i>You want a hug?
If you're okay with a free hug.</i>

1065
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,569
<i>- What should I do?
- It's a little weird, but fun.</i>

1066
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,228
<i>- Thanks to you, I think I lost gracefully.</i>
- Hi.

1067
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:38,448
<i>Ever since I met you,
tough moments passed by before I knew it.</i>

1068
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:40,910
<i>Did you really love me?</i>

1069
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,240
<i>Come to my wedding.</i>

1070
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:43,325
<i>Come and see.</i>

1071
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:45,413
<i>I just want to console you.</i>

1072
01:17:45,495 --> 01:17:48,035
<i>As for the first time I met her,
we ran into each other at a wedding</i>

1073
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,672
<i>of our mutual friend a few years back.</i>

1074
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:52,839
<i>Then when our eyes met,
she took my breath away.</i>

1075
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:54,419
<i>Why are you looking at me like that?</i>

1076
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:55,594
<i>How did I look at you?</i>

1077
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,801
<i>Dangerously?</i>

1078
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:58,341
<i>Why do you keep seducing me?</i>

1079
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,184
<i>Would you be seduced if I do?</i>

1080
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:02,049
<i>Bo-ra, let's start over.</i>

1081
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:03,176
<i>I love you.</i>

1082
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,602
<i>The thought of you with someone else
is driving me crazy!</i>

1083
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,681
<i>Do you have feelings for Bo-ra?</i>

1084
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,766
<i>Does an ex-boyfriend
have the right to do this?</i>

1085
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,731
<i>Don't get back with him.</i>

1086
01:18:10,812 --> 01:18:11,812
<i>I like you.</i>

1087
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:13,146
<i>I like you, Su-hyeok.</i>

1088
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:15,231
<i>Still, you have nothing to tell me?</i>

1089
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:17,026
<i>Now is the time
to hold your wrist and exit.</i>

1090
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:19,820
<i>I tried to stop,
but I like you for all that you are.</i>

1091
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:22,204
<i>You like me no matter what I do.
Is that what you mean?</i>

1092
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:24,831
<i>After this, what do they
usually do in a drama?</i>

1093
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,869
<i>You know what they do.</i>

1094
01:18:26,953 --> 01:18:27,953
<i>What brought you here?</i>

1095
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,157
<i>My name is Bang U-ri,
I'm here for an interview today.</i>

1096
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:32,668
<i>I've come to have feelings for you.</i>

1097
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,210
<i>- If you're okay with it...
- Yes!</i>

1098
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:35,963
<i>Then shall we go to a movie together?</i>

1099
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:38,255
<i>Why exactly didn't you propose to me?</i>

1100
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:39,339
<i>Then how did we get married?</i>

1101
01:18:39,424 --> 01:18:40,974
<i>Brother, come on in.</i>

1102
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,760
<i>I will hear you out just for once.</i>

1103
01:18:42,844 --> 01:18:45,054
<i>I didn't cool off at all.
I'm getting warm.</i>

1104
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:46,348
<i>I will always be warm.</i>

1105
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:47,721
Are you an international student?

1106
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,347
<i>Can I get your phone number?</i>

1107
01:18:49,434 --> 01:18:50,944
I'll kill you if you follow me.

1108
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:52,898
<i>If we do, you must go out with me, okay?</i>

1109
01:18:52,979 --> 01:18:54,979
<i>Remember what I always tell you?
I'll protect you.</i>

1110
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,824
<i>- You trust me?
- Protect our love.</i>

1111
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,729
<i>Protect our love, no matter what.</i>

1112
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,280
{\an8}<i>I'm sorry that I blamed you
for everything.</i>

1113
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,533
{\an8}<i>That does it for me now.</i>

1114
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:04,874
{\an8}<i>It's good enough for me.</i>

1115
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:07,989
{\an8}<i>Welcome to Golden Night,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1116
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:09,577
{\an8}- What's that?
- It's super annoying.

1117
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:12,172
{\an8}- Will you hold grudges?
<i>- I feel sorry and thankful.</i>

1118
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:13,668
{\an8}<i>I feel more sorry than thankful.</i>

1119
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,169
{\an8}<i>Don't you have self-esteem?</i>

1120
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,291
{\an8}<i>What are you doing?</i>

1121
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:17,917
{\an8}<i>I even installed a tracking device.</i>
