1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,961
TRUE TO LOVE

2
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,956
TRUE TO LOVE

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,499
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,287
<i>- Hello?</i>
- What's wrong with your voice?

5
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,250
<i>Were you crying?</i>

6
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,082
No.

7
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,553
The thing is...

8
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,430
We've really met before

9
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:33,678
at the wedding.

10
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,177
Now you believe me.

11
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,690
Why did you call me?

12
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,565
Well...

13
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,567
<i>So...</i>

14
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:54,664
When you feel down or bored at night,

15
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:59,496
so when you need a free hug,

16
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,753
you can call me anytime.

17
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,915
Have a good night.

18
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,741
<i>I said we're like Mulder and Scully.</i>

19
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:38,161
<i>He said we're like
DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.</i>

20
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,292
How about a drink at my place?

21
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,906
<i>One thing is clear.</i>

22
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,167
<i>Like Mulder and Scully did,</i>

23
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:48,209
<i>I don't want to ask him to
donate his sperm to have a baby.</i>

24
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,214
<i>What is that?</i>

25
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,135
<i>Like DiCaprio and Kate Winslet,</i>

26
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,020
<i>I don't want him to escort me
when I marry another man.</i>

27
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,731
<i>Instead, I want to march down the aisle
with him arm-in-arm.</i>

28
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,899
<i>And I had hopes</i>

29
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,950
<i>of falling in love with someone
who, perhaps,</i>

30
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,407
<i>would love me for the way I am.</i>

31
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,922
<i>I had hopes that something like a drama
might happen to me.</i>

32
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,667
{\an8}PNB PRODUCER JUNG-EUN

33
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,138
You know what?

34
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,558
I want to start over.

35
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,232
In this restructuring process,
the main focus is...

36
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,160
<i>Tune in for</i> Date at Noon <i>today!</i>

37
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,739
{\an8}<i>I'm back with a new segment.</i>

38
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,365
{\an8}<i>I'm coming back with "True to Love."</i>

39
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,924
<i>Would you support my new start?</i>

40
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,969
{\an8}DATE AT NOON

41
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:24,846
{\an8}Seriously?

42
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,936
{\an8}<i>Hello?</i>

43
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,362
{\an8}I'm going on the air in a bit.

44
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,691
{\an8}What do I do? I'm so nervous.

45
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:41,067
Give me some pep talk.
Pray for me so I won't make mistakes.

46
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,526
Oh, right, you're going on the air today.

47
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,407
<i>Don't worry. You'll do great.</i>

48
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,834
<i>You're a genius after all.</i>

49
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,212
No way, did you forget?

50
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,884
You twisted my arm to do this.
Now you hang me out to dry.

51
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,630
Unbelievable.

52
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,383
You sound fine. There's no need to worry.

53
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,125
That's the spirit! You can do it!

54
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,018
- Bo-ra, you're on the air in five minutes.
- Five minutes.

55
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,353
There are flowers for you.

56
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:13,518
Flowers?

57
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,276
I can do this.

58
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,401
Okay, coming.

59
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,623
Who is it from?
Who is your number one fan?

60
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,293
- Is this for me?
- Yes.

61
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,421
ROOTING FOR YOUR NEW START
FROM DEBORAH'S NO. 1 FAN

62
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,547
He pretended like he forgot.

63
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,850
Where's Yu-ri?

64
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,639
You haven't heard? She quit her job.

65
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,524
Her husband will work abroad,
so she's going with him.

66
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,652
- I'm going in.
- You got this!

67
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,199
Romantic relationships, is it really hard?

68
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,740
You can't be true and sincere
in a romantic relationship?

69
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,405
{\an8}If you still find love difficult,

70
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,655
{\an8}tune in for True to Love.

71
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,923
<i>So very nice to
hear her voice again, right?</i>

72
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,514
<i>For us who still find love life difficult,</i>

73
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,930
<i>she came back to</i> Date at Noon.

74
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,099
Formerly known as a dating coach, and now?

75
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,719
I'm not sure how to introduce her now.

76
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,807
Why don't you introduce yourself?

77
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,232
Hi, everyone.

78
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,650
Formerly known as
a dating coach, currently...

79
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,864
I returned as a breakup icon, I'm Deborah.

80
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,322
<i>So good to be back!</i>

81
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,858
<i>Bo-ra, Bo-ra, Deborah!</i>

82
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,526
<i>You have no idea how much I missed you.</i>

83
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,825
<i>Thank you.</i>

84
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,248
Deborah, I'm so glad you're back.

85
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,288
Our listeners have been

86
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,922
really concerned about you
while you were away.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,460
How do you feel to be back?
Could you share with us?

88
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,421
Sure.

89
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,681
They say that you learn from pain.

90
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,852
I didn't believe it, since it seemed like
all there was left was pain.

91
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:17,975
<i>But I'm sure I learned something
through my breakup.</i>

92
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,233
I was able to discover
parts of myself that I hadn't known.

93
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:25,196
Of course, it is very difficult
to face parts of myself

94
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,319
that aren't my favorites.

95
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:32,236
But I realized I needed to
learn to embrace it as myself.

96
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,116
I can therefore say without reservation

97
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,826
<i>that I have grown through love.</i>

98
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,587
<i>When I was struggling,
someone told me this,</i>

99
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,297
<i>"I got dumped, too."</i>

100
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,970
<i>"But consider it as a common cold."</i>

101
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,429
<i>"It's going to be okay soon."</i>

102
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,139
<i>I didn't know at the time,
but in hindsight,</i>

103
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,600
<i>having someone in the same boat
who empathized with me,</i>

104
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,891
<i>and hearing those words</i>

105
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,774
was a huge help to me.

106
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:05,027
So in the hope of giving
that kind of consolation to someone else,

107
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,070
I mustered the courage
to come back to the show like this.

108
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,945
Come to think of it,
I haven't thanked that person yet.

109
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,995
I'd like to take this chance
to tell the person

110
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,379
that it felt so warm
and I'm very grateful.

111
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:26,797
Also, if you're currently hurting
because of a breakup,

112
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,796
I want to tell you this.

113
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,387
I've been there.

114
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,766
A breakup, like the common cold,
is not a big deal.

115
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,140
This too shall pass.

116
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,648
You will get well soon.

117
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,019
You can take time to
process those painful feelings.

118
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,858
Right now, messages
of support and congratulations

119
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,328
- are flooding in.
- Right.

120
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,198
First off, 8854.

121
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,575
"What a pleasant surprise
to hear this sweet voice."

122
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,124
"Deborah, I've been waiting
so long to hear your voice."

123
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,128
Thank you, 8854.

124
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,634
And this is from 0501,
"You got over the cold, right?"

125
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,634
"Deborah, let's not be sick again."

126
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,098
Let us all stay healthy, everyone.

127
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,179
And from 9737.

128
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,765
"I can't believe
you became a breakup icon."

129
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,598
"Still, thank you for coming back."

130
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,227
Thank you for waiting for me.

131
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,364
Okay.

132
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,200
There's someone who sent us a short story.

133
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,699
From one of our listeners
with phone number ending 6958.

134
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,661
{\an8}"Hi, I'm a longtime fan of Deborah."

135
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,752
{\an8}"Like Deborah,
I recently broke up with my girlfriend."

136
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,499
It's a male listener.

137
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,456
"I had a difficult time
after breaking up with my girlfriend."

138
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:48,463
"Until we broke up,
I did not know how much I love her

139
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,797
and how much she means to me."

140
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,183
"So I'm going to be courageous
and start over."

141
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,812
"I need your support, Deborah."

142
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,889
- That was the story.
- Right.

143
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:04,225
We will have a live phone call
with this listener right now.

144
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,273
Why don't you answer the phone, Deborah?

145
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,148
Hello, listener 6958.

146
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,741
<i>Hello, Deborah.</i>

147
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,373
<i>It's so good to hear your voice again.</i>

148
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,075
<i>Hello?</i>

149
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,288
<i>Hello?</i>

150
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,960
Okay, well...

151
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,625
Listener 6958.

152
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,836
<i>You said you want to
get back together with your ex-girlfriend.</i>

153
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,756
Did you tell her your feelings then?

154
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,643
<i>No.</i>

155
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,307
I'm on my way to tell her now.

156
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,602
No, don't come...

157
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,725
I mean, don't go.

158
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,611
<i>Because...</i>

159
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,488
you don't know how she feels now.

160
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,332
She might have moved on already. So...

161
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,199
That might be the case.

162
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,495
Still,

163
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,790
there should be a way to win her over.

164
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,498
I believe you can give me some answer.

165
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,006
No.

166
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,933
There is no answer.

167
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:26,313
There cannot be an answer,
don't you think?

168
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,190
Like you can't turn back time. So...

169
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,653
What you can turn back right now
is your car that you're driving.

170
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,567
I know I can't get everything
back to normal.

171
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,488
That was so painful,

172
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,786
so I looked back at
the time we spent together.

173
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,456
<i>When we were so happy together
and loving each other so dearly.</i>

174
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,416
That is something that does not change.

175
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,094
<i>I decided to have faith in that time.</i>

176
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,930
I assume that Deborah

177
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:05,772
is speaking out of concern for you.

178
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,363
Because telling an ex
your feelings in a rush

179
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,109
is not likely
to work in your favor, right?

180
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,608
Are you still going to push for it?

181
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,316
There's this quote.

182
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,156
"When something is important enough,

183
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,292
even if the odds are not in your favor,
you do it."

184
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,325
<i>That's right. Elon Musk said that.</i>

185
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,594
I cannot calculate
the timing or probability.

186
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,961
Because I realized
what is really important.

187
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,835
<i>I won't give up easily.</i>

188
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,636
- It's him, right?
- I think so.

189
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,307
<i>He quoted Elon Musk.</i>

190
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,105
Has he lost his mind?

191
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,229
What's going on?

192
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:59,315
{\an8}If your ex-girlfriend
finds out how sincere you are,

193
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:04,454
I'm confident that she will
surely change her mind.

194
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,754
I think letting her hear this could help.

195
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,579
- Right?
- Well, maybe.

196
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,960
We wish you the best of luck.

197
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,298
Last but not least, this listener

198
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,183
<i>asked Deborah for some words of support.</i>

199
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,891
<i>Why don't you wish him luck?</i>

200
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:25,971
<i>Okay.</i>

201
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,809
I wish you good luck.

202
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:35,364
<i>Now, after a song,
we'll be back with more stories.</i>

203
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,454
You still look tense.

204
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,748
Yes, a little...

205
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,710
That's okay. Take it easy.

206
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,081
Go crazy.

207
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,088
What is all this about out of the blue?

208
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:43,931
Bo-ra, let's...

209
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,300
start over.

210
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,933
I want to get back together with you.

211
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,642
<i>I could have turned him down right away.</i>

212
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,398
<i>No, I could have avoided him
in the first place.</i>

213
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:02,861
<i>But how can I explain this moment
when I cannot do that?</i>

214
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:07,493
<i>The gravity that held our relationship
was already long gone.</i>

215
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,075
<i>But there remains the force of momentum.</i>

216
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,499
<i>I can't stop right away after running.</i>

217
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,540
<i>I can't stop right away after loving.</i>

218
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:08,013
{\an8}EP 13
IT'S ALL ABOUT TIMING, TAKE COURAGE FIRST

219
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,361
Did you like the flowers?

220
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:27,901
Yeah...

221
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,370
Is this from you?

222
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,869
Of course.

223
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,002
Who is Deborah's number one fan
besides me?

224
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,118
I special-ordered pretty purple flowers.

225
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,254
Of course, the prettiest purple
is light purple, Yeon Bo-ra.

226
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,375
As it's the same as your name.

227
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,547
Ju-wan.

228
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,921
What you told me...

229
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,217
I kept thinking about it.

230
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,555
You asked me if I wanted to
be the good guy until the end.

231
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,145
You're right.

232
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,989
I always wanted to look like the good guy
and be a good person.

233
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,412
Because I wanted to be
the perfect boyfriend for you.

234
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,082
I acted like I was a decent person.

235
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,293
Even though I knew I wasn't.

236
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,883
Back then, I was just venting my anger.
Don't let it bother you.

237
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,548
No.

238
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,802
It was hard to apologize.

239
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:36,426
It was scary to own up to my faults.
So I avoided it.

240
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,233
I'm nothing special.

241
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,604
I'm just a selfish and insecure person.

242
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,649
I felt like I shouldn't be
such a person in front of you.

243
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,403
I pretended like I wasn't.
I tried not to show it.

244
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,411
Maybe I was tired of that.

245
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,410
We all are.

246
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,919
No one is perfect after all.

247
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,133
You were.

248
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:09,761
You were a perfect woman for me at least.

249
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,049
That's because...

250
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,807
I pretended like I was as well.

251
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,975
I told you that you don't know me well.

252
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:26,768
Right.

253
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,819
I thought I knew you well.

254
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,950
But these days,
you look like a different person.

255
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,122
I guess I didn't know you.

256
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,239
That's why

257
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,413
I want you to give me a chance

258
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,668
to get to know you better.

259
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,915
I need to know at least
what kind of woman I loved

260
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,053
and broke up with.

261
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,015
<i>By the way, are you sure?</i>

262
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,774
<i>They're seeing each other?</i>

263
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,817
<i>But they barely talk to each other.</i>

264
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,027
<i>That's just a cover.</i>

265
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,278
<i>They suddenly became awkward,
not even saying hi.</i>

266
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,124
<i>That's more suspicious.</i>

267
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,829
<i>Yeah, I showed you the note.</i>

268
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,000
<i>"With love."</i>

269
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,248
<i>They even have pet names for each other.</i>

270
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,620
<i>They watched a movie alone.</i>

271
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,752
Hello, thanks for calling
Jinlee Publishing.

272
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:34,126
<i>Right, Chun-woo said
he saw them having coffee alone that day.</i>

273
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,375
<i>I'm not surprised.</i>

274
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,336
<i>She got hired through connections.</i>

275
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,007
{\an8}<i>They had coffee and lunch alone.</i>

276
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,716
{\an8}<i>It was obvious.</i>

277
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,136
Thank you.

278
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,780
- U-ri.
- Yes?

279
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,073
- Are you going to Sang-jin's office?
- Yes, do you need anything?

280
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,367
No, never mind.

281
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,876
Did you hear that?

282
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,597
The designer called

283
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:24,722
and wanted your confirmation
on the revised draft

284
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:29,558
and wanted you to send
emails to this address.

285
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,023
- Okay, thank you.
- Sure.

286
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,829
Sang-jin.

287
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,335
Hey.

288
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,126
You didn't hear the broadcast
since you were outside, right?

289
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,796
I was worried about hate comments.
But the reactions are great.

290
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,966
Now, we don't need to worry
about publicity.

291
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,183
That Deborah. "Deborah, breakup icon."

292
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,897
She straight up went head-on into it.

293
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,149
She's good.

294
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,940
That's great.

295
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,435
You know what's more amazing?

296
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,030
I've got quite a hunch
in the dating department.

297
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,994
I'm quite extraordinary.

298
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,327
She had a live phone call
with a listener who's called 6958.

299
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:33,174
From the story, I came to think
that there was something going on here.

300
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,923
So I looked it up.

301
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,759
The last digits of
Deborah's phone number is also 6958.

302
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,262
Deborah's ex-boyfriend
wants to get back together.

303
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,473
He said that on a live radio show.

304
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,515
If this goes well,

305
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,308
it's perfect for book publicity later.

306
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,983
Perfect storytelling marketing.

307
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,308
That's just an assumption.

308
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,778
And if he confesses his love,
is it guaranteed to work?

309
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,069
It wasn't just a confession of love.

310
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:03,568
A wholehearted confession
of a man who has surrendered to love.

311
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,826
It was almost like a drama.

312
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,950
The male lead regrets,
comes to his senses,

313
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,367
confesses his love on a live show
and they get back together.

314
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,168
It's so romantic.

315
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,959
What kind of woman
wouldn't be swayed by that?

316
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,213
It even made my heart flutter.

317
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,054
So when is your meeting with Deborah?

318
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,131
What?

319
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,886
Oh, tomorrow.

320
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,302
Tomorrow.

321
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,306
Then we'll find out everything tomorrow.

322
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,267
Get a bouquet of flowers tomorrow
before the meeting.

323
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,522
I should have sent one
on behalf of the company.

324
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,855
I was so swamped that it slipped my mind.

325
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,980
Come on, man.

326
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,607
When I'm busy,
you should have sent her one already.

327
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,744
You're so clueless...

328
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,950
What did I do wrong?

329
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,951
We can give her one tomorrow.

330
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,055
Not even a call.

331
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,422
- Yes.
<i>- Did you get home all right?</i>

332
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,881
You must be tired.

333
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,712
Why don't we have lunch tomorrow?

334
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,760
<i>As friends. Lunch wouldn't hurt.</i>

335
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,263
I'm afraid I can't. I have work.

336
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,731
You're making an excuse
to reject me, aren't you?

337
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:58,193
I'm not used to this, so I'm confused.

338
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,402
I am rejecting your offer,

339
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,652
but I really have work.

340
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,437
All right, then let's have
dinner together.

341
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,778
If you're going to reject this too,
do it in person.

342
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,372
<i>Bye.</i>

343
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,177
Excuse me.

344
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,354
- I'd like to order.
- Bo-ra.

345
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,893
Have French toast
with strawberries on top.

346
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,397
Get another one for me along with yours.

347
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,819
Get another one for me, too.

348
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,397
Get them one.

349
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,447
Look at the way you do business here.

350
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,701
Fine, you two can enjoy that.

351
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,491
And I'll have two Americanos, please.

352
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:55,702
Why two?

353
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:56,946
You have company today?

354
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,418
- Hello.
- Hi.

355
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:20,097
Did you listen to the broadcast yesterday?
I guess you couldn't because of work.

356
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,773
It would have been nice if you did.

357
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:25,899
I did.

358
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,856
You thanked someone.

359
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:31,863
It was touching.

360
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,793
If it was touching, you should have
let me know that you'd heard it.

361
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,712
I waited.

362
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,679
Then did you hear that part, too?
The live phone call?

363
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:54,848
Yes.

364
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,477
So did you talk with him?

365
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,856
He came to the broadcasting station,
so we briefly talked.

366
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:08,857
So...

367
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,574
I talked with him all right.

368
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,257
Welcome...

369
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,796
Bo-mi.

370
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,755
I heard you work here.

371
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,466
How have you been? It's been a while.

372
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,266
- What's up?
- Hey.

373
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,813
Come on.

374
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,814
You won't even talk to me?

375
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,396
You've become more beautiful, Bo-mi.

376
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,033
Why didn't you call me?

377
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:53,645
I missed you.

378
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,868
You've become prettier
since I saw you last.

379
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,079
How can you be so pretty?

380
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,619
<i>Gifts from my ex-boyfriend.</i>

381
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,792
<i>Selling at a real bargain.</i>

382
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,371
You said you're selling this
at a bargain after a breakup.

383
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,920
Come on, say something to me.

384
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:13,014
I can't stand this pathetic bullshit.

385
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,430
If you broke up, that's it.
Being desperate and clingy.

386
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,889
Shame on you!

387
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,099
What's the matter?

388
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,144
You'd better give up.

389
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,977
It's too late.
Nothing's going to change anyway.

390
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:32,029
Who are you, and why are you saying this?

391
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,610
Forget it. Stop. It's okay.

392
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,275
Don't you get it?

393
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,528
I'm the current boyfriend

394
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,987
of your ex-girlfriend
whom you can't possibly get over!

395
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,474
No way. You must be joking.

396
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,719
No, Jin-ho. Don't.

397
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,477
That's not it. Okay?

398
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,397
Jealous much?

399
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:11,568
Bo-mi is perfectly happy with me.
So can you just get lost?

400
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,779
Stop it.

401
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,030
He's my sister's ex-boyfriend.

402
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:19,906
What?

403
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,220
All right, seems like
it's time to be upfront about it.

404
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,892
I know you're all wondering
what is happening.

405
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,759
Here's the thing.

406
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,022
I've been going out with him.

407
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:46,975
Happy now?

408
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,560
I'm sorry for keeping you in the dark.

409
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,028
It was hard to keep it a secret.

410
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,649
Now that we're open about it,

411
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,113
it's a load off my chest.

412
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:03,776
We'll be a good couple.
I look forward to your support.

413
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,248
Sure.

414
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,259
Jin-woo, give me a coffee.

415
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,050
- Iced?
- Yes.

416
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,639
Why didn't you tell me
you had a meeting here?

417
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,148
I said I'd pick you up.

418
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,520
What...

419
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,609
What are you doing now?

420
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,451
I'm here to see you. Jin-woo as well.

421
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,374
Hello.

422
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,002
We did shake hands before.

423
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,788
We haven't been properly introduced.

424
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,372
I'm Noh Ju-wan.

425
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:55,918
I'm Lee Su-hyeok.

426
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,093
You didn't grab my hand tightly today.

427
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,644
I heard from Bo-ra
that you became close through work.

428
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,474
When I heard what you said that day,

429
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,060
I thought you were dating.

430
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,811
I was really on guard.

431
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,806
It was just a wrong impression.

432
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,898
It was just you being
passionate about your work.

433
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,364
I reserved a restaurant for our dinner.

434
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,567
You'll be surprised if you know where.

435
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,041
It's the place where we used to go.

436
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:31,158
You wanted to sit on the terrace
when it's nice outside.

437
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,827
We were in the middle of a conversation.

438
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,172
You need to talk more about work.

439
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,803
I'll let you two talk first.

440
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,592
I need to call someone anyway.

441
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,693
You should go.

442
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,519
I'm busy right now.

443
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,154
- What?
- I said go.

444
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,189
Okay. Got it.

445
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,646
I'll talk with Jin-woo.

446
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,646
Let's go when you're done.

447
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:15,918
Why did you come?

448
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,338
What do you mean? Shouldn't I come here?

449
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:19,749
So,

450
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,917
are you trying to get back with Bo-ra?

451
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:27,969
Well...

452
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,937
You look busy.

453
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:47,025
By the way, do you always
do your work in this manner?

454
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,489
What manner is that?

455
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:55,623
I understand that it's common in Korea
to mix business with pleasure.

456
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,286
But that usually leads to
unnecessary waste of emotions

457
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,376
as well as avoidable mistakes.

458
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,723
You're not getting to the point yet.

459
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,801
You're really beating around the bush.

460
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,595
I'm getting there.

461
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,678
Do you...

462
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,176
have feelings for Bo-ra?

463
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,942
I don't think I need to
answer that question.

464
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,942
Right?

465
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,704
Does an ex-boyfriend
have the right to do this?

466
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,198
I don't have the right for the moment.

467
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,951
If you heard the broadcast,
you must be aware.

468
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,120
I will get back together with Bo-ra.

469
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,577
That is why I asked you.

470
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,173
Fortunately, you didn't
give me any answer.

471
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,466
If you said you had feelings for her,

472
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,009
I was going to tell you not to.

473
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,053
I was going to beg or persuade you.

474
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,064
Don't look at me like I'm a loser.

475
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:58,307
If I can start over with her,

476
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,056
I'm willing to become a bigger loser.

477
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,574
See? I was going to keep you in check
and make you give her up.

478
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,358
But now I'm just begging you

479
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:10,611
to stop swaying her.

480
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,162
So you acknowledge that she's been swayed?

481
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,036
You know already.

482
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:18,911
When someone goes through a breakup

483
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,338
they can be swayed for a bit
by someone who comforted them.

484
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,381
But taking advantage of that vulnerability

485
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,263
is clearly not fair play.

486
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,848
When we get back together

487
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,846
and get married as we planned,

488
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,272
Bo-ra...

489
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:41,403
will have a hard time because of the fact

490
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:44,518
that she was swayed for a moment.
I know that so well.

491
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,821
That's why I'm telling you this.

492
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,947
First of all, I'm so sorry.

493
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,993
I know it could be very misleading.

494
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,656
Please let me explain.

495
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,575
I didn't get back with him at all.

496
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,044
He just wanted to be friends.

497
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,134
And...

498
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,376
I didn't plan to meet him here...

499
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,341
No, there's no need.

500
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,216
What?

501
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,345
You don't need to explain
everything to me.

502
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,887
I wasn't going to pry into
your love life, that's your privacy.

503
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,805
I was just wondering
if there needs to be any changes

504
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,483
to what we discussed
during the meeting last time.

505
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,562
I was just asking for your confirmation.

506
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,652
I see...

507
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,025
Now it seems like

508
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,794
we do need to make some changes.

509
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,906
Let's wrap up the meeting today.

510
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,457
I...

511
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,130
I'm afraid I'm interrupting your date.

512
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,590
Let's talk in the meeting.

513
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,763
This is for you on behalf of our company,

514
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,639
though it's a day late.

515
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,265
I congratulate you on starting over.

516
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,775
Your radio show and relationship.

517
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,161
Are you done?

518
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:11,554
Take care.

519
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,732
We have a lot of time left
till our dinner reservation.

520
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,236
What should we do?
Do we have enough time for a movie?

521
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,909
- What are you doing? It's so childish.
- What?

522
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,697
You really don't know?

523
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,662
I was having a meeting.

524
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:44,453
How could you interrupt that?

525
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,120
Well, I just...
Since I'm acquainted with him,

526
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,286
I didn't want to act like a stranger,
so I said hi.

527
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,800
- It made you uncomfortable.
- I know you did that on purpose

528
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,669
to mislead him about our relationship.

529
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,548
What's there to mislead?

530
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,010
You said he's just a close colleague.

531
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,059
Isn't he?

532
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,653
Or... do you have feelings for him?

533
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:12,938
What?

534
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,448
If you can't answer, never mind.

535
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,490
He couldn't answer
the same question either.

536
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,164
If you can't too,

537
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,368
there's nothing to worry about, right?

538
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,252
Fine.

539
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:38,841
Let me reject you in person.
I can't have dinner with you.

540
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,054
Bye.

541
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,272
I swallowed my pride,
and I'm making an effort.

542
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,266
But why now?

543
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,065
You said you hated me.
You were sick and tired of me.

544
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:02,242
Now that it's over, you feel sad?
Are you jealous I'd see someone else?

545
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,912
Fine. I hated it.

546
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,531
Now that it's over, I can't move on.

547
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,077
The thought of you with someone else
is driving me crazy!

548
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,463
Bo-ra.

549
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,290
Listen to me.

550
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,165
I love you.

551
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,673
But what I can't possibly stand right now

552
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:24,177
is the fact that you're swayed
by a guy who doesn't even like you.

553
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,770
We should have just
gotten married back then.

554
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,021
What on earth are you talking about?

555
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,781
Like you said, I don't know you well,

556
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,320
but I do know one thing.

557
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,032
You're not emotional enough
to be swayed by a guy

558
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:45,704
who gives you such little assurance.

559
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,157
Am I wrong?

560
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:53,669
It's true, Bo-ra.

561
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,130
If you do this, we can't even be friends.

562
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,967
I didn't want that in the first place.

563
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:03,841
How can we be friends?

564
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,512
Should I say it again?

565
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,973
I love you.

566
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,925
How can we possibly become friends?

567
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,688
Hey.

568
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,225
How did it go with Deborah?

569
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:22,818
Do they seem to be back together?

570
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,026
Yeah.

571
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,452
That's amazing.

572
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,503
All right. This is more like it!

573
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:32,908
Do you hear that sound?

574
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,541
The sound of printing
1st, 2nd, 3rd editions, right?

575
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:38,964
What's with all this?

576
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,804
Aren't we supposed to go for
an open ending, not a reunion?

577
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,840
Things are different now.

578
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:46,014
I didn't like an open ending
from the beginning.

579
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:47,303
Nothing beats a happy ending.

580
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,755
You call this a happy ending?

581
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,175
An ending like that?

582
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,482
Is it all a happy ending
if the book sells well?

583
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:55,644
That's not what I meant.

584
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,557
It's what the writer wanted.

585
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,816
What did she want the most from day one?

586
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,978
She wanted to get her ex back.

587
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:07,489
Also, how many couples do not
go through a breakup before marriage?

588
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,703
They must have learned something from it.

589
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,163
And they get back together stronger
after staying apart.

590
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,504
Indeed, it is a happy ending.

591
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,550
So we have to change
the publishing plan for Deborah's book?

592
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:22,998
You heard him.

593
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,168
I made all the marketing plans
with the current concept.

594
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,255
Then what was that meeting for
in the first place?

595
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,644
There's nothing we can do.
It is what it is.

596
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,101
He insisted that he's not a geezer.

597
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,602
But why is he acting like one?

598
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,555
By the way, U-ri.

599
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,232
What do you think?

600
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,693
Pardon? About what?

601
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,483
Why do you even ask?

602
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,698
She should be on her boyfriend's side.

603
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,740
What? Boyfriend?

604
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:53,578
U-ri. We all know about you two.

605
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,080
You're dating him, right?

606
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:57,412
You could just tell us.
What's the big deal?

607
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,495
Me and Sang-jin?

608
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:01,594
Yes.

609
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:02,708
No.

610
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,803
Come on. I wasn't going to
bring it up, but to be honest,

611
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:09,592
you got hired by pulling strings.
Everyone here knows that.

612
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,642
That's true.

613
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,684
No, what I mean is...

614
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,516
By the way, are you okay with it?

615
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,555
You know Sang-jin got divorced.

616
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,935
It should be okay.

617
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,612
He's from a very wealthy family.

618
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,070
A building owner.
A born-with-a-silver-spoon president.

619
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,320
U-ri, you must've watched too many dramas.

620
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,164
Or is it more like <i>Cinderella?</i>

621
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,866
It's nothing like that.
It's a misunderstanding.

622
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,825
I won't force you to answer,

623
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,666
but U-ri, please make one thing clear.

624
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:47,262
You won't become full-time
before Hyun-seok, right?

625
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:51,255
How would I know that?

626
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,093
No way. Is it all arranged already?

627
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,555
Then, is it all right to do this?

628
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,269
Shouldn't we get on her good side?

629
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:00,599
It's really nothing like that.

630
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:01,765
It's not.

631
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,443
In that case,

632
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,780
is Sang-jin hitting on you

633
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,688
using the job
or your full-time employment?

634
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,237
No.

635
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,740
- Sounds true.
- You can tell us if that's the case.

636
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,658
Do tell us. It's really okay.

637
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:16,992
No.

638
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:18,947
That's what the employees said?

639
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,999
And U-ri couldn't say a thing?

640
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,133
Sang-jin.

641
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,338
You know you always say that

642
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,506
you do what can be criticized for,
but never do what you'd be ashamed of.

643
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:38,852
It's not that, right?

644
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,733
You didn't do something
you'd be ashamed of, right?

645
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:46,438
Right.

646
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,439
If they hear
the president kept hitting on her,

647
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:53,487
they wouldn't blame the female employee
for flirting with him anymore.

648
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:55,992
Okay, let's go with that.

649
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,664
Where is that coming from?
How is that a solution?

650
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:00,576
What should I do then?

651
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:04,615
She just started her career.
Should I let her take all the heat?

652
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:55,679
Let's call it a day.

653
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:57,929
- Let's go.
- Okay.

654
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,137
You see...

655
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,642
There's something I need to tell you.

656
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:11,652
It was just me.

657
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,534
I had a crush on Mr. Sang-jin.

658
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:20,738
I got dumped even before saying
how I feel about him.

659
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:26,869
I don't think that is wrong.

660
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:31,749
Because you don't need to be qualified
to like someone.

661
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:39,431
But now I come to think
that I'm probably not qualified.

662
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:45,524
Also, I didn't know Sang-jin was rich.

663
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,644
I really had no idea.

664
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:52,565
Though I think that'd make no difference
to the way I feel about him.

665
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,569
That is not why I had feelings for him.

666
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,900
Other than that,

667
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,573
there were so many things
I liked about him.

668
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,911
As for myself,

669
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:09,712
I prefer books to dramas.

670
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,918
That's why I got a job at this company.

671
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,795
My favorite books are

672
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,340
<i>Anne of Green Gables, Daddy-Long-Legs,</i>

673
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:22,387
not <i>Cinderella.</i>

674
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,077
Let me keep this short.

675
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:52,253
I need to straighten something out
as vice president.

676
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:56,296
At Jinlee Publishing,

677
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,759
as you know, we've hired office assistance

678
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,011
and management support positions
year-round.

679
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:05,433
That said, in the process of hiring U-ri,

680
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,973
there were no
procedural issues whatsoever.

681
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,515
As for switching to full-time,

682
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:13,652
the decision will be made
solely upon performance reviews.

683
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:17,030
In addition, office gossip
and unsubstantiated hearsay

684
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,568
about your co-worker

685
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:21,399
is clearly workplace bullying.

686
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:23,702
Last but not least,

687
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,236
as for confessions and apologies,

688
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:31,577
when you think it's late, it's too late.

689
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:34,246
That's all.

690
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:36,174
Enjoy the rest of your day, everyone.

691
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,382
See you tomorrow.

692
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:39,549
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

693
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,011
Let's go, Sang-jin.

694
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,261
He does all the cool stuff.

695
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,178
Bye.

696
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,065
U-ri.

697
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:05,869
Sorry. I'm so sorry
that I can't find the right words.

698
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,831
I thought you were dating.

699
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,120
We were upset
since we thought you lied to us.

700
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:12,834
It's just how we felt.

701
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,964
Anyway, there's no excuse for it.
We were so wrong.

702
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,462
It's about time for me
to get a chance to be full-time.

703
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,545
I was over-sensitive. I'm so sorry.

704
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,550
You don't need to accept my apology now.

705
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,884
No, apology accepted.

706
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:26,298
I'm sorry, and thank you.

707
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,756
Shall we have a beer together?

708
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,306
- It's on me.
- No, we got a company card.

709
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:33,981
- Let's go together, U-ri.
- I'll pack my stuff then.

710
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,436
You have a stomachache?

711
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:41,895
Isn't it indigestion?

712
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:44,945
I don't know.
It kind of feels like indigestion.

713
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:47,739
Maybe I ate too much today.

714
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:50,792
Right.

715
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,998
You had French toast,
waffles, strawberries and a lot of cakes.

716
00:47:56,916 --> 00:48:00,246
You could win an eating competition.

717
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,674
SANITARY PADS

718
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:09,007
What should we buy?

719
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:11,175
Cola? Sparkling water?

720
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,893
Or digestive medicine?

721
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,864
Where's a pregnancy test?

722
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,287
We have three minutes to think.

723
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,547
Let's think what we should do
if it's two lines.

724
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,172
What do you mean? Of course we...

725
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,507
Not of course.

726
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,392
Whether to give birth or not,

727
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:52,389
whether to raise a baby by myself
or together, we should make a choice.

728
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,444
I made my decision.

729
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,649
Let's get married.

730
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,645
Don't be impulsive. Think.

731
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:06,436
I will think about it, too.

732
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,987
You do the thinking. I'm done.

733
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,113
I want to marry you anyway.

734
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:12,488
If it's sooner,
it's all the better for me.

735
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,735
Because we'd be able to
be together longer.

736
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,406
I can't believe I'm becoming a daddy.

737
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:46,632
I feel like I'm on top of the world.
I mean it.

738
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:47,881
Awesome!

739
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:53,091
What's wrong?

740
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:54,466
You hesitated.

741
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,222
You hesitated. You just did.

742
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:58,556
No, I'm really thrilled.

743
00:50:58,639 --> 00:50:59,969
I feel like I could fly now.

744
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,227
When you are extremely happy,
you could go numb all of a sudden.

745
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,441
I mean it!

746
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,364
Believe me.

747
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:16,905
So did you make a decision?

748
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,950
I don't know.

749
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,580
I shouldn't have a belly bump
in my wedding dress.

750
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,457
I'm so happy!

751
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:32,547
Are you hungry again?

752
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,337
Yes.

753
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:36,471
But I'm not the one who's hungry.

754
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:40,011
I shouldn't let our baby feel hungry.

755
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,137
Wait up.

756
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,156
Honey, guess what...

757
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,331
No.

758
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,583
Why are you saying no?
You don't know what.

759
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,212
Whatever it is, it's a no.

760
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,128
Well, the thing is,

761
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,339
you know Sang-cheol, he...

762
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,170
I said no!

763
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:56,965
You didn't even hear me out.
Can't let me finish my sentence?

764
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,679
I'm saying no to a caravan.

765
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:01,762
What, Sang-cheol told you
to buy it from him?

766
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:03,346
- That it's a steal?
- Yes.

767
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:04,641
Do you know why?

768
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:07,274
Because his wife
told him she'll divorce him

769
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,641
if he doesn't sell it,

770
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:11,228
because she's had enough.

771
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:14,484
If you bring it here,
do you think I'd say nothing?

772
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,278
You're unbelievable.

773
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:22,413
Games, cameras, figurines, golf,

774
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,201
fishing, and now it's camping?

775
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:31,963
- Well, still...
- No.

776
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:33,293
- No.
- I said no.

777
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,587
It's a no-no.

778
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,172
Okay, I won't. Enough.

779
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,382
No to everything...

780
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:40,932
You heard me.

781
00:53:45,932 --> 00:53:47,892
Where's my phone?

782
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,516
Out of the way. Aren't you sitting on it?

783
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:52,523
I don't know. Look carefully.

784
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:53,855
Is it downstairs?

785
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,898
- Call me!
- Okay.

786
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:07,911
Found it!

787
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:32,979
Yu-jeong.

788
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:40,704
So you've been
letting Jin-ho stay downstairs all along?

789
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:43,072
You could have told me so, why...

790
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,493
Why?

791
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:50,161
Why couldn't you tell me?

792
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,960
He needed to crash for a short time
till he got a place.

793
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,712
So I just didn't tell you.

794
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:58,298
- Right?
- Yes.

795
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:02,009
But finding a place is taking
longer than I thought.

796
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:04,804
Lead the way.

797
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:07,888
- To where?
- You know where.

798
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,635
- But...
- Lead the way.

799
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:13,598
- Privacy...
- Hurry up.

800
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,472
What is this?

801
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,135
Oh, my gosh...

802
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:48,845
What is all this?

803
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,182
I don't know.

804
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,555
What is all this? I have no clue.

805
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,063
Jin-ho. It's all yours, right?

806
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:58,983
Yes.

807
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:03,186
Seriously, cut it out.

808
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,033
When are you going to stop lying?

809
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:08,197
What else did you lie about?

810
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,332
You could just say you two are dating.

811
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,329
Is there more that I don't know about?

812
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,711
Did you hide a girl in here?

813
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,835
Bo-mi.

814
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:22,844
- What is it?
- Are you okay?

815
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,134
You must be scared.

816
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:26,376
Is our baby okay?

817
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,313
It's okay.

818
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:40,308
Are you pregnant?

819
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,405
I can't believe this.

820
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:01,541
BO-RA

821
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:03,963
No.

822
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:05,916
Don't pick it up. Please. I'm begging you.

823
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:07,336
Let go.

824
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,554
No. She's really going to kill me.

825
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:10,885
This isn't right. Let go.

826
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:12,303
Let go.

827
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,719
Don't tell her, or I will throw this.

828
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:17,558
I can really throw it. I will.

829
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,063
No!

830
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:21,015
Honey, put down your phone.

831
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,689
It's really expensive.

832
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,694
Please, Yu-jeong.

833
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,316
- I'm going to throw it.
- No!

834
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,276
All right.

835
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,160
I'll talk to her briefly and hang up.

836
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:35,743
So that she won't call again.

837
00:57:35,828 --> 00:57:36,868
Sounds good?

838
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,504
Then give me the phone
and talk on the speakerphone.

839
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:43,877
Give it.

840
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:55,763
Hey.

841
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,690
Hey, I shouldn't be asking a married woman
to come out this late at night, right?

842
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,442
Why? You need a drink?

843
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:10,567
Bo-ra. Hurry here! Bo-mi's pregnant!

844
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,036
What did she say?

845
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:22,168
"Bo-ra, hurry here."

846
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:25,497
"Bo-mi's fragrant?"

847
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,009
What did she say?

848
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:39,806
So...

849
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:43,977
you're saying...

850
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,534
she's pregnant?

851
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:58,788
Come on out.

852
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,909
No, I won't go.

853
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:04,333
If not, what are you going to do here?

854
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,536
Come with me.

855
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,540
Bo-ra...

856
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:15,594
- Come.
- What's the matter with you?

857
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:18,058
Why are you acting like
I did something wrong?

858
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,468
You...

859
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:22,814
Hey, go and talk to her at home.

860
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:24,727
You should go with her.

861
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:41,791
Hey.

862
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,000
Stay here.

863
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:57,552
Hey...

864
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,977
How shocking.

865
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,361
What was all that?

866
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:17,866
Why are you following me up?
Go play downstairs like you do.

867
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:20,075
Come on.

868
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,617
You want me to go?

869
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,960
I just played video games
and watched soccer sometimes.

870
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:28,881
I'm sorry.

871
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:31,842
Did I complain?

872
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,840
Why do you lie to me?

873
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,632
You keep lying to me.

874
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:37,716
What lie?

875
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:43,311
All right.

876
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:47,062
I'll stop everything. That'll do, right?

877
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:48,766
"That'll do"?

878
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:55,692
How am I supposed to believe you now?
If you needed alone time so badly

879
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:58,028
that you had to lie,
why did you even marry me?

880
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:02,236
Right, because I asked you to.

881
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,906
You didn't even propose to me.

882
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,834
You married me
just because I asked you, right?

883
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:07,293
That's why you're doing this.

884
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,920
Until when are you going to
talk about the proposal?

885
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:14,962
Do you love me?

886
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:17,423
Do you even love me?

887
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,585
You said you won't believe me.

888
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,006
That's right.

889
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,308
I can't believe you anymore. I won't.

890
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,270
Because you've lost my trust.

891
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,100
Where's the man that I wanted to marry?

892
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:33,268
The man who put his phone in a waterproof
pack not to miss my call while showering.

893
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:36,487
The man who let the last bus leave
and stayed all night together

894
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:37,948
and was still sad to say bye.

895
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,658
The man who used to do a video call

896
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:42,068
24 hours 'cause you missed me
when I was studying abroad.

897
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:44,537
That's the man I married.

898
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,464
But now, you're just...

899
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:53,587
You're just a selfish,
emotionally detached guy.

900
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:55,706
Hey. Yang Jin-woo.

901
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,552
You've really changed.

902
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,796
Are you aware of that?

903
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,392
Yes, so have you.

904
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,351
- What?
- You think you haven't changed?

905
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:08,675
You always complain about whatever I say.

906
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,847
You hate whatever I do.
You say no to everything.

907
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:14,016
That is why I can't say anything.
Why would I? You won't listen anyway.

908
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,400
Did I? When? About what?

909
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,193
Am I wrong? "Stop playing games."

910
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:19,397
"Biking is dangerous."

911
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:20,946
Fishing? You hate everything!

912
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:23,529
"Golf? A guy like you?"
"Don't you dare invest in stocks."

913
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,485
"I'll divorce you
if you buy cryptocurrency."

914
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:26,946
Then what can I ever do?

915
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:28,245
All I should do is work?

916
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:30,368
Work, home, work, home,
no time for myself?

917
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:31,956
I need alone time.

918
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,580
Just a little bit of alone time,

919
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:34,917
I just need a little bit.

920
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:36,552
What did I do so wrong?

921
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:43,679
Then what about us?

922
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,716
What? What about us?

923
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:49,728
Do we ever spend time together?

924
01:02:52,895 --> 01:02:54,015
Jin-woo.

925
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,480
In the morning, we are in a rush
and busy all day at work.

926
01:02:57,816 --> 01:03:00,526
In the evening, after dinner and
cleaning up, we just pass out.

927
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,990
But you complain
you don't have alone time for yourself.

928
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:07,453
You're not bothered about
not having time with me?

929
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:12,789
I guess you aren't. I am.

930
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,040
If you put it that way...

931
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,750
Well, we will be together

932
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:20,257
for the rest of our lives, so...

933
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:21,759
Is that so?

934
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,676
That's what you think.

935
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:30,846
So you lie to me
'cause I'd give you an earful,

936
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,638
you don't do it with me
'cause you could some other time.

937
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,687
We'll be together for life,
so you can put off spending time with me.

938
01:03:36,772 --> 01:03:38,362
I'm your lowest priority.

939
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,610
I see that's what you think.

940
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,780
By the way,

941
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,241
who said we'll be together for life?

942
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,870
What's that supposed to mean?

943
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:57,995
I just wonder

944
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:01,961
if living together for life like this
is really meaningful.

945
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,667
That crossed my mind.

946
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:06,177
How can you...

947
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,716
I'll sleep somewhere else. Okay?

948
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,327
Let me crash here tonight.

949
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:47,683
I'm sorry, Jin-woo. It's all my fault.

950
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:53,392
You should have told me.
You lied and made things get out of hand.

951
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:54,980
Turn off the light.

952
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:05,938
- Good night.
- You, too.

953
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,186
Hello, Ms. Yeon.

954
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,694
- Hi, U-ri.
- Let me take you to the conference room.

955
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:02,666
Mr. Han. Ms. Yeon is here.

956
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:03,841
Okay.

957
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:05,549
U-ri.

958
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,297
Yes?

959
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:14,045
Well... Are you all right?

960
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:17,216
Pardon? Why?

961
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:19,483
No, I was just...

962
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,860
I was worried about you.

963
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:26,108
Did you talk it out with your co-workers?

964
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:28,741
I hope you don't feel
uncomfortable around me.

965
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:34,568
They apologized to me
and we cleared up the misunderstandings.

966
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:37,078
And I'm all right.

967
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,580
I owe you an apology.

968
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,837
I shouldn't have made you uncomfortable
by expressing my feelings.

969
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,632
But you don't have to worry about it.

970
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:50,133
It will never happen again.

971
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:52,425
I got over you now.

972
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:55,258
And I'm cool.

973
01:06:58,306 --> 01:06:59,386
Well, then.

974
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:17,445
Let's start the meeting in ten minutes.

975
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,914
I have something
to discuss with her first.

976
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:21,405
- Okay.
- Okay.

977
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:53,066
When can I expect to receive a draft?

978
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:57,158
By now, I need a specific timeline.

979
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,699
But you won't share your draft,

980
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:01,793
it's hard to get things moving.

981
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:07,174
I only have the ending part left.

982
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:09,961
I need some time to mull over it.

983
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,299
So you aren't sure about the deadline.
Is that what you mean?

984
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:15,716
Yes.

985
01:08:18,804 --> 01:08:21,644
When a writer can't decide an ending,
in most of the cases,

986
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,768
it's because the ending doesn't
seem convincing to readers.

987
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:29,769
If it's not convincing to yourself,

988
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:31,726
how are you supposed to
convince the readers?

989
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,612
You got out of a beat-up car,

990
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:40,367
but you bother to repair and
get back in it, such a happy ending...

991
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:45,001
It is not a very convincing ending.

992
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:53,875
It is easy to criticize destructively.

993
01:08:53,964 --> 01:08:56,844
How should I change the ending?

994
01:08:57,509 --> 01:09:00,139
I got out of the beat-up car,
and get hit by an even more beat-up car?

995
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:02,889
Or I sold a beat-up car
and got a Mercedes.

996
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:04,313
Turns out it was salvaged?

997
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:06,561
I got totally screwed? Fooled? Scammed?

998
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:09,227
It's way better than that.

999
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:12,481
"An even more beat-up car"?

1000
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:13,856
"Salvaged car"?

1001
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:16,952
Why? You thought you were a Mercedes?

1002
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,619
So, you'll show only the left side
of your face which you like,

1003
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,697
eat <i>naengmyeon</i> that you don't like,
acting like you love it,

1004
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,535
acting like you're happy
to become a princess of "Chicken Land,"

1005
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:30,917
is that the ending you really want?

1006
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:33,041
You called yourself genius.
You apparently aren't.

1007
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:34,628
You said you follow your instincts.

1008
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:38,473
You're dishonest,
not just with others, but with yourself.

1009
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:42,394
Or you don't know what you want.

1010
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:47,517
Do you want to say I'm pathetic?

1011
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:51,939
Do you want to insult me
by saying I'm shallow?

1012
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,031
But do you know what's really pathetic?

1013
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,864
When I heard someone didn't hate me,
I thought, "Does it mean he likes me?"

1014
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,277
Having that self-delusion,

1015
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:06,908
not knowing that was just false hope.

1016
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:09,368
Who are you talking about?

1017
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:12,376
When you were good to me,
you were just being kind and nice.

1018
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:14,666
When you gave me a hug, it was a free hug.

1019
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:17,633
When you kissed me, it was... a mistake?

1020
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:21,718
When you expressed your feelings about me,
it was an act. Right?

1021
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,717
Who is the dishonest one here?

1022
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,175
Was I the only one in that kiss?

1023
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,675
Didn't we agree that
it was mutual and simultaneous?

1024
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:32,148
And who said it was a mistake first?

1025
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:35,188
Then why did you
invite me over to your place?

1026
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:36,733
Don't you know what that implies?

1027
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:39,606
You were feeling me out
to see if I'd say yes.

1028
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:41,114
I didn't feel you out!

1029
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:43,106
If not, what was it then?

1030
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,626
You won't swallow your pride.

1031
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:04,216
You can't do what embarrasses you.
Not in a million years.

1032
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,051
You know what?

1033
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:11,434
I don't have a clue
what's in that incredible heart of yours,

1034
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:14,848
but if you can't verbalize your feelings,
don't show them in the first place.

1035
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:18,357
Because it only makes
the one who's misled a fool.

1036
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,680
TRUE TO LOVE

1037
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:52,095
Didn't I tell you I won't do it?

1038
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:53,943
{\an8}<i>I said I wasn't up for Deborah
from the start.</i>

1039
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:55,729
{\an8}<i>Hello? Is this "Kiddo?"</i>

1040
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,482
{\an8}- What?
- Don't get back with him.

1041
01:11:57,564 --> 01:11:59,574
{\an8}<i>You won't remember anything anyway,
'cause you're drunk.</i>

1042
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,189
{\an8}<i>Because you love him, you marry him,</i>

1043
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:03,566
{\an8}<i>you're pregnant, so you have a baby,
you'll just live like that?</i>

1044
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,533
{\an8}<i>You think I'm pathetic, right?
Jin-ho doesn't.</i>

1045
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:06,663
{\an8}<i>He says I can do it.</i>

1046
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,990
{\an8}Jin-ho, don't tell him I'm here.

1047
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,615
{\an8}Don't you need to go bring Yu-jeong?

1048
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:12,662
{\an8}<i>I should figure out what to say
after I say I'm sorry.</i>

1049
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:15,116
{\an8}<i>If I don't get it right at once,
it gets really serious.</i>

1050
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,456
{\an8}<i>I'm sorry I'm always late.</i>

1051
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:19,541
{\an8}<i>Besides an apology,
don't you have anything to tell me?</i>

1052
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:22,167
{\an8}I like you a lot, Su-hyeok.

1053
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:23,665
{\an8}<i>And do you know what it's like now?</i>

1054
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:24,877
{\an8}<i>Everything is a mess.</i>

01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,426
{\an8}<i>Still, you have nothing to tell me?</i>

01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:29,509
{\an8}<i>Thanks for keeping your promise
