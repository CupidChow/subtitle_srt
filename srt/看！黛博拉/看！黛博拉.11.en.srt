1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,963
TRUE TO LOVE

2
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,956
TRUE TO LOVE

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,501
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,881
What is it? Is something wrong?

5
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,719
Don't go.

6
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,097
No, you can't go.

7
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,268
What are you saying?

8
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,109
Bo-ra!

9
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,804
Tell me what this is all about.

10
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:22,935
You promised you'd go with me today.

11
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,771
You said you'd be a catfish.

12
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,773
You said you'd let me use you.

13
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,066
You have to keep your word.

14
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,782
I know where it is.
You should go there first. Okay?

15
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,077
Give me the keys.

16
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,931
She already sent out wedding invitations.

17
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,920
Yet she's lingering around
her ex-boyfriend. Don't you get it?

18
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:53,090
She's just shaking you up
to finish you off.

19
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,886
It's like shooting you again
to make sure you are really dead.

20
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,364
Sticking your nose in others' business
and crossing the line,

21
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,723
are you not done with it yet?

22
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,726
It is my business. I will take care of it.

23
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,855
You still think you broke up
because of me?

24
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,649
So if you give her the ring
you couldn't throw away,

25
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,401
you think you'd get her back?

26
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,777
Is that why you're going?

27
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:17,197
Who are you talking about exactly?
Aren't you talking about yourself?

28
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,410
"Are you sleeping?"

29
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,995
You said you know it meant nothing.

30
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,080
You'll obviously run into him,
it'd be awkward.

31
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,041
Still, you insist on going there.
For what?

32
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,709
To hear that he's regretting it?

33
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,419
Is that what you expect?

34
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,379
Coming from someone
who's bent over backwards

35
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:35,507
to win her ex back,
it doesn't sound so convincing.

36
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,427
Or is that why you're so sure of yourself?

37
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,892
Fine. That is why I'm so sure of myself.

38
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:48,520
A clingy ex who talks about
revenge or lingering love.

39
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,899
She just wants to see her ex
regret it and cry.

40
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,693
To fix her self-esteem
that had hit rock bottom,

41
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,947
even though she knows
how pathetic and low that is.

42
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,041
Whatever. Here it is.

43
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,819
Fine. Go.

44
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,700
Who cares whether you get hurt or not?

45
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,536
It's none of my business.

46
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,054
You can't come back if you go now.

47
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:10,644
EP 11
CAN'T WAIT FOR WINTER TO COME

48
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,116
Did you drink all that by yourself?

49
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,413
SANG-JUN

50
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,915
You still come over

51
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,210
when I say I miss you.

52
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,004
What a relief.

53
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,385
You'd better stop drinking.

54
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,017
What's the matter?

55
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,811
I tried on wedding dresses today.

56
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,690
I tried so many dresses all day.

57
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,485
But I didn't like any of them.

58
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,698
When I tried on the last one,

59
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,369
I felt dizzy and nauseous all of a sudden.

60
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,206
I came running outside.

61
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,125
But then I burst into tears.

62
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,840
- Su-hyeok, I think...
- Answer it.

63
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:27,763
No.

64
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,057
He keeps calling you. He's worried.

65
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,559
If I pick it up now,
I think I'll say I can't marry him.

66
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,478
Should I still pick it up?

67
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,522
Do you want me to?

68
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,496
I regret so much

69
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,165
the way we broke up that day.

70
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,168
Over time,

71
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:03,257
I might regret this very moment
when I still could turn back.

72
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,801
It scares me.

73
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,513
I regretted, too.

74
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,812
I'm regretting right this moment, too.

75
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,123
Unlock the car.

76
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,095
Why are you so tired?

77
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,763
You slept early last night.

78
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:52,973
I know.

79
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,934
By the way, where were you at dawn?

80
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,853
You were not in bed.

81
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,063
Where would I go?

82
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,441
Where else could I be
besides the bathroom in the house?

83
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,402
You've got a call.

84
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,945
- It's Bo-ra.
- I know.

85
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,031
Hey.

86
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,616
We're leaving now.

87
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,544
Yeon Bo-ra.

88
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,630
Get in.

89
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:26,965
Okay.

90
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,218
What's going on?

91
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,472
Hi, Jin-woo.

92
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,681
Hey, how are you?

93
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:35,766
Why are you so down?

94
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,769
Weren't you going with Su-hyeok?

95
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,146
I don't know.

96
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,649
He ran away.

97
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,903
I loved you very much, too.

98
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,697
Maybe more than you did.

99
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,909
I couldn't ask you to be my girlfriend...

100
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,330
because I believed you already were.

101
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,044
If I ever got married,
I wanted to marry you.

102
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,160
That's why I bought a ring
for the first time in my life.

103
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:09,883
But...

104
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,680
But... that day?

105
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,935
I said I wanted to break up.

106
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,277
What on earth did I do?

107
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,196
I blew it.

108
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,617
I shouldn't have listened to her.

109
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,038
The fact that we broke up
because of someone else,

110
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,874
really...

111
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,258
By the way,

112
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,593
are you okay?

113
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,430
I heard you work with that woman, Deborah.

114
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,308
You get repulsed by that sort of person

115
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,852
who says whatever they like
without a filter.

116
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,105
I know you can't stand
dealing with someone you dislike.

117
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,315
It's not like that.

118
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,567
I got her apology.

119
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,402
I mean...

120
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,863
Not that she owed me an apology.

121
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,242
Then, on that day,

122
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,369
was it because of her?

123
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,539
When I gave you the invitation,

124
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,334
you were cold to me.

125
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,174
I guess that was why.

126
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,509
Did she say that?

127
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,804
That I was two-timing and moved on
with someone else straight away?

128
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,433
If I really did,
how could I possibly see you like this?

129
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,602
That's ridiculous.

130
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,770
Yu-ri.

131
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,522
Let me finish.

132
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,901
The reason why I didn't
take out the ring that day...

133
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,113
was because I didn't want to.

134
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,701
No matter how harshly
you blamed and insulted me,

135
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,205
I would have taken it out if I wanted to.

136
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,709
That was just how far my heart could go.

137
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,763
Had I told you this sooner,

138
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,015
it would've been easier
for you to move on.

139
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,101
That's what I regretted.

140
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:26,895
That's why I came.

141
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,067
And...

142
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,195
I wanted to sincerely congratulate you
on your marriage.

143
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:49,543
I longed to hear that you loved me.

144
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,756
Little did I know that
I'd hear it like this.

145
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,427
You couldn't say those words
for four years.

146
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,471
I guess you can now, right?

147
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,894
Yes.

148
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,859
I'm planning to try.

149
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,411
I didn't know you were here.
I looked everywhere for you.

150
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,163
Why didn't you answer your phone...

151
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,465
Hello.

152
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,552
I'm Lee Su-hyeok
I was a senior at her school.

153
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,804
Oh, hello.

154
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:47,309
Everyone was supposed to gather
to get her invitation today.

155
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,686
But they bailed on her
because something came up.

156
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,730
She's pretty disappointed by that.

157
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,359
There's no need to cry.

158
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,361
It's because you're drunk, right?

159
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,822
After all those years,
you haven't changed.

160
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,283
Is this true?

161
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,914
There's no need to cry.
You cried earlier, you're making me worry.

162
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,588
Is it because of the dresses?

163
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,173
You looked beautiful in all of them.

164
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,343
I couldn't say which was best
'cause you looked gorgeous in anything.

165
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,888
So don't be mad and lighten up, please?

166
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,606
It's not like I'm mad...

167
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,738
Look here!

168
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,452
You look lovely!

169
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,955
Look into each other's eyes.

170
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,333
Beautiful!

171
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,013
There they are.

172
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,431
Eun-ju!

173
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,558
Eun-ju!

174
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,977
Bo-ra!

175
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,273
Jin-woo!

176
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,651
Oh, my gosh.

177
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,736
- You look so beautiful.
- So pretty!

178
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,739
Do I look okay? Thanks for coming.

179
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,449
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

180
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,577
I'm glad you made it all right.

181
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,829
By the way, are you okay?

182
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,581
You look so distressed.

183
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,667
Who would have thought
you guys would end up that way?

184
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,085
Even I'm upset about it.

185
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,129
Tell me about it.

186
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,340
That's why they say you never know
till you enter the wedding hall.

187
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,638
By the way, you need some touch-up.

188
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,057
Your makeup is all smudged already.

189
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,518
You're saying
this dewy makeup looks greasy...

190
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,980
You're such a jokester!

191
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,941
Ju-mi!

192
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,485
I thought you were bringing
a plus-one today.

193
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,695
Are you by yourself?

194
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,698
Yes, that's how it turned out.

195
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,242
I see.

196
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:15,248
Anyways, I wish you can feel the joys
that only a happy married woman can feel.

197
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,583
You're not getting any younger.

198
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,003
Well, I'm not really up for it.

199
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,047
Who gets so crazy about marriage
these days?

200
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,381
Staying single is the trend.

201
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,009
I thought so, too.

202
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,011
But people who can,
do get married after all.

203
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,056
Right.

204
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,099
Hurry and go get changed.

205
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,685
- All right. Yu-jeong!
- Yeah?

206
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,229
- Let's go get changed.
- Okay.

207
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,523
Bo-ra!

208
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:46,571
Consider champagne as a prop.
Let us not drink it.

209
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,157
Today is such a good day.

210
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,034
You know what I mean?

211
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,330
- We'll go get changed.
- Okay.

212
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,540
Honey!

213
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,255
Should I kick her ass or not?

214
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,840
Don't. Put up with her.

215
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,846
WEDDING OF
HYUN-MYEONG & EUN-JU

216
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,273
There they come.

217
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,320
- Is it everybody?
- Yes.

218
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,447
Let's get started then.

219
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:32,158
Gracefully. Look at the camera.

220
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,287
Now look at each other and cheers.

221
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,832
Congratulations. What a lovely day.

222
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,459
- Let's go to the next spot.
- Okay.

223
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,670
Bo-ra.

224
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,004
It's a prop.

225
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,509
Have a nice trip.

226
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,095
Look excited.

227
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,763
Wait a moment.

228
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,098
Hi, Ju-wan.

229
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,393
Ju-wan said he's running late
because of work.

230
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,602
He might not make it.

231
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,020
What? Ju-wan?

232
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,608
Is that so?

233
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,242
He's not coming?

234
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,536
Is he avoiding me or what?

235
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,289
I was going to raise hell with him
and make a real scene.

236
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,337
Just kidding.

237
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,508
Let's keep going.

238
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,260
Look lively!

239
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,262
Okay!

240
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,557
Elegantly. Good.

241
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,601
Stand closer.

242
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,561
Like you're best friends.

243
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,856
Bride and groom, show your ring, please.

244
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,942
Bling, good.

245
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:53,239
Let's go to the pool
and get some glamorous shots.

246
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,700
Here we go. One, two...

247
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,828
Please, groom.

248
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,580
What?

249
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,956
- Smile.
- I see.

250
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,708
Let's do this.

251
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,294
You got this, man.

252
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,879
Here we go. You can do it!

253
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,507
Let's go. One, two...

254
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,511
Groom!

255
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,845
Focus.

256
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,765
You're not the only one who's tired.
Everyone is tired.

257
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,225
I would smile if I could.

258
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:22,936
What's that?

259
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,398
Smile.

260
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,733
Okay, I will.

261
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,736
- Let's just get this over with.
- What did you just say?

262
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,322
"Get this over with"?

263
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,162
Answer carefully.

264
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,957
- Or this could get ugly.
- What did I do now?

265
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,001
You heard what I said.
Let's just get this over with!

266
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,212
Chill out, man.

267
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,967
Fine, screw this!

268
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,094
Hey, calm down. Wait.

269
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,470
What's with you?

270
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,555
Screw it!

271
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,216
Eun-ju, you're bleeding.

272
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,386
Hey, are you...

273
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,721
Are you okay?

274
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,139
Blood...

275
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,245
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

276
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,830
Not at all.

277
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:06,956
Not one bit.

278
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,249
Right.

279
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,378
This is the worst.

280
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,966
He's marrying me because I insisted.

281
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,510
Otherwise, I thought he'd never marry me.

282
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,390
We don't do it anymore.

283
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,144
I don't even remember
the last time we did it.

284
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:32,899
What do I do?

285
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,442
My goodness...

286
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,111
What do I do?

287
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:38,696
Tell me.

288
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,033
Breaking off an engagement is no big deal
and will lead to a rosy future.

289
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,117
Tell me

290
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:46,204
that marriage solves everything and
makes you happy without exception.

291
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,002
Please?

292
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,012
Hey, let's go out.

293
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,190
Let me see. Are you all right?

294
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,991
I'm so sorry, honey.

295
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,284
I screwed up. You get a nosebleed

296
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,537
when you're worked up
with low blood pressure.

297
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,706
Whatever! Forget it!

298
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,873
Screw everything.

299
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,709
- You don't want to do it.
- I don't...

300
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,336
want to fight.

301
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,798
We've been fighting constantly lately,
that was so hard.

302
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,137
Let's work this out, shall we?

303
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,805
I will try harder.

304
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,932
What do you mean?

305
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,184
Trying means you're forced to do it.

306
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,894
I am going to try because I love you.

307
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,688
I want to try because I love you.

308
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,233
<i>Despite that, I tried harder.</i>

309
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,402
And everything was getting better.

310
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,529
But you ruined everything.

311
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,948
Trying is not love.

312
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,451
<i>The moment when the bare truth is exposed,</i>

313
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,327
<i>I have to admit</i>

314
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,996
<i>that I'm not okay,</i>

315
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,123
<i>that I wasn't happy with him,</i>

316
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,668
<i>and that our relationship
had already ended a long time ago.</i>

317
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:16,919
I love you.

318
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,465
For real?

319
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,019
Jeez, I have a nosebleed.

320
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,520
Look at all this.

321
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,025
What's all this?

322
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,401
This one's pretty good, babe.

323
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:41,778
Whatever.

324
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,115
They're unbelievable...

325
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:52,955
Hey, Ju-wan.

326
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,417
- Parking?
- Is Ju-wan here?

327
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,629
You can park at the entrance. We did, too.

328
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,797
Okay.

329
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,298
Okay. Hurry up.

330
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,382
What is it?

331
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,303
Ju-wan's here.

332
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,472
Where is she going?

333
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,681
I don't know.

334
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,644
Isn't she going to
go head-to-head with Ju-wan?

335
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,147
- No way...
- No.

336
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,650
- No.
- She can't be.

337
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,402
Hey, that's impossible...

338
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,115
Did you come out to greet me?

339
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:11,826
Kind of.

340
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,836
You didn't get in trouble
while I was away, did you?

341
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:27,842
Let's go.

342
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,044
This is my friend who's getting married.

343
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,670
And this is

344
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,591
Lee Su-hyeok, my friend and co-worker.

345
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,595
Let me apologize for Bo-ra.

346
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,847
I should have come sooner
to keep her out of trouble.

347
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,642
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- What's that?

348
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,019
I'm glad you came.

349
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,814
Bo-ra didn't say anything.
I didn't know you'd make it.

350
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,943
Are you still shy to talk about me?

351
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,364
What are you talking about?

352
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,700
He said he couldn't make it
since he had other plans today.

353
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:38,496
This place looks really nice.

354
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,039
Can you show me around?

355
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,166
Sure.

356
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,709
- Let's go.
- Excuse us.

357
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:44,835
Sure.

358
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,884
Ju-wan!

359
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,511
Congratulations.

360
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,643
Let's get inside.

361
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,936
Who was that?

362
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,562
Unbelievable.

363
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,564
Come here already.

364
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:13,072
How did you make it when you're so worried
about your ex who's getting married?

365
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,532
I said I'd come.

366
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,534
So you're a man of your word?

367
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,997
You're holding my hand without asking.

368
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,128
Did you forget?

369
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,422
Catfish effect.

370
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,675
To cause jealousy,

371
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,844
you'd need to do this bit of acting.

372
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:49,066
So your name is Su-hyeok, right?

373
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,944
Come join us.

374
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,655
- Yes, join us.
- You can have a seat here.

375
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:55,740
Please do join us.

376
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,116
Okay.

377
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:00,995
It could use some salt.

378
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,538
Don't we have garlic?

379
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:09,378
So what's going on with you and Bo-ra?

380
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,089
Us?

381
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,008
Well...

382
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,719
I wonder how I can
describe our relationship.

383
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,224
We share each other's secrets.

384
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,143
We sweat together.

385
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,832
We do many things together.
That's how I'd put our relationship.

386
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:32,151
Why would you sweat together?

387
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,277
Oh, my.

388
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,532
There is something going on, right?

389
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:39,867
I like Bo-ra...

390
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:41,869
a lot.

391
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,999
I'd need to win favor
with her friends, right?

392
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,128
So I guess that's why
you tagged along today.

393
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,300
I assume you don't drink.

394
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,928
No, not with Bo-ra.

395
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,181
When she's drunk, she gets so adorable.

396
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,891
To see that,

397
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,893
I decided not to get drunk with her.

398
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:09,897
I guess you haven't seen her
wasted all the way yet.

399
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,107
I know.

400
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,610
Why?

401
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,195
That's why I fell for her.

402
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,083
Cute.

403
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,378
Isn't she just adorable?

404
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,090
Adorable indeed.

405
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:42,930
What's going on?

406
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,683
Just a pretend play.

407
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,896
How did you two first meet each other?

408
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,152
<i>I was in a jewelry store to pick a ring
that I wanted to get.</i>

409
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,155
<i>He was getting a ring for someone.
He had to pick the ring I chose.</i>

410
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,408
<i>He got dumped. So did I.
So two poor and lonely souls met.</i>

411
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,326
<i>Can't tell this long story.</i>

412
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,412
As for the first time I met her,

413
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:10,708
we ran into each other at a wedding
of our mutual friend a few years back.

414
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,168
Yeah.

415
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,211
I still vividly remember it.

416
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:18,591
She was in a black dress

417
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,134
and turned toward me.

418
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,095
That moment,

419
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:25,389
it felt like time passed slowly.
It was in slow motion.

420
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,725
Then when our eyes met,

421
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,146
she took my breath away.

422
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,566
No way. 'Cause she was so beautiful?

423
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,026
Love at first sight?

424
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,403
Something like that, I think.

425
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:41,614
She was so beautiful
that it was unrealistic.

426
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,241
Way to go, girl.

427
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,494
Who's that guy?

428
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,621
- Su-hyeok?
- Oh, Su-hyeok?

429
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,706
After that brief encounter,

430
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,750
I didn't expect to see her again.

431
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:56,295
Then after a few serendipitous moments,
we came to work together.

432
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,796
Then it hit me.

433
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,760
"Is this what you call destiny?"

434
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,931
I normally don't believe in destiny.

435
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,476
But I came to believe in
what I didn't believe.

436
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:14,230
I came to be grateful for everything

437
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,524
that turned our serendipity into destiny.

438
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,861
I've become a changed man
ever since I met Bo-ra.

439
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,699
Come on.

440
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:29,119
Breaking off an engagement doesn't sound
like a bad idea right now.

441
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,335
Congrats.

442
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,380
- Jin-woo.
- What?

443
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:40,714
What are you doing?

444
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,521
Now you're scaring me.

445
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,108
Did I get too deep into character?

446
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,736
I'm doing method acting.

447
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,906
Don't go too far.

448
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,078
So cute.

449
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:14,707
One moment.

450
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,299
So deluded meeting you...

451
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,051
So delighted meeting you.

452
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,306
Same here.

453
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,730
That's one firm grip you got there.
You must be in good shape.

454
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,131
- We'll be off.
- Okay.

455
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,633
- Let's go.
- Sure.

456
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,760
Bye.

457
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,287
What are you doing?

458
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,833
Being a catfish.
I'm doing it right while I'm at it.

459
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,217
What the...

460
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,783
I was outside all day long.

461
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,034
I have a runny nose.

462
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,419
Are you looking for the ring?

463
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,796
No, I was looking for this.

464
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:37,099
I thought you probably had
thrown it into the river.

465
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,517
I see you didn't.

466
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,144
I was going to, but...

467
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:43,272
I remembered
all the remaining monthly installments.

468
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,690
So I couldn't dare to.

469
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,195
TV shows and reality
are different, indeed.

470
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:56,785
So, what are you going to do with
that tiny, sparkly, and expensive garbage?

471
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,829
I'm not sure.

472
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:04,126
You want to buy it from me?

473
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,461
I know you liked it.

474
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,628
What?

475
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,047
Unopened, brand-new product.

476
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,467
I'll give you a discount.

477
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,136
Are you kidding me?

478
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:19,767
I'm sorry about earlier.

479
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,978
I just...

480
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:25,814
didn't want you to go.

481
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:28,692
I know

482
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,111
that you were worried about me.

483
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,909
So,

484
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,995
did you cry in front of her?

485
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,040
I thought about crying,

486
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,501
but I failed to bring myself to tears.

487
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,380
I went to tell her something,

488
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:55,010
so that we can have closure.

489
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,772
I went there today

490
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,732
not necessarily because of him.

491
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:11,610
It's not fair.

492
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,487
I already gave up on the <i>naengmyeon</i> place.

493
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,697
So why do I have to keep distance
from my friends?

494
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:18,534
Right...

495
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:21,870
Right.

496
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,218
Looks like autumn is coming to an end.

497
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,596
The smell of the wind
has changed overnight.

498
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,730
You said you were cold
staying outside all day long.

499
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,066
You're going to catch a cold.

500
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:56,196
Are you sad the seasons are changing?

501
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,493
Nope.

502
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,288
I can't wait for winter to come.

503
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,422
You wanna eat something?

504
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,215
Or coffee first?

505
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:17,509
I don't know. Isn't there anything else?

506
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:19,011
Is there anything you wanna do?

507
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:21,930
I'll think about it.

508
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,056
Okay.

509
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,590
TUNE IN FOR WEBFLIX TONIGHT

510
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,094
You wanted to eat chicken, didn't you?

511
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,097
With chicken and beer,

512
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,060
watching WEBFLIX and hanging out,

513
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,312
that should be fun, right?

514
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,981
So what are you saying?
You want to go to a motel?

515
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,566
What?

516
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,817
Did I say that?

517
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,738
Bo-mi. Car.

518
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,699
Watch out. It's dangerous.

519
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,125
What's wrong?

520
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,877
It's really okay with me.

521
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:38,507
It's not okay. For 150,000 won.
It's a waste of money. Let's go.

522
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:43,095
They said weekend rates are all high.
The room is big and it's a suite.

523
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,390
Most of all, I'm really okay with it.

524
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,517
I'm okay even if I spend all I have.

525
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,560
Come on.

526
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,729
Is 150,000 won all you have?

527
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,856
You're going to splurge tonight?

528
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:58,568
Let's go.
We can order chicken at the Han River.

529
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:00,654
Okay? Come on.

530
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,201
Let's go.

531
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,540
Always the Han River.

532
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,125
It's cold.

533
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,209
Wait, Bo-mi.

534
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,674
Yes, Jin-woo.

535
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,010
What?

536
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,178
Really?

537
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,556
So you're not coming home tonight?

538
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,142
Yu-jeong either?

539
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,102
<i>It just happened that way.</i>

540
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,979
<i>We could be late due to a traffic jam.</i>

541
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,564
<i>Can you open the store tomorrow?</i>

542
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,816
Don't you worry about a thing.

543
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,401
Jin-woo.

544
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,194
Really love...

545
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,365
Have a really lovely time with your wife.

546
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,742
Okay. Peace!

547
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:51,580
Hand.

548
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,313
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

549
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,444
You were supposed to drive,
how could you get drunk?

550
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,197
You should've told me not to drink
if you were going to drink.

551
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,034
The other ones drank
because they booked a room.

552
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,745
You got no plans or whatever...

553
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,331
Saw what Su-hyeok did?

554
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,042
He didn't drink a drop
in order to give Bo-ra a ride.

555
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:41,546
Come on, it's nice
to be like old times again.

556
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,841
Yu-jeong.

557
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:46,176
You trust me, don't you?

558
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,719
I'll just hold your hand in bed.

559
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,058
Yu-jeong.

560
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,692
<i>Are you going somewhere?</i>

561
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,736
<i>Yes.</i>

562
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:15,872
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

563
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,334
<i>I...</i>

564
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,294
<i>Let's just break up.</i>

565
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:22,379
Jin-woo.

566
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:23,797
Yeah?

567
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,466
How come we don't do it?

568
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:28,635
What?

569
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,429
We can do it right now.

570
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:36,309
No, I'm serious.

571
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,019
I'm asking out of curiosity.

572
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,022
How come we don't do it after marriage?

573
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,359
Well...

574
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,696
Because you can do it at any time
once you're married?

575
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,700
- 'Cause you can do it at any time?
- Yes.

576
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,828
That's the reason why we don't do it...

577
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,915
Does that make sense?

578
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,459
In that case,

579
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:05,672
what if we didn't get married
and just kept dating?

580
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,633
It would have been different, right?

581
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,555
It's just that

582
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:16,725
Eun-ju asked me
if marriage makes me happy.

583
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,268
I couldn't say anything.

584
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,899
Not that I'm unhappy now.

585
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:28,528
I couldn't wait to marry you

586
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:31,531
because I wanted to have
a romance with you my whole life.

587
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:37,204
Turns out marriage and romance
are two different things.

588
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,375
To be honest,

589
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,838
I sometimes regret it.

590
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,353
You good-for-nothing...

591
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,702
This way.

592
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,583
Very interesting.

593
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,002
It's quite cozy.

594
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:27,379
- I know, right?
- Yes.

595
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,423
Give it to me.

596
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,426
Here.

597
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:41,810
You can sit here.

598
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:45,480
This is where Jin-woo hangs out
in the middle of the night

599
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,564
hiding from Yu-jeong?

600
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:51,528
Yes, he said men need some alone time
after marriage.

601
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:56,157
That's not fair.
Are all men like that after marriage?

602
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,327
You'd be like that too, right?

603
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:00,870
Never.

604
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:04,624
I'll be with you all day long.
Don't you worry about it, babe.

605
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,252
Why would I worry about that?

606
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,587
Are you going to marry me?

607
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:10,964
Of course!

608
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,509
What, you're not going to?

609
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,013
I'll start thinking about it.

610
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,852
But really, I love this space.

611
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,729
- Really?
- Yes.

612
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,857
Let's take over this place.

613
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,111
How?

614
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:36,614
What?

615
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,452
You think she knows?

616
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,120
No, not yet.

617
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,374
She's got a hunch. She sensed
something's off. Maybe that much.

618
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,878
By the way, where were you at dawn?

619
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,379
You were not in bed.

620
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,048
I knew it.

621
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,549
That's why she put out a feeler.

622
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,468
So, from now on,

623
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,502
you shouldn't come downstairs.

624
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,763
Or I could get kicked out.

625
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,349
- Got it?
- Sure thing.

626
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,392
Good.

627
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,028
Enjoy.

628
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,321
Thanks.

629
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:19,449
- Jin-ho.
- Yes?

630
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:21,618
I heard you have a girlfriend.

631
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,371
Is it Ms. Destiny
you were talking about before?

632
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,332
That's why you rejected me.

633
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,167
What a disappointment.

634
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,588
I heard her name is Bom-yi.

635
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,550
When are you going to
introduce Bom-yi to us?

636
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:44,724
She's a little shy.

637
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:49,896
Oh, she's a shy person.

638
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,439
Too bad.

639
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:54,734
Still, make sure to introduce her
if you get a chance.

640
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,653
Okay.

641
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:02,784
So funny.

642
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:11,960
NEW POST

643
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,422
"Be first

644
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:20,510
and be lonely."

645
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,808
EUN-JU HAS SHARED 12 PHOTOS

646
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,335
How cute.

647
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:56,880
Everybody knows they're seeing each other.

648
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,132
Assuming we really don't know?

649
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:04,429
Should I keep acting like
I have no idea or not?

650
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:08,433
I know.

651
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,684
He's so cute.

652
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,358
What?

653
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:18,735
I'm talking about you.

654
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:21,988
What's going on with you and Su-hyeok?

655
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,406
There's something going on.

656
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,158
There's nothing.

657
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:31,372
It's nothing.

658
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:32,665
I told you before.

659
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,375
That was just a mistake.

660
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,211
So, what is that mistake?

661
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,699
- Did you two sleep together?
- No, we didn't! Just kiss...

662
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,638
We kissed. That's all.

663
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:47,931
Kiss?

664
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:50,391
- Keep it down.
- That's really no big deal.

665
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,143
Well, it happens.

666
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:54,604
When a man and woman
get swept up in the mood when drunk,

667
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:55,897
they could kiss sometimes.

668
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:58,525
We weren't drunk.

669
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:01,861
In a coin karaoke.

670
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,072
You were completely sober?

671
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,115
Where? Coin karaoke?

672
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:07,200
Yes.

673
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:09,077
Where young folks go?

674
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,411
Yes.

675
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:18,086
You two seriously hit it off.

676
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,046
That's not a mistake.

677
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,632
Well, it was me who started it.

678
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:23,841
Not him.

679
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,011
He said he didn't?

680
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:30,598
That's odd.

681
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,727
But the way he looks at you
is so romantic.

682
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:43,194
No, that day, we were just

683
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,613
like Mulder and Scully,

684
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,783
or DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.

685
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,244
That's how we agreed to
define our relationship.

686
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,662
- So you should...
- What's that?

687
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:57,542
Like...

688
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,544
I see. Whatever.

689
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,379
Let me know when you two sleep together.

690
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:03,923
You really have to tell me this time.

691
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,725
<i>What time should we meet today?</i>

692
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,186
<i>Sorry, I sent it to the wrong number.</i>

693
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:19,981
<i>The one I'm meeting today
has the same name as you.</i>

694
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,357
What?

695
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:24,444
<i>Her name is Lee Bo-ra,
I just saved her first name.</i>

696
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:27,905
What's this staged show about?

697
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,075
What is this about?

698
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:39,125
He might have sent it by mistake.

699
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,044
<i>That was what I hoped.</i>

700
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:43,755
<i>But I kept receiving messages</i>

701
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,883
<i>from him and I couldn't
understand his intentions.</i>

702
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:53,556
<i>I didn't want to bother to
respond to his messages anymore.</i>

703
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,436
<i>But they were the messages I had to reply.</i>

704
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:01,731
<i>I checked out your social media.
I see you unfollowed me.</i>

705
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,566
<i>Yes, I did. Why?</i>

706
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,115
<i>I didn't. I wonder if I was supposed to.</i>

707
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:16,287
<i>Were you near our company yesterday?</i>

708
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,539
<i>Someone told me they saw you there.</i>

709
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,709
<i>I wasn't...</i>

710
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:24,671
<i>Must be someone who looks like me.</i>

711
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,175
<i>I need to rush to the meeting.</i>

712
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:30,593
<i>I'll get back to you later.</i>

713
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:43,481
<i>It's nice outside,
don't you have a date with your boyfriend?</i>

714
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,735
<i>I guess you like him very much.</i>

715
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,237
<i>You're already dating someone.</i>

716
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,781
<i>I can't move on yet.</i>

717
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:57,328
NOH JU-WAN

718
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,388
DELETED MESSAGE

719
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,226
<i>You got something to tell me,
by any chance?</i>

720
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,562
<i>What is it that you want to tell me?</i>

721
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,821
<i>Can I see you later today?</i>

722
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:51,299
That day, I didn't get around
to say bye to you properly.

723
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,926
I just wanted to talk with you.

724
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:56,971
I see.

725
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:00,892
Well...

726
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:04,145
How's it going with him?

727
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:07,982
Not that it's any of my business.

728
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,693
Su-hyeok?

729
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:12,278
We're not dating.

730
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,322
We got closer through work.

731
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,243
Did you go back to work?

732
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,954
Yes, I'm trying.

733
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:27,084
Unlike my previous self-help books about
romantic relationships, it's an essay.

734
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:30,129
It is difficult to write about myself.

735
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:31,464
But it's fun.

736
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:36,344
By the way,

737
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:39,806
you seem to have changed.

738
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:41,599
Really?

739
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:43,309
I'm the same.

740
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:50,775
The thing is, I was really worried
about you that day.

741
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,403
Worried? About what?

742
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:56,906
You know, to be honest,

743
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:01,160
everybody there knows about us
and that we broke up not that long ago.

744
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:04,747
While I was around,

745
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:09,544
you were touchy-feely with another man,
and publicly displayed affection and all.

746
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,046
I bet they would frown upon it.

747
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:16,676
Though they didn't say it,
it could undermine your reputation.

748
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,344
That's why I was worried.

749
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:20,888
I couldn't help but worry.

750
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,684
I see...

751
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,436
I haven't thought about it like that.

752
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:33,067
But did I do something wrong there?

753
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,986
No.

754
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,029
I'm not saying you did anything wrong.

755
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,198
It's just him.

756
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:41,325
I understand that he likes you.

757
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:43,911
But considering that you work together,

758
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:45,997
he probably thinks
you're a bit easygoing with him,

759
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,208
since you're so nice to him.

760
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:51,419
That's what I'm concerned about.

761
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:55,047
Frankly, a lot of men do that
just on impulse,

762
00:52:55,965 --> 00:53:00,177
because of your fame or glamorous looks,

763
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,513
for no reason because you just broke up,

764
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:07,184
using work as an excuse,
and cross the line when you're off guard.

765
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:08,895
Seriously...

766
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,479
That's how you see me, I guess.

767
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,983
Anyone who approaches me
is being impulsive, or it's for no reason.

768
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:16,819
Am I that unattractive?

769
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:19,864
No, that's not what I meant.

770
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:23,701
I just don't want you to get hurt anymore.

771
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,330
You don't need to worry about that.

772
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,540
And he's a very good man.

773
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,378
I see.

774
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:37,757
Okay.

775
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,808
Well...

776
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:49,685
About what I suggested before.

777
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,187
What do you think?

778
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,399
I suggested that we become friends.

779
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:57,985
We can do that now, can't we?

780
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,449
Sure. Though we're not besties,

781
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,660
we can reach out to each other
for major occasions.

782
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,244
I think we could do that.

783
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:10,915
Right.

784
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,043
<i>He has become my past.</i>

785
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:18,381
<i>The memories are glamorized
and I didn't hate him anymore.</i>

786
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:20,841
You see, Bo-ra.

787
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,552
What you saw before

788
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,221
was really a mistake.

789
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:27,974
Believe me. It really was.

790
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:31,978
Okay.

791
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:34,397
<i>I answered,
but I didn't believe what he said.</i>

792
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:36,691
<i>What I have in my memories is true.</i>

793
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,444
<i>And what he did that day
wasn't probably a mistake.</i>

794
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,573
<i>Just as what I did with him
wasn't a mistake.</i>

795
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,346
- What are you doing?
- You scared me!

796
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:13,519
I'm just taking progress photos.

797
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:16,981
You've become even prettier.

798
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,275
How pretty are you going to get?

799
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:23,320
Why are you looking at me like that?

800
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:26,407
You're going to take my breath away again.

801
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,662
When is that chilling
method acting of yours

802
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:33,122
ever going to end?

803
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:34,749
I know.

804
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:38,419
It's not easy to get out of character.

805
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:42,715
Despite my mad acting skills,
there was no catfish effect, I guess?

806
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:44,592
I know.

807
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,552
Maybe the catfish wasn't good.

808
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,262
There's no reaction from the sardine.

809
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,349
On that note, why don't we...

810
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:58,105
You two look great together.

811
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:02,359
I hope I didn't interrupt you.

812
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:05,488
I guess you have a lot of things to do.

813
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,448
Let's catch up later in our meeting.

814
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,366
- Well...
- Let's go...

815
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:14,205
Don't say another word...

816
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,998
Jeez...

817
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,793
Hey, I bet you guys are dying to
make out again.

818
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,396
Then you'll act like nothing happened.

819
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:23,047
I shouldn't have told you.

820
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,966
It's somewhat so sexy.

821
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:28,094
You kiss like animals and go,

822
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,262
"That was a mistake, Su-hyeok."

823
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:33,474
"I understand, Bo-ra.
You can't resist a man like me."

824
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,309
That's how it goes.

825
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:38,646
That is exactly what I wanted.

826
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,107
It's not like that. We are...

827
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,109
Yeah, Mulder and whatever.

828
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:45,069
What exactly does that mean?

829
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,324
<i>I said we're like Mulder and Scully.</i>

830
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,994
<i>He said we're like
DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.</i>

831
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,082
<i>What did I mean by that?</i>

832
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:04,088
<i>What does he have on his mind?</i>

833
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,816
<i>Let's not get ahead of myself.</i>

834
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,776
<i>Don't be fooled by those romantic eyes.</i>

835
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,382
<i>That's how low you are,</i>

836
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,885
though you'll never admit it.

837
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:31,050
Hey.

838
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:35,512
Now that our company has grown,

839
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:39,099
I think we need to care
more about employee benefits.

840
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:41,936
So I thought about it.

841
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,733
How about we provide lunch for them?

842
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,653
Food expenses are already covered.

843
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:54,615
Lunch prices have gone up so much
these days.

844
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:57,660
If they can enjoy lunch
without anyone feeling left out,

845
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:59,328
they'll like it, don't you think?

846
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:01,330
Right.

847
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,917
By the way, who's feeling left out?

848
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:06,460
You mean U-ri?

849
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,755
Is this because of U-ri?

850
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,174
Why do you care so much about her?

851
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,637
Come on, I don't.

852
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:20,849
Am I wrong? What you dread the most
is using the company credit card.

853
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:22,810
Ever since U-ri joined us,

854
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,896
you used it for a uniform, gift cards,
and taxi fare...

855
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,898
You've been spending money like water.

856
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:32,486
I'm trying to boost company morale,
as the president.

857
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,616
She packs lunch every single day

858
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,703
and commutes for three hours
to work and back.

859
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:44,415
That's an admirable effort,
and I feel bad as well.

860
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:45,833
That is why.

861
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,632
I didn't know you're such a generous
Daddy-Long-Legs.

862
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:58,012
Or what?

863
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:02,099
What are you getting at?

864
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:06,770
No, it can't be what I'm thinking.
If you have an ounce of consciousness...

865
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:13,485
I've thought about the original direction
and concept of the book.

866
01:00:16,572 --> 01:00:18,157
"After heartbreak and break-up,

867
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,659
there has to be a victory again."
It's good till that part.

868
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,621
However, I've started to doubt
whether that victory has to be

869
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:26,332
getting back with an ex.

870
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:28,208
Rather than getting back an ex,

871
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:32,296
something that indicates
growth or a new beginning

872
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,132
with a kind of open ending
lines up more with the trend these days.

873
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:39,053
I believe it will also contribute to
raising the quality of our book.

874
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,220
How's that sound?

875
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:45,392
In fact, we've talked about this as well.

876
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:47,811
What people can relate to
after a breakup is,

877
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:50,105
"Gone is the beat-up car
and here comes the Mercedes."

878
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:51,607
Not "Get the beat-up car back"

879
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,902
or "repair and drive the beat-up car."

880
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,363
You could let the beat-up car go
and get a license,

881
01:00:57,446 --> 01:00:59,698
or you could also buy a brand-new car.

882
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:02,659
Like in the movie <i>500 Days of Summer,</i>

883
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:03,869
the ending is like that.

884
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:07,831
The male lead breaks up with
a woman named Summer.

885
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:10,667
Then he meets a woman named Autumn
at the end of the movie.

886
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:14,546
So, after 500 days of summer,

887
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:18,258
the first day of autumn begins.
How about that kind of ending?

888
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:22,679
What do you think?

889
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:27,559
I like it.

890
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,479
The end of summer is
the beginning of autumn.

891
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:33,607
The last day of summer
is the first day of autumn.

892
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:38,487
It's an essay, so we should
follow the author's instinct.

893
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:47,329
One of my friends said
she just cannot wait for your new book.

894
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:49,748
Young people have a soft spot
for love stories.

895
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:51,083
Absolutely.

896
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,669
More than your own romantic relationships,

897
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,296
others' love stories and romance
are way more fun.

898
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,965
I totally agree with you.

899
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,758
To me, romance in books

900
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:02,511
and workplace romance in TV shows

901
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,763
are just so romantic

902
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:06,765
that I want to experience it myself
so badly.

903
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:07,975
Well...

904
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:11,019
I don't think that's possible
because of Sang-jin.

905
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,396
That's right.

906
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,273
He banned workplace romance.

907
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,275
He tells us that
during every staff dinner.

908
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:18,402
- Really?
- Yes.

909
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:19,862
Sang-jin.

910
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,614
Is workplace romance
banned in our company?

911
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:31,457
Workplace... Workplace romance...

912
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:34,644
Loving your workplace, right?

913
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,211
That's allowed. Definitely.

914
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,047
I don't know what you're talking about.

915
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:42,176
I just don't get it.

916
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:46,805
Anyway, U-ri.
It's dangerous to fantasize about romance.

917
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,266
It's very easy to be disappointed.

918
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,477
Right, romantic relationships
can be a real pain.

919
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,645
You always ask about how she slept or ate.

920
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,899
"Are you up? Did you eat?
What did you eat?"

921
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,401
"You must be so tired. Sleep tight."

922
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:01,153
Even talking about it makes me tired.

923
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,864
Caring about each other sounds so nice.

924
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:08,368
It's basically to eat,
watch a movie, and drink tea.

925
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:11,371
Or to watch a movie, eat, and drink tea.
Drink tea, watch a movie, eat.

926
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:13,373
Romance is all the same. Don't you think?

927
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,877
Eating, having coffee,

928
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,379
and watching a movie.

929
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,259
How odd.

930
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:25,427
Isn't it such a pain?

931
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,231
Why did you come out?

932
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,149
I'm out on business, so I came out early.

933
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:45,864
- You want to go with me?
- What's that?

934
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:48,659
Now you're asking me to go
everywhere with you.

935
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:49,785
Where are you headed?

936
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:53,580
I just haven't watched it yet.

937
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:54,748
<i>500 Days of Summer.</i>

938
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:57,834
To fully understand
the author's intentions,

939
01:03:58,335 --> 01:03:59,419
I need to. That's why.

940
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,631
So you want to...

941
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,886
You're out on business, you mean...

942
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,513
Yes.

943
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:35,163
<i>With love, Judy.</i>

944
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:49,720
Excuse me.

945
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:51,888
Sang-jin.

946
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,268
What are you doing after work today?

947
01:04:56,685 --> 01:05:00,480
These days, not sure if it's an age thing,

948
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,025
but I don't want to bother to do anything.

949
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:07,112
I just want to go home
as soon as possible.

950
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:13,619
The weather is so wonderful these days,
but you feel like that, I see.

951
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:19,750
I have an idea.

952
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:24,463
Would you like to go to a movie with me?

953
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:29,843
To the top.

954
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,100
On your left.

955
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:47,527
I didn't specifically pick the seats.

956
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:51,740
You saw me
when I bought the tickets earlier.

957
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,035
Should I go inside?

958
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:56,828
Sure.

959
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,054
<i>Why I watch the same movie
over and over again.</i>

960
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,722
<i>I get to discover something new.</i>

961
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:20,560
<i>You were touchy-feely with another man,
and publicly displayed affection and all.</i>

962
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,354
<i>I bet they would frown upon it.</i>

963
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:24,606
<i>Was he always such a loser?</i>

964
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:26,525
<i>I'm not saying you did anything wrong.</i>

965
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:29,111
<i>The woman has clearly expressed</i>

966
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:32,698
<i>that it was right for the two to break up.</i>

967
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:37,411
<i>The ending where the main characters
break up was convincing to me.</i>

968
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:41,707
<i>And I realized that it was a happy ending,
not a sad one.</i>

969
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:01,935
<i>That was clearly the last day of autumn</i>

970
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:03,895
<i>and the first day of winter.</i>

971
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,962
TRUE TO LOVE

972
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,382
- Bo-ra.
- Son, I didn't know you were on a date.

973
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,260
<i>Remember what I always tell you?
I'll protect you.</i>

974
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:36,762
<i>I will really keep that promise.</i>

975
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:39,681
<i>Are you protecting me from yourself?</i>

976
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:40,766
U-ri.

977
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:42,392
<i>I don't deserve it.</i>

978
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:44,603
<i>I don't deserve to receive your heart.</i>

979
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:48,064
But... I haven't even told you
my feelings about you.

980
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:49,900
<i>Hear me out just once.</i>

981
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:52,194
<i>You must have felt so lonely.</i>

982
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:53,987
<i>I feel sorry and thankful.</i>

983
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,739
<i>But I feel more sorry than thankful.</i>

984
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,073
<i>I'm thankful and sorry too.</i>

985
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:58,575
<i>But I'm more thankful than sorry.</i>

986
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,535
<i>- Way more.
- Maybe I'm needy.</i>

987
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,829
Are you going to come closer?

988
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:04,498
I just hope everyone likes me.

989
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:05,808
There might be at least one person.

990
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,084
<i>So where in the world is that one person?</i>

991
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:10,962
Perhaps he's closer to you than you think.

992
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:13,381
<i>- Why do you do this?</i>
- I don't want to go home early.

993
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:15,383
<i>- Why do you keep...
- Wanna drink at my place?</i>

994
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:17,135
- How pretty.
<i>- Doing that?</i>

995
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,137
Why do you keep seducing me?

996
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,348
Would you be seduced if I do?
