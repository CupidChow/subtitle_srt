00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,750
Min Jung, let's go

2
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,910
here

3
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,260
You son of a bitch

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,420
24 HOURS AGO

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,560
LUN-LIN COMPANY, CHINA

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,920
"take it all.
- yes.

7
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,350
What?

8
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,500
fuck you

9
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,090
What's wrong with this cat?

10
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,170
stupid cat

11
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,530
What are you doing?"

12
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,780
We don't have much time

13
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,360
hey

14
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,140
What are you doing there?"

15
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,060
What's wrong with you?

16
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,030
What's the matter, eh?

17
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:30,800
what are you

18
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,210
Fuck off!

19
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,350
DECEMBER 8, 2019, WUHAN, CHINA.

20
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,040
There was a sharp outbreak of pneumonia

GANGNAM ZOMBIES

22
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,730
This Christmas isn't as busy as usual

23
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,550
despite the fact that two years have passed since the first COVID-19 patient appeared,

24
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,460
we still remain vigilant.

31

< i>gangnam new station,
next stop San Dan dong

41
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,330
What does he eat?

42
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,880
What's wrong with it?

43
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,120
crazy!

44
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,560
Here, this guy.

45
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,730
This man suddenly came to my store

46
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,600
and he started eating meat

47
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,900
chewing like crazy.

48
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,070
We need to pick him up

49
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,180
I'm sorry, sir

50
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,910
What's wrong with him?

51
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
Is he crazy?

52
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,860
Sir, put the meat down

53
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,360
Come with us."

54
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,400
arrest him!

55
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,520
but he runs away!

56
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,140
requesting a car!

57
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,730
Hold him!"

58
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,100
"hey, Mom.
"there's nothing for you to do in Seoul.

59
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,440
Come back here and find another job.

60
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,260
- The coronavirus is a serious matter.
- Mom

61
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,550
other parents are only happy if their son has a job in Seoul

62
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,460
And you just want me to stay home

63
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,460
is it bad to live with your parents?

64
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,000
Mom, my job is here.

65
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,570
Why?

66
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,850
"Do you have a girlfriend?"
"Stop it, Mom.

67
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,240
"You live together already?"
- no. I mean..."

68
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,990
it's not like...

69
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,960
mister

70
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,530
damn it

71
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,890
you broke my phone.

72
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,550
mister

73
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Stop it

74
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,510
"Stop it!"
"Min Jung?"

75
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,720
This is...

76
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,310
mister

77
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,720
Oh, shit.

78
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,960
everyone knows what you're like,

79
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,150
"why are you showing off?"
"Did you put something in the alcohol?"

80
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,800
She'd never drunk anything like this

81
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,520
did you put something in it on purpose?

82
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,830
It smacks of violating the Sexual Assault Act

83
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,720
how did you get to me

84
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,310
Hey...

85
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,560
are you a prosecutor?

86
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,210
Or A Lawyer?

87
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,520
She's just an ordinary woman...

88
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,640
let's have a good look

89
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,990
who else are you?"

90
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,360
vali

91
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,000
guys, such a cool morning, so quiet and peaceful

92
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,600
all the way?

93
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,630
let's go

94
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,800
you che

95
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,540
is that your boyfriend or something?

96
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,640
All right, just one more time for me

97
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,010
once - no big deal

98
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,740
It's all right.

99
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,650
gleyavnoe good mood

100
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,780
let's smile and go our separate ways peacefully

101
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,120
Well, you'll get it from me!

102
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,020
goat

103
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,600
"it hurts, it hurts.
"does it hurt?"

104
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,530
the brute

105
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,410
cool, huh?

106
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,310
Well, wait, you'll get it right now

107
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,220
Min Jung, are you okay?

108
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,420
not hurt?"

109
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,020
I'm leaving

110
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,890
Min Jung.

111
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,300
Min Jung, how are you?

112
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,000
Maybe I should have taken them to the police station.

113
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,040
Hyun suk, are you fighting gangs now?

114
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,640
should I have passed by?

115
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,280
That's the easiest thing to do

116
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,210
no, it was worth solving everything legally

117
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,820
and if they hire a lawyer, you can go to jail.

118
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,690
but you and the girls have seen everything, and you will testify in my defense

119
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,460
what if the witnesses don't want to be seen?

120
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,900
No, I mean...

121
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,530
are you in a bad mood or something?

122
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,440
Wait, wasn't I cool?

123
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,310
Well, maybe just a little bit.

124
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,120
Min Jung, wait.

125
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,970
Min Jung, what are you doing after work?

126
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,100
Today is Christmas Eve.

127
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,240
What difference does it make, I'll go home and go to bed

128
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,970
why don't you come to the concert with me then?

129
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,510
I have a ticket - don't

130
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,180
I don't want.

131
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,480
invite someone else instead

132
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,050
maybe after all?

133
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,980
I don't want to go with the others

134
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,120
Min Jung, it'll be fun

135
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,050
wait a minute

136
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,520
are you from the sixth floor, youtuber?

137
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,220
Yes.

138
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,790
It's good that you know me

139
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:43,790
wait a minute

140
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,000
you have three months ' rent debt

141
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,970
The thing is, I don't get paid yet

142
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,900
That's not my problem

143
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,540
So what's up?

144
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,010
Why didn't you pay the rent for three months?

145
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,210
I don't know, ask my boss instead

146
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,650
Your boss won't return my calls,
apparently avoiding me.

147
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,790
Tell your boss this

148
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,890
if you don't pay this month, collect your money and leave

149
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,330
Understood?

150
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,360
Yeah, it's a nice day...

151
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,860
What?

152
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,730
Never mind, I'll tell him everything

153
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,030
Wait.

154
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,570
are you aware that you can't smoke in offices here?

155
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,440
I don't smoke.

156
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,550
what ill-mannered people

157
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:46,220
If you don't make them pay, I'll cut your wages, too, okay?

158
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,990
Yes, boss.

159
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,800
assholes

160
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,410
Min Jung.

161
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,650
 This is Dae Hyun.

162
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,020
what is it

163
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:37,140
today's exclusive-zombie attack
for a member of the taekwondo team

164
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,310
Well, how are you guys interested?

165
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,610
former national team representative
 single-handedly defeated a zombie

166
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,220
obviously, his body automatically enters combat mode

167
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,190
Yi Hyun Suk, how are you feeling?

168
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,850
Boss, let's not do this

169
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,630
Guys, I'll be back soon with some fresh news

170
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,200
see you! bye!

171
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,670
Removed.

172
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,400
Good job.

173
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,530
well done!

174
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,300
yes, you know how to make Christmas Eve unforgettable

175
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,740
Yes, that's how it works

176
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,650
Oh, Min Jung, hi, you stay here

177
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,750
forget about him

178
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,950
you'll get a great shot

179
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,750
come with me and edit everything

180
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,350
Let's go, let's go

181
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,830
Dae Hyun.

182
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,730
Dae Hyun.

183
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,610
Dae Hyun, your nose is bleeding

184
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,770
why are you sprawled out

185
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,280
Get up.

186
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,110
Call 119

187
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,310
What are you talking about?

188
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,850
blood

189
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,220
Hyun suk, my nose is bleeding.

190
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,490
Let's go buy you something to eat

191
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,120
Meat?

192
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,060
give me some beef?"

193
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,730
Okay.

194
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,490
Come on."

195
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,960
Wait for me."

196
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,500
Removed.

197
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,230
Okay.

198
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,600
Min-jung, you're doing it right

199
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,370
Hyun suk just said a few words

200
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,370
So what?

201
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,240
The reaction is very important.

202
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,210
And then...

203
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,080
Yes.

204
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,080
here's the part

205
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,150
Can I do a slow mo here?

206
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:39,980
exactly

207
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,190
Yes.

208
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,520
right here...

209
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,090
your princess is in trouble.

210
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,600
can you save her again?

211
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,240
Dae Hyun, come with me.

212
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Why?

213
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,110
The boss.

214
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,600
What's up, asshole?

215
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,050
Dae hyun wants to hold a meeting

216
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,190
what?

217
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,520
and why is that? what is the most important thing you decided to tell us?

218
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,560
This is...

219
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,760
Well, you see

220
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,970
meeting to inform...

221
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,040
we need to discuss the development of our YouTube channel.

222
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,210
That's right, a YouTube channel.

223
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,540
Yes.

224
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,480
Really?

225
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,410
If so, I'm all for it

226
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,570
You guys are doing great

227
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,220
Let's discuss it then

228
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,500
Home page

229
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,170
We have 3,237 Subscribers on our channel.

230
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:05,300
The highest level of views is 7200
and the lowest is 2300.

231
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:13,210
and how do we get all this with all this
a silver button, not to mention a gold one?

232
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,950
The annual income is 230,000 won.

233
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,490
we work so hard and that's all we get?

234
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,620
Oh, my God.

235
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,960
Here comes the sun lord!

236
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,500
What a coincidence, Yi Sun-ja.

237
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:39,000
Okay, let's take a break, check out our income.

238
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,900
what are we going to do next?

239
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,510
What can I do to make it better?

240
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,640
we need to work on the style of our videos

241
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,150
so far, we've been making videos according to your preferences.

242
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,350
but you still need to focus on the preferences of the audience

243
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,090
I came up with a great idea.

244
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,830
You probably know that I was a real star

245
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,930
Come on, I'm back, your TJ.

246
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,370
were you a star?

247
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,470
That was twenty years ago.

248
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,940
I'm just an animal

249
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,510
don't you believe me?

250
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,490
Well, I work, how else to pay for rent

251
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,190
The boss.

252
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,480
how will you pay us your salary?

253
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,440
I already owe you my rent

254
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:41,610
guys, well, we need to work, fight for success with all our might

255
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,710
Then, you see, I'll give you a salary

256
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,700
And I'll probably fire you

257
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,780
The boss.

258
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,500
What?

259
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,760
You can't smoke here.

260
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,300
don't you have anything else to do?"

261
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,640
all dismissed

262
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,010
Go away, go away

263
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,230
You don't need to go anywhere, do you?

264
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,130
Yes, we go, we go

265
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,160
goat

266
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,910
mister

267
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,660
why are you standing there?

268
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,820
go away

269
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,100
What's wrong with you?

270
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,380
Min Jung.

271
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,100
I have something to say.

272
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,820
What?

273
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,980
just for a second.

274
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,280
what's the matter?

275
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,440
put your hand here

276
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:37,850
why?

277
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,790
because if someone does,

278
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,950
If they grab you like this, you can break out

279
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,660
Just like that, I broke the asshole's arm

280
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,630
and then like this

281
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
just remember this trick

282
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,620
What? What's wrong with you?

283
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,150
why do you protect others, but you can't fight back against the boss?

284
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,590
it's hard to find a new job right now

285
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,590
although this is an unofficial job, I studied a lot,

286
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,370
I tried to get this place.

287
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,190
in addition, what-no experience.

288
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,790
Can't you become a freelancer?

289
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,250
Without experience, who needs me?

290
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,770
editing a video is interesting

291
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,950
If I report my boss for harassment,

292
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,800
I can't work here anymore.

293
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,810
I'll figure something out.

294
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,980
Hyun suk, I know what you want to say.

295
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,520
But I'll handle it myself.

296
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,260
Yes, boss?

297
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,350
Okay, I'll be right down..

298
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,130
Hyun suk, the boss is calling. Hurry up.

299
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,030
Come here and take a look!

300
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,600
That's the guy who broke my phone!

301
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,530
What are you talking about?

302
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,930
Wait a minute, watch the video

303
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,130
click on pause

304
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,240
does he drink blood?

305
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,570
is it an alien or some kind of mutant?

306
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,150
or an alien mutant?

307
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,930
maybe just an ordinary person...

308
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,850
special effects and all that

309
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,820
youtube is full of similar videos

310
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,460
what the hell are you talking about

311
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,260
well yes

312
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,990
lousy

313
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,380
It's right next to the office

314
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,850
If we could take a video of this guy, we'd be famous right away

315
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,810
By the way, where have you been?"

316
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,740
I went to the bathroom

317
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,950
Are you guys dating?

318
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:23,670
No, it's not.

319
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:30,140
found time to relax, it would be better to shoot such a video

320
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,970
Let's take off our own.

321
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,260
Okay, so what?

322
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,840
hire someone, dress them up

323
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,120
and more fake blood

324
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,570
what the hell are you talking about?

325
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,680
do you want our show to be completely ruined?

326
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:53,680
how stupid you are to even think about it

327
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,020
I understood

328
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,180
Continuation of the video

329
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,820
Yang-chul, Yang-chul.

330
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,290
I'm here.

331
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,700
I'm in the underground parking lot with the general manager, come here, okay?

332
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,170
Okay, I'll be right there

333
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,420
What are you doing?

334
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,050
Go ahead and work

335
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,720
Okay.

336
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,560
you're here again

337
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,190
mister

338
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,450
Hey!-

339
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,660
I brought you some water

340
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,430
I'm coming, I'm coming

341
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:43,840
Yes, yes, I'm listening, clearly, it's urgent

342
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,110
put it there

343
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
oh and hard

344
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:56,850
I'm so tired.

345
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,930
What are you doing?

346
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,000
the authorities are out of place

347
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,270
I just saw him, there he is

348
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,300
No, it's not there, it's out

349
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,740
I think I'm going crazy.

350
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,540
mister

351
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:22,980
Yes?

352
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,910
It's hard for everyone right now

353
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,580
water costs only 9,000 won

354
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,050
Three buckets of water per month - 27,000 rubles.

355
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,050
Four months, 108,000.

356
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,290
Do you know how much I would earn if you paid for water?

357
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,700
I told the boss that he would transfer the money to you immediately.

358
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,400
Soon?

359
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:46,930
Okay.

360
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:47,930
Money transfer?

361
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,470
Okay.

362
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:53,140
then there is no problem

363
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,510
Okay, okay, let me walk you out

364
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,220
come here

365
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,520
your boss is lucky to have such fast employees

366
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,150
Goodbye.

367
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,590
transfer the money!

368
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,830
Good, good

369
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,830
See you.

370
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,230
Is he gone?"

371
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,570
get back to work

372
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,080
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

373
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,250
Oh, shit.

374
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,120
if you don't have enough money, why order water?

375
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,200
I don't have a penny, but bring him some water, what a jerk

376
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,130
and how should I earn money?

377
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,470
I should have told him everything

378
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,270
What a smell!

379
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,970
They don't pay rent, but they've made a mess of it

380
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,480
what do you do?

381
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,250
I beg your pardon

382
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,120
The janitor isn't here today

383
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,920
if there is no cleaner, then clean it yourself

384
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,360
excuse me

385
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,260
because of people like you, housing prices are falling

386
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,600
although, where can you understand the problems of normal people

387
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,170
Hey, you!

388
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,070
why are you so quiet?

389
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,080
what's the matter?

390
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,910
have you completely lost your fear?

391
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,880
aren't you ashamed?

392
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,560
I beg your pardon

393
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,630
That's it, I'm sorry, it's your joint. You need to pay for mistakes

394
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,340
hold

395
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,780
What are you doing?

396
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,990
What's wrong with you?

397
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,760
What are you doing?

398
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,480
Well, do something!

399
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,360
Walkie-talkie!

400
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,740
Is anyone here?"

401
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,670
I'm listening

402
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,570
Don't let anyone out! Close the door.

403
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,740
got it

404
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,810
Close all the doors!

405
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,740
What the hell?

406
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,460
anyone there?"

407
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,760
Open

408
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,030
anyone there?" open it

409
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,040
open

410
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,510
here it is good, normal

411
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,950
and this part

412
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,150
what the fuck

413
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,220
all right

414
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,990
anyone there?" open up!

415
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,090
Please open it!

416
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,220
Open it soon!

417
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,530
What happened?

418
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,030
what's the matter?

419
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:37,640
There's a monster in this building! The monster!

420
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,840
so they would have called the police, why did they come running to us?

421
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,210
I can't call the police!

422
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,510
if someone finds out about this, prices will drop completely, you can not call the police!

423
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,750
and what kind of monsters are there?

424
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,650
I don't know

425
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,930
The monster is he, he, the Monster!

426
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,460
What should I do

427
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:15,910
Let's just do this, you catch the monster, and I'll pretend
 that you don't owe me anything for the rent

428
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,680
Really?

429
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,350
Sure.

430
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,710
Look, there are witnesses here

431
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,310
I know.

432
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,980
why did you agree, you never know what kind of bridge there is

433
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,120
Let's go and find out

434
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,060
I feel in my gut that this will bring a resounding success to our show

435
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,990
exactly

436
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,260
let's record a report

437
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,400
That's right, let's go

438
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:49,840
are you okay?

439
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,440
What?

440
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,510
Yes, I'm fine.

441
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,030
Wait

442
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,490
Well, open it already!

443
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,630
Help me!

444
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,070
It's a zombie.

445
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,400
It's a zombie

446
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,440
We need to take it off!

447
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,900
We must leave!

448
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,310
faster

449
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,190
real zombies

450
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,560
I need to call the police.

451
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,530
Boss, give me the phone.

452
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,760
you can't call the cops!

453
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,330
What do you mean?

454
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,530
You are welcome!

455
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,830
you need to post the video first, and then call

456
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,900
the video came out right!

457
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,040
forget about the video! We need to call the cops

458
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,670
this will make us all stars!

459
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,470
Wait

460
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,710
mister

461
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,780
This is the key to our Glory!

462
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,580
mister

463
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,950
Wait

464
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,050
Dae hyun! Dae hyun!

465
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:53,950
We need to save Dae hyun

466
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:54,350
stand

467
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,090
We need to help him

468
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,790
no

469
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,990
Dae Hyun is there.

470
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,960
you pushed him to save your ass!

471
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,660
Let me go!" Who do you think you are?

472
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,000
what a scum you are

473
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,900
stop it

474
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:47,910
Come on, we need to call the police

475
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:58,150
No way! Please don't do this!

476
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,590
I need to sell this building.

477
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:06,560
If anyone finds out about this, I won't rent out any more rooms

478
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,800
Please help me, don't call the police!

479
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,400
Wake up now

480
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,300
did you see that a man was eaten there?

481
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,230
What's that got to do with me?

482
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,140
Why is this happening in my building?

483
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,240
Why...

484
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,340
It wasn't my fault.

485
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:25,840
Why...

486
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,450
No. my building!

487
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,390
It's a building!

488
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:37,360
That's all I have!

489
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,090
madam

490
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,190
madam

491
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,720
go away

492
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,490
Damn, he's coming.

493
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:21,230
Help me! Help me!

494
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,760
Come on, Min Jung.

495
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:51,850
Min-jung

496
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:20,870
Min Jung, are you okay?

497
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,450
Hyun Suk...

498
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,920
Hyun suk.

499
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,340
Where are you, Hyun Suk...

500
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:19,740
Min Jung, are you okay?

501
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,210
did you see something?"

502
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,380
There is no...

503
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:30,780
so, what do we do now?

504
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,890
first let's go to the office and get in touch with the outside world

505
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,560
then we'll find a safe place

506
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,000
and how to get to the office?

507
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:45,340
If we go out, the monsters will attack us.

508
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,930
Don't worry. I'm a taekwondo champion.

509
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,460
I will protect you.

510
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,400
do you believe me?"

511
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,010
Damn, we can't fight our way in there!

512
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,650
No way.

513
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:03,140
We can... we can...

514
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:52,620
Dae Hyun.

515
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:54,820
Dae Hyun.

516
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:57,900
Dae hyun!

517
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,840
Just hold it like this.

518
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,810
If you get caught, do this

519
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,450
then so

520
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:26,090
Just do it.

521
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:33,990
Dae Hyun, wake up!

522
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,590
Dae Hyun.

523
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,430
Dae hyun!

524
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,800
Dae Hyun.

525
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,030
Dae hyun!

526
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:05,400
Please calm down

527
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:13,310
He's not Dae Hyun anymore.

528
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,780
Quickly, let's go

529
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:20,240
You can't call from here

530
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:23,580
it's blocked here

531
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,690
The landline doesn't work either.

532
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:39,930
Min Jung.

533
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,210
mister

534
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,920
Okay, we'll figure it out

535
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,720
Is he dead?"

536
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:42,630
I don't know.

537
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:43,860
We must leave

538
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,280
Everything seems to be clear

539
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:08,350
Wait.

540
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,110
What'll we do?

541
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:42,760
let's go

542
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:07,790
Min Jung, let's go

543
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,080
Min Jung, over here

544
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,460
I'll distract them

545
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,960
you stay here

546
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,660
What are you going to do?"

547
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,670
Do not be afraid

548
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,770
I'm the champion, remember?

549
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:29,540
Hyun Suk!

550
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,540
Hyun Suk!

551
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,680
Hyun Suk, are you okay?

552
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,120
yes

553
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,730
get it

554
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,820
Min Jung

555
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,430
hyun suk

556
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:22,870
Hyun suk, how are you?

557
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:27,550
did you get bitten?"

558
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,050
it looks like that

559
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,500
Min Jung, go away

560
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,730
How am I going to leave alone?

561
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:48,870
have to

562
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,670
I'll become a zombie

563
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:56,040
quickly leave

564
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:03,320
We'll figure something out, we'll go together

565
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,220
Let's leave together

566
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:09,760
don't be silly

567
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:11,560
just go away

568
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:31,210
I really wanted to go to the concert with you

569
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:36,820
Since I don't have much time left,

570
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:40,950
Can I give you a hug?"

571
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:07,650
everything is fine

572
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:09,780
Now go away

573
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,690
there's no need to stay here too long

574
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:17,760
I'll walk you out

575
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,410
this... plug-ins?

576
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,020
did they bite you?"

577
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,470
I... just..."

578
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:14,050
Then let's go together

579
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,780
oh, shit

580
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:27,130
are you coming or what?"
