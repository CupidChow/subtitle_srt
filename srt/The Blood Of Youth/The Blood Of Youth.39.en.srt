00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:43,980
I beg you.

379
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,620
If you

380
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,860
can hear me,

381
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,940
please wake up soon.

382
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,090
One year ago,

383
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,770
I left without letting my master's knowledge.

384
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,490
[Jingxue Pavilion]

385
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,090
My biggest wish

386
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,220
was to become better at sword-fighting.

387
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,180
To improve my skills.

388
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,620
So that one day I could become

389
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,620
a powerful man like my master.

390
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,660
I'd then fight for justice
in the martial arts world

391
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,660
and make my name known far and wide.

392
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:18,980
Soon after,

393
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,250
I met Xiao Se,

394
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,730
Wuxin,

395
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,570
Qianluo,

396
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,700
and Lian.

397
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,380
My companions increased in number.

398
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,940
The opponents I came across were stronger too.

399
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,090
At the time,

400
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,490
I told myself

401
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,730
that before I have the ability

402
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,050
to protect the world,

403
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,570
I must first protect

404
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,490
my companions.

405
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,140
But Lian died.

406
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,010
And Xiao Se got injured again and again.

407
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,700
In the beginning, I could still

408
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,660
do something to help.

409
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,290
But now, all I can do

410
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,180
is sit here.

411
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,620
This feeling is a first for me.

412
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,330
Full of anger,

413
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,330
but also hopelessness.

414
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,010
You sitting here

415
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,330
is also a form of protection.

416
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,730
Look.

417
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,810
The entrance is right ahead.

418
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,860
Behind us is where Xiao Se is resting.

419
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,620
Whoever wishes to get into the room

420
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,700
will first

421
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,010
have to go through us.

422
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,250
While you're guarding the door,

423
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,900
they will have to think twice

424
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,290
about whether or not they can beat you,

425
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,460
or how they can beat you.

426
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,290
You're the reason

427
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,660
why they dare not barge into the residence.

428
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,220
So do you still think

429
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,180
you're useless?

430
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,380
With you here,

431
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,620
I feel much more reassured.

432
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:51,980
Look.

433
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,420
I'm scared too.

434
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,010
Don't be.

435
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,290
I'll guard this place with everything I've got.

436
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,770
With me here,

437
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,490
no one will be able

438
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,380
to harm anyone of you.

439
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,220
You're injured too.

440
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,140
You should go and recuperate too.

441
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,290
Keeping watch here

442
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,220
is not beneficial for either of you.

443
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,980
Since leaving the celestial mountain,

444
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,580
he's not been

445
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,340
this badly injured.

446
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,050
Moreover, the last thing Xiao Se said

447
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,580
before he passed out really worries me.

448
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:47,770
What did he mean

449
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,290
by saving Tianqi first?

450
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,420
Don't worry.

451
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:51,700
I'll help him

452
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,770
regain consciousness.

453
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,660
Although this would mean
that I can't get my power back

454
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,980
in the next five years.

455
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,940
I'll do it.

456
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,700
Be it five or ten years,

457
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,420
even if I lose all my power,

458
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,250
that's fine.

459
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,980
He and I have the same master.

460
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,530
We practice the same martial arts.

461
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,620
That's why I'm able to help him.

462
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,570
Your good intention is appreciated.

463
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,250
But you should wait outside.

464
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,290
Trust me.

465
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,460
I'll give you back

466
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,700
a conscious Xiao Se.

467
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,660
I'll leave him to you then.

468
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,620
I'll stop

469
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,620
butting heads with you again.

470
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,090
Go on then.

471
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,860
What a silly girl.

472
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,460
This is weird.

473
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,570
I'm suddenly feeling

474
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,420
a sense of loss

475
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,330
now that Xiao Se isn't around.

476
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,330
I always found him annoying.

477
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,860
But as long as he was there,

478
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,180
everything would work out.

479
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,290
That's Xiao Se for you.

480
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,180
He gives people a sense of security.

481
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,050
Actually, it's not hard to do something.

482
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,460
Whoever comes,

483
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,860
we'll just chop them off.

484
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,700
You're always the most charismatic, Qianluo.

485
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,620
With you here,

486
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,570
I won't be taken

487
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,620
as the most hot-headed.

488
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,700
You punk.

489
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,420
I know

490
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,660
you're criticizing me.

491
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,180
How come you look like

492
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,460
you've been crying?

493
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,770
Lei Wujie.

494
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,570
Xiao Se

495
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,810
is going to be fine, right?

496
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:22,940
Lei Wujie.

497
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,570
You and your nonsense.

498
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,420
I was joking.

499
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,290
Don't fret.

500
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,620
I heard that Chuhe was injured

501
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,330
while fighting Lone Sword Deity.

502
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,010
I came specifically to check on him.

503
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,330
He's fine.

504
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,460
Please go back.

505
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,330
I'm already here.

506
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,490
Aren't you going to invite me inside?

507
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,180
Is this how Lord Yong'an

508
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,490
treats his guests?

509
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,940
Just give up.

510
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:57,980
You've all been injured

511
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,290
by my godfather earlier.

512
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,180
You're no match for Wuxin.

513
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,660
Longxie.

514
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,290
Let me remind you.

515
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,140
My godfather

516
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,810
is Luo Qingyang.

517
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,660
Xiao Se, your injury...

518
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,860
Ji Xue gave me

519
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,530
all her inner force.

520
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,380
She has fainted.

521
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,010
But that has given me

522
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,140
another chance to fight.

523
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,220
Lei Wujie.

524
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,090
Don't push yourself too hard while you're hurt.

525
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:45,980
I'm fine.

526
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,620
We have to

527
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,660
save Wuxin first.

528
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,570
Xiao Yu.

529
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,290
You came to see me?

530
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,700
I'm right here.

531
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,980
As expected of Xiao Chuhe,

532
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,250
always full of surprises.

533
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,180
Xiao Yu.

534
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,090
You really went too far this time.

535
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,140
Did I?

536
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,050
As long as you're still alive,

537
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,620
I'm willing

538
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,570
to do even more despicable things.

539
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,940
Do you really hate me that much?

540
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,530
Since we were young,

541
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,180
because of you,

542
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,660
I always ranked second

543
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,770
in martial arts and talents among the princes.

544
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,490
As soon as you joined

545
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,660
the government-run academy,

546
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,380
you became the chancellor's apprentice.

547
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,940
I trained hard in martial arts.

548
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,140
But when you turned 17,

549
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,700
you reached the Insouciant Phase.

550
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,980
You became famous.

551
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,660
From that point onward,

552
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,770
I knew

553
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,660
that if I wish to stand out,

554
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,860
I'd have to get rid of you.

555
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,220
Later, you left Tianqi City

556
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,810
and I finally managed

557
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,530
to get what I wanted and gain recognition.

558
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,180
It was truly

559
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,730
a memorable period.

560
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,530
But just four years later,

561
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,050
you reappeared.

562
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,010
The banquet at the Qianjin Gambling House.

563
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,860
You forced everyone to attend it.

564
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,770
Even our father was there.

565
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,140
The mutiny led by the Langya Army

566
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,090
was about to break the palace walls.

567
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,700
But with just a few words,

568
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,860
you made an army of 100,000 turn around.

569
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,490
When Lone Sword Deity
brought calamity upon Tianqi,

570
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,290
you simply summoned

571
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,460
the Tianzhan Sword.

572
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,700
As if you were proclaiming

573
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,330
your status as the chosen emperor.

574
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,570
Chuhe.

575
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,250
That was all the things you did.

576
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,090
And you said I went too far?

577
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,460
Is that appropriate?

578
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,700
What a joke.

579
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,730
Are you out for blood

580
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,460
just because

581
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,660
other people are better than you?

582
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,570
I'm not like you people,

583
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,810
who are willingly
subjecting yourselves to others

584
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,660
and doing other people's bidding.

585
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,460
I will be the ruler of men!

586
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,570
Whoever gets in my way

587
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,380
will be dead!

588
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,330
There's nothing left to be said then.

589
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,530
Just come at us.

590
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,090
Why do you look at me like that?

591
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,810
Oh, Xiao Yu.

592
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,490
Today, you're different from your usual self.

593
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,730
Different, how?

594
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,180
You've always been

595
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,380
a calm person.

596
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,660
You don't like to bare your heart.

597
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,250
But you just divulged

598
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,660
your most honest thoughts.

599
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,660
Meaning you've lost your cool.

600
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,140
This is what I've been dreaming of.

601
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,810
The day has finally come.

602
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,570
For sure, I can't hold back

603
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,570
my excitement.

604
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,700
Because you

605
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,460
are about to meet your end!

606
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:47,770
Is that so?

607
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,010
By the hands of my friend?

608
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,660
That's right.

609
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,250
Watching your best friend

610
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,810
kill you.

611
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,620
That would be an awesome sight.

612
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:11,810
(Wuxin,)

613
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,220
(the expert at reading people.)

614
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,900
(How did he end up being drugged?)

615
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,010
(If he wanted to escape,)

616
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,810
(no one would be able to stop him.)

617
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,250
(If he wished to die,)

618
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,380
(who then)

619
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,380
(could turn him into this monster?)

620
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,620
(Who in Tianqi City has the power)

621
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,940
(to give him a way out?)

622
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,530
(Who can he trust?)

623
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,860
It's me.

624
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,010
And Lei Wujie.

625
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,250
You've guessed right.

626
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,490
I chose you two

627
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,460
for a specific reason.

628
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,140
Lei Wujie.

629
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,010
Use the Formidable Fist.

630
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:48,940
Got it!

631
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,250
You were the one

632
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,380
who taught me this skill.

633
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,940
Today, I'll show you

634
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,490
how far I've come.

635
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,420
Xiao Se!

636
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,490
Wuxin's bloodlust

637
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,700
isn't as strong as before.

638
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,660
Then my guess was right.

639
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,620
This skill

640
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,530
has the ability to calm the mind and subdue evil.

641
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,290
So it has the same effect

642
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,770
on drugged subjects.

643
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:29,730

Your name means heartless,

649
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,980

and then look into your heart.

Great work.

I've always been smart,

Yu'er.

00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:02,810
Mother.

683
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,490
Xiao Se.

00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,140
I wish

685
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,620
I could hold you and cry right now.

686
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:07,770
How could there

687
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,010
be so much helplessness in this world?

688
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,730
The bad guys just keep coming!

689
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,220
It's either we die or become crippled.

690
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,490
The big bad is here.

691
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,700
Stop your yapping.

692
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,980
I can't fight anymore.

693
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,940
Looks like it's just you against me again.

694
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,380
The earlier fight today

695
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,140
was a culmination of Heaven

696
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,900
and the sword's will.

697
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,010

00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,290

How come my appearance

701
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,770
happened at such a tricky moment again?

702
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,900
Always having to rescue others from danger.

703
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,810
Could this be

704
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,900
my destiny?

705
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,380
I, Wuxin,

706
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:49,730
am destined

707
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,570
to be the savior,

708
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,730
a light descended from the heavens.

709
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,460
You're shameless.

710
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,220
Right.

711
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,380
You two

712
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,490
were the ones that saved me.

713
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,180
Abyssal Eye.

714
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,860
Magical Freedom Fist.

715
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,380
Good job.

716
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,980
It's the "Freedom

717
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,330
Formidable Fist".

718
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,770
It's just a name I made up.

719
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,180
I'm surprised you remember it so clearly.

720
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,660
Shi'er.

721
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,530
How could you...

722
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,290
Mother.

723
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,620
You left but came back

724
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,770
so that you could leave with my brother?

725
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,810
No!

726
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:25,940
Qingyang.

727
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,010
Take Yu'er away.

728
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,220
Your Highness.

729
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,220
At this point,

730
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:31,940
things

731
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,010
aren't as simple as they were.

732
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,700
I don't care

733
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,620
if Xiao Yu wants to kill me or wants the throne.

734
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,490
But he killed my friend.

735
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,940
He instigated treason against Tianqi today

736
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,530
and caused the death of innocent people.

737
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,010
He even colluded with Nanjue

738
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,980
and attacked Beili.

739
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,180
Millions were displaced,

740
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,620
and families were destroyed.

741
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,700
No one is going to save him this time.

742
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,290
Are you going to kill Yu'er?

743
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,770
How touching.

744
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,330
Finally,

745
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,860
I'm the one being chosen.

746
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,980
This good fortune took me by surprise.

747
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,770
I wasn't ready for it.

748
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,770
But, Mother,

749
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,380
when did I say

750
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,250
I wanted to leave Tianqi?

751
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,140
And you.

752
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,330
You think

753
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,460
you've already won?

754
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,770
It's not over yet.

755
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,050
Wenjun.

756
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,660
I'm guessing

757
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,900
this is what you are using

758
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,420
to force me and Lone Sword Deity

759
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,530
to kill for you.

760
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,250
Did he secretly

761
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,770
drug his mother too?

762
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,290
Yu'er.

763
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:07,940
You...

764
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,130
Impertinent fool!

765
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:12,860
Your Highness!

766
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,900
Stop, Qingyang!

767
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,900
How did you know?

768
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,210
I realized it when I met Mother

769
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,980
the other day.

770
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,780
Why did you think

771
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,490
I willingly

772
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,740
walked into your trap

773
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,460
and turned into a drugged subject?

774
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,490
I knew nothing of mind control.

775
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,940
So I had to

776
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,300
experience it for myself.

777
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,740
Demons subdued, six senses cleansed!

778
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,260
Be gone!

779
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,260
Mother.

780
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,090
Shi'er.

781
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:01,940
Nicely done.

782
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,460
Such a touching reunion

783
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,530
between mother and son.

784
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:08,980
I was right.

785
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,650
There's only one family in your heart.

786
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,650
Just leave.

787
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,860
Take your son with you.

788
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,050
Don't ever return to Tianqi City again.

789
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,010
Fool!

790
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,260
If not for you,

791
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,090
Wenjun would never

792
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,460
have suffered so much.

793
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,650
But look how you've hurt her.

794
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:30,940
Qingyang.

795
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,900
Wenjun.

796
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,780
Now that it's come to this,

797
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,740
what else is holding you back?

798
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:37,820
My godfather,

799
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,010
you've devoted your whole life to Mother.

800
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,340
Of course you'd defend her.

801
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,690
Fine.

802
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,460
Let me tell you

803
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,170
about what happened.

804
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,260
Back then, Wenjun and Ye Dingzhi

805
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,130
had managed to escape Tianqi City.

806
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,780
They lived in seclusion outside Gusu City

807
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,300
but were tricked into returning to Tianqi.

808
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,860
Think about it.

809
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,780
What could have made her

810
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,340
leave behind the happiness she had found

811
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,610
and go back

812
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,940
to being imprisoned?

813
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,170
It was you.

814
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,170
Me?

815
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,340
Someone passed along a fake message from me,

816
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,300
saying that you fell gravely ill in Tianqi.

817
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,380
So she rushed back to Tianqi.

818
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,170
Because of that,

819
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,490
she was trapped in Tianqi.

820
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,170
It triggered
the Demon Sect's invasion of the east.

821
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,860
The second time,

822
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,740
I had the chance to take her away from Tianqi.

823
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,980
But she once again refused.

824
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,610
It was because she made a deal

825
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,570
with Xiao Ruojin

826
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,210
so that Wuxin's life could be spared

827
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,570
and your position
in the imperial family was retained.

828
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,050
What you said...

829
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,380
are merely excuses.

830
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,820
Excuses?

831
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,650
Many a time,

832
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,380
I've tried coming to Tianqi.

833
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,610
But every time she said no.

834
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,010
Because she knew

835
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,980
that you would never give up

836
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,610
your position as an imperial member.

837
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,820
This whole time,

838
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,530
she was the one enduring in silence,

839
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,010
bearing the burden for you!

840
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,530
You think the whole world

841
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,900
has turned against you?

842
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,940
What a fool!

843
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,610
You gave up on everybody!

844
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:46,820
Xiao Yu.

845
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,690
You always feel like you're the victim.

846
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,780
But in fact, you've received

847
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,420
a lot of love too.

848
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,010
My mother died young.

849
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,420
What you have

850
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,690
is what I could only dream of.

851
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,490
But you were dead set

852
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,570
on competing with me

853
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,570
over things I did not care about at all.

854
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,460
Qingyang.

855
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,210
Take Yu'er away.

856
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,010
Wenjun.

857
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,610
But this impertinent boy

858
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,740
drugged you!

859
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,130
Your Highness.

860
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,260
One has to pay

861
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,860
for what one did wrong.

862
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,900
Even if I were to die today,

863
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,490
I'd never let Xiao Yu get away.

864
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,940
I can spare him.

865
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,610
But he will go to the Court of Judicature

866
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,420
to be punished by Father.

867
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,570
Turns out my whole life

868
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,490
is the biggest joke of all.

869
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,460
Yu'er...

870
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,740
Yu'er!

871
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,050
Your Highness!

872
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,610
Yu'er!

873
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,130
Yu'er.

874
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,260
Yu'er.

875
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,300
Yu'er.

876
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,210
Yu'er.

877
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,300
Yu'er.

878
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,090
Yu.

879
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,690
You still refuse to accept it, huh?

880
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,780
Only when you belittle others,

881
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,860
will you not be belittled by them.

882
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,420
Yu'er...

883
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,690
Yu'er.

884
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,380
Your Highness.

885
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,340
Yu'er.

886
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,210
Yu'er!

887
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,410
Yu'er...

888
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,650
Yu'er...

889
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,300
It's snowing.

890
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,920
[Tai'an Hall]

891
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,380
Is that Yu?

892
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,090
Why is he kneeling over there?

893
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,460
Seventh Prince started a fight
with the other princes

894
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,900
at the academy today.

895
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,250
This is His Majesty's punishment.

896
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,650
Yu can be naughty.

897
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,380
But he knows when to stop.

898
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,650
Why would he pick a fight with others?

899
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,130
Because Seventh Prince was upset

900
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,500
that his result was not as good

901
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,300
as yours.

902
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,380
The other princes made fun of him for that.

903
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,500
A prince

904
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,980
even ridiculed Consort Xuan.

905
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,460
So Seventh Prince lost it and...

906
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,050
Your Highness.

907
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,380
Are you my sixth brother?

908
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,210
