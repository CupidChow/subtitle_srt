[Episode 20]

25
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,700
Ye Xiaoying the Slayer?

26
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,130
General Ye,

27
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,340
what brings you here

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,250
from Tianqi?

29
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,780
He,

30
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,900
do you think

31
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,060
I wanted to visit the Lei Fortress?

32
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,900
I'm not willing

33
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,370
to be involved

34
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,410
with you guys.

35
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,810
However,

36
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,970
I think my daughter is with you guys.

37
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:30,940
Tell me then.

38
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,060
Should I come or not?

39
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,340
Father?

40
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,220
My daughter,

41
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,810
are you hurt?

42
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,250
That's great to hear.

43
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,500
She's the daughter of Ye Xiaoying?

44
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,340
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

45
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,250
You...

46
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,370
Do you like her?

47
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:06,900
Ruoyi,

48
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,780
how's the person you mentioned

49
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,850
in Xueyue City doing?

50
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,500
Chuhe is seriously wounded.

51
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,130
He's being treated right now.

52
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,740
Today's a crucial day for his survival.

53
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,650
Were you guys pursued?

54
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,130
The information I sent
to the General's Residence

55
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,460
was leaked.

56
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,220
I was too careless.

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,570
You don't need to blame yourself.

58
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,090
Let's go.

59
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,570
Kid,

60
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,780
I was just

61
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,810
testing you.

62
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,900
After all, you're the son of my old friend.

63
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,220
You didn't disappoint me at all.

64
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,300
Speaking of which,

65
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,530
I even carried you

66
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,500
when you were born.

67
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,570
Greetings, Mr. Ye.

68
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,530
Good.

69
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,090
Let's go.

70
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,900
Ye Xiaoying didn't come here

71
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,900
just to see his daughter.

72
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,500
He's here for the sake

73
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,690
of the one lying in there.

74
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,780
Martial Uncle, you mean...

75
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,810
He brought many men with him.

76
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,690
When he gives the order,

77
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,890
they can rush into Lei Fortress
and take him away.

78
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,570
We would have no way to stop him.

79
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,980
I can stop him.

80
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,660
Xiao Se?

81
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:35,940
Xiao Se!

82
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,570
I won't open the door. Don't come in.

83
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,100
Lei Wujie, are you all right?

84
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,100
I'm fine.

85
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,130
I just want to see

86
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,330
if Xiao Se is all right.

87
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,660
This is the first time

88
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,570
Wuxin is treating me like this.

89
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,450
What exactly

90
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,860
is going on in there?

91
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,010
This is what you call terminal lucidity.

92
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,250
Even his powers

93
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:03,980
have grown significantly.

94
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,500
This should be the price

95
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,500
of taking the Three-Day Pill.

96
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,770
The power

97
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,620
in his body

98
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,060
will surge within an instant.

99
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,770
With this power,

100
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,370
he can remain invincible

101
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,370
for an hour.

102
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,300
However, he will be vulnerable

103
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,210
after an hour.

104
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,330
We don't have much time now.

105
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,130
We should suppress him first.

106
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,540
After that, we'll clear his hidden pulse

107
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,450
and remove his zhenqi.

108
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,500
After that,

109
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,660
he will never be able
to practice martial arts again.

110
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,500
He might not even be able to walk properly.

111
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,500
This is the only way to save him.

112
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,890
Never be able to practice martial arts?

113
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,500
I hope he won't blame me for this.

114
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,500
Forget it.

115
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,130
I once lost all of my powers too.

116
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,660
However, I obtained Peace.

117
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,660
Continue.

118
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,770
Stop.

119
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,540
Move aside.

120
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,060
Are you the young divine healer?

121
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,980
I've seen Tang Lian's

122
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,420
Fatal Blossom Shower.

123
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,660
But he's nothing compared to you.

124
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,210
Snow Chickweed?

125
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,060
That's an extremely rare herb.

126
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,690
Do you two have any powers?

127
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,100
Barely.

128
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,500
I guess.

129
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,420
I need an absolute answer.

130
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,890
Please answer me again.

131
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,330
Top ten in Beili Kingdom.

132
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,330
Top one outside of Beili Kingdom.

133
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:41,890
Great.

134
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,210
I want you guys to assist me

135
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:43,690
in forcing

136
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,740
his internal energy into his hidden pulse.

137
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,620
That's what we did before.

138
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,980
But when we suppressed his internal energy,

139
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,450
it would bounce back.

140
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,180
This time,

141
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,690
I will seal off his hidden pulse.

142
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,540
What you guys need to do

143
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,660
is to force his zhenqi

144
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,180
back into the hidden pulse.

145
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,660
I still have nine silver needles.

146
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,420
That's enough.

147
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,420
Okay.

148
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,660
Let's try again.

149
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,060
Excuse me.

150
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,060
Mister, are you

151
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,770
from Sword Heart Tomb?

152
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,420
No.

153
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,540
I'm just a passerby.

154
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,620
I met the lady who was rushing by coincidence.

155
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,980
And her horse was out of stamina.

156
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,500
That's why I sent her here.

157
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,300
I see.

158
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,300
If that's the case,

159
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,810
you can be considered our benefactor.

160
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:46,980
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

161
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,420
Don't mention it.

162
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,620
Marquis,

163
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,660
I'm still here.

164
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,100
Drop the act, please.

165
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,330
General.

166
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,100
This must be your daughter.

167
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,620
She's all grown up.

168
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,690
She does resemble her mother.

169
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,860
Greetings, Marquis Lanyue.

170
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,810
The Golden Marquis Lanyue?

171
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:10,690
Do you know him?

172
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,890
I've only heard of his name before.

173
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,300
He's His Majesty's

174
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,810
youngest brother.

175
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,420
General, what are you doing here?

176
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,860
My daughter is disobedient.

177
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,300
Although she's weak,

178
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,420
she loves to explore dangerous places.

179
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,370
I had no choice

180
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,370
but to catch her myself.

181
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,850
I understand now.

182
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,060
General, you're here to catch your daughter.

183
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,730
However, I don't think you need

184
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,970
the mighty Ye Battalion for this.

185
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,060
Excuse me.

186
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,260
Let me interrupt for a second.

187
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,940
I don't understand

188
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,420
the conversation

189
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,060
between a marquis

190
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,850
and a general like you guys.

191
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,940
Seems like this young man

192
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,780
still doesn't know

193
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,450
who's lying inside, huh?

194
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,140
I know who he is.

195
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,780
He's my friend, Xiao Se.

196
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,810
Xiao Se?

197
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,450
He's Lord Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe.

198
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,940
Lord Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe?

199
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:40,490
This is...

200
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,300
This is...

201
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,570
Are you referring

202
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,420
to the Lord Yong'an who stood up for Lord Langya?

203
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,730
Are you referring

204
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,780
to the 17-year-old prodigy
who reached the Insouciant Phase?

205
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,970
Qianluo,

206
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,810
they say Xiao Se is Lord Yong'an.

207
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,490
What...

208
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,420
(So, that's what Father meant)

209
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,570
(when he told me to protect him.)

210
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,420
Xiao Se is Xiao Chuhe.

211
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,020
Xiao Se is Lord Yong'an.

212
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,780
Lord Yong'an is Xiao Se?

213
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:09,730
Qianluo?

214
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,420
Qianluo?

215
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,260
Xiao Se is Lord Yong'an.

216
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,900
Aren't you excited?

217
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,540
Young man,

218
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,900
why are you so excited?

219
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,850
He's a legendary character.

220
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,380
Of course I'm excited.

221
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,300
Qianluo,

222
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,380
hurry and tell Lian

223
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,450
about this thrilling news!

224
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,420
Go now.

225
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,540
Lian.

226
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:41,850
Lian,

227
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,730
why didn't you come over when you were awake?

228
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,900
Tang Clan

229
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,850
was the cause of everything after all.

230
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,140
As a disciple of the Tang Clan,

231
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,850
I truly feel guilty.

232
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,210
Let's forget about that for now.

233
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,260
Lian,

234
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,140
Xiao Se

235
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,730
is actually Xiao Chuhe, the Sixth Prince.

236
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,730
I never expected that to be true.

237
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,300
You knew about it?

238
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,260
It was just my speculation.

239
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,660
And now, a general

240
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,540
and even a marquis

241
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,250
are here.

242
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,730
Seems like they're going to take him away.

243
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,810
Marquis?

244
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,660
Let's go.

245
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:23,850
Wuxin,

246
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,660
do you know that Xiao Se

247
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,610
is Lord Yong'an?

248
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,020
Why are you frowning at me?

249
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,900
Are you upset because I'm better-looking

250
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,940
than you?

251
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,300
You're a dashing young man indeed.

252
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,690
You do look like

253
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,970
one of my old friends.

254
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,660
Do you know

255
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,610
my father, Ye Dingzhi?

256
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,970
Ye Dingzhi?

257
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,210
I've heard a lot about him.

258
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,330
However, I've never seen him before.

259
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,300
Wuxin,

260
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,810
how's Xiao Se?

261
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,570
You guys got yourself a gem here.

262
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,940
That young lady

263
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,380
is truly a divine healer.

264
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,610
She saved

265
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,490
Xiao Se's life

266
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,810
with just a few needles.

267
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:02,940
However,

268
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:03,940
she doesn't have

269
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,810
a great temper.

270
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,490
You guys have to be careful

271
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,850
when you talk to her.

272
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,490
Okay.

273
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:10,970
I'll go and take a look.

274
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,850
I want to visit my nephew too.

275
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,180
Those who pass my sword

276
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,780
will be slain.

277
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,780
I forgot to ask

278
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,450
this young man for his identity.

279
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,260
Who are you?

280
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,140
Why are you stopping us?

281
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,450
I'm the Azure Dragon,

282
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,330
one of Tianqi's Four Guardians.

283
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,420
I guard the East.

284
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,210
Azure Dragon?

285
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,490
Who are you to Li Xinyue?

286
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,810
My father is Lei Mengsha,

287
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,330
my mother is Li Xinyue,

288
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,810
and my sister is Li Hanyi.

289
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,450
I see.

290
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,570
Lei Wujie,

291
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,090
they just want to check on

292
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,330
Xiao Se's injury.

293
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,610
If there's anything,

294
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,780
-when Xiao Se awakes...
-Miss Ruoyi,

295
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,690
pardon me, but I cannot do so.

296
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,330
Wise man,

297
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,330
you're the son of my superior.

298
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,610
Naturally, I will protect you

299
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,540
from any harm.

300
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,490
However, the person inside

301
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,940
has a unique identity.

302
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,540
I have to take him with me.

303
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,660
Ye Xiaoying,

304
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,660
are you trying to defy His Majesty's decree?

305
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,260
His Majesty's decree?

306
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,300
If that's the case,

307
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,690
Marquis, I assume

308
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,690
you have His Majesty's decree with you.

309
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,570
Please let me read it then.

310
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,610
Ye Xiaoying,

311
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,570
how dare you!

312
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,330
People call me the Slayer!

313
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,730
Do you think I'm timid?

314
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,260
Lian.

315
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,260
Who might you be?

316
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,140
I'm the Black Tortoise.

317
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,780
One of Tianqi's Four Guardians.

318
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,060
I guard the North.

319
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,730
You're a disciple of Tang Lianyue?

320
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,610
I'm a disciple of Tang Lianyue

321
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,780
and Baili Dongjun of Xueyue City,

322
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,210
Tang Lian.

323
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,850
Greetings, Marquis Lanyue.

324
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,060
Miss,

325
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,850
which guardian are you then?

326
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,940
Must I be

327
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:09,690
one of the guardians?

328
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,380
It concerns Xiao Se.

329
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,690
That's why I'm here.

330
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,300
Are you the daughter of the Spear Deity?

331
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,730
I'm the Vermilion Bird,

332
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,660
one of Tianqi's Four Guardians.

333
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
I guard the South.

334
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,330
If so, you can count me in.

335
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,450
You guys stood in front of me

336
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,540
that day.

337
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,140
Today, it's my turn to protect you guys.

338
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,140
Great.

339
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,490
That's brave of you.

340
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,660
It's been years since I witnessed this.

341
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,300
I have to take the person inside

342
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,330
with me

343
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,260
as it's my task.

344
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:55,970
Stop.

345
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,260
You guys want to steal my patient

346
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,380
when he hasn't recovered yet?

347
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,020
Fine.

348
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,610
You guys can go ahead.

349
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,810
You can go for it.

350
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,300
Do you believe

351
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,260
that he'll die

352
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,060
within three days on the road?

353
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,490
That's easy.

354
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,060
I just need to bring you along.

355
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,210
That's pointless.

356
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,210
I can't cure him.

357
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,060
What?

358
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,260
Divine Healer,

359
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,210
please be more specific.

360
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,110
Just now, you've suppressed

361
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,860
his injury.

362
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,860
Did something else happen?

363
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,900
Xiao Se's condition has stabilized.

364
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,830
However, that's the only thing I can do.

365
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,990
If so, how can we make sure
he recovers completely?

366
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,500
The celestial mountain,

367
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,900
Penglai Island,

368
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,310
the reclusive deities,

369
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,140
and the Soul-Amending Skill.

370
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,230
Mr. Xie, I'm afraid

371
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,470
these are just nonsense

372
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,900
written in books.

373
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,350
Even if Penglai Island does exist,

374
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,660
no one has been there before.

375
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,310
Chuhe can only

376
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,740
stay alive

377
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,110
if he returns to Tianqi with me.

378
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,470
Even my master can't treat his condition.

379
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,860
No one else

380
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,740
can treat him.

381
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,590
The State Preceptor, Qi Tianchen.

382
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,950
Qi Tianchen might be able to do it.

383
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,310
But judging from Xiao Se's current condition,

384
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,020
stepping into Tianqi

385
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,950
doesn't seem like

386
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,860
a wise choice.

387
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,860
What do you mean by that?

388
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,660
Could it be that you want him to die here?

389
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,070
No one else in Tianqi can harm him

390
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,500
when I'm here.

391
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,140
If that person could harm him back then,

392
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,430
he can harm him this time, too.

393
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,860
The celestial mountain

394
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,620
isn't just a myth.

395
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,980
Someone has been there before.

396
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,350
Who is it?

397
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,020
Baili Dongjun.

398
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,380
My master has been
to the celestial mountain before?

399
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,660
He has.

400
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,900
He lost all of his powers

401
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,110
after his second visit to the island.

402
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,590
But after his return,

403
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,190
he fought Ye Dingzhi

404
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,110
and repelled the Demon Sect.

405
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,110
Even if you're right,

406
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,230
judging from his condition,

407
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,620
tell me how long

408
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,540
he can last.

409
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:00,950
I'm going.

410
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,660
Xiao Se.

411
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,500
Why are you pretending to be tough?

412
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,390
Look at your current state.

413
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,340
Maybe you'll be dead

414
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,630
before leaving the sea.

415
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,390
Uncle,

416
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,630
I want my hidden pulse to be cured.

417
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,630
What's the point in treating your hidden pulse

418
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,430
but losing your life?

419
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,500
The State Preceptor
cannot treat your hidden pulse.

420
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,580
However, he can make sure
you have nothing to worry about

421
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,710
for the rest of your life.

422
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,500
What happens after that?

423
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,190
Do I have to spend my entire life

424
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,630
like a good-for-nothing?

425
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,020
I need to give it a try

426
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,430
as long as there's a sliver of hope.

427
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,870
No one can stop me.

428
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,710
Okay.

429
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,870
Since you've said so,

430
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,340
I will keep you company.

431
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,740
We're just heading to an island, right?

432
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,710
If we depart from Dongji,

433
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,910
we can reach Sanshe Island

434
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,190
within half a month.

435
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,500
Uncle.

436
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,950
Yes?

437
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,580
General Ye.

438
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,340
Your Highness, do you have any instructions?

439
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,950
Please return to Tianqi now.

440
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,710
I came here

441
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,390
under your father's order.

442
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,470
I have to bring you back.

443
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,580
If not, I cannot face His Majesty.

444
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,870
Uncle, please look at my hand.

445
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,540
What do you mean by that?

446
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,950
I've slain

447
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,260
countless enemies with my hands.

448
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,670
I've even pointed fingers

449
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,340
at the Emperor himself.

450
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,630
But now,

451
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,780
I don't even have the strength

452
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,670
to grab a stick.

453
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,870
Uncle,

454
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,780
do you think the Xiao Chuhe you know

455
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,190
will spend the rest of his life like this?

456
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,190
Chuhe,

457
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,910
I wish to help you too.

458
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,060
But I...

459
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,870
One year.

460
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,390
After one year,

461
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,910
at this time,

462
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,910
no matter if I've recovered or not,

463
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,870
no matter if I'm alive or not,

464
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,990
I will be in Xueyue City,

465
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,950
waiting for you all.

466
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,870
No matter who it is,

467
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,100
I will surely return with you guys.

468
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,950
Okay.

469
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,540
If it was someone else,

470
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,390
I'd never compromise.

471
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,780
But I'm sure

472
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,060
you will keep your word.

473
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,780
See you in Xueyue City

474
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,150
after one year.

475
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,300
I will surely keep my promise.

476
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,500
Xiao Se?

477
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:51,870
That's a great name.

478
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,950
But I expect you

479
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,500
to appear as Xiao Chuhe.

480
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,950
Chuhe,

481
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,780
on that day, I will lead

482
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,300
your father's 1,000 Tiger Soldiers

483
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,990
and raise

484
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,100
the golden divine bird flag of the Xiao family.

485
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,910
We will call your name

486
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,390
in Xueyue City.

487
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,190
Remember.

488
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,820
You're the Sixth Prince of the Xiao family

489
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,740
and Lord Yong'an of Beili.

490
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,150
Tianqi

491
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,430
will always be your home.

492
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,260
Your Highness,

493
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,340
we'll wait for your return.

494
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,230
Take care, General Ye.

495
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,540
Ruoyi.

496
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,300
Since Third City Lord

497
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,910
couldn't cure you

498
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,500
even after so long,

499
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,060
I think we should seek help

500
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,260
from the State Preceptor.

501
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,230
Let's go.

502
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,260
Ruoyi.

503
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,390
Be a good girl.

504
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,230
Ruo...

505
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,740
I think you stand a chance.

506
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,990
Really?

507
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,100
Really.

508
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,820
She looked at two people

509
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,820
when she was leaving.

510
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,020
She looked at Xiao Se

511
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,230
because they were old acquaintances.

512
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,190
The other person was you.

513
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,780
You're her new friend.

514
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,060
You're a monk.

515
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,060
What do you know?

516
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:35,670
By the way,

517
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,230
do you want to join us?

518
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,710
It's been so long since we traveled together.

519
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,470
My identity is special.

520
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,780
If I join you guys,

521
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,470
people might think

522
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,430
that I'm up to no good.

523
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,300
I'm afraid we'll be stopped

524
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,230
before we can depart from land

525
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,910
even though I'm kind and just.

526
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,780
Kind and just?

527
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,020
I couldn't tell.

528
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,630
You're right.

529
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,190
Of course you can't tell.

530
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,260
That's why you couldn't tell

531
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,780
when people are interested in you.

532
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,710
All right.

533
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,500
I'll go now.

534
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,260
We made a promise

535
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,020
that we'd view the peak of Mount Kunlun,

536
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,020
the edge of the sea,

537
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,910
and the edge of the world.

538
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,870
You must return safely.

539
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,430
You came back this time

540
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,870
to settle some old scores, right?

541
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,430
No.

542
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,260
I came here to check on you.

543
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,540
Nonsense.

544
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,950
I could say the same.

545
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,260
See you.

546
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,430
I look forward

547
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,150
to the day we meet again.

548
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,780
Why does he do that all the time?

549
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,780
He comes and goes whenever he feels like it.

550
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:38,710
Lei Wujie,

551
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,390
protect him on the way to the celestial mountain.

552
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,500
Why did you only tell Lei Wujie that?

553
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,710
What about me?

554
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,150
How could you omit me

555
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,990
from the Four Guardians of Tianqi?

556
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,670
Four Guardians of Tianqi?

557
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,540
They are just titles

558
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,470
imposed by others onto you.

559
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,300
Just forget about me.

560
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,670
Do you think I'm doing this

561
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,300
because of that title?

562
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,630
I just said it

563
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,100
to make myself cooler.

564
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,740
I was trying to scare them away.

565
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,670
I'm helping you out

566
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,390
because we're friends.

567
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,910
What kind of friends?

568
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,670
Naturally, we're friends

569
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,150
who have gone through

570
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,150
thick and thin together.

571
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,010
Xiao Se,

572
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:17,910
you don't need to

573
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,540
reject them.

574
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,390
Since you wish to return to your old self,

575
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,780
you should accept

576
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,870
our assistance.

577
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,870
Prince Xiao,

578
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,580
are you done?

579
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,580
If so, we should continue our treatment.

580
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,470
You shouldn't talk too much

581
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,340
when you're about to die.

582
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,870
Zhao Yuzhen is dead.

583
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,540
Li Hanyi went berserk.

584
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,780
After that, a huge fight erupted in Lei Fortress.

585
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,340
Lei Qianhu of the Lei Clan
was murdered by Dark River.

586
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,470
Old Master Tang of the Tang Clan

587
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,910
was murdered by Xiao Chuhe.

588
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,580
Lei Yunhe has made a comeback,

589
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,020
and the Two Heroes of the Lei Clan
have resurfaced.

590
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,260
That's all.

591
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,870
Has Chuhe got his power back?

592
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,740
It wasn't stated in the letter.

593
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,340
Even if he did get his power back,

594
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,300
he wouldn't be able to kill Old Master Tang.

595
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,870
Judging by his personality,

596
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,260
he will never commit an act

597
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,470
that will incite the hatred
of the entire Tang Clan.

598
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,540
There's more to this than meets the eye.

599
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:19,390
Investigate it thoroughly.

600
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,300
Yes, Your Highness.

601
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,950
Initially, I just wanted Old Master Tang

602
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,740
to let Tang Ze show his skills

603
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,910
during the heroes' gathering

604
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,190
so that we could suppress the Lei Fortress.

605
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,580
But the involvement of Dark River

606
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,710
has landed us

607
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,100
in an irredeemable situation.

608
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,630
This is good too.

609
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,300
Now, the Tang Clan and the Lei Clan

610
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,820
are hostile to one another.

611
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
They turned against each other.

612
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,990
It's a huge blow

613
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,300
to Xueyue City.

614
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,710
What about that person?

615
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,740
We have no news of him yet.

616
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,020
Wrathful Sword Deity will come soon.

617
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,300
I believe he will have an answer.

618
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,540
But I keep feeling

619
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,630
that there's a mastermind

620
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,470
behind everything.

621
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,670
[Lord Chi's Residence]
When I look at it,

622
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,950
it may seem like a waste

623
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,820
now that Old Master Tang is dead,

624
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,670
but turning the Tang Clan

625
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,740
against the Lei Clan

626
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,910
has reduced Xueyue City's power.

627
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,300
This is a great deal

628
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,710
for Xiao Chong,

629
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,300
who has bet everything on Wushuang City.

630
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,020
Indeed.

631
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,820
If two men ride on a horse, one must ride behind.

632
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,910
Just let them fight.

633
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,500
If both of them perish,

634
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,990
the world will be mine.

635
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,230
But this time,

636
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,870
I've overestimated Xiao Chong.

637
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,950
He made a cowardly decision.

638
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,060
Rumor has it that Xiao Chuhe

639
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,260
is only alive

640
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,780
all thanks to Ye Anshi.

641
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,950
I made one wrong move.

642
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,060
I thought Ye Dingzhi's child

643
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,430
would be as ambitious

644
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,870
as I am.

645
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,260
What shall we do next?

646
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,540
He should be returning to Tianqi City too.

647
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,540
We have to prepare ourselves

648
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,100
before he arrives.

649
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,780
Qianluo, listen to me.

650
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,500
No, I won't.

651
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,230
You guys are tricking me.

652
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,100
Too many things had happened here.

653
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,540
We cannot write all of them down in a letter.

654
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,630
Someone needs to return to Xueyue City

655
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,580
and notify Third Master.

656
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,300
Lian, you should go then.

657
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,630
Qianluo.

658
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,470
I'll be fine with Lei Wujie

659
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,060
and Tang Lian by my side.

660
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,780
Report back to Xueyue City.

661
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,870
You can meet up with us

662
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,990
at Dongji Sea City by then.

663
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,100
We need to recuperate

664
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,780
at Lei Fortress for several days anyway.

665
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,430
The timing will be just right.

666
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,820
Are you sure you're not deceiving me?

667
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,630
Marquis Lanyue said

668
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,740
Xiao Chuhe is a man of his word.

669
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,470
Even he believes in him.

670
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,470
Why don't you believe in him?

671
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,340
Okay.

672
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,630
I believe in you.

673
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,230
I won't waste any time.

674
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,340
I'll depart right now.

675
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,630
Are you sure you want to bring Qianluo along?

676
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,540
I deceived her.

677
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,190
But you said

678
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,820
you are a man of your word.

679
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,230
You should listen closely.

680
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,580
I said

681
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,500
Xiao Chuhe is a man of his word.

682
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,500
I'm Xiao Se. It has nothing to do with me.

683
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,060
You're a liar indeed.

684
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,100
I've asked you so many times

685
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,630
if you were the person I was waiting for.

686
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,630
But you said no.

687
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,740
I don't know

688
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,710
if you're the successor
of the Black Tortoise Token.

689
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,670
But you know everything.

690
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,430
Do you think it's difficult for you?

691
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,670
Although I had no choice,

692
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,820
Old Master Tang did die in front of me

693
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,150
and everyone there saw it.

694
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Right now, the entire Tang Clan

695
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,950
sees me as their sworn enemy.

696
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,020
Yet, as the eldest disciple of the Tang Clan,

697
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,670
you swore to protect me.

698
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,330
[Tianqi, protecting the land]

699
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,100
It's because I uphold my principles.

700
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,580
I told you long ago.

701
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,820
You shouldn't be too hard on yourself.

702
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,340
To be honest,

703
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,260
I didn't kill Old Master Tang.

704
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,500
What?

705
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,630
With the internal force I had back then,

706
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,500
I could never kill him

707
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,780
under their pressure.

708
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,630
I speculate that Su Changhe

709
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,630
launched a sneak attack.

710
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,910
He's the true killer.

711
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,340
However, the Tang Clan

712
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,060
will never believe in that.

713
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:20,950
I believe in you.

714
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,990
You believe in me?

715
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,780
Xiao Se!

716
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,020
Why do you shout my name

717
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,870
every day?

718
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,670
What else should I call you then?

719
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,630
Should I call you Xiao Chuhe, Lord Yong'an?

720
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,740
Or should I call you Sixth Prince, Your Highness?

721
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,710
Are you itching for a beating?

722
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,260
I was just kidding.

723
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,780
It doesn't matter if you're Xiao Chuhe,

724
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,500
Lord Yong'an,

725
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,390
or Sixth Prince.

726
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,430
I only know that you're Xiao Se.

727
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,430
You're

728
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,390
my best friend.

729
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,580
That's why

730
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,060
you should let me show you around

731
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,540
since it's your first time

732
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,230
coming to Lei Fortress.

733
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,260
You've grown up.

734
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,430
Sure.

735
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,580
[Hanshui Temple]
Master, I've returned.

736
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,710
Wuxin?

737
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,390
Why have you returned?

738
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,580
It's because you said before

739
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,470
that Hanshui Temple would always be my home.

740
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,990
You said that I could come back anytime.

741
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,390
All monks in Hanshui Temple

742
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,430
have left.

743
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,260
I'm the only person left.

744
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,060
Wuxin, it would be great

745
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,580
if you could come back.

746
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,630
It's a shame
that I'm only staying here for a few days.

747
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,820
I can't stay here for long.

748
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,390
Wuchan,

749
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,870
I have a favor to ask of you.

750
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:00,910
His irises are scattered and dispersed.

751
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,340
Obviously, he has lost his mind.

752
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,060
Don't worry. I can save him.

753
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,630
Minghou,

754
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,870
you shall stay here in the future.

755
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,950
You'll learn the Purification Chants from him.

756
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,630
"Learn it

757
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,910
to repel demons

758
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,020
and the inner demon."

759
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,780
Although Master said that before,

760
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,540
it might take a long time.

761
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,390
That's fine.

762
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,060
Minghou can stay here.

763
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,990
I need to look for someone.

764
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,670
Rumor has it

765
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,060
that she was one of the people

766
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,710
who caused my father to be killed.

767
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,990
Wuxin, do you still harbor hatred against them?

768
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,060
When Baili Dongjun

769
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,390
sparred with my father,

770
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,230
he barely won.

771
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,910
My father managed to survive
even though he was seriously wounded.

772
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,430
In the end, he was intercepted
and killed in Jiangnan.

773
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,340
Rumor has it

774
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,670
that the leader of those who killed him

775
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,260
was Li Hanyi.

776
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,580
I'm just curious

777
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,020
as to what happened that day.

778
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,100
So, you'll head to Xueyue City

779
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,390
and look for Li Hanyi?

780
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:04,990
No.

781
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,630
Li Hanyi showed herself

782
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,390
at Lei Fortress that day.

783
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,820
She was harmed by Dark River's Leader.

784
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,540
Now, she has gone berserk.

785
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,580
So I need to look for her.

786
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,950
Even Li Hanyi, Xueyue Sword Deity,

787
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,710
was harmed by Dark River.

788
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,990
Is the martial arts world
going to embrace a major change?

789
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,140
The entire Beili Kingdom

790
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,580
will experience a major change.

791
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,910
Marquis, you rushed back to Tianqi.

792
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,020
However, you came to me
instead of heading to the palace.

793
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,230
Have you encountered

794
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,580
a difficult issue?

795
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,060
I heard from people

796
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,470
that there's a celestial mountain
called Penglai Island

797
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,950
right outside of Sanshe Island.

798
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,780
There's a deity on the island.

799
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,870
He can ride

800
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,020
the wind,

801
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,340
co-exist with Heaven and Earth,

802
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,060
and live as long as the sun and the moon.

803
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,060
State Preceptor,

804
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,540
have you heard about him before?

805
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,470
Baili Dongjun mentioned

806
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,100
his experience on the island to me before.

807
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,630
But I advised him

808
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,060
not to return to that island.

809
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,150
But why?

810
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,990
This book records all kinds of peculiar things.

811
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,910
According to the books,

812
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,780
there are three levels of power

813
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,540
and five levels of celestialhood.

814
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,950
The five levels are

815
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,950
Sky Deity, Divine Deity,

816
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,670
Earth Deity, Human Deity, and Ghost Deity.

817
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,630
State Preceptor,

818
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,950
I know you're powerful.

819
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,670
But I'm not a cultivator.

820
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,630
I don't understand what you're saying.

821
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,020
Calm down.

822
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,150
Out of the five levels,

823
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,740
there are certain skills
that match your previous description.

824
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,150
There are all kinds of mystical skills
in the world.

825
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,470
As long as you're sincere
in cultivating your skills,

826
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,820
you'll achieve immortality.

827
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,190
The deity you mentioned

828
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,740
might be

829
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,630
the Earth Deity who really exists.

830
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,430
Could it be that deities truly exist?

831
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,100
Master,

832
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,100
His Majesty is waiting in the side hall.

833
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,100
My brother

834
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,580
is quite anxious.

835
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,230
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

836
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,100
Spare the formalities.

837
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,150
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

838
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,260
Lanyue.

839
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,300
Why didn't you come to see me

840
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,260
in Pingqing Palace after your return?

841
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,710
Why did you head to the Directorate of Astronomy?

842
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,150
I had some doubts,

843
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,950
and I wanted State Preceptor
to resolve them for me

844
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,990
before I came to see you, Your Majesty.

845
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,340
If so, has State Preceptor

846
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,500
resolved your doubts?

847
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,190
State Preceptor is on another level.

848
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,670
It's as if he has answered my question

849
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,990
and hasn't at the same time.

850
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,470
Lanyue,

851
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,470
you just need to tell me

852
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,020
whether you met Chuhe or not.

853
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,100
I did meet him.

854
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,390
Why didn't you bring him back?

855
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,060
I wanted to bring him back too.

856
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,660
It's just

857
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,100
that there were several people protecting him.

858
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,500
Who has such audacity to stop you?

859
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,220
The son of General Lei Mengsha.

860
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,830
There's another person

861
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,470
called Tang Lian as well.

862
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,180
He's Tang Lianyue's only disciple.

863
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,750
After that, he moved to Xueyue City.

864
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,430
He's also the disciple of Baili Dongjun.

865
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,020
Lei Fortress,

866
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,700
Tang Clan,

867
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,990
and Xueyue City.

868
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,350
Do they still intend

869
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,750
to interfere with our family affairs?

870
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,220
Your Majesty,

871
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,830
it's not just them.

872
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,430
Chuhe

873
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,390
doesn't wish to return yet.

874
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,100
Does he still resent me?

875
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:11,910
No.

876
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,990
Actually, he's willing to return.

877
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
Chuhe's skills and power

878
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,830
were stripped

879
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,220
by someone

880
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,390
when he left Tianqi.

881
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,830
And he sustained

882
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,750
serious injuries in Lei Fortress

883
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,270
when he fought against
the assassins of Dark River.

884
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,430
Luckily, he was saved
by the successor of the Medicine King.

885
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,570
That's how he was able to survive.

886
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,870
But for him to be cured completely,

887
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,870
he has to head to a celestial island.

888
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,910
Rumor has it that a deity over there

889
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,430
can cure his meridians.

890
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,910
Although it's a perilous trip,

891
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,430
Chuhe still wants

892
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,020
to head there personally.

893
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,270
I thought he was still angry at me.

894
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,220
I never expected him

895
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,430
to have gone through this.

896
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,220
It's no wonder

897
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,950
you looked for State Preceptor.

898
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,910
It's related to celestialhood.

899
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,500
Your Majesty,

900
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,470
I've only heard about the deity on Penglai Island

901
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,790
without seeing him for myself.

902
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,660
State Preceptor,

903
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,580
can you cure Chuhe's condition?

904
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,390
I can at least make sure he survives.

905
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,390
Good.

906
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,700
Since State Preceptor has said that,

907
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,870
I

908
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,660
can rest at ease now.

909
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,500
Lanyue,

910
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,140
can you stop them

911
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,540
if you rush from Tianqi to Dongji?

912
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,350
Your Majesty,

913
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,140
but I've already

914
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,660
given Chuhe my promise.

915
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,500
You dare to make your own decisions right now, huh?

916
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,470
I dare not do so.

917
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,060
Your Majesty.

918
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,790
Eunuch Jinwei

919
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,990
can complete the task for you.

920
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,660
He's on his way

921
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,910
to Dongji right now.

922
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,410
[Dongji]

923
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,390
Hurry up!

924
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,220
Hurry up!

925
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,030
Let's return together later.

926
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,390
Lend me a hand.

927
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,310
We caught a lot today.

928
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:16,990
Leave them here.

929
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,220
Slowly.

930
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,100
Look.

931
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,580
Aren't we by the sea now?

932
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,220
Why can't I

933
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,310
find the sea anywhere?

934
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,140
Mister,

935
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,060
the sea is in the east while we're in the west.

936
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,990
Of course you won't find it.

937
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,030
Thanks.

938
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,740
The east?

939
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,430
Why can't I

940
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,540
tell directions no matter where I go?

941
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,510
It's getting late.

942
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,180
Mister, why do you wish to head to the sea?

943
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,060
I'm heading there to buy some food.

944
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,910
The market over there closes in the afternoon.

945
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,310
You won't get to buy anything.

946
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,030
If so, where can I buy some food?

947
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,470
I want something fresh

948
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,580
and cheap.

949
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,660
You should head to the fish market.

950
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,030
It operates until a later hour.

951
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,260
The fish market?

952
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:58,660
Although my shells

953
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,740
aren't valuable,

954
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,100
I can exchange them for a few copper coins.

955
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,310
If so, can you bring me to the fish market?

956
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:04,910
Sure.

957
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,510
Let's go.

958
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,470
Let's go.

959
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:08,870
By the way, mister,

960
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,790
what's your name?

961
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,260
I'm Lei Wujie.

962
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:11,950
Miss, what about you?

963
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,180
I'm Zhenzhu.

964
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,140
Miss Zhenzhu,

965
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,170
did you grow up

966
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:16,660
here?

967
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,220
That's right.

968
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,740
Have you been to the sea before?

969
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:19,700
Everyone here

970
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,870
has been to the sea before.

971
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,830
I'm heading to Sanshe Island.

972
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,790
Can the boats here

973
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,220
fetch me to Sanshe Island?

974
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,430
Sanshe Island?
(*three snakes)

975
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,580
A normal fisherman's boat

976
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,830
cannot reach the island.

977
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,870
Why do you want to head there?

978
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,580
To catch snakes?

979
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,260
I wish to check it out.

980
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,790
After all, that place is rumored to be

981
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,740
the edge of the sea.

982
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,030
A huge ship

983
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,990
just docked at our port recently.

984
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:39,830
Look.

985
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,030
There is

986
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,990
a huge flag on the ship.

987
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,180
It's a phoenix experiencing a rebirth.

988
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,540
They said

989
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,910
it's called Xuesong Ship.

990
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,540
My father said

991
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,430
that Xuesong Ship

992
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,430
is the largest and fastest ship in Beili.

993
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,350
I think only Xuesong Ship

994
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,580
can head toward

995
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,660
the edge of the sea.

996
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:57,870
Why don't you

997
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,100
check it out tomorrow?

998
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,990
I see.

999
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:16,990
Lian.

1000
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,180
I know what you're trying to say.

1001
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,350
I'm hungry too.

1002
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,350
This brat

1003
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,470
is so unreliable.

1004
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,700
It's been four hours,

1005
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,350
and he hasn't returned yet.

1006
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,260
I wonder where he went.

1007
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:28,870
Could it be

1008
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,910
that he's in trouble?

1009
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:31,950
That won't happen.

1010
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,060
I assume that brat

1011
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,060
is lost.

1012
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:38,870
Lian,

1013
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,740
Xiao Se,

1014
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,100
let's have some crabs.

1015
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,660
You're finally back.

1016
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,140
You brat.

1017
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,830
Why took you so long

1018
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,660
to buy some food?

1019
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,470
It's a long story.

1020
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,470
I went to

1021
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,030
their famous seafood market.

1022
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,870
They sell tortoises this huge

1023
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,470
and green groupers this long.

1024
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,830
If the tortoises are this huge

1025
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,310
and the green groupers are this long,

1026
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,350
why did you only

1027
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,310
buy us crabs?

1028
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,260
It's because they are cheap.

1029
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,660
Look, it's a huge plate.

1030
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,060
I'm not lying here.

1031
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,790
It only costs ten copper coins.

1032
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,910
Lei isn't wrong.

1033
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,950
We need to ride a boat to get to the sea.

1034
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,700
And we don't know how much we need to spend on it.

1035
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,470
Don't be angry.

1036
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,430
What a joke.

1037
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,620
I'm the owner of Snowfall Villa.

1038
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:23,950
I once won a city

1039
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,660
in Qianjin Gambling House.

1040
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,390
Do you think I can't afford a boat ride?

1041
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,180
I can even buy you a boat.

1042
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,310
Yeah, yeah.

1043
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,540
Mr. Xiao

1044
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,030
is the wealthiest and mightiest.

1045
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,540
So, Mr. Xiao, I assume

1046
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,620
you're not having these crabs, right?

1047
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,140
Hands off.

1048
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,510
Let's dig in then.

1049
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,390
Where did you get these stupid shells?

1050
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,700
Well,

1051
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,950
I bought them

1052
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,220
from a female local fisher.

1053
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,870
I bought the shells from her,

1054
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,430
and she helped me to find a boat.

1055
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,620
Have you inquired about the boat for us?

1056
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,140
Of course.

1057
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,540
However,

1058
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,430
the boats here

1059
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,220
cannot travel that far.

1060
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,740
The authorities don't allow them to do so either.

1061
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,350
However, there's a ship called Xuesong Ship.

1062
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,180
It can go

1063
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,220
to the furthest part of the sea.

1064
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,260
Xuesong Ship?

1065
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,540
There's even a cool flag

1066
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,220
on the ship.

1067
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,100
It depicts a phoenix

1068
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,700
experiencing a rebirth.

1069
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,180
That's

1070
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,660
the Flying Phoenix.

1071
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,740
It's the symbol of the Mu family in Qingzhou.

1072
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,310
The Mu family in Qingzhou?

1073
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,740
Qingzhou is just a category.

1074
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,180
The correct term

1075
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,870
should be the Nine Cities of Qingzhou.

1076
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,180
They're business-based cities.

1077
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,660
They occupy 80% of Beili's business industry.

1078
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,100
It's also the largest economic center

1079
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:43,950
in Beili.

1080
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,830
It represents the wealth of Tianqi.

1081
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:46,830
If that's the case,

1082
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,580
the Nine Cities of Qingzhou

1083
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,430
is like your family's treasure vault.

1084
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,390
You can put it that way.

1085
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,430
The Mu family is known

1086
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,830
as the richest family
in the Nine Cities of Qingzhou.
