[Episode 23]

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,920
Will you wake up

26
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,760
or continue

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,070
to live within this dream?

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,400
I want to live

29
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,000
in a world where you'll never leave.

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,600
I've been waiting for this day

31
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,070
for ages.

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,040
You fool.

33
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,510
I am already dead.

34
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,480
I can never come back

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,600
to the living world.

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,390
Life is but a dream.

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,440
You're only awake after death.

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,110
We will meet again someday.

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,200
But today is not the day.

40
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,510
It's time you wake up.

41
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,600
No.

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,950
I don't want to wake up.

43
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,350
After drinking the Oblivion Broth,

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
I'll forget everything

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,880
about this dream.

46
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,630
And it will be a new beginning for you.

47
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,280
Wouldn't that be nice?

48
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,320
I used to think the same thing.

49
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,630
But when I saw you again,

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,880
I want to stay in this dream.

51
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,550
It doesn't matter

52
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,040
if the world

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,480
has Baili Dongjun

54
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,760
in it.

55
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,830
Do not be stubborn.

56
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,550
Life

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,320
is but a dream.

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,070
Death

59
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,480
is the true awakening.

60
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,920
I hope

61
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,920
you don't have any regrets.

62
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,880
Why would you tell me not to have regrets?

63
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,040
Do you have any idea

64
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,950
how long I've spent in regret?

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,230
I still remember it.

66
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:56,830
How?

67
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,390
I remember everything.

68
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,830
Could it be

69
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,600
that the legend was false?

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,440
Master.

71
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:06,720
Master?

72
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,070
Tang Lian?

73
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
How did you know

74
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,790
how to get here?

75
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,600
The Third Master told me the way.

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:17,840
Master.

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,280
There's a pressing matter.

78
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,080
Xiao Se and the others might be in danger.

79
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,040
Xiao Se?

80
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,550
Is he

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,870
Xiao Chuhe who came to

82
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Xueyue City the other day?

83
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:30,840
Yes.

84
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,720
He wanted to heal his damaged meridians.

85
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,720
Yes.

86
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,400
But Mo Yi...

87
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,430
Mo Yi went berserk.

88
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,350
He's reached the Malevolence Phase.

89
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,750
I wanted to exorcise him,

90
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,990
but he

91
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,550
tricked me into drinking

92
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,670
the Oblivion Broth.

93
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,640
He went berserk?

94
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,790
We must rush there

95
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,520
immediately.

96
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,600
Xiao Se,

97
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,520
Qianluo,

98
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,670
Lei Wujie from the Lei Fortress,

99
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,990
and Ye Ruoyi, General Ye's daughter,

100
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,870
are all out there.

101
00:04:59,600 --> 00:04:59,990
Do you even know

102
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,960
what this place is?

103
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,280
The bunch of you

104
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,280
shouldn't have come.

105
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,110
I was reckless.

106
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,040
Master!

107
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,480
Whose doing is this?

108
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,600
Mo Yi?

109
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,790
Yes.

110
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,040
A bunch of rocks

111
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,110
was enough to stop you.

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,920
What a worthless fool.

113
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,840
Yes, I've failed you.

114
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,640
You have the mind of a rock.

115
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,640
You can't take a joke.

116
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:35,990
Stop staring.

117
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:36,870
Get moving.

118
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,480
Lian!

119
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,040
Have you found them?

120
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:57,920
No.

121
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,920
Time's up.

122
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,280
I'm here for what I seek.

123
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,990
What do you seek?

124
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,040
You.

125
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,160
Me?

126
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,990
Yes.

127
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,750
Form the formation!

128
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
The Three-Element Formation.

129
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,480
It's no wonder your aura

130
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
felt so familiar.

131
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,430
You're a disciple of Mount Huanglong.

132
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,960
Your body shouldn't be fit

133
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,160
to master spiritual arts.

134
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,400
Purify!

135
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,400
Exorcise!

136
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,720
Demise!

137
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,350
Token of Celestial Masters.

138
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,750
Of the entire Mount Huanglong,

139
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,160
my marital brother, Qi, is the only one

140
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,870
with this level of might,

141
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,160
barring only my master and me.

142
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,520
Are you Qi's disciple?

143
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,400
These three haven't mastered the art of Tao.

144
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,160
You're the only one

145
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,990
holding this Three-Element Formation.

146
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,960
Let's see how much longer you can hold on.

147
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,640
You stand before an immortal,

148
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,350
kneel!

149
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,840
Ruoyi!

150
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,080
Ruoyi!

151
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,520
He forced himself to enter the Insouciant Phase.

152
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,040
Ruoyi!

153
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,520
You did well,

154
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,350
but not well enough.

155
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,190
What is it that you want?

156
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,520
You'll find out soon enough.

157
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,710
Ruoyi!

158
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,240
Cease!

159
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,190
Ruoyi!

160
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,070
Ruoyi.

161
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,040
Baili Dongjun.

162
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,950
Mr. Mo Yi.

163
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,400
Ruoyi, are you all right?

164
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,920
Master Baili arrived in time.

165
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,830
Master is as powerful

166
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,830
as an immortal.

167
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,640
Has he reached another phase?

168
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,230
The Unbeatable Phase.

169
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,670
I saved you from your demise last time,

170
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,120
and I helped you brew

171
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,470
the Oblivion Broth.

172
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,920
Yet, you've come to ruin my plan.

173
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,620
The dead cannot come back to life.

174
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,790
Mr. Mo Yi,

175
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,310
you seek to use Miss Ye's body

176
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,430
to resurrect your younger sister.

177
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,640
But that is not possible.

178
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,160
You've lost your mind.

179
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,760
Let go of your obsession

180
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,160
before it's too late.

181
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,590
Who do you think you are?

182
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,400
Who are you

183
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,520
to lecture me?

184
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,520
I guess there's no other way.

185
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,000
You've shown me kindness.

186
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,040
So I'll let you make the first move.

187
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,140
You?

188
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,260
You're not worthy of fighting me.

189
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,660
Please.

190
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,060
After that dream,

191
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,180
you've become much stronger.

192
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,060
But you're still not a match for me.

193
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,420
Indeed.

194
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,140
I have a long way to go
before I can hope to beat you.

195
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,300
Therefore, I'll need some help

196
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,940
from others.

197
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,700
Lend me your weapons!

198
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,180
City Lord Baili

199
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,340
can control three weapons

200
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,420
simultaneously?

201
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,620
I know all the martial arts in the world.

202
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,940
I can slay

203
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,100
even an immortal!

204
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,460
Supervisor! Supervisor!

205
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,060
There's been an anomaly!

206
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,380
Please take a look now!

207
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,460
I've seen it.

208
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,580
Supervisor.

209
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,700
Such an anomaly is unprecedented.

210
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,940
It was daytime,

211
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,380
but the sun faded away,

212
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,500
and the sky became lit with stars.

213
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,500
There's no record

214
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,620
of such a phenomenon.

215
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,220
Yes, there is.

216
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,300
In the last chapter of the Scroll of Guluo,

217
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,660
the Verse of Annihilation.

218
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,180
Stars shine in the sky along with the sun.

219
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,740
An immortal descends to the mortal realm.

220
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,500
Heaven is shattered and Earth is razed.

221
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,340
The Scroll of Guluo?

222
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:04,980
Supervisor.

223
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,020
That was a forgery.

224
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,220
It's false because it tells

225
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,700
the secrets of fate.

226
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,020
It's too late.

227
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,860
Form the formation.

228
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,260
Formation?

229
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,460
What formation?

230
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,260
Dragon Seeker Formation.

231
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,260
I must see him.

232
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,700
Supervisor.

233
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,540
Do you know the cause of this anomaly?

234
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,900
Yes.

235
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,340
Master.

236
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,100
Eldest Martial Uncle.

237
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:46,980
Stand back.

238
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,420
It's a tough fight.

239
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,980
After you leave,

240
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,900
finish the Oblivion Broth.

241
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,740
It'll keep you alive.

242
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,580
Run!

243
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,500
Go.

244
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,500
Let's go.

245
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,020
Let's go.

246
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,420
Ruoyi!

247
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,100
Who is he?

248
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,980
Supervisor of Astronomy,

249
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,020
Qi Tianchen.

250
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,620
Your Highness.

251
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,060
How have you been?

252
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,580
It's been years.

253
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,580
You are still as humorous

254
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,340
as ever.

255
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,260
Has he reached

256
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,220
the Unbeatable Phase too?

257
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,700
I'm not as powerful as City Lord Baili.

258
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,940
I haven't reached

259
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,420
the Unbeatable Phase.

260
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,660
I manage

261
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,740
to project my spirit here

262
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,220
with the power

263
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,140
of the Dragon Seeker Formation.

264
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,140
Yi.

265
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,180
It's been years.

266
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,900
Tianchen.

267
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,300
Things have changed since we last met.

268
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,100
I am an old man

269
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,340
with gray hair.

270
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,820
But you?

271
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,700
You haven't aged a day at all!

272
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,660
I'm glad to know

273
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,780
you're still alive.

274
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,580
However,

275
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,820
as the heir of Mount Huanglong,

276
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,700
you've strayed from the righteous path.

277
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,900
That is a grave mistake.

278
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:47,940
Well?

279
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,860
Are you going to stand in my way too?

280
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,220
You and I are no longer

281
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,740
on the same level.

282
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,500
How are you supposed to stop me?

283
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,780
Kneel!

284
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,420
Very well.

285
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,340
I'll give you a head-start of three strikes.

286
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,860
This is for saving me.

287
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,740
If you hadn't looked back

288
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,540
that day,

289
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,460
I would have died.

290
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,340
Kneel!

291
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,460
This is for our sect.

292
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,020
Without Mount Huanglong,

293
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,380
I wouldn't be here.

294
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,260
Kneel!

295
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,940
This is for the bond we shared.

296
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,660
He took three hits from you, State Preceptor.

297
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,220
But there's not a scratch on him.

298
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,780
Are we even strong enough

299
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,300
to bring him down?

300
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,380
We need one more warrior for this.

301
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,420
Who is it?

302
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,500
You learned from the academy,
a descendant of Confucianism.

303
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,300
I learned the way of Tao, a state preceptor.

304
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,740
We need an exorcist

305
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,540
to be truly unbeatable.

306
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,700
Since we are one man short,

307
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,140
we'll have to give it our best.

308
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,340
Our chances are slim.

309
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,140
When I took on Ye Dingzhi

310
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,260
all alone,

311
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,700
the entire world

312
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,020
thought my chances were slim.

313
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,180
Very well.

314
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,140
I shall open a path for City Lord Baili!

315
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,660
What is that punch?

316
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,140
It's not a punch.

317
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,380
It's swordplay.

318
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,300
The legs are the grip.

319
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,780
The body is the blade.

320
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,860
The fists are the hilt.

321
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,740
The fingers are the point.

322
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,500
They use their bodies as swords.

323
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,500
I can do nothing but watch

324
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,740
this incredible duel.

325
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,780
Unless you've reached

326
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,220
the Insouciant Phase,

327
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,260
you're incapable of interfering.

328
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,820
The Insouciant Phase...

329
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,460
Lei Wujie.

330
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,260
Your body

331
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,860
is too weak to take on the Insouciant Phase.

332
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,060
If you enter the phase by force again,

333
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,980
you die.

334
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,500
You heard

335
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,260
what Supervisor said just now.

336
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,140
They need an exorcist

337
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
to become unbeatable.

338
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,380
Don't you remember?

339
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,020
I'd learned the technique.

340
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,180
Even now, I still follow his instructions.

341
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,060
(The technique I'm about to teach you)

342
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,700
(is the Freedom)

343
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,660
(Formidable Fist.)

344
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,700
I practice it every day.

345
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,900
If I die,

346
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,900
but we win the fight,

347
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,060
Ruoyi,

348
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,580
remember me.

349
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,020
Lei Wujie!

350
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,060
He...

351
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,220
An incredible Exorcising Fist!

352
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,060
You did well.

353
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,500
It's a shame not many

354
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,620
can witness this fight.

355
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,820
Otherwise,

356
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,220
you'd make a name for yourself.

357
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,460
Qianluo.

358
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,020
Do you have any strength left?

359
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,020
Yes.

360
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,380
Toss the spear.

361
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,300
Toss it!

362
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,820
Xiao Se!

363
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,060
The immortal said
the saints were unaffected by emotions.

364
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,580
It's to be unaffected by emotions,

365
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,900
not merciless.

366
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,100
You haven't forgotten the obsession,

367
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,780
but you've made yourself merciless.

368
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,060
I am disappointed in you.

369
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,980
Who are you?

370
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,820
I am Mo Yi.

371
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,180
Mo Yi, the immortal.

372
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,220
How are you Mo Yi?

373
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:57,940
No.

374
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,220
I am Mo Yi.

375
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,260
Xiao Se!

376
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:08,980
Xiao Se!

377
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,340
City Lord Baili!

378
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,660
Break!

379
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,420
Xiao Se!

380
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,740
Xiao Se!

381
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,820
I am the Liquor Deity of the material world.

382
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,100
The intoxication
shall send me to the sky's limit.

383
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,780
I seek not the deities dancing in the wind,

384
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,460
but a drunken deity!

385
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,660
Break!

386
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,260
From now on,

387
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,180
this unparalleled scent
shall perish from the world.

388
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,500
Kind sir,

389
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,540
could you spare me some food?

390
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:56,820
There you go.

391
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,820
Thank you! Thank you so much!

392
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,300
Little girl.

393
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,300
Aren't you starving?

394
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,940
Why don't you eat up?

395
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,500
I am saving it for my older brother.

396
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,460
Little girl, have you

397
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,740
only ever had

398
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,100
one piece of bread?

399
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,500
Am I right?

400
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:55,860
Little girl.

401
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,900
How could you be so silly?

402
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,820
Why didn't you eat it?

403
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,020
Why did you save it

404
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,380
for your brother?

405
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
I just

406
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,500
ate it

407
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,140
without thinking.

408
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,820
Yi.

409
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,460
I'll only be a drag on you.

410
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,660
I want you to live.

411
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,020
I want you to live on.

412
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,340
Yi.

413
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,300
You look different now.

414
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,700
You look like a deity.

415
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,420
Yi!

416
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,940
I will always be with you.

417
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,980
I'll never leave you.

418
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,580
The last bit of Oblivion Broth

419
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,460
has been used up.

420
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,100
Your time is running out.

421
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:15,860
Whatever.

422
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,180
Such is my fate.

423
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,780
Who knows how long the Oblivion Broth

424
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,620
can stall him?

425
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,340
Xiao Se.

426
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,420
You should leave.

427
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,020
Xiao Se!

428
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,060
If he wakes up,

429
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,860
I'll stop him for you.

430
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,700
No!

431
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,180
We're not leaving without you.

432
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:32,940
Yes.

433
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,100
Go to Tianqi for me.

434
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,980
Tell them

435
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,740
I won't be going back.

436
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,780
But I don't regret my decision.

437
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,500
He woke up instantly.

438
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,060
Do you want me to save you?

439
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,180
Yes.

440
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,180
But I won't beg for your help.

441
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,980
How honorable.

442
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,460
-Xiao Se!
-Xiao Se!

443
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,060
Lei Wujie!

444
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,220
After them.

445
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,180
Does it mean

446
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,500
the Dragon Seeker Formation is broken?

447
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,620
There is no way

448
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,980
it could have been broken
with the Supervisor inside!

449
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,700
Supervisor!

450
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:24,980
Supervisor!

451
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,180
What is happening?

452
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,220
We must leave the rest

453
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,100
to Xueyue City now.

454
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,780
To think it was a girl

455
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,220
who wounded you.

456
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,060
A girl?

457
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,660
Your hidden pulse contains

458
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,940
the energy of extreme yin.

459
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,660
When you use your strength,

460
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,420
this inner force of extreme yin

461
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,740
will run amok inside you,

462
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,660
causing your inner injury to flare up.

463
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,620
There is only one way to save you.

464
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,500
You must forsake your inner force

465
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,260
and the yin energy

466
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,380
all at once.

467
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,100
From there on,

468
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,540
you will lose

469
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,820
all your martial art mastery.

470
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,300
But you can train to regain your strength.

471
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,500
You can muster your inner force again.

472
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,660
If you have the will,

473
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,060
it's a matter of time

474
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,140
before you reach your prime again.

475
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,500
My inner strength

476
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,740
can keep your meridian from dying.

477
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,220
It's enough to make a fine warrior out of you.

478
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,620
You shall slowly build up

479
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,060
your inner strength over time.

480
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,420
It shall

481
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,860
slowly dissipate bit by bit.

482
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,580
Why did you save me?

483
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,620
I went astray.

484
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
You saved me.

485
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,580
It's only right to return the favor.

486
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,060
Not to mention you are full of potential.

487
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,980
I have the technique to slay a dragon.

488
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,180
It's only natural

489
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,940
for me to cherish a fellow talent.

490
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,420
Much thanks.

491
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,100
One more palm to go.

492
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,780
Can you take it?

493
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,700
I'm willing to accept your knowledge.

494
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,460
Where is Xiao Se?

495
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,700
I've cured your beloved one.

496
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,140
He is upstairs.

497
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,020
Take care of him.

498
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,740
Put her down.

499
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,140
Take it easy.

500
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,900
Ruoyi.

501
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,900
Lyu'er.
(*green)

502
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,580
Lyu'er

503
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,500
was your sister?

504
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,300
Yes.

505
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,820
She was my only sister.

506
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,540
You two look very much alike.

507
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,420
She would have looked just like you

508
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,140
had she

509
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,700
had the chance to grow up.

510
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,620
Unfortunately,

511
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,260
she didn't get the chance.

512
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,580
I didn't manage to save Lyu'er.

513
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,740
Today, I shall not make the same mistake.

514
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,250
I gave you a strand of my zhenqi.

515
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,100
It protected your heart meridian.

516
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,740
As long as you don't suffer
from severe inner injury,

517
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,140
you can live

518
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,580
a normal life.

519
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,580
Why did you help me?

520
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,260
Perhaps,

521
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,020
it's because of your outfit.

522
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,580
Your body is still weak.

523
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,380
You need rest.

524
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,500
Miss Ye.

525
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,020
You should get some rest.

526
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,340
Lei Wujie.

527
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,820
Baili.

528
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,420
I have a favor to ask.

529
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,140
Ask away.

530
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,980
I was trapped by my obsession for years.

531
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,340
I've never taken a good rest.

532
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,580
It's time for me to do so.

533
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,100
I shall visit the human world
when I'm awake again.

534
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,020
Are you willing

535
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,740
to be my guard?

536
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,420
It'll be an honor.

537
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,500
Master.

538
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,300
How long are you going to guard him?

539
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,460
Ten years

540
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,740
or even longer.

541
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,380
I have nothing better to do anyway.

542
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,420
I might as well enjoy the view.

543
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,340
I'm not about to leave just yet.

544
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,180
Are you leaving Xueyue City for good?

545
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,660
We have Qianluo's father in charge.

546
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,820
Are you leaving me too?

547
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,580
I'm not

548
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,660
your only master.

549
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,420
Well...

550
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,860
The glorious days

551
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,940
of Xueyue City are behind us.

552
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,380
But if you return to Beili,

553
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,700
all problems can be solved.

554
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,340
Why can't you resolve them

555
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,140
without me?

556
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,820
You were the legendary hero

557
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,580
of Beili.

558
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,020
Xueyue City is surrounded by enemies.

559
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,420
The Second City Lord

560
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:14,940
might be away.

561
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,900
The Third City Lord is left all alone.

562
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,540
Things won't be easy for him.

563
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:19,820
What?

564
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,220
I have to save

565
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,260
Beili again

566
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,340
just because I saved it 13 years ago?

567
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,580
Sikong Changfeng is in charge of Xueyue City.

568
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,980
As for the other problems,

569
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:32,860
it's your turn

570
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,940
to deal with them.

571
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,340
Us?

572
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,340
Yes.

573
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,700
The path you're about to take

574
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,300
will be different from mine.

575
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,540
You know the true identity

576
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,340
of Xiao.

577
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,500
Tang Lianyue

578
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,540
must have told you your true identity.

579
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,980
The Imperial Court is just perilous
as the martial arts world.

580
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,700
The line between good and evil is very fine.

581
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,940
The stance comes first.

582
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,300
You must be cautious.

583
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:00,980
But Master...

584
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,740
All right.

585
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,860
Enough excuses.

586
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,380
What more do you want to say?

587
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,260
By the way,

588
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,820
after you got drunk yesterday,

589
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
you said a name.

590
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,020
"Yueyao."

591
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,020
Who is she?

592
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
She was my wife.

593
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,980
Your wife?

594
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,740
My disciple,

595
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,540
someday

596
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,060
we'll meet again.

597
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,100
Do not let me down.

598
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,460
Yes.

599
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,820
See you around.

600
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,620
[Lord Bai's Residence]

601
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,380
The annual ceremony is tomorrow.

602
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:48,860
Your Highness,

603
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,260
it's time to rest.

604
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,300
Zang Ming.

605
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,580
Do you think my father

606
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,500
will write his name down?

607
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,140
I think

608
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
that is possible.

609
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,700
But I think

610
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,500
that's not possible.

611
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,420
Why is that, Your Highness?

612
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,660
Because he hasn't

613
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,580
truly returned.

614
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,940
If his name

615
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,300
was written before his return,

616
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,620
the obstacles he'd face

617
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,220
would be terrifying.

618
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,420
If Father loves him,

619
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:23,940
he will not

620
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,220
put him in harm's way.

621
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,900
But when His Majesty

622
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,300
exiled Xiao Chuhe,

623
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,740
his safety

624
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,740
wasn't a concern.

625
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,180
Who can say for sure the exile

626
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,140
wasn't meant to keep him safe?

627
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,860
You should know

628
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,660
the most perilous place on earth

629
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,220
is Tianqi City.

630
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,300
Your Highness

631
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,740
will stand out the most

632
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,820
in the ceremony tomorrow.

633
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,100
The yellow scroll

634
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,820
can outshine me anytime.

635
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,260
It will have

636
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,300
everyone's attention tomorrow.

637
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,060
Any news from the palace?

638
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:07,940
No.

639
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,300
That old geezer.

640
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,460
He's not revealing

641
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,660
the Dragon Seal Scroll

642
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,740
until the very end.

643
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,700
The scroll

644
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,420
doesn't matter anymore.

645
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,020
The selection of the next crown prince
is tied to the fate of the nation.

646
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,820
His Majesty wouldn't appoint a blind man.

647
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,220
See?

648
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,940
Even you get it,

649
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,380
but Chong doesn't.

650
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,260
He is Father's pawn

651
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,260
to balance the situation.

652
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,900
I used his hands

653
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,140
to get rid of Xiao Chuhe.

654
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,540
Then, Father got rid of

655
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,620
this expandable pawn.

656
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,380
Then, I'm the only one left

657
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,180
in the game.

658
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,820
Maybe the Second Prince

659
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,820
doesn't want to believe it.

660
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,900
Why should I care what he believes?

661
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,300
Tomorrow is inevitable.

662
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,260
You came out for the breeze

663
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,980
as soon as you recovered.

664
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,140
The wind is strong on the sea.

665
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,700
Why do you need a fan?

666
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,300
The wind on the sea smells fishy.

667
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,700
My fan

668
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,460
gives out the fragrance of sandalwood.

669
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,260
Take a sniff.

670
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,100
Never mind.

671
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,900
Save it for yourself.

672
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,220
Any plan after going back?

673
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,100
I'll return to Xueyue City.

674
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,660
Beauty of Four Seasons.

675
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,820
It sounds like a nice place.

676
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,500
I heard the Spear Deity, Master Sikong,

677
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,300
was a direct disciple of the Medicine King.

678
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,540
Correct.

679
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,100
The ceremony is today.

680
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,220
Rumor has it His Majesty

681
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,340
will write down the name
of the next crown prince

682
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,860
on the Dragon Seal Scroll.

683
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,100
Not my concern.

684
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,660
I've never thought about becoming an emperor.

685
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,980
What's so funny?

686
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,340
To the Mu family

687
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,620
of Qingzhou,

688
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,900
I've always been the outlier.

689
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,380
Do you know why?

690
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,460
I do.

691
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,860
You study medicine instead of business.

692
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,020
That's one of the reasons.

693
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,780
I have an older brother

694
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,780
who got sick.

695
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,620
He might never become a father.

696
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:31,980
Therefore,

697
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,580
I am next in line to be the family head.

698
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,980
But that's not who I want to be.

699
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,140
I want to cure my brother.

700
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,940
If I can cure him,

701
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,100
he will certainly be the next head of the family.

702
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,100
In the eyes of the folks in Qingzhou,

703
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,140
I'm a fool.

704
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,860
If someone is rich

705
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,140
without empathy,

706
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,020
what good can he be?

707
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,140
The folks in Qingzhou

708
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,260
are the real fools.

709
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,140
My grandfather told me

710
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
to find the sword

711
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,100
he had forged, the Mountains Mover,

712
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,340
and its wielder.

713
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,460
When I'm home,

714
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,300
I'll tell him

715
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,540
it's in the hands

716
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,540
of someone worthy of it.

717
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,620
Many tried to stop me

718
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,220
from going on this voyage.

719
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,180
I told them,

720
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,860
"Even the rats care about their skin,
so how can a man live without honor?

721
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,020
What is life without honor?"

722
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,820
They think I've gone mad from all the reading.

723
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,740
But they are the fools.

724
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,180
When a person dies,

725
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,020
they take nothing with them.

726
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,620
But bonds

727
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,500
shall remain in the world.

728
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,340
They couldn't even tell

729
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,260
which was

730
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,980
more important to them.

731
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,340
So, I left Qingzhou.

732
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,700
I left those people.

733
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,300
It was a pleasure

734
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
meeting you.

735
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,860
I think

736
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,180
we are the same kind of people.

737
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,180
What kind

738
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,260
of people are we?

739
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,780
Young people.

740
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,340
Young people?

741
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,180
We are all young people.

742
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,700
We do not despair after a defeat,

743
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,460
and we are proud of our victories.

744
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,660
We have swords in our hands

745
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,260
and will in our hearts.

746
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,780
The vastness of the sea
gives birth to our heroic qualities.

747
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,860
The blooming blossoms

748
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,060
make us show the world our joy.

749
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,500
The path ahead is perilous,
but we shall not falter.

750
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,300
The company of friends
calls for a toast to heaven.

751
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,660
Laugh when you feel like it.

752
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,260
Berate when you're upset.

753
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,100
There are endless paths to take,

754
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,820
but always follow your heart

755
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,060
and stay true to yourself.

756
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,300
And more importantly,

757
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,500
we share one thing in common.

758
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,220
What is it?

759
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,420
We are all good-looking.

760
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,540
Those with good looks

761
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,980
are the young.

762
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,700
Those without good looks

763
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,740
are youngsters.

764
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,980
Qianluo,

765
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,380
why didn't you look at me?

766
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,340
Because you're a youngster.

767
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,380
