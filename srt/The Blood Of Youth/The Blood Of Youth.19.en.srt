[The Blood of Youth]

24
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,930
[Episode 19]

25
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,060
In the past,

26
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,420
the Lei family had four heroes.

27
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,890
Today,

28
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,140
only Qianhu remains.

29
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,810
He is not the only one!

30
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,460
Old Master Tang.

31
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,340
After all these years,

32
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,370
have you not moved on from the feud

33
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,220
between Lei Fortress and the Tang Clan?

34
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,410
Lei Hong.

35
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,690
You know,

36
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,020
when I was younger,

37
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,180
I once said this

38
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,410
to the old master.

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,090
I said I had a dream

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,530
to have only one clan in the world.

41
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,940
What do you mean?

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,410
The clan

43
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,900
can also mean

44
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,410
the Tang Clan of Shu.

45
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,340
I understand what you mean now.

46
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,460
The Tang Clan didn't come

47
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,370
for revenge

48
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,410
but to slaughter everyone!

49
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,530
Why does Shabu want to leave?

50
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,020
Maybe it's sensing

51
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,940
Master's sword thought.

52
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,370
Why is Master

53
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,340
summoning it?

54
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,460
Are we too late?

55
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,250
Take a stroll through hell,

56
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,130
your soul might actually remain in this world!

57
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,810
Young men,

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,370
watch and learn!

59
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:01,940
Lei Qianhu.

60
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,300
The wound

61
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,570
has damaged your veins.

62
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,780
You were trying hard to hold off the pain.

63
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,300
Trying hard?

64
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,740
I can still put up a good fight.

65
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,250
Clan Leader!

66
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,620
The Hellish Palm.

67
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,010
I underestimated him.

68
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,210
You're wounded.

69
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,250
Leave now.

70
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,620
I can take it from here.

71
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,300
Yes.

72
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,100
Stop!

73
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,810
Lightning falls from heaven,

74
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,010
a crane in the sky.

75
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,300
What a shame.

76
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,250
You're late.

77
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,740
Your brother

78
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,890
is already dead.

79
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,620
Clan Leader!

80
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,570
Qianhu!

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,010
Let's go.

82
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,250
Qianhu...

83
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,570
I...

84
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,180
used brute force

85
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,210
to alter the ninth level
of Five-Thunder Tiangang Punch.

86
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,300
Have you lost your mind?

87
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,860
That technique

88
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,890
could have killed you!

89
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,330
(Listen closely.)

90
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,810
The Lei family has three ultimate techniques.

91
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,500
Each of you can pick one

92
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,940
to master.

93
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,420
The first technique.

94
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,540
[Former Clan Leader of the Lei Clan]
The Formless Fist.

95
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,860
Amazing!

96
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,890
The second technique.

97
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,330
Thunderclap Finger!

98
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,660
The third technique.

99
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,180
Is it the most powerful?

100
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,130
Probably.

101
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,180
Five-Thunder Tiangang Punch!

102
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,450
What was that?

103
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,180
Awesome!

104
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,890
The Five-Thunder Tiangang Punch

105
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,860
is the most powerful technique

106
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,980
of the three.

107
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,130
But the technique
can easily backfire on the user.

108
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,540
The ninth level is called Annihilation.

109
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,300
It not only annihilates the sky above

110
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,130
but also yourself!

111
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,940
The fate of the Lei Clan was at stake.

112
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,330
I couldn't be too cautious.

113
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,420
He.

114
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,890
You're finally back.

115
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,450
Stop talking.

116
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,300
Lei Hong.

117
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,620
Tend to Hu's injury.

118
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,100
It's too late for that.

119
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,690
Superintendent of the Lei Clan,

120
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,060
Lei Tianhen, heed my order.

121
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,500
At your service.

122
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
The Lei Clan's

123
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,770
19th Clan Leader

124
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,860
hereby passes the leadership...

125
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,660
Passes the leadership

126
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,210
to my martial brother,

127
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,100
Lei Hong.

128
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,060
After we fend off the enemies,

129
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,370
step into the Lei Clan's ancestral shrine.

130
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,420
Hold

131
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,010
Ceremony of Three Roars and Six Rumblings.

132
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,180
Inaugurate

133
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,980
the 20th Clan Leader.

134
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,740
As you wish.

135
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,420
Clan Leader!

136
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:52,740
Clan Leader!

137
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,690
(Listen up, you guys.)

138
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,690
(Hong.)

139
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,620
Five more years of training

140
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,370
and we'll go on our own adventure.

141
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,740
Five years?

142
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,570
No, that's way too long.

143
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,540
Make it three years.

144
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,860
We'll leave after three years.

145
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,980
Deal.

146
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,450
What about me?

147
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
You two made a pact

148
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,770
and left me out.

149
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,010
Qianhu.

150
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,570
Hong and I will go on our journeys.

151
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,770
We are going to make

152
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,500
more people know the might of the Lei Clan.

153
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,300
If Hong and I

154
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,660
are met with misfortune out there,

155
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,060
who will run the clan?

156
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,330
So,

157
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,370
when Hong and I

158
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,130
are away,

159
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,210
you must protect our family.

160
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,060
Okay.

161
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:29,570
I look forward

162
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,010
to hearing about your glorious feats.

163
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,940
I'll keep the Lei family safe!

164
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,860
The Nine Heavens Thunder,

165
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,260
which shocked heaven and earth!

166
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,430
Nine-Heaven Lightning Fall.

167
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,660
Leader!

168
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,020
What's going on?

169
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,140
How come

170
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,070
his inner force is so powerful?

171
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,110
Fatal Blossom Shower.

172
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,350
The Two Heroes of the Lei Clan.

173
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,230
You live up to your reputation.

174
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,740
But to go against

175
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,020
so many powerful foes,

176
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,830
only death awaits you!

177
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,660
We beg to differ!

178
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,780
They'll live!

179
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:11,710
Master Hu!

180
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:12,900
Master Hu!

181
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,190
Master Hu!

182
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,950
Master Hu...

183
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,740
I was late.

184
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:20,950
Tang Lian.

185
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,470
Are you going to betray your clan?

186
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,140
Old Master.

187
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,950
After this is over,

188
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,990
I'll accept my punishment.

189
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,710
But I must uphold

190
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,140
my principle.

191
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,070
The Hellish Palm.

192
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,950
This must be

193
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,140
the Leader of the Dark River,

194
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,660
Su Changhe.

195
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,070
You do know a thing or two.

196
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,070
So, who might you be?

197
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,230
Masters of the Lei Clan,

198
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,470
I need you

199
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
to stall the Leader,

200
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,140
Su Changhe.

201
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,900
We will take down Old Master Tang.

202
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:11,740
I'm old enough

203
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,780
to be your grandpa.

204
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,540
Fighting a bunch of kids

205
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,020
is somewhat

206
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,990
embarrassing to me.

207
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,990
Embarrassing?

208
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,110
Is fighting an elder

209
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,020
embarrassing?

210
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,540
I disagree.

211
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,070
The new generation will replace the old.

212
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,430
Old age

213
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,140
doesn't make you the law.

214
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,020
You conspired with the Dark River

215
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,070
to attack the Lei Fortress.

216
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,900
That is truly an embarrassing act.

217
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,740
Lei Wujie.

218
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:47,950
When did you

219
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,740
learn to give a speech?

220
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,990
I speak out of grief

221
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,070
and anger.

222
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,310
Bring it on, then.

223
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,780
Old Master Tang

224
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,590
has 70 years' worth of internal energy.

225
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,350
His zhenqi can match a deity.

226
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,190
Lei Wujie can't land a strike on him.

227
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,310
The Tang Clan has a hidden weapon

228
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,230
that breaks through the protection of zhenqi.

229
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,540
Tang Lian, would you

230
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,950
fight Old Master Tang?

231
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,740
I...

232
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,110
Lei Wujie.

233
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,350
Give it everything you have.

234
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:24,950
I believe in you.

235
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,780
Xiao Se,

236
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,780
if I use that move,

237
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,260
I'll be unconscious

238
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,350
in ten moves.

239
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,620
Stay conscious until then.

240
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,590
Very well.

241
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,190
I believe in you

242
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,620
even though you always lie to me.

243
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,900
You've reached

244
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,230
the Insouciant Phase at such a young age.

245
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,660
Mastery from the Sword Deity:
Unpredictable Cloud and Mist!

246
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,110
Every weapon in this world

247
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,990
is alive.

248
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,660
They are alive.

249
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,020
They all have souls.

250
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,140
They can become connected

251
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,620
to the wielder's heart.

252
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,430
Watch closely.

253
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,660
Wind can be gentle,

254
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,260
but it can also cut like blades.

255
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,780
(This technique was taught by the Spear Deity.)

256
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:58,860
(Its name is)

257
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,900
Windbreaker.

258
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:02,780
Xiao Se.

259
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,070
I withstood 13 moves.

260
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:06,950
I got you three of them.

261
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,830
You did well.

262
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,540
Qianluo!

263
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,110
Qianluo.

264
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,860
Xiao Se.

265
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,950
Leave now.

266
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,430
A technique of the Directorate of Astronomy.

267
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,190
Interesting.

268
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,350
Old Master.

269
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,140
That's enough.

270
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,260
Tang Lian.

271
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,950
How dare you?

272
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,110
You would

273
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,350
even pick a fight with me?

274
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,830
However,

275
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,950
you're not

276
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,590
worthy yet.

277
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,310
Old Master.

278
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,740
Please.

279
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,990
End this now.

280
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,070
End this?

281
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,780
-Lian!
-Lian!

282
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,740
Get them out of here!

283
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,540
You see me

284
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,620
as your eldest martial brother.

285
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,350
As long as I can fight,

286
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,230
I won't let any of you die.

287
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,230
Lian!

288
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,350
Leave now.

289
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,780
Lian!

290
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,660
Lian!

291
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,500
Lian...

292
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,660
Now,

293
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,230
you've fallen.

294
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,950
Not yet.

295
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,740
Not yet?

296
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,190
Strike me if you can.

297
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,470
I will never use
the hidden weapon of the Tang Clan.

298
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,990
Are you cutting your ties with the Tang Clan

299
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,380
and defecting to Xueyue City?

300
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,950
I used a hidden weapon

301
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,380
of the Tang Clan on you.

302
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,380
I feel sorry for my action.

303
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:45,780
I am unworthy

304
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,950
of using another hidden weapon.

305
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,830
So why haven't you backed down?

306
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,620
I must uphold my principle.

307
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,950
Xiao Se.

308
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,500
Xiao Se, you have to go.

309
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,950
We can die anyway,

310
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,110
but not you.

311
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,060
You want to leave?

312
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,470
No one is leaving alive.

313
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:19,950
Lian!

314
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,470
The Wuji Staff.

315
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,390
Ruoyi.

316
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,020
We are all the same.

317
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,230
There is only one Sikong Qianluo

318
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:41,910
in this world.

319
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,870
One Ye Ruoyi.

320
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,780
One Tang Lian.

321
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,060
One Lei Wujie.

322
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,150
No one

You're actually an expert.

326
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,540
Yeah.

327
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,190
I told you I don't know martial arts.

328
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,540
I lied.

329
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,500
Why can't

330
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,340

331
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,260

00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,540
to you.

388
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,060
Xiao Se!

389
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,270
It seems

390
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,540
I must arrive sooner.

391
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,510
You came all the way here

392
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,820
just to save him?

393
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,270
Very touching, isn't it?

394
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:30,780
It doesn't matter.

395
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,510
Someone else came a long way

396
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,470
for you

397
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,750
to take your life.

398
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,270
Let's go!

399
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,910
Su Changhe!

400
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,910
Hanyi!

401
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,300
Master!

402
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,060
Are you all right?

403
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,060
I'm still alive.

404
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,140
Wait there.

405
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,780
Why are you here again?

406
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,470
It seems

407
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,510
a fight is inevitable.

408
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,140
Zhantian, your qinggong

409
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,580
is still swift as ever.

410
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,190
So,

411
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,300
you want to protect these people.

412
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,860
It seems like it.

413
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,030
I don't think

414
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,430
you plan to take their lives.

415
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,030
Thank my foolish disciple

416
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,540
for asking me to carry a message for the Tang Clan.

417
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,910
I guess

418
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,300
I am late for the fight.

419
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,430
Whatever.

420
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,910
This is all fate's will.

421
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,430
Without medical attention,

422
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,300
these kids

423
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,860
might die here.

424
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,990
But Li Hanyi...

425
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,230
Leave it to Lei Hong.

426
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,340
Scholarly Sword Deity,

427
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,750
please tend to their injuries.

428
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,620
Yes.

429
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,540
Hanyi!

430
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,430
Stop chasing them, Hanyi!

431
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,190
You got defeated.

432
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,670
Sir,

433
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,670
calm down.

434
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:18,580
Who might you be?

435
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,190
I am Tang Ze of the Tang Clan.

436
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,230
I came with Old Master Tang for the banquet.

437
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,140
I want to make a deal.

438
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,510
[Tang Ze, Tang Clan]
I wish to discuss it with you.

439
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,780
A deal?

440
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,950
What makes you think

441
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,820
you have the right to do so?

442
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,990
Are the lives of the guests enough

443
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,370
to make you listen?

444
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,140
What do you mean?

445
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,540
I assure you,

446
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,030
I can neutralize the Dark River's poison.

447
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,190
What if I say no?

448
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,540
I assure you,

449
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,190
you don't even

450
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,270
feel your own death,

451
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,710
and I'll have

452
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,910
the antidote you're carrying.

453
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,990
What if that wasn't the antidote

454
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,780
but a lethal poison?

455
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,270
Or perhaps,

456
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,300
some of them are the antidote,

457
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,060
while the others are poisons?

458
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,670
If you checked

459
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,990
every pill in every bottle,

460
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,190
most people

461
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,430
would have already been dead.

462
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,780
This incident has nothing

463
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,340
to do with the Tang Clan.

464
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,140
The Dark River infiltrated

465
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,670
the hero banquet and poisoned the heroes.

466
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,710
The Tang Clan and warriors of the Lei Fortress

467
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:18,910
were unharmed.

468
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,750
The assassins from the Dark River were defeated.

469
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,950
Old Master Tang lost his life in the battle.

470
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,030
You shameless scoundrel!

471
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,580
You are right.

472
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,470
Very well.

473
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,140
I know the consequences.

474
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,140
However,

475
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,380
the Lei Clan

476
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,060
will make the Tang Clan pay for this bloodshed.

477
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,060
This feud will go on

478
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,910
for generations to come.

479
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,030
I'll keep that in mind.

480
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,710
Director, you actually made the time

481
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,270
to drop by for a visit.

482
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,990
What a surprise.

483
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,300
State Preceptor.

484
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,910
You haven't stepped outside Tianqi City

485
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,670
for over a decade.

486
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,430
What could be so important

487
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,430
that you had to leave?

488
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,910
It was a promise to an old friend.

489
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,580
By the way,

490
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,780
I heard that five days ago,

491
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,190
His Majesty visited

492
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,950
the Directorate of Astronomy after his return.

493
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,860
But Golden Marquis Lanyue

494
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,340
left the city

495
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,710
before that.

496
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,710
So that was what brought you here?

497
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,710
You were being too mysterious.

498
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,300
All right.

499
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,710
I shall

500
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,950
get to the point.

501
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,780
His Majesty made a sudden
announcement to appoint an heir.

502
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,510
According to the rules in Beili,

503
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,100
the succession of the throne

504
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,470
will be divided into two scrolls.

505
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,580
One for the Five Eunuchs
to interpret His Majesty's will.

506
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,100
The other goes to the Directorate of Astronomy

507
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,540
to deliver heaven's will.

508
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,380
When the names

509
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,190
on the two scrolls are the same,

510
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,860
the successor of the throne

511
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,060
will be acknowledged.

512
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,710
However, I haven't received

513
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,670
that scroll.

514
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,780
That doesn't sit right with me.

515
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,020
Therefore, I must inquire you.

516
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,780
Have you

517
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,340
received that scroll?

518
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,510
No.

519
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,950
Have they inquired you regarding the matter?

520
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,580
Yes.

521
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,780
Did you tell them

522
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,860
your answer?

523
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,470
As I said,

524
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,580
heaven's will is merely a possibility.

525
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,820
I merely expressed

526
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,860
my opinion.

527
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,270
In the end, His Majesty must decide.

528
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,060
The White brings peace.

529
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,300
The Vermilion expands the land.

530
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,430
With the Dragon in the opposition,
there will be no peace.

531
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,860
The State Preceptor stated these lines?

532
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,620
Did he really say this?

533
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,190
Absolutely.

534
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,780
After the court was dismissed,

535
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,060
13 officials

536
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,300
went to the Director of Astronomy.

537
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,620
But

538
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,300
he refused to talk to anyone.

539
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,670
But Director Jinxuan

540
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,540
managed to

541
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,710
see the State Preceptor.

542
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,820
Longxie.

543
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,670
Tell me.

544
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,060
How would you interpret

545
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,860
these lines?

546
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,620
The first two lines are easy.

547
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,030
Lord Bai, Xiao Chong, is one to defend this nation.

548
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,230
He has great composure

549
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,270
and keeps a level head.

550
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,910
Lord Chi, you expand our land.

551
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,230
You are mighty.

552
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,620
In our war against Nanjue,

553
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,540
we'll need a ruler

554
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,670
who is also a commander.

555
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,380
But the last two lines are full of variables.

556
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
With the last two lines...

557
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,100
The first two lines

558
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,510
seem pointless.

559
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,100
Not just the first two lines.

560
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,470
The entire verse

561
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,030
is pointless.

562
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,100
These lines

563
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,140
don't sound like words of advice.

564
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,990
Given they come from the State Preceptor,

565
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,510
they feel like a warning.

566
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,230
A nation to defend,

567
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,060
land to expand.

568
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,270
There is only one true dragon.

569
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,710
There can only be one ruler.

570
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,030
The victor gains great power,

571
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,300
and the rest can only bow below.

572
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,710
Bloodshed.

573
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,270
Generation after generation,

574
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,540
one dynasty after another,

575
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,510
the stars are ever-changing.

576
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,670
Dynasties rise and fall.

577
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,140
That is the only rule

578
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,860
that never changes.

579
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,580
Lian!

580
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,340
Lian?

581
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,380
Is anyone there?

582
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:01,910
Stop yelling.

583
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,780
You could tear your wound open.

584
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,820
Martial Uncle.

585
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,710
You must have a death wish

586
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,910
to use the Inferno Phase.

587
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,780
Be grateful that you're still alive.

588
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,030
Martial Uncle.

589
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,140
The Lei Fortress...

590
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,620
Don't worry.

591
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,380
Our brethren in the Lei Fortress

592
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,710
are mostly unharmed.

593
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,230
They got the antidote.

594
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,540
The hero banquet

595
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,620
seemed like a great battle,

596
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,990
but only two lives were lost.

597
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,950
Master Hu and Old Master Tang...

598
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,540
The two men who had enough power

599
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,710
to shake the martial arts world.

600
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,580
From now on,

601
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,300
the power balance

602
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,860
will begin to shift.

603
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,670
This is my fault.

604
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,510
I should have arrived sooner!

605
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,510
It's time to move on.

606
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,030
Over the years,

607
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,950
he had suffered from the toxic cold.

608
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,580
Now, he is finally freed from it.

609
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,710
By the way,

610
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,430
did you find my sister?

611
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,910
No.

612
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,620
We received no news about her.

613
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:09,710
No.

614
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,140
I have to search for her.

615
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,860
You are in no shape

616
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,340
to do anything.

617
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,230
But she is in danger!

618
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,100
Leave it to your master.

619
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,750
If you're feeling better,

620
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,860
you should check on your friend.

621
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,380
His condition is not looking good.

622
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,100
Xiao Se?

623
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,230
How is he?

624
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,510
The Scholarly Sword Deity

625
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,100
and Wuxin transferred their qi to treat him.

626
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,910
They've been inside for some time.

627
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,670
Sir.

628
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,030
How is Xiao Se?

629
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,510
How is he?

630
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,190
Xiao Se's hidden pulse was already damaged.

631
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,380
When he moved his qi by force,

632
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,670
the root of his qi was damaged.

633
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,300
We did everything we could.

634
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,540
We could only

635
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,710
alleviate his injury for some time.

636
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,820
A day or two at most.

637
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,060
Can anyone save him?

638
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,100
Qi Tianchen can save him.

639
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,580
But he is back

640
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,510
in Tianqi City.

641
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,710
Medicine King Xin Baicao can help him.

642
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,710
But his whereabouts are unpredictable.

643
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,470
No one knows where he is.

644
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,620
What about his disciple?

645
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,300
Your father?

646
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,670
No.

647
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,990
There is another disciple at Sword Heart Tomb.

648
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,780
It's not far from here.

649
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,300
I can ask Martial Uncle to send a letter.

650
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,060
It only takes half a day.

651
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,910
I'm afraid it'll be too late.

652
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,510
I'll try again.

653
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,620
There's still time.

654
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,030
We have the Three-Day Pill.

655
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,580
The Three-Day Pill?

656
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,670
The Tao Sword Deity left the mountain.

657
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,190
Why wasn't Xueyue City informed?

658
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,750
Why didn't Tang Lian's request

659
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,140
for backup arrive sooner?

660
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,100
Calm down.

661
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,140
At least, the kids

662
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,100
are now safe.

663
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,230
Lei Hong

664
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,270
went after Hanyi.

665
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,580
There shouldn't be a problem.

666
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,620
How can I calm down?

667
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,950
The Tao Sword Master is dead.

668
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,270
The Xueyue Sword Deity went insane.

669
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,340
The Lei Clan was raided.

670
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,540
Old Master Tang and Lei Qianhu

671
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,380
are now dead.

672
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,380
But Xueyue City

673
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,670
was the last to learn the news?

674
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,470
And it was all

675
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,820
thanks to Lei Yunhe's letter!

676
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:22,950
The Xueyue City

677
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,950
is known to be

678
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,100
the finest intelligence agency.

679
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,340
We are not clowns!

680
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,270
Calm down.

681
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,230
Hear him out.

682
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,060
Start talking.

683
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,300
Recently,

684
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,980
all the Spider Shadows

685
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,950
sent to gather intel

686
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,380
were intercepted.

687
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,540
Some were captured,

688
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,620
and some were killed.

689
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,950
It seems someone

690
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,190
is trying to

691
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,190
keep the information from reaching us.

692
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,670
How many of them are there?

693
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,950
How are they capable of this?

694
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,580
At least over a hundred mighty warriors.

695
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,030
Who could have the power

696
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,580
to mobilize so many warriors?

697
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,860
No.

698
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,060
I must find them.

699
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,910
You mustn't.

700
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,540
Two city lords are away.

701
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,580
If you leave,

702
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,270
Wushuang City might take action.

703
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,100
The Dark River attacked during the banquet.

704
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,950
Mr. Xiao used his inner force to protect

705
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:13,950
the heroes

706
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,030
but is now heavily wounded.

707
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,780
His life hangs by a thread.

708
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,670
Miss Sikong gave him

709
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,670
the Three-Day Pill.

710
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,030
Miss Hua Jin,

711
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,510
please hurry to the Lei Fortress.

712
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,270
What?

713
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,510
He took the pill?

714
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,670
What's wrong?

715
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,510
The pill can bring out

716
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,710
every bit of a person's life force.

717
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,300
He can survive for three days

718
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,300
regardless of the injury.

719
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,470
But if he's not healed

720
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,430
after three days,

721
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:38,860
nothing

722
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,670
can save him.

723
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,540
What...

724
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,780
All the more reason

725
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,750
to go there immediately.

726
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:43,820
Look.

727
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,540
Take my Violet Stallion and go.

728
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:46,910
I'll be going now.

729
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,060
Stay safe!

730
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,270
Got it.

731
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,750
Lei Wujie.

732
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,910
Have some water.

733
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,670
I'm good.

734
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,830
You've been keeping watch the entire day.

735
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,180
Get some rest.

736
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,390
Your condition

737
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,660
is just as bad as Xiao Se's.

738
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,830
It's fine.

739
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,100
Just some scrapes.

740
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,950
Are you sure?

741
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,580
Are you worried about me?

742
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,180
I guess

743
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,060
you're doing very well.

744
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,100
I'll live.

745
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,260
You speak in interesting ways.

746
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,740
So...

747
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:42,830
Miss Ruoyi.

748
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,030
You should head back and get some rest.

749
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:45,990
I'll stay here.

750
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,180
You and Qianluo

751
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,870
can take over tomorrow morning.

752
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,030
Sure.

753
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,470
Lei Wujie.

754
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:14,830
Sir.

755
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,390
Do you remember the gift I gave you

756
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,030
back in Xueyue City?

757
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,660
Yes.

758
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:22,790
The Late Snow.

759
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,140
Did you read it?

760
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,350
No.

761
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,140
That's why you sound so immature

762
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,950
when you talk to a girl.

763
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,790
Every gift I've given

764
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,310
is meant to correct the flaws.

765
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,310
Do not

766
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,390
take the book so lightly

767
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,140
just because it can be found

768
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,260
easily on the market.

769
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,740
That book

770
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,140
is very meaningful to you.

771
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,030
Too dense.

772
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,260
How dense of you.

773
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,620
But...

774
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,830
Should I really read that book?

775
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,950
The Dark River

776
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,260
only killed for money

777
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,510
for the past years.

778
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,980
Why did they

779
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,910
raid the hero banquet?

780
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,030
Are they going

781
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,740
to make enemies with all the heroes?

782
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,100
Their target

783
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,830
was Xueyue City,

784
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,910
the Lei Fortress,

785
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,060
and the Tang Clan.

786
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,430
We were simply

787
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,390
caught up in trouble.

788
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,260
Officer.

789
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,990
Why...

790
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,830
You must have come

791
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,990
from the Lei Fortress.

792
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,830
I have some questions.

793
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,470
There's nothing to tell.

794
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,470
Insolence!

795
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,310
Do you know who the general is?

796
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,510
Stand down!

797
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,310
Do not fight the soldiers of Beili.

798
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,220
Greetings, General.

799
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,030
Kneel.

800
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,470
Greetings, General.

801
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
At ease, Chief.

802
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,340
Get up, please.

803
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:06,990
I came by

804
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,620
because I have

805
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,260
some questions.

806
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,580
Ask away, General.

807
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,430
I shall tell you everything I know.

808
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,390
Sit.

809
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,470
The Dark River attacked the banquet guests.

810
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,180
Casualties?

811
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,100
Lei Qianhu of the Lei Clan

812
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,580
and Old Master Tang

813
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,790
died when having a fight.

814
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,100
They managed to save

815
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:29,990
everyone else.

816
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,830
We don't know
if the Dark River suffered any losses.

817
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,580
There were no remains.

818
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,580
Xueyue City sent out

819
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,830
many young disciples.

820
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,100
They arrived late,

821
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,470
just in time for the great battle.

822
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,870
But I didn't meet them.

823
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,060
How so?

824
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,260
It's said

825
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,660
they had suffered grave injuries
from the battle.

826
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,350
Some were ever in a coma.

827
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,390
They are being healed at the Lei Fortress

828
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,220
as we speak.

829
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,260
However,

830
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,830
these are mere rumors.

831
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,350
I haven't seen it myself.

832
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,430
Cursed Dark River.

833
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,700
If my daughter is hurt,

834
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,220
I'll turn the entire Beili upside down

835
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,830
to hunt them down!

836
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,830
Good horse.

837
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,180
Hang in there.

838
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,060
We're almost there.

839
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,350
The Lei Fortress

840
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,390
is only dozens of li away.

841
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:28,950
Good horse.

842
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,660
It can't run anymore.

843
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,390
It will die of exhaustion.

844
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,220
What do we do then?

845
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,510
Why are you

846
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,540
in a hurry to get there?

847
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,620
I must treat a patient there.

848
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,660
I'm going to be late.

849
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,260
Come on.

850
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,620
Sir, your horse.

851
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,350
Let me have your horse.

852
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,510
I'll buy it.

853
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,910
If you won't sell it,

854
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:51,830
I'll pay you up-front.

855
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,870
When I get there,

856
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,470
I'll send

857
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,180
the horse back here.

858
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:54,990
All right?

859
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,790
There's a simpler way.

860
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,540
I'll go with you.

861
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,220
Waiter.

862
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,990
Take good care of her horse.

863
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,580
Yes.

864
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,390
Lei.

865
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:19,990
Lei?

866
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,790
The sun is already up.

867
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,030
I...

868
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,580
I didn't fall asleep.

869
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,580
I only fell asleep just now.

870
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:41,700
Lei Wujie.

871
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,990
I know you're tired.

872
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,390
Get some rest.

873
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,140
I'm all right.

874
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,470
Martial Brother!

875
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,390
Martial Brother!

876
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,180
Wujie, bad news.

877
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,350
There are soldiers outside.

878
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,180
The Lei Fortress

879
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,140
is surrounded.

880
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:54,540
Soldiers?

881
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,260
We have respect for the Lei Fortress.

882
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,260
So we won't intrude.

883
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,060
But if the Clan Leader

884
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,260
doesn't show up,

885
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,140
we shall enter by brute force.

886
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,950
If you want to enter,

887
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,990
you'll have to go through me.

888
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,550
Despite your injury,

889
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,780
you're still brave as ever.

890
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,950
Who are you?

891
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,350
A great question.

892
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,300
My name

893
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,430
is written

894
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,870
on this sword I'm carrying.

895
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,180
Kid.

896
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,700
The sword you're wielding

897
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,780
is the fourth greatest sword,

898
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,220
the Heart Sword.

899
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,070
You do know a thing or two.

900
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,990
What?

901
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,950
Are you scared now?

902
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:55,870
You're holding

903
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,220
Xinyue's sword.

904
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,700
But you got the foolhardy demeanor

905
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,990
from your father.

906
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,620
But...

907
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,660
How come you know my parents?

908
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,180
I know a lot more about them.

909
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,550
Come on.

910
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,140
Let me put your skill to the test.

911
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,740
Let's see if you have

912
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,100
your parents' prowess

913
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,100
from all those years ago.

914
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,260
He is still recovering from his injury.

915
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,780
He could die in a sword fight

916
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,430
against you.

917
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,350
Acting Clan Leader.

918
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,300
You came with a large troop, General Ye.

919
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,510
Do you wish to raid the fortress?

920
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,620
Martial Uncle,

921
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,070
who is he?

922
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,300
He is your father's best friend,

923
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,220
the general of Beili's main force,

924
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,390
Ye Xiaoying.

925
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,830
