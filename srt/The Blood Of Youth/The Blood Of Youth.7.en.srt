the rest of the principles,

She's right.

146
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,580
Qianluo did it out of kindness.

147

You call that helping me?

148

You've been holding me back all the way.

149

Why do you keep causing trouble

155
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,580
If it weren't for me,

156
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,740
he would have been in trouble

158
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,260

Ah, it's Guxu Formation.

164

Am I right?

165
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,740
Even if you don't intervene,

a mere Guxu Formation

you're upset

175
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780

Who's Fairy Rui?

182
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,700
She's a girl

184
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,180

He's so charming.

190
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,780
I don't think

191
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,660
it'll be hard for them

192
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,860
to talk all night.

193
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,820
Next time,

194
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,900
you must not behave this mischievously anymore.

195
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:48,820
Do you hear me?

196
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,100
-Well...
-Yes, I heard you.

197
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,180
Mister Spear Deity,

198
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,660
I'm Lei Wujie from Lei Fortress

199
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,700
of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

200
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,340
I'm on my way to Xueyue City
to train under a master.

201
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:57,900
Young man,

202
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,340
you're a fine-looking man with talents.

203
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,460
Stop embarrassing yourself.

204
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,740
He said I'm full of vigor.

205
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,300
I'm Wuchan,

206
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,740
and this is my martial brother, Wuxin.

207
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,340
You had a rough day.

208
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,420
I was supposed to reach here earlier.

209
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,620
But I ran into an old friend

210
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,980
on my way here.

211
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,060
So we had a talk,

212
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,420
which delayed me.

213
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,700
No ordinary person could disintegrate

214
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,980
their own martial arts skills.

215
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,140
It was no wonder Wangyou thought highly of you.

216
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,420
Are you also here to take me away?

217
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,700
No.

218
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,980
I am here especially

219
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,460
to send Ye Anshi back to the sect.

220
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,020
I want to go back to Hanshui Temple.

221
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,700
I am here especially

222
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,020
to send Ye Anshi back to the sect.

223
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,540
White-Haired Deity?

224
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,660
White-Haired Deity.

225
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,100
The old friend I mentioned

226
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,300
is him.

227
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,820
Mr. Mo.

228
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,620
Not only did you run away without a word
after seeing me,

229
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,300
but you also struck me pretty hard.

230
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,100
Are you going to deny me?

231
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,980
Mr. Mo, you're an expert in martial arts skills.

232
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,820
How could I even injure you?

233
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,340
I'll take him with me, then.

234
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,380
Will Xueyue City not regret it?

235
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,340
I'll say it again.

236
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,540
Xueyue City doesn't fear the Demon Sect

237
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,140
or Tianwaitian,

238
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,540
let alone

239
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,220
a young man.

240
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,140
Let's go.

241
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,100
Wait.

242
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,460
Kid,

243
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,700
what do you want?

244
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,460
Why didn't you ask

245
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,140
if he's willing to go with you?

246
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,700
He's the Young Head

247
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,540
of the Tianwaitian Sect.

248
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,020
If he doesn't return to Tianwaitian,

249
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,420
don't tell me he should return to Hanshui Temple.

250
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,220
What if he wants

251
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,300
to return to Hanshui Temple?

252
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,780
Kid,

253
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,260
are you tired of living?

254
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,300
Do you think I will not kill you

255
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,780
because I fear Lei Hong

256
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,900
who's hiding in the Lei Fortress?

257
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,020
Wuxin,

258
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,420
do you really want to go?

259
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,660
I...

260
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,980
The twelve-year term has expired.

261
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,900
You should leave.

262
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,180
Why are you hesitating?

263
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,700
The armistice

264
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,300
is for a twelve-year term.

265
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,300
During that time, he was a hostage.

266
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,980
Now, the twelve-year term has expired.

267
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
The world is vast.

268
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,980
He can go anywhere he wants.

269
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,700
That's right.

270
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,380
Wuxin,

271
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,580
just say it.

272
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,460
At worst we can fight again.

273
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,900
You're seeking a master in Xueyue City.

274
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,380
How can you fight Spear Deity?

275
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,140
A sect is a sect.

276
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,100
Justice is justice.

277
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,700
Brotherhood is brotherhood.

278
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,980
Xiao Se, am I right?

279
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,820
He's right.

280
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:06,940
Young Head.

281
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,380
Mr. Mo.

282
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,540
Mr. Mo,

283
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,940
what are you doing?

284
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,260
Young Head,

285
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,100
it has been 12 years

286
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,380
since Tianwaitian waited for your return.

287
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,900
Today, the other 16 sects outside the region

288
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,260
have fallen apart.

289
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,940
Tianwaitian is the only one

290
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,540
with its members staying.

291
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,340
All of us are waiting for you

292
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,340
to return

293
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,500

Congratulations, Ye Anshi,
the Head of the Tianwaitian Sect

318
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
for his return.

319
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,860
Spear Deity, you don't have to force me.

320
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,660
I know.

321
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,700
Actually,

322
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,380
Old Wangyou is gone.

323
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,740
It doesn't matter

324
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,740
if I return to Hanshui Temple or not.

325
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,220
But Old Wangyou was right.

326
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,660
My home

327
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,220
is a place beyond the border,

328
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,900
beyond the sky.

329
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,100
You can return to Hanshui Temple,

330
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,580
but not now.

331
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,450
♪Traveling freely with friends♪

332
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,020
♪It won't be lonely if I have my confidants♪

333
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,580
Wuchan,

334
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,060
I'm leaving now.

335
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,620
Wuxin,

336
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,180
it doesn't matter

337
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,540
if you're the Head of Tianwaitian,

338
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,900
Hanshui Temple

339
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,700
will always be your home.

340
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,620
Do you still remember

341
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:36,980
the fist technique I taught you?

342
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,700
It may look ordinary.

343
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,580
But after countless practices,

344
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,020
even dripping water can wear away a stone

345
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,540
and sand can build a pagoda.

346
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,460
I hope you'll

347
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,940
never

348
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,020
get to use what I've taught you.

349
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,740
I had already forgotten about it.

350
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,980
It's best if you do.

351
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,780
Wuxin,

352
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,900
I can find a solution

353
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,340
if you don't want to go.

354
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,780
I know you're full of ideas.

355
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,420
People say

356
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,900
life is ruthless.

357
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:23,940
But who

358
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,860
can be really ruthless?

359
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,060
I can't avoid the inevitable.

360
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,620
I'll go

361
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,260
to settle an old score.

362
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,900
What happens after that?

363
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,420
After that...

364
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,740
I'll return to the martial arts world

365
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,180
and continue the journey

366
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,940
with you.

367
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,260
What do we do with the coffin

368
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,380
at the foot of the mountain?

369
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,860
Just bury it.

370
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,620
(I wish to travel north with the wind,)

371
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,460
(watching the snow sweeping across the land.)

372
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,260
(I wish to travel east with the ship,)

373
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,540
(seeing the elegant fairy brave the wind.)

374
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,500
(I wish to travel far with the clouds,)

375
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,100
(even the emperor ruling the court cannot stop me.)

376
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,940
(I will bathe in sunlight
on the top of Mount Kunlun.)

377
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,300
(I will witness lush mountains rise
at the edge of the ocean.)

Yes, of course.

696
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,540
Yin Luoxia loves gambling.

697
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,500
She once lost three consecutive bets

698
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,260
with Sikong Changfeng, the Spear Deity.

699
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,340
So she was forced to join Xueyue City

700
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,260
as its elder.

701
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,540
It's said

702
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,180
after she joined Xueyue City,

703
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,100
she only accepted one disciple

704
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,060
who loves gambling like her.

705
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,460
So tell me.

706
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,620
What method did he use to gamble with you?

707
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,140
I can only take a guess at first.

708
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,780
He just took a glimpse through the opening

709
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,300
and said I lost.

710
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,860
There's a hidden box under the treasure chest.

711
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,620
He looked at the dice in advance.

712
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,940
If your guess was right,

713
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,580
he'd only need to flick gently

714
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,660
to move the dice.

715
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,220
You'll lose no matter what.

716
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,220
So that's what happened.

717
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,180
I'm heading back now.

718
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,820
Come back here!

719
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,660
Gambling

720
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,460
is nothing but a small trick.

721
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,940
Challenging the Dengtian Tower
isn't a trifling matter.

722
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,060
If you want to win,

723
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,500
you still need to do what you're good at.

724
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,300
What am I good at?

725
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,260
Beat him.

726
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:15,940
I get it now.

727
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:17,700
He's out.

728
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,900
Excuse me! Make way!

729
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,020
He only took a short break.

730
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,100
Not necessarily.

731
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,660
There are 15 floors.

732
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,780
Martial Uncle,

733
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,700
that man in red keeps running around.

734
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,900
It looks like he's only taking a break

735
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,220
not because he was defeated.

736
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,380
If this goes on,

737
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,500
he'll steal away

738
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,740

739
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,780
Calm down.

740
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,060
When he reaches the 16th floor,

741
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,660
I'll kick him down from the floor.

742
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,340
It also saves us the energy

743
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,700
of going up the floor one by one.

744
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,780
Since we're all waiting

745
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,740
for him to come down,

746
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,220
how about I invite you two

747
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,260

748
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,660

seek dragons with all-seeing eyes.

00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,140
Who are you?

751
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,380
How did you know my martial uncle?

752
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,860
Feixuan, calm down.

753
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,780
This mister doesn't know martial arts.

754
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,980
There are three phases of Qi-Observing Arts.

755
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,420
You only practiced the first phase.

756
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,820
Are you saying I misread your skills

757
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,500
and that you're actually an expert?

758
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,220
No.

759
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,580
You didn't misread me.

760
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,260
It's true I don't know martial arts.

761
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,820
I only want to invite you

762
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,860
to have some tea.

763
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,340
Just

764
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,300
for tea?

765
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,540
Since I run into
the disciples of Mount Wangcheng,

766
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,460
I'd naturally want to ask you to do a reading.

767
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,020
You can stop hiding your identities.

768
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,100
There's an organization in Xueyue City

769
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,900
called Cobweb

770
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
that specializes in collecting intelligence.

771
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,660
From the moment we entered

772
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,620
the southern part of this city,

773
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,580
we were already being watched.

774
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,740
You seem to know a lot of things.

775
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,300
I just don't know my fate.

776
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,580
So I want to have it read.

777
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,060
Please come this way.

778
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,740
Feixuan,

779
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,700
didn't you always say

780
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,620
you may have mastered the Divination Arts,

781
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,140
but you don't have someone talented
to practice on?

782
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,860
He can be your practice subject.

783
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,180
Go and perform a divination for him.

784
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,260
Talented subject?

785
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,020
Just go. You don't have anything to lose.

786
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:07,980
Come on.

787
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,540
You're back.

788
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,780
How was the soy milk?

789
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,620
After I reach the top of the tower,

790
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,420
I'll buy you a bowl.

791
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,860
Are you that confident?

792
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,780
My friend told me

793
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,300
gambling

794
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,700
is actually relying on little tricks.

795
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,100
So...

796
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,580
So I'm going to bet on big.

797
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,420
We'll open if you're sure.

798
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,500
If I want to win,

799
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,220
I still need to use real skills.

800
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,700
Move your hand away!

801
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:58,980
Six!

802
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,740
One!

803
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,260
Let go!

804
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:20,900
No, you let go!

805
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,980
-I said, let go.
-No, you let go.

806
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,460
If you don't let go, I'm going to bite you.

807
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,460
One, one, six. So it's eight points.

808
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:02,980
No, it's 13 points!

809
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,820
It's big!

810
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,140
Not bad.

811
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,100
Your martial arts skills

812
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,220
are a lot better than your gambling skills.

813
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,180
I don't feel flattered

814
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,380
at all.

815
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,460
What's your name?

816
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,500
Lei Wujie of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

817
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,580
Didn't I tell you that

818
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,580
when I came up earlier?

819
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,860
I'm Luo Mingxuan.

820
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,300
I know.

821
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,580
You're Fairy Luoxia's disciple.

822
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,020
I've long admired

823
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,020
Fairy Luoxia.

824
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,020
What...? You've long

825
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:41,940
admired her?

826
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,220
What's wrong?

827
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,460
She's already over 30.

828
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,020
They said she split a river in half.

829
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,500
But the one she split

830
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,500
isn't the Yangtze River or Yellow River.

831
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,860
Why would you admire her?

832
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,300
Listen.

833
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,340
She's actually an old woman.

834
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,020
Mingxuan,

835
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,420
come to Xizhao Chamber.

836
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,900
I'd better get going to the upper floor.

837
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:06,980
I'll see you around.

838
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,900
What an interesting chap.

839
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,500
I was only away from the city for half a day.

840
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,940
Someone has already reached the 13th floor.

841
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,460
What a bunch of trash!

842
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,500
Mister, we can begin now.

843
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,500
Wait.

844
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,780
What now?

845
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,700
The person who's challenging the tower

846
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,420
owes me 800 silver taels.

847
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,820
So I must do something

848
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,060
for him as a support.

849
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,540
Xiao Se?

850
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,940
Miss Sikong,

851
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,500
it's been a while.

852
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,020
What took you so long to arrive here?

853
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,820
You were supposed

854
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,340
to arrive at Xueyue City one month ago.

855
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,940
I don't want to answer this question.

856
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,820
Martial Uncle,

857
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,900
he passed the 13th floor.

858
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,940
[Thirteen Ingots]

859
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,180
He's heading to the 14th floor now.

860
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,420
Where's Lei Wujie?

861
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,500
Don't tell me

862
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,020
he's the one challenging the tower.

863
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,020
Miss Sikong, you're right.

864
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,660
We didn't have the time to spar

865
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,380
because we bade farewell in a hurry.

866
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,380
This is just nice.

867
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,500
What are you doing?

868
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,300
I can't let you go.

869
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,220
Are you trying

870
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,420
to stop me for Lei Wujie?

871
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,580
Martial Uncle,

872
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,540
didn't you say

873
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,620
he doesn't know martial arts skills?

874
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,620
That's not a martial arts skill.

875
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,860
It's one of the qinggong skills.

876
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,820
One can use it without using inner force.

877
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,180
Which qinggong?

878
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,060
The world's best qinggong,

879
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,500
Walking on Clouds.

880
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,340
Why is there no one here?

881
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,660
Eldest Martial Brother!

882
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,500
It's been a long time, Eldest Martial Brother.

883
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,100
Didn't I tell you not to address me that way

884
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,580
before you are officially accepted?

885
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,820
I can ignore the rest.

886
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,820
But I must address you that way.

887
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:47,940
After all,

888
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,140
we've gone through thick and thin together.

889
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,220
You're the Lei Clan's disciple.

890
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,940
If you want to join us,

891
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,780
you only need to bring a visiting card to see me.

892
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,060
Why do you insist on challenging
the Dengtian Tower?

893
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,820
I came to Xueyue City

894
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,460
to meet a person.

895
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,820
If I want to see her,

896
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,500
I must challenge the Dengtian Tower.

897
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,820
If I have to fight you,

898
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,580
I hope you don't blame me.

899
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,780
Not bad.

900
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:19,900
Your martial arts skills

901
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,100
have improved a lot.

902
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,220
I practice every day

903
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,020
and never slack off even for a moment.

904
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,900
Eldest Martial Brother,

905
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:38,900
again!

906
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,940
I didn't expect your Fire Infusion

907
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,140
to be this powerful.

908
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,140
It broke

909
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,420
my Bladelike Thread Formation in a flash.

910
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,740
Bladelike thread?

911
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,900
It looks like

912
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,420
an ordinary silk thread no matter how I see it.

913
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,180
See?

914
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,260
It breaks as soon as I pull it.

915
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,220
Nonsense.

916
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,700
My Bladelike Thread

917
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,020
is the best weapon in the world.

918
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,340
Unexpectedly, it can't beat

919
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,380
your Fire Infusion.

920
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,620
I'm not your match.

921
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,500
Just go.

922
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,740
Lian,

923
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,380
your acting skills are terrible.

924
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,540
You see.

925
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,220
There are

926
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,220
only two of us here.

927
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,460
You can tell me if you want to throw this fight.

928
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,620
I won't tell anyone about this.

929
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,300
I throw the fight?

930
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,140
Fine.

931
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,660
Then take a blow

932
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,380
from my Pear Blossom Needle Cloudburst.

933
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,820
Are you going to say I threw the fight again?

934
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,060
No, I won't say anything.

935
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,260
I'll keep my mouth shut.

936
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,060
♪The silent temple♪
