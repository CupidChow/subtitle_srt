24
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,860
[Episode 5]

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,420
That day hasn't come back

26
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,620
to my mind for a while already.

27
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,860
You are unfazed.

28
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,700
Have you heard of Mount Kunlun?

29
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,220
It's a very cold place.

30
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,340
It snows all year long

31
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,180
and it won't melt after a millennium.

32
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,740
I trained there for six years

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,740
and my heart

34
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,180
is as frigid as the snow there.

35
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,220
So your Abyssal Eye won't work on me.

36
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:33,820
Die now!

37
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,300
Fun.

38
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,540
Enough of your gibberish.

Shattering Blade?

40
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,180
A couple of years ago,

41
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,940
I would lose to you.

42
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,660
But now...

43
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,980
Oh, little Wuxin.

44
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,900
Wang Rensun has lost too.

45
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,460
Why don't you ask

46
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,460
your two friends there

47
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,420
to help you?

48
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,060
You're hiding.

49
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,700
You think I won't notice?

50
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,020
Xiao Se.

51
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,260
Have we been

52
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,900
noticed?

53
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,380
Let's go!

54
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,460
No!

55
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,820
The cold breeze feels prickly on my skin.

56
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,900
I wonder if my child was well-covered.

57
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,140
Let's go.

58
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,620
Little Wuxin.

59
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,180
People from the Jiulong Sect

60
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,220
will come to you soon.

61
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,300
Run if you can now.

62
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,820
I can't.

63
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:10,700
True.

64
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,860
You can run for your life,

65
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,300
but you can't run

66
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,420
from your fate.

67
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:24,980
Lift it up.

68
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,260
What is wrong with you?

69
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,780
All you know is to fight.

70
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,260
Do you know how dangerous it was?

71
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,340
If the Jade Deity had wanted to kill you,

72
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,420
you would have been dead.

73
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,260
You...

74
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,140
But I'm fine now.

75
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,500
Oh, right.

76
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,500
What happened?

77
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,820
Why did they leave out of a sudden?

78
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,020
How am I supposed to know?

79
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,500
You're sly like a fox.

80
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,700
I thought you knew everything.

81
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,260
Perhaps he saw

82
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,220
your reckless punch

83
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,980
and got scared.

84
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,260
He thought he couldn't take it

85
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,020
and fled.

86
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,940
I sure hope that is true.

87
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:03,940
Master.

88
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,740
Why should we leave?

89
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,340
They can't defeat you anyway.

90
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,980
And what do you know?

91
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,540
Wuxin has mastered

92
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,540
the 32 Secret Rakshasa Arts.

93
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,100
He isn't as simple

94
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,260
as you imagined.

95
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,420
And most importantly...

96
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,780
Lingjun.

97
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,860
Prepare a horse.

98
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,220
I need to see His Majesty now.

99
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,580
Noted.

100
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,100
Come here.

101
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:35,980
What?

102
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,020
Stay here.

103
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,340
All the irrelevant ones are gone now.

104
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,220
Let's

105
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,180
get down to business.

106
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,300
You're all grown up.

107
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,500
Naturally.

108
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,060
It's been 12 years.

109
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,580
You think I'll remain

110
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,580
five years old forever?

111
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,020
What do you remember

112
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,740
from back then?

113
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,340
Many things.

114
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,980
I

115
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,940
used to ride on your shoulder

116
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,020
and tug at your beard.

117
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,060
I remember

118
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,220
how mesmerized I was

119
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,580
when you manipulated your Shattering Blade.

120
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,740
What else do I remember?

121
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,220
I remember

122
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,020
how you betrayed my father.

123
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,020
For 12 years, I've been wondering

124
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,900
if you would come to kill me.

125
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,540
I asked Abbot Wangyou.

126
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,540
And he said

127
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,140
this is a world of karma.

128
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,740
He told me many things about Buddhism,

129
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,020
but I'm not a monk

130
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,780
nor am I capable of understanding it.

131
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,740
I just wondered

132
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,860
what I would be doing

133
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,460
when you came to claim my life.

134
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,820
I suppose

135
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,940
I'll give you the tool to kill me.

136
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,900
[Religious Disciplines]

137
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,700
That's him.

138
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,740
He killed my father.

139
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,980
Kill him for me!

140
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,460
Kill him now.

141
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,660
Kill him!

142
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,540
Through fate, it began.

143
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,180
Through fate, it stops.

144
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,060
You will decide how you confront

145
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,060
this unfinished business on your own
once you grow up.

146
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,180
Understood?

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,660
Old Wangyou

148
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,660
said to be merciful.

149
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,060
Don't worry.

150
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,020
I won't kill you.

151
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,540
I hope

152
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
you will kill me.

153
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,460
If you spare me,

154
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,380
it means

155
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,460
something more troublesome awaits me.

156
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,260
No.

157
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,100
I just want you

158
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,140
to perform a ritual for me.

159
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,460
A ritual?

160
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,780
I train in Dafanyin Temple,

161
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,460
but I'm not a monk.

162
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,620
Not you.

163
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,260
I want the entire temple

164
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,420
to perform this ritual.

165
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,220
Falan.

166
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:03,980
Falan.

167
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:05,940
Falan.

168
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,460
He's asleep?

169
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,580
Wow.

170
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,580
Falan.

171
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,740
I have a favor to ask.

172
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,940
Please perform a ritual for me.

173
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,780
We need 300 monks.

174
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,660
You're the only friend left

175
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,300
of Old Wangyou.

176
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,540
You can repay all the kindness

177
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,580
he extended to you

178
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,860
all these years with this gesture.

179
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,300
After three days,

180
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,220
I'll visit again.

181
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,220
And then?

182
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,140
And then...

183
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
We'll see if I'm still alive.

184
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,220
After the ritual,

185
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,660
you should leave.

186
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,660
Twelve years ago,

187
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,820
you were forced to meddle.

188
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,900
Now,

189
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,060
you shouldn't repeat the same mistake.

190
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,740
Lei Wujie,

191
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,260
do you realize

192
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,300
how he never takes us with him

193
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,820
whenever he leaves?

194
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,820
It does look like it.

195
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,300
As the hostages,

196
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,620
why should we follow him?

197
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,620
Right.

198
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,700
Let's go to Tang Lian then.

199
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,460
Is something bothering you two?

200
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,180
We're going

201
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,020
somewhere very far.

202
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,340
We need some horses.

203
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,020
But I don't have money.

204
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,820
He's creepy.

205
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,460
Wuxin.

206
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,020
What is this diet?

207
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,540
I have never seen it before.

208
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,380
Ignorance.

209
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,620
That's edible?

210
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,620
It's not bad.

211
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,540
What do you think?

212
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,020
Not bad, isn't it?

213
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,380
It's delicious.

214
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,380
If we can have some meat in there,

215
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:33,900
it'll be amazing.

216
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:35,900
Wuxin.

217
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,460
Where did you

218
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,300
learn how to cook?

219
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,220
Old Wangyou taught me.

220
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,180
Abbot Wangyou studied

221
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,220
culinary too?

222
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,620
Perhaps he picked up it

223
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,980
during one of his voyages.

224
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,580
I heard his hometown

225
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,900
is in the Kingdom of Yushi.

226
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,540
Indeed.

227
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,420
To be precise,

228
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,140
he was born

229
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,860
in this temple.

230
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,580
Old Wangyou had a knack for Buddhism.

231
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:17,980
At the age of six,

232
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,740
he could debate

233
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,820
with The Venerable One from Dafanyin Temple.

234
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,940
Seeking enlightenment,

235
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,620
he left Yushi

236
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,980
and traveled around.

237
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,060
At the age of 40,

238
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,100
he became an abbot for Hanshui Temple.

239
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,380
By then,

240
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,610
he was already

241
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,340
touted as the Master of Zen.

242
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,980
And after 20 years,

243
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,580
he adopted me.

244
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,340
Xiao, you are knowledgeable.

245
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,820
Surely,

246
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,860
you know who I am.

247
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,180
If I'm not mistaken,

248
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:50,980
your last name is Ye.

249
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,300
Indeed.

250
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,300
I am Ye Anshi.

251
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,580
My father is Ye Dingzhi.

252
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,540
Ye Dingzhi?

253
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,180
The Head of the Demon Sect?

254
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,060
Yes.

255
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,740
My father was the Head of the Demon Sect.

256
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:05,940
Xiao Se.

257
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,980
Tianwaitian is the Demon Sect, right?

258
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,620
Demon Sect is the name

259
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,980
given to the congregation

260
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,900
(between several sects beyond the border.)

261
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,100
(The biggest of which is Tianwaitian.)

262
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,580
(And the Head of the Demon Sect)

263
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,460
(is the patriarch of Tianwaitian.)

264
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,780
However,

265
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,860
as the Demon Sect
failed in their eastern expedition,

266
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,340
they signed an armistice

267
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,780
with the Central Plains.

268
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,620
An important member of Tianwaitian

269
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,500
was required to be kept in Beili as a hostage

270
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,940
for 12 years.

271
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,260
And that person must be you.

272
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,060
It is me.

273
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,980
I was five

274
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,460
and I followed my father on his expedition.

275
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,060
My father passed on,

276
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,300
and I was adopted by Wangyou.

277
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,300
Wuxin.

278
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,460
You were kept here as a hostage

279
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,260
when you were five.

280
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,740
But now...

281
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,780
The twelve-year hostage is ending.

282
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,060
By right,

283
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,460
I should return to Tianwaitian.

284
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,540
But if you go back,

285
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,020
no one knows if the Demon Sect

286
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,260
will make a comeback or not.

287
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,020
So some

288
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,300
want to cripple you.

289
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,700
Some want to imprison you.

290
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,220
And some want to kill you.

291
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,620
In the end,

292
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,980
Dajue of the Jiulong Sect came up

293
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,700
with the Golden Coffin idea.

294
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,940
If I were you,

295
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,180
I would find the fastest horse available

296
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,500
and flee to the west.

297
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,940
If I wanted to flee,

298
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,980
I would have left
with White-Haired Deity already.

299
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,580
You didn't leave with him.

300
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,780
Instead, you brought us with you.

301
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,060
Is it truly for this ritual?

302
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,220
Many people

303
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,300
asked Old Wangyou to hand me over.

304
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,740
He wanted to protect me,

305
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,660
but he couldn't dissuade others either.

306
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,060
He was under pressure.

307
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,460
And in the end...

308
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
Hand Wuxin to us now.

309
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,780
Now!

310
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,540
Hand him over.

311
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,820
Oh, Amitabha.

312
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,540
Hand him over now.

313
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,300
Hurry up.

314
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,420
-Now!
-Hand him over now!

315
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,940
We'll kill you if you don't.

316
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:06,700
Stop!

317
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,100
Oh, Amitabha.

318
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,180
Wuxin.

319
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,460
Stay out of it.

320
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,940
Oh, Amitabha.

321
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,940
Oh, Amitabha.

322
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,380
And he died because of it.

323
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,740
So are you trying to repay his kindness here?

324
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,540
You

325
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,700
always rub people the wrong way.

326
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,020
Old Wangyou always said

327
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,740
he wanted to return here.

328
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,740
I pass by this place,

329
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,620
so I'll guide his soul back.

330
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,420
Just

331
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,340
a gesture of my gratitude.

332
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,420
I still fail to understand

333
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,340
one thing.

334
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,180
Why

335
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,020
us?

336
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,260
We have nothing

337
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,140
to do with this.

338
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,420
I know, right?

339
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,260
If you need help,

340
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,540
why can't you find someone powerful

341
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,260
from Tianwaitian?

342
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,340
Didn't I say

343
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,860
that I have no money?

344
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,500
I see an expensive fur coat

345
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,820
and an expensive red fabric here.

346
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,460
You look rich.

347
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:09,940
I...

348
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,860
You

349
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,620
have so many lies

350
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,980
tucked inside your sleeves,

351
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,210
waiting to be unleashed.

352
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,780
You're

353
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,980
like that too.

354
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,580
Shut up.

355
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,220
I wish to travel north with the wind,

356
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,820
watching the snow sweeping across the land.

357
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,300
I wish to travel east with the ship,

358
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,620
seeing the elegant fairy brave the wind.

359
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,580
I wish to travel far with the clouds,

360
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,580
even the emperor ruling the court cannot stop me.

361
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,740
I will bathe in sunlight
on the top of Mount Kunlun.

362
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,340
I will witness lush mountains rise
at the edge of the ocean.

363
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,420
We shall reunite after a long journey.

364
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,020
But I won't go home

365
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,860
unless I've seen the world.

366
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,500
Now you sound

367
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,140
like a hero.

368
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,220
Whether I'm a hero or not doesn't matter.

369
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,060
It's living

370
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,300
that matters.

371
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,140
Also,

372
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,060
you're right.

373
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,340
I chose you two

374
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,300
for a reason.

375
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,380
What reason is that?

376
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,660
After I mastered the Abyssal Eye,

377
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,820
Old Wangyou told me

378
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,100
that only two kinds of people

379
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,340
are immune to it.

380
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,580
(One is people with naivete.)

381
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,140
What does it mean?

382
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,420
Unsullied by worldly things.

383
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,540
The other one

384
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,860
(is people who bury their thoughts.)

385
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,300
I would like to visit a place.

386
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,860
Would you...

387
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:04,940
No.

388
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,340
They bury their thoughts in a bottomless pit.

389
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,700
So much

390
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,460
so that even they don't know themselves anymore.

391
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,780
I suppose the former

392
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,980
refers to this airhead

393
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,420
and the latter refers to me.

394
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,660
What about Shen Jingzhou?

395
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,420
He is immune

396
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,220
to your Abyssal Eye too.

397
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,380
(Eunuch Jade Deity isn't immune)

398
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,260
to my Abyssal Eye.

399
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,340
He was obsessed

400
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,700
with his inner demon,

401
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,220
(but his will was strong.)

402
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,060
(It only fettered him for a moment.)

403
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,260
Unlike you two.

404
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,100
When I looked into your eyes,

405
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,180
nothing happened.

406
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,580
What now then?

407
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,740
Old Wangyou has destroyed the Rakshasa Sect.

408
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,260
If I die,

409
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,580
so will the martial techniques from it.

410
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,500
Therefore,

411
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,500
I want to teach you two

412
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,220
one technique each.

413
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,500
What technique?

414
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,740
I will teach you

415
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,180
the Freedom

416
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,940
Formidable Fist.

417
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,580
Such a long name!

418
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,100
Such a random name.

419
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,700
Watch carefully.

420
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,100
Good.

421
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,380
You are gifted.

422
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,380
As expected from a disciple of the Lei family

423
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,540
of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

424
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,220
Pardon my ignorance,

425
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,420
but

426
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,700
what's so strong about this technique?

427
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,340
You fool.

428
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,020

It's just Luohan Fist.

432

The rudimentary fist technique
from Shaolin Temple.

433
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,100
Just spend 20 wen and you can get a manual

435
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,780
Even my inn staff member knows one or two tricks.

Luohan Fist

437
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,210
is just the first half.

438
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,780
The other half is called Fumo Fist.

439
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,460
Together,

440
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,420
they form the Freedom

Yes.

I don't know any martial arts.

469

Except for qinggong which I use to flee.

470

I can't fight with my fist at all.

471

But I quite fancy the ability

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,300
to stand on water.

Your mind is not still.

Well, no.

on the book,

so I gave them names.

486

Still, I'm the wrong person.

before you master it.

00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,700
Many powerful foes

762
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
will be here.

763
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,180
Are you sure?

764
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:00,900
So?

765
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,060
Old Wangyou isn't here anymore.

766
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,940
No one can stop me.

767
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,140
Xiao Se.

768
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,260
What is that?

769
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,500
Sarira, perhaps?

770
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,820
Sarira?

771
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,900
After some monks pass away,

772
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,700
they leave a pearl-like object

773
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,020
that cannot be destroyed.

774
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,460
We call it a sarira.

775
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,060
It's a Buddhist artifact.

776
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,020
After Old Wangyou passed away,

777
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,500
his body turned to dust.

778
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,340
But amidst the dust

779
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,580
lies a sarira.

780
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,380
So,

781
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,260
I brought it

782
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,140
to Yushi.

783
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,980
Old Wangyou couldn't return here
when he was alive.

784
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,420
So I brought

785
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,020
his soul here.

786
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,380
Foolish child.

787
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,020
Why did you come here?

788
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,580
Master.

789
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,020
Weep no more.

790
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,940
You shall return to your home.

791
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,260
My home is Hanshui Temple.

792
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,260
[Hanshui Temple]

793
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,220
This is Hanshui Temple.

794
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,540
Your home, from now on.

795
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,980
Missing home, aren't you?

796
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,860
Master.

797
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,460
Will you

798
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,460
leave me suddenly too,

799
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,100
like my parents did?

800
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,580
Oh, my child.

801
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,860
I will always be by your side.

802
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,500
Foolish, how foolish.

803
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,580
Hanshui Temple

804
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,460
is but a sojourn.

805
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,620
You are all grown up now.

806
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,620
You shall return to your home.

807
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,140
Your home

808
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,100
is a place of freedom.

809
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,180
A place beyond the border,

810
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,540
beyond the sky.

811
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,460
No.

812
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,700
Master.

813
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,020
I don't want to go anywhere.

814
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,220
I just want to return to Hanshui Temple.

815
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,660
Oh, my foolish child.

816
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,740
Only they think

817
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,220
you are capable

818
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,020
of ruining the world.

819
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,740
Master,

820
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,940
