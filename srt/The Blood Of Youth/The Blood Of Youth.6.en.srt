[Episode 6]

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,780
Your home

26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,060
is a place of freedom.

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,220
A place beyond the border,

28
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,740
beyond the sky.

29
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,340
No.

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,580
Master,

31
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,740
I don't want to go anywhere.

32
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,940
I only want to return to Hanshui Temple.

33
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,700
Oh, my foolish child.

34
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,420
Only they think

35
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,220
you are capable

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,820
of ruining the world.

37
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,660
Master,

38
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,540
I seek your guidance.

39
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,380
The truth is,

40
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,140
I was neither your master,
nor were you my disciple.

41
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,620
We were only fated

42
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,500
to keep each other company

43
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,420
(to complete a journey, that's all.)

44
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,700
(Now,)

45
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,580
my journey with you has ended.

46
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,020
As for the journey ahead,

47
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,740
you can only rely on yourself

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,780
to continue ahead with your journey.

49
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,860
Master.

50
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,100
Master!

51
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,580
(No matter what)

52
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,420
(you've decided,)

53
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,220
(don't forget your true intention)

54
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,860
(and don't look back.)

55
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,460
This umbrella can protect you from the rain.

56
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,500
Yet, it cannot protect your sad heart.

57
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,660
Come on.

58
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,660
Let's purify our thoughts and feelings first.

59
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,180
I'm sure the rain will stop,

60
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,340
and the sun will shine again.

61
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:19,980
I

62
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,340
shall heed your advice.

63
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,580
Lian,

64
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,700
what do you think

65
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Wuxin is up to?

66
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,500
Why is he not hiding

67
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,860
when many people are pursuing him?

68
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,620
Isn't it dangerous for him

69
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
to cause a commotion?

70
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,020
That sound

71
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,820
indicates they're performing a ritual
to release souls from suffering.

72
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,500
What's that?

73
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,580
That's the Extinction of Mental Intoxicants.

74
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,340
The evil spirit is right ahead

75
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,220
in that barren mountain.

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,620
Pick up your speed!

77
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,940
It turned out

78
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,700
Wuxin is performing the ritual
for Abbot Wangyou.

79
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,660
Master said

80
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,060
his homeland was Yushi.

81
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,860
Is Wuxin's goal

82
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,260
just to bring

83
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,380
Abbot Wangyou

84
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,580
back to his roots?

85
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,260
Back to the roots?

86
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,420
Wuxin isn't a demon.

87
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,700
Master wasn't helping a demon either.

88
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,620
Act with my heart.

89
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,300
I've finally

90
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,260

93
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,140
Can you stop putting up

94
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,540
that otherworldly appearance?

95
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,780
We all saw it.

96
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,820
I wanted to be indifferent toward the world.

97
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,700
Yet, I turned out to be a detached person

98
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,500
who's proud of it.

99
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,620
I didn't know

100
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,100
that I would feel

101
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,380
so attached to an old abbot.

102
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,860
How I overestimated myself.

103
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,220
But Old Wangyou said

104
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,740
I still need to finish

is Xiao Wuse?

171
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,540
Why did you change your name

172
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,940
all of a sudden?

173
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,460
I merely misspoke.

174
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,340
What exactly is your real name?

175
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820

179

bring him back here?

180
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:47,820
No.

181
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,060
It's better to let them beat him to death.

182
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,900
That would work too.

183
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,260

184
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,060
think about it again?

190
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,660
How many

191
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,460
do you think this kid can break?

192
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:24,780
I think

193
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,380
not a single one.

194
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,020
Do you have no faith in him at all?

195
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,260
He

196
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,740
is the secondary owner of my Snowfall Villa.

197
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,100
When the Truth Revealing Formation

198
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,460
is formed,

199
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,220
seven people turn into one person,

200
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,900
and one person turns into seven people.

201
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:49,780
Lei...

202
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,620
I mean, Xiao Wuse

203
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,020
is currently not inferior to it

204
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,660
because the formation

205
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,300
has not been

206
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,780
completely formed yet.

207
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,980
It looks like the opponents

208
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,540
don't take this Xiao Wuse seriously.

209
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,540
This is bad. They've completed the formation.

210
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,220
Wuxin.

211
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,820
Stop getting in the way.

212
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,420
Yuzhai,

213
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,540
are we there yet?

214
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,900
We're almost there.

215
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,820
We'll reach Yushi

216
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,020
after walking another five li ahead.

217
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm sure the Master of Jiulong Sect

218
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,500
has already arrived.

219
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,060
Yuzhai,

220
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,180
is Wuxin really that important?

221
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,220
All this rushing day and night

222
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,860
really tires me out.

223
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,580
I can't believe you said that.

224
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,100
We've wasted our time in Three-Gaze City

225
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,740
because you were late.

226
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:29,900
If it weren't for you,

227
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,980
we would have arrived at Yushi earlier.

228
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,060
Without me,

229
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,500
you can't defeat them even if you arrive earlier.

230
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,340
You...

231
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,380
You're right.

232
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,500
Yuzhai,

233
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,700
what else

234
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,940
does Wuxin have other than some of

235
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,380
the Secret Rakshasa Arts?

236
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,580
Did you just say some?

237
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,500
He masters 32 Secret Arts.

238
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,540
It's 32, get it?

239
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,860
Then,

240
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,860
what's our purpose

241
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,580
in capturing Wuxin?

242
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,620
The first reason,

243
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,820
we must return the Secret Arts

244
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,260
to its original owner, the Rakshasa.

245
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,940
As for Wuxin,

246
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,820
we must bring him back to Wushuang City.

247
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,540
This time,

248
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,820
we must not let Xueyue City

249
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,500
take him first.

250
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,620
Back then,

251
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,780
our Wushuang City was truly

252
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,660
incomparable in the world

253
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,460
before the establishment of Xueyue City.

254
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,420
I may not want to admit it.

255
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,260
But

256
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,020
you're the most

257
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,860
talented person

258
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,660
in Wushuang City in a century.

259
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,540
If Wushuang City

260
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,980
wants to be back

261
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,900
at the top of the world again,

262
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,700
we can only rely on you.

263
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,900
So I hope

264
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,860
you can give your best

265
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,740
this time.

266
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,220
Do you have anything else to ask?

267
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,420
I'm just curious.

268
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,260
Since Wuxin is so important,

269
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,140
why didn't you tell me before we depart?

270
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,100
Yet, you had to

271
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,580
choose to tell me when we almost arrive?

272
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,220
I've already

273
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,460
told you all this already.

274
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,740
(Is Wushuang City's century-old foundation)

275
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,100
(really depending on this fool?)

276
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,700
Wuxin of Hanshui Temple

277
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,500
is here to break the formation.

278
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,620
Wuxin.

279
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,300
Master Dajue.

280
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,660
It's been a long time.

281
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,780
Since you said that,

282
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,540
why didn't you open your eyes

283
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,580
to look at me?

284
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,660
Jiulong Sect may not be good at martial arts.

285
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,540
But it has the Truth Revealing Formation

286
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,940
passed down
from the Buddhism-related Western Regions.

287
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,700
It's said

288
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,500
even the top expert

289
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,340
can't break this formation.

290
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,980
Seven of you act like one same person.

291
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,740
I wonder

292
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,980
if you are of the same mind too.

293
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,100
Are these people trapped

294
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,020
because of their inner demons?

295
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,620
It looks like those from Jiulong Sect

296
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,700
are not that great.

297
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,820
Wuxin is not using martial arts.

298
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,540
So you can't compare it that way.

299
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,340
But the formation

300
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,580
is not broken yet.

301
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,340
Master Dajue.

302
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,100
If you don't open your eyes,

303
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,820
your martial brothers

304
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,460
will die.

305
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
Wuxin,

306
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,220
why must you force me?

307
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,740
Master Dajue,

308
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,620
you talk too much.

309
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,860
If you don't release the formation,

310
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,740
do you think

311
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,300
they can last

312
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,860
for more than half an hour?

313
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,580
If your heart is clear, no evil can enter.

314
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,220
I had no idea you have

315
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,780
such advanced mental cultivation.

316
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,380
Wuxin,

317
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,380
do you still remember

318
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,940
when we first met?

319
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,780
Of course I remember.

320
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,300
At that time, I had only been

321
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,980
in Hanshui Temple for four months.

322
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,620
After you came from Jiulong Sect

323
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,820
and spoke to my master for seven days,

324
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,820
you took Wuchan away.

325
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,540
Then you know

326
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,460
what I thought

327
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,740
when I first saw you?

328
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,220
The Jiulong Sect follows the Five Precepts.

329
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,820
No killings.

330
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,140
No stealing.

331
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,580
No vice.

332
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,940
No falsehood.

333
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,500
No intoxication.

334
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,500
I think

335
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:49,980
when you

336
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,500
first saw me,

337
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,740
you were about to violate the first precept.

338
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,180
You're right.

339
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,100
When I first saw you,

340
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,700
I wanted to kill you!

341
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,900
What kind of martial arts is this?

342
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,780
Invincible,

343
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
immune to poison,

344
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,020
indestructible,

345
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,540
formidable.

346
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,140
This is one of Jiulong Sect's

347
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,340
top ten unique skills.

348
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,140
The Vajra body was achieved

349
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,860
by practicing Purification Chants
to the extreme.

350
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,900
This is the Vajra body

351
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,980
Old Wangyou told me about.

352
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,620
Wuxin!

353
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:51,940
Wuxin.

354
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,900
Are you all right?

355
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,180
That sure hurts.

356
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,500
Dajue may have high cultivation.

357
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,380
But the Vajra body exhausts the internal power.

358
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,060
You have to stall for time

359
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,700
and don't fight him head-on.

360
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,300
I'm afraid it won't work.

361
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,180
The last stage of the Truth Revealing Formation

362
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,580
is the return to one.

363
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,580
Now, all seven internal powers

364
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,020
are inside Dajue's body.

365
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,420
I guess

366
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,300
I'll be exhausted first

367
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,340
if I want to exhaust him.

368
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,020
What do you plan to do now?

369
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,380
Since he wants to build a Vajra body,

370
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,020
then I have to break his Vajra body.

371
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,100
If your Vajra body is indestructible,

372
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,620
I'll destroy your primordial spirit!

373
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,380
Lian,

374
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,580
why are we still taking this coffin with us?

375
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,660
This Coffin of Reincarnation

376
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,700
can dispel Wuxin's

377
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,380
demonic energy.

378
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,580
Wuxin

379
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,140
is the Head of the Demon Sect after all.

380
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,860
Demon Sect?

381
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,780
It was nothing

382
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,340
but a rumor people created.

383
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:04,740
When did he

384
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,780
get on top of the carriage?

385
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,740
I didn't notice it at all.

386
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,340
What great footwork.

387
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,780
Master,

388
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,980
were you the one

389
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,420
who performed the ritual just now?

390
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,100
Yes.

391
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,020
I was entrusted

392
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,700
to release my old friend's soul from suffering.

393
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,900
Was it for Abbot Wangyou?

394
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,700
Did that lad, Dajue,

395
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,500
tell you to come?

396
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,900
Yes.

397
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,460
He kept accusing others of being demons

398
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,420
and wanted to fight and kill them.

399
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,900
He had learned nothing after all these years.

400
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,700
These people

401
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,260
also have a sect name.

402
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,940
The name Tianwaitian

403
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,460
may not sound much

404
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,220
and is too fishy.

405
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,300
But

406
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,500
Tianwaitian is the enemy

407
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,580
of the Central Plains' martial arts world.

408
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,540
Twelve years ago...

409
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,140
How much do you know

410
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,140
about the incident 12 years ago?

411
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,980
The enemy of the martial arts world
of the Central Plains?

412
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,700
Is that what your master told you?

413
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,220
My master rarely speaks

414
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,420
of the incident.

415
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,020
He would bring it up once in a while.

416
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,540
He'd talk about Ye Dingzhi
being innately powerful,

417
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,300
which he rarely sees in life.

418
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,020
But he did sound

419
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,660
quite...

420
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,460
My father said the same thing too.

421
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,820
He seems

422
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,260
to revere the Head of the Demon Sect,

423
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,220
Ye Dingzhi.

424
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,020
I found it odd at the time.

425
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,260
Aren't those from the Demon Sect our enemies?

426
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,500
If Baili Dongjun

427
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,980
and Sikong Changfeng

428
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,020
had the same

429
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,180
tolerance and insight as those men,

430
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,540
none of what happened today

431
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,100
would have happened in Xueyue City.

432
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,340
Can you tell us

433
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,580
what exactly happened back then?

434
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,740
These are all the grudges

435
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,820
of the previous generation
of the martial arts world.

436
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,420
What's the use

437
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,100
of you youngsters

438
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,660
asking about incidents

439
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,540
that are trivial?

440
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,500
But...

441
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,180
These were the decisions

442
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,420
of the people involved.

443
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,260
Be it regret

444
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,460
or discontentment,

445
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,180
this is our martial arts world.

446
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,500
And youngsters of your generation

447
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,740
should have your own martial arts world.

448
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,180
If you were tied down

449
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,420
to these old incidents,

450
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,740
how could you enjoy your lives as youngsters?

451
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,660
Youngsters should act with their hearts.

452
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,300
Am I right?

453
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,500
Act with their hearts.

454
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,020
It was written in my master's letter.

455
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,460
But I still

456
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,540
don't know

457
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,700
what I really think.

458
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,940
Foolish child.

459
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,980
The reason

460
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,580
you followed Dajue here

461
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,500
is because of the so-called justice

462
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,660
of the martial arts world

463
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,820
that good and evil can't be reconciled.

464
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,940
Am I right?

465
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,060
Then you hesitated again

466
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,020
at the foot of the mountain.

467
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,500
Why is that?

468
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,540
That means

469
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,660
it's what you want.

470
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,260
What I want?

471
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,300
Dajue,

472
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,740
do you know why my master died?

473
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,500
It was because of hypocrites like you all

474
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,820
who made him speechless

475
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,940
to the point of having nowhere to go

476
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,020
and being unable to keep living!

477
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,340
Wuxin!

478
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,820
If it weren't

479
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,100
for protecting an evil spirit like you,

480
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,260
why would Wangyou end up like this?

481
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,940
I'll kill you today!

482
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,580
Wuchan!

483
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,940
Are you going to protect this evil spirit too?

484
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
Wuxin is not a demon.

485
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,380
Get out of my way!

486
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,700
Master said I was born with a devil's heart

487
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,820
and not destined to cultivate Buddhism.

488
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,700
So he let me enter Rakshasa

489
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,540
and cultivate the Secret Arts

490
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,420
to comprehend with all mental cultivation.

491
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,900
All of you here are prating
about eradicating evil.

492
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,820
But who are you

493
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,340
to decide what evil is?

494
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,900
Is the profound
mental cultivation skill something

495
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,820
an evil spirit like you can ask?

496
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,420
Profound mental cultivation skill?

497
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,260
When it comes to this phrase around this world,

498
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,020
only my master can utter it.

499
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,260
But

500
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,020
not you.

501
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,820
Still talking, are we?

502
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,260
Prepare to die!

503
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,060
-Dajue!
-Dajue!

504
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:04,940
Qianluo.

505
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,700
Wuxin.

506
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,500
Tang Lian,

507
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,140
does Xueyue City

508
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,820
also want to fight

509
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,740
for the remnant of the Demon Sect?

510
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
Master Dajue, I hope you don't misunderstand.

511
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,220
This is my personal act.

512
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,260
It doesn't represent Xueyue City's stand.

513
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,020
I don't think Wuxin

514
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,060
is someone treacherous and evil.

515
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,780
I hope

516
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,060
you can be compassionate

517
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:26,940
and spare him.

518
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,020
Master Dajue,

519
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,140
Wuxin is really not a demon.

520
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,860
You people

521
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,540
can't tell good from evil.

522
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,100
What is wrong

523
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,180
about rooting out

524
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,540
the remnant of the Demon Sect?

525
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,900
Master Dajue,

526
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,700
Wuxin was only five

527
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,940
when the Demon Sect marched to the east.

528
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,980
What does the hatred

529
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,340
have to do with him?

530
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,260
Watch out.

531
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,940
Something is wrong with Dajue.

532
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,860
All of the remnants of the Demon Sect

533
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,860
shall die!

534
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,660
Ye Dingzhi,

535
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,460
pay for my master's death!

536
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,900
Jiulong Demon Subduing Formation!

537
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,540
Rise!

538
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,140
Ye Dingzhi,

539
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,540
die now!

540
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,220
Wuxin,

541
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,300
you...

542
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,220
When my father

543
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,140
led Tianwaitian to invade the Central Plains,

544
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,820
he committed grievous sins.

545
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
It's reasonable

546
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,140
for a son to pay for his father's sin.

547
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,780
Wuxin,

548
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,300
don't do anything foolish.

549
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:10,820
I, Ye Anshi,

550
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,300
am the Young Head of Tianwaitian,

551
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,700
but I mastered Secret Rakshasa Arts
of the Central Plains.

552
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,020
In this matter,

553
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,420
I must give an explanation.

554
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,620
Master Dajue,

555
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,540
you succumbed to your inner demon because of me.

556
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,380
Today,

557
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,020
we shall end

558
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,900
this preordained fate together.

559
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,100
Dajue's skill is dissipating.

560
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,260
What kind of evil technique is this?

561
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,340
It can actually disintegrate the enemy's skills.

562
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,620
Watch closely.

563
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,700
Wuxin's skill is dissipating even faster.

564
00:27:59,500 --> 00:27:59,980
Wuxin,

565
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:00,860
you...

566
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,180
Stop glaring at me.

567
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:04,860
I don't know

568
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,100
what the name of this martial arts skill is.

569
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,900
The book cover was destroyed,

570
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,060
so I renamed the skill

571
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,130
as

572
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,020
The Compassion.

573
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,740
Master Dajue.

574
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,090
Master Dajue.

575
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,660
Master Dajue,

576
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,140
I've destroyed the skills

577
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,620
you cultivated for decades.

578
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,140
But don't worry.

579
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,620
I'll not take the 32 Secret Arts

580
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,780
of your Rakshasa Sect

581
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,020
with me.

582
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,100
Wuxin!

583
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,500
[Zen]

584
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,860
Why did you have to disintegrate

585
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,060
your skills?

586
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,020
There were better ways to deal with it.

587
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,100
If I hadn't disintegrated these skills,

588
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,380
I'm afraid they would have risked their lives

589
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,700
to stop me from leaving.

590
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,060
What do you want to say?

591
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,740
The Compassion.

592
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,780
It's a good name.

593
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,140
It has always been.

594
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,460
Master Dajue,

595
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,020
you had a fight,

596
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,660
and Wuxin's martial arts skills are gone too.

597
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,220
Shouldn't you get out

598
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,220
of our way now?

599
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,460
Thank you

600
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,820
for saving my life.

601
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,500
I'll leave you two to talk.

602
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,220
Despite everything,

603
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:32,940
you're also

604
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,140
Old Wangyou's old friend.

605
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,220
How could I not save you?

606
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,460
It's just

607
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,860
too bad that you've lost your cultivation.

608
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,100
I hope you can forgive me.

609
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,180
How ridiculous.

610
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,300
I cultivated the Purification Chants

611
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,340
for so many years.

612
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,180
Yet, I couldn't subdue my inner demon.

613
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,540
There is no evil in this world.

614
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,180
It

615
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,700
is just our inner demons.

616
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,380
Wuchan,

617
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,740
are you returning to Hanshui Temple?

618
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,380
Master Dajue,

619
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,980
I shall remember all your teachings

620
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,820
for the past 12 years.

621
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,540
Twelve years ago,

622
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,900
I made a bet with Wangyou.

623
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,460
A bet?

624
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,060
So many years had passed.

625
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,420
It looks like this bet

626
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,020
has never been made.

627
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,340
Everything

628
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,860
was my wishful thinking.

629
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,620
It looks like

630
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,540
Old Wangyou won the bet.

631
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,060
Wuxin,

632
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:18,820
you must have suffered a lot.

633
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,860
A fine line

634
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,180
between evil and good.

635
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,500
It looks like Jiulong Sect has failed!

636
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,700
Wushuang City wants to get involved
in this chaotic situation too?

637
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,140
And Xueyue City

638
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,220
is not getting involved?

639
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,500
Are you trying to stop us?

640
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,900
We only want him.

641
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,460
A thought of evil.

642
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,500
What if we refuse to hand him over to you?

643
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,700
Are you going to kill us?

644
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,180
We're still capable

645
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,940
of inflicting injuries without killing anyone.

646
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,860
By you

647
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,020
and that lad called Wushuang?

648
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,900
Of course not.

649
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,620
Just me alone.

650
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,300
You, rascal.

651
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,740
You're so arrogant.

652
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,260
Is there any problem with that?

653
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:13,940
You...

654
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,420
If not,

655
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,860
then I'll begin.

656
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,300
I want to end this quickly

657
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,100
because I need to rush back to Wushuang City.

658
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,540
Cloud!

659
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,380
The Sword Wielding Arts.

660
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,140
Frost!

661
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,220
Thread!

662
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,220
Jade!

663
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,780
At this age, this lad

664
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,740
can control four flying swords

665
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,020
from the Wushuang Sword Box.

666
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,780
He's truly one of the greatest geniuses
in the world.

667
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,340
What's wrong?

668
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,020
A thought of evil.

669
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,380
A thought of good.

670
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
A thought of evil.

671
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,460
Wind, go!

672
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,500
I only

673
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,180
had a short rest,

674
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,300
and you're already in a tight corner.

675
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,900
It looks like you need me

676
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,180
to change the course of events.

677
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,380
So this is where the fun part is.

678
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:32,980
Go!

679
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,580
Xiao Se,

680
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,100
I thought Wuxin had lost

681
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:49,980
all his abilities.

682
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,020
How did he...

683
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,420
I dare say

684
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,380
he lied to that old man.

685
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,300
He's using different martial arts skills.

686
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:00,980
Divine Eye.

687
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,180
Astral Travel.

688
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,620
Divine Ear.

689
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,900
These aren't Rakshasa Arts

690
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:08,900
but the real

691
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,900
Six Higher Knowledge Arts.

692
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,780
Could this be what Master said

693
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,740
about a thought of the universe?

694
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,780
He disintegrated all his Secret Arts

695
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,140
and attained the Six Higher Knowledge Arts.

696
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,980
Congratulations, Wuxin.

697
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,940
It's probably for the best.

698
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,220
I can keep fighting if it's more interesting.

699
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,540
How interesting do you want it to be?

700
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,420
Go!

701
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,540
What do you feel?

702
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,460
What?

703
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,580
Do you feel particularly defeated?

704
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,860
Yes, a little.

705
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,540
Originally, I wanted

706
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,980
to make a name for myself

707
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,980
using my own abilities in this journey.

708
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,340
But I can't beat

709
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,340
any of the people I met

710
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,460
along the way.

711
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,220
Do you still remember

712
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,340
what you said in your first fight

713
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
with Minghou and Yueji?

714
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,980
I said...

715
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,300
Such a huge blade.

716
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,580
Such a huge blade.

717
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,980
Not this one.

718
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,380
I just entered the martial arts world

719
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,780
and I could fight an opponent like you.

720
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,700
How lucky am I?

721
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,020
Watch closely.

722
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,940
The best

723
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,620
of this generation will be one of them.

724
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,820
The Sword Wielding Arts

725
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,340
are truly an eye-opener.

726
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,420
The Six Higher Knowledge Arts

727
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,820
are indeed profound.

728
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,420
This is bad.

729
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,260
His injury is serious.

730
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,460
He has reached this limit.

731
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,340
(I can't believe)

732
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,100
(that after taking the blows
from Shen Jingzhou's Blizzard Sword)

733
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,300
(and Jiulong Sect's Truth Revealing Formation,)

734
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,820
(I still)

735
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,620
(have to die in the end.)

736
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,900
Wuxin!

737
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,180
You used your body to block
instead of using your sword.

738
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,340
What a fool.

739
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:32,940
Get up.

740
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,660
He's indeed a fool.

741
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,700
But

742
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,500
this friendship is worth admiring.

743
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,820
What's your name?

744
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,740
Lei Wujie of the Lei family

745
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,020
of Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

746
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,500
I know Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

747
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,140
But I don't think

748
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,620
Lei Wujie is famous.

749
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,460
You'll know it in the future.

750
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,420
All right.

751
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,540
My sword doesn't harm nameless heroes.

752
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,180
So I'll let you go today.

753
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,140
You must remember

754
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,620
to make a name for yourself in the future.

755
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,580
Of course.

756
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:04,900
Wushuang,

757
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,660
why did you stop?

758
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,020
I had fun, so I don't want to fight anymore.
