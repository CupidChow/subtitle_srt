[The Blood of Youth]

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,970
[Episode 14]

25
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,220
Father,

26
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,580
I remember a statement

27
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,820
made to me by a master.

28
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,420
Youths

29
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,100
must have their own martial arts world.

30
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,500
Therefore,

31
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,820
I cannot

32
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,420
accept this token.

33
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,580
Father, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,820
So, you don't like it?

35
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,660
You think I want to give it to you?

36
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,540
Goodness.

37
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,140
Come on.

38
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,740
Let's not talk about the token.

39
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,580
Let's talk about Xiao Chuhe.

40
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,780
Where were we just now?

41
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,940
-That Xiao Chuhe...
-Father!

42
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,100
Didn't you just say

43
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,740
that you are going to find someone
you acknowledge

44
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,020
and protect him?

45
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,380
What do you think about Xiao Se?

46
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,260
Acknowledgment and protection?

47
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,580
I don't think such terms

48
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,660
are meant for us.

49
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,300
You just don't want to admit it.

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,780
All right now.

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,300
Go to Xiao Se

52
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,700
and return the favor

53
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,900
to him.

54
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,340
Father!

55
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,020
I've known Miss Ruoyi for a long time.

56
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,020
But it was my first time
chatting with her this long.

57
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,140
Have you finished reading "Late Snow"

58
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,260
given to you by Scholarly Sword Deity?

59
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,980
That book is boring.

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,900
I was sleepy just after reading a few lines.

61
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,860
It's no fun.

62
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,540
I don't like that book.

63
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,660
If so, what kind of book

64
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,580
do you like?

65
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,060
Naturally, I like books

66
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,980
about wanderers in the martial arts world

67
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,500
and heroes on the battlefield.

68
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,340
For example,

69
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,660
the story of Baiyu Sword Deity

70
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,980
conquering Tianqi by himself.

71
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,340
I will never get tired of it.

72
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,380
The story of Baiyu Sword Deity

73
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,860
conquering Tianqi City?

74
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,540
Xiao Se,

75
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,980
why do you have a weird expression

76
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,180
whenever I mention Tianqi City?

77
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,940
If I'm not mistaken,

78
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,940
your hometown should be Tianqi.

79
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,100
I don't have a hometown.

80
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,700
You're mistaken.

81
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,940
Everyone has a hometown.

82
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,620
Don't tell me you were born

83
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,540
from a rock?

84
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,900
So, what's hometown to you?

85
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,940
Isn't it obvious?

86
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,860
Hometown?

87
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,700
It's a place that you're destined to return to

88
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,260
no matter

89
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,380
how far you go

90
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,780
or how long

91
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,260
you are away.

92
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,820
A place that we're destined to return to?

93
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,620
You're right.

94
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,300
My hometown is Tianqi City.

95
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,380
It's a place

96
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,140
that I'm destined to return to.

97
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,820
Lord Bai said

98
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,180
he is taking you with him

99
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,300
under an imperial order.

100
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,820
However, judging from him

101
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,140
still being here,

102
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,060
I think you've rejected him.

103
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,340
If so, Third City Lord,

104
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,540
do you think I should reject him?

105
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,140
I don't know

106
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,940
what he offered,

107
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,060
but judging from the way he looked,

108
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,260
there should be

109
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,140
a condition

110
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,900
that would leave many people in awe.

111
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,900
That's right.

112
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,660
However, there's also a reason

113
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,900
that I must reject him.

114
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,780
Third City Lord, do you think

115
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,700
I should

116
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,660
return with him?

117
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,700
I understand your persistence.

118
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,140
However, in my opinion,

119
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,220
if you return to Tianqi

120
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,540
right now,

121
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,900
many issues

122
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,250
will be simplified.

123
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,540
It's beneficial to you,

124
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,100
to your father,

125
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,700
and to that incident

126
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,660
in the past.

127
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,900
That's right.

128
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,580
Father has already

129
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,380
made a huge compromise.

130
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,340
With his personality,

131
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,140
this is already the extent of his leniency.

132
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,780
I heard that Lord Bai

133
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,980
gave you three days.

134
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,380
What's wrong?

135
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,740
Third City Lord, are you also going

136
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,220
to persuade me on his behalf?

137
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,340
I, Sikong Changfeng,

138
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,460
never persuade anyone

139
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,380
on anyone's behalf.

140
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,020
I just think

141
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,580
that this is a great time

142
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,260
for you to return to Tianqi.

143
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,780
Of course I know that.

144
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,220
All right then.

145
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,820
I'll stop bothering you.

146
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,620
By the way,

147
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,180
what do you think

148
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,300
about my daughter?

149
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,420
She's proficient with a spear.

150
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,180
She's inherited your skills.

151
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,980
Who asked you about her spear skills?

152
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,260
I'm talking about

153
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,820
her looks.

154
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,380
Her looks?

155
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,780
She inherited her mother's looks.

156
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,020
What about her personality?

157
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,100
As for her personality,

158
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,260
it makes her unique.

159
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,100
However, she's pretty special.

160
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,020
(If you return)

161
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,180
(to Tianqi right now,)

162
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,740
(many issues)

163
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,980
(will be simplified.)

164
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,140
(It's beneficial to you,)

165
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,660
(to your father,)

166
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,780
(and to that incident)

167
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,540
(in the past.)

168
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,340
Three days, huh?

169
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,900
Wuxin,

170
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,740
why are you always here

171
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,780
whenever I feel troubled?

172
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,420
Mr. Xiao, that means

173
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,900
you still trust me.

174
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,020
When you're troubled,

175
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,860
you will only feel at ease

176
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,900
when you see your bosom friend.

177
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,900
You're still as narcissistic as always,

178
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,260
even in my dreams.

179
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,300
Mr. Xiao,

180
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,140
may I know

181
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,260
what is troubling you?

182
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,100
It's something I've pondered over

183
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,340
and persevered for a long time.

184
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,500
Sometimes, it's unnecessary

185
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,140
to persevere.

186
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,740
Maybe you'll go farther

187
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,820
if you take another path.

188
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,900
That's what you think too?

189
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,420
But sometimes, it's different.

190
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,860
People in the world think

191
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,100
that they must persevere

192
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,460
even if isn't worth it.

193
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
They think that they should persevere

194
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,900
even if there's no hope

195
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,780
and that they should persevere

196
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,060
until death.

197
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,660
This is quite rare,

198
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,180
but judging from your character,

199
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,660
I'm sure you'll encounter things like these.

200
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,820
Wuxin.

201
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,180
Have I resolved your doubts?

202
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,260
What a joke.

203
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,540
I said I was troubled.

204
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,460
I didn't say that I had any doubts.

205
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,740
Lord Bai, how long have you been

206
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,940
staying in Xueyue City?

207
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,100
Counting the day I came,

208
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,660
today's already the fourth day.

209
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,580
Lord Bai, is Xueyue City as interesting

210
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,420
as what you've heard?

211
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,180
It's plainer

212
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,540
than what I'd imagined.

213
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,940
Xueyue City

214
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,180
is actually

215
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,340
an ordinary city.

216
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,660
It's just that martial artists

217
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,900
love to adorn it with their own special meanings.

218
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,220
However,

219
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,340
it's also special

220
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,420
due to

221
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,180
how plain it is.

222
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,220
Xueyue City

223
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,420
was built by several

224
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,700
martial arts masters

225
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,500
as a shelter from the world a century ago.

226
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,500
However,

227
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,220
too many people are paying attention to it now.

228
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,340
It has gone against

229
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,020
the initial goals of our predecessors.

230
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,140
No one can avoid the world entirely

231
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,380
if you live in the world.

232
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,260
Back then,

233
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,500
when you were still the Vermilion Bird,

234
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,700
you razed half of Tianqi

235
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,700
to the ground with your spear.

236
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,460
That was all in the past.

237
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,940
Since then,

238
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,220
I think it's been around two decades

239
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,540
since you returned to Tianqi.

240
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,420
Lord Bai,

241
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,180
are you asking me

242
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,020
if I will support Xiao Se

243
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,300
just like how I supported

244
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,860
your father back then?

245
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,380
I dare not say so.

246
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,220
Actually, I've never

247
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,460
supported your father before.

248
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,660
Lord Langya

249
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,060
was the only person I supported.

250
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,460
What's wrong?

251
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,220
Do I sound like

252
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,620
a rebel to you?

253
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,940
That's right.

254
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,140
But I've said it already.

255
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,180
You can complain to your father.

256
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,540
He's not daring enough to make comments

257
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,140
because that's the truth.

258
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:48,980
It's just like

259
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,300
I have an answer

260
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,740
to your previous question.

261
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,340
Yes.

262
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,580
I just didn't expect you

263
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,420
to have such

264
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
a resolute answer.

265
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,060
I've always been a decisive man.

266
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,820
Although I said I supported him,

267
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,540
I wasn't saying

268
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,900
that I would support him
in robbing things of others.

269
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,820
I was saying that I would support
every decision he made.

270
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,140
Just like how he's working as an accountant

271
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,540
in Xueyue City right now.

272
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,540
Even if he's going to do that
for the rest of his life,

273
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,340
I will support him.

274
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,100
After all, Xiao Se is unparalleled

275
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,700
when it comes to accounting.

276
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,780
I understand now.

277
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,860
[Xiaoqing Pavilion]

278
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,820
Chuhe,

279
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,980
time's up.

280
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,940
Doesn't that mean

281
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,100
you're returning tomorrow?

282
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,060
I will leave

283
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,780
after getting your answer.

284
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,460
Restoring my status as a prince,

285
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,140
and I'll be given the title of Lord Yong'an?

286
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,620
Those conditions

287
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,980
are tempting indeed.

288
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,060
You and I understand our father's temper well.

289
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,380
He has already made a huge compromise

290
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,220
by issuing such a decree.

291
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,540
As long as I return with you,

292
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,260
I won't need

293
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,820
to wander in the martial arts world again.

294
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,860
I can return to Tianqi City

295
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,860
and the real

296
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,260
Snowfall Villa.

297
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,180
I can drink

298
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,460
at Diaolou Parlor every day,

299
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,500
gamble at Qianjin Gambling House,

300
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,740
admire the scenery at Bibo Lake,

301
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,140
and even have the best physician

302
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,780
tend

303
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,780
to my internal injuries

304
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,220
and provide me with the best herbs.

305
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,340
Certainly.

306
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,060
I even have more chances

307
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,620
to find out the truth

308
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,300
behind the incident I've always wanted to know.

309
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,180
As long as you give me your answer,

310
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,020
you can decide what to do

311
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,500
in Tianqi City

312
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,500
after you head back.

313
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,980
Okay.

314
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,460
I'll give you my answer then.

315
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,580
I, Xiao Se,

316
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,420
reject the decree.

317
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,220
Why?

318
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,300
You've already given many reasons

319
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,420
to head back yourself.

320
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,700
But you still rejected me in the end.

321
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,260
Because if I return with you right now,

322
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,100
that means I'll be acknowledging

323
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,460
that everything I did in the past was wrong.

324
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,100
Since I was wrong

325
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,060
in everything I did,

326
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,340
that means the only person

327
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,740
who could redress

328
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,940
Uncle Langya's grievances

329
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,260
has admitted defeat.

330
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,180
Do you know what that means?

331
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,860
Regarding Lord Langya's rebellion,

332
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,060
the Imperial Censorate closed the case long ago.

333
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,300
Lord Langya was executed as well.

334
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,020
That means

335
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,380
Uncle Langya's innocence

336
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,980
and his last

337
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,500
sliver of hope

338
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,060
will vanish.

339
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,620
He will bear

340
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,380
the heinous crime of plotting against the state,

341
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,780
be humiliated for the rest of his life

342
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,980
in Beili Kingdom,

343
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,660
and be frowned upon forever
by future generations.

344
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,140
What's the point of you

345
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,980
persevering alone?

346
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,980
With my perseverance,

347
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,820
at least there's someone in this world

348
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,180
who dares to fight for him.

349
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,780
This way, Uncle Langya's courage

350
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,060
and bravery on the battlefield

351
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,580
will be known.

352
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,580
And his acts of saving

353
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,900
the people

354
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,860
will be meaningful.

355
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,260
That's right.

356
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,460
So what

357
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
if I'm persevering alone?

358
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,140
Unless I am dead,

359
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,660
I will never admit defeat.

360
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,460
You'll be executed
for going against the imperial decree!

361
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,660
Do you dare to execute me then?

362
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,420
Do it now

363
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,500
if you dare.

If you don't dare to do it,

365
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,380
return to your father

366
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,500
and get a decree

Take him away!

370
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,420
Yes, Your Highness!

371
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,260
You didn't have to put on an act.

372
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,220
Again!

Your Highness,

377
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,500
what did Xiao Chuhe mean by that?

378
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,540
I promised Father

379
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,220
that I would surely accomplish this task

380
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,130
before I departed.

381
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,260
But when I saw him,

382
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,780
I already knew

383
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,060
that he would never leave.

384
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,500
Why is that the case?

385
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,660
Because his keenness

386
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,460
is still there.

387
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,540
That's why I put on an act.

388
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,900
I waited for three days.

389
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,780
And just now,

390
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,900
Chuhe cooperated with me

391
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,700
to finish the act.

392
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,700
So,

393
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,860
are you saying that he took the blow on purpose?

394
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,180
That's right.

395
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,420
If he resists with his life,

396
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,820
I will have no reason

397
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
to keep forcing him.

398
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,420
And I can also

399
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,220
explain myself to Father.

400
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,540
Your Highness, you planned for that long ago?

401
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,580
No one truly wants Xiao Chuhe

402
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,420
to return to Tianqi City.

403
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,260
In the past,

404
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,100
all other princes

405
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,820
served as his foil.

406
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,380
And now,

407
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,500
I've finally acquired a chance.

408
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,740
I cannot miss out on it again.

409
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,820
I was reckless.

410
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,420
I don't know when it started,

411
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,300
but I started thinking about my personal gains.

412
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,060
Although Chuhe knew this before me,

413
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,340
he has never changed.

414
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,180
Lord Bai, you came in a hurry,

415
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,410
[Xueyue City]
and now, you're leaving in a hurry.

416
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,700
Since I've accomplished my task,

417
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,580
I shouldn't interrupt you.

418
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,940
Lord Bai, you're just like

419
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,860
Lord Jingyu.

420
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,940
I dare not mention

421
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,380
the title my father used to have.

422
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,620
It's a shame

423
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,020
that Xiao Se

424
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,300
is nothing like Lord Langya.

425
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,740
Is that so?

426
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,420
I heard from many people

427
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,180
that Chuhe

428
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,820
was just like Lord Langya.

429
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,980
They're totally different.

430
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,900
Lord Langya was a gentleman.

431
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,580
He loved to reason things out.

432
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,020
And he always looked at the bigger picture.

433
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,020
What about Chuhe?

434
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,420
He never looks at the bigger picture!

435
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,500
Everything is fine as long as he's happy.

436
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,940
I understand now.

437
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,580
Farewell.

438
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,900
Farewell.

439
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,100
[Proceed with the plan]

440
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:35,820
Your Highness,

441
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,180
I just received news

442
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,860
from Shao Han.

443
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,780
Did everything go smoothly?

444
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,900
Shao Han told us to proceed with the plan.

445
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,300
Okay.

446
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,100
If so,

447
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,660
we shall head to

448
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,780
Wushuang City.

449
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,340
Head of Tianwaitian,
a rare guest from a distant place

450
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,180
is paying you a visit.

451
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,820
How far did he come from?

452
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,740
Why is he here?

453
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,980
We came from 1,000 li away,

454
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,540
the imperial city of Tianqi.

455
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,220
We're here to see you, sir.

456
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,580
You're here to see me?

457
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,460
You've seen me.

458
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,860
You can leave now.

459
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,860
No.

460
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,460
I haven't seen you.

461
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,420
As Buddha said,

462
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,900
if the heart is born without a figure,

463
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,460
the figure is born of the heart.

464
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
If the figure is born without a heart,

465
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,700
the figure is unborn of the heart.

466
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,580
I've only seen your figure.

467
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,660
I haven't got to know your heart.

468
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,380
That's why we haven't seen each other yet.

469
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,260
You wish to know my heart?

470
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,580
Do you know my original name?

471
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,060
Wuxin.
(*no heart)

472
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,020
Come inside.

473
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,220
I think

474
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,860
I've met him before.

475
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,220
Yueji greets

476
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,860
and Minghou kills.

477
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,740
This is Minghou.

478
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,420
You guys are old acquaintances indeed.

479
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,060
However, it seems like

480
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,260
he remembers nothing.

481
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,740
Is he

482
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,340
your drug tester?

483
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,660
When I met him and Yueji,

484
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,180
both of them were seriously wounded.

485
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,300
They were dying.

486
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,820
Although he didn't die,

487
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,140
he became

488
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,060
a drug tester that only listens to your order.

489
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,540
Everything has a price.

490
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,340
Since he wanted him

491
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,500
and Yueji to be saved,

492
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,340
he has to pay the price.

493
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,300
It's a shame

494
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,580
that I cannot use that technique now.

495
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,620
I cannot help you again.

496
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,260
As for you,

497
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,580
why are you here to see me?

498
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,340
My surname is Xiao.

499
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,260
So, you're Xiao Yu, also known as Lord Chi.

500
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,980
You're the seventh son of Emperor Mingde.

501
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,860
You look like you only indulge
in worldly pleasures.

502
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,180
[Xiao Yu, Lord Chi]

503
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,100
But all these years,

504
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,580
your power is growing.

505
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,460
Even my return to Tianwaitian

506
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,980
was part of your arrangement.

507
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,900
You did so

508
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,340
because Tianwaitian was having civil unrest.

509
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,340
That's why you sent me back here

510
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,060
and used me as a puppet

511
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,700
to control the scenes in secret.

512
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,620
In the end, not just Tianwaitian

513
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,220
but even the entire martial arts world

514
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,140
will be under your control.

515
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,220
That's right.

516
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,740
You're right.

517
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,420
However,

518
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,610
your ability

519
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,020
far exceeded what I could imagine.

520
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
You've taken over Tianwaitian

521
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,860
in just a few months.

522
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,980
That's why I traveled over 1,000 li

523
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
in hopes of establishing an alliance with you.

524
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,820
But why should I do so?

525
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,740
My surname is Xiao,

526
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,580
but my mother's surname is Yi.

527
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,860
Back then, I was too young.

528
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,100
I could only remember her surname.

529
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,740
I forgot her name.

530
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,860
Yi Wenjun.

531
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
That name doesn't ring a bell.

532
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,500
I'm afraid

533
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,620
it doesn't ring a bell

534
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,900
to you, me,

535
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,140
or even herself.

536
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,700
What do people remember her as?

537
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,340
Consort Xuan.

538
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,820
So,

539
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,900
you're my half-brother?

540
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,620
I was born when Ye Dingzhi abducted my mother

541
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,380
back then.

542
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,540
I'm your elder brother.

543
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,660
And I'm two years older than you.

544
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,260
That means I'm at a disadvantage here.

545
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,220
So?

546
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,740
What do you mean?

547
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,780
Although we're brothers,

548
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,060
we have different fathers.

549
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,300
Our fathers are rivals too.

550
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,660
After all,

551
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,180
back then, my father

552
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,500
led the Demon Sect to conquer the east.

553
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,260
Everyone thought

554
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,060
he did it because of his ambitions
to rule the world.

555
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,580
However, he was motivated to do so

556
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,980
clearly because Emperor Mingde

557
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,980
abducted my mother.

558
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,100
My father died because of your father.

559
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,900
He even abducted my mother.

560
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,740
You're lucky

561
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,540
that I'm not chopping you up.

562
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,380
How dare you ask me

563
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,780
to assist you in stealing the Emperor's throne?

564
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,820
My father is old now.

565
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,740
He intends to select a crown prince.

566
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,460
Our family

567
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,260
originally depended on Shadow Sect
when we were in Tianqi.

568
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,180
But Lord Langya abolished them

569
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,380
when he was still alive.

570
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,980
Now, our family

571
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,580
has no say in Tianqi City at all.

572
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,860
And my mother is detested by all

573
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,060
due to that incident.

574
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,420
Other princes

575
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,300
control the forces

576
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,380
in Wushuang City and Xueyue City.

577
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,020
Don't make yourself sound so weak.

578
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,820
Back then, my mother had a senior

579
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,380
who was deeply in love with her.

580
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,140
His name is Luo Qingyang.

581
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,020
In the end, he became

582
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,740
the strongest one

583
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,340
among the Five Sword Deities.

584
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,660
He's the City Lord of Muliang City,
Lone Sword Deity.

585
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,580
Now, he's your foster father.

586
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,300
He's our foster father indeed.

587
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
Our foster father?

588
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,900
Brother, you're deceptive

589
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,420
with your words.

590
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,380
I just want Mother

591
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,540
to lead a better life.

592
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,380
All these years,

593
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,500
everyone detests Mother

594
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,340
because of that incident with Ye Dingzhi.

595
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,700
They look down on me too.

596
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,700
But I want to become the most powerful person

597
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,540
and make everyone regret their decision.

598
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,140
You intend to move me with kinship?

599
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,460
That's not a good choice.

600
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,940
After all, there's no pleasant memory

601
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,500
between us.

602
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,380
However,

603
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,860
taking over the world

604
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,460
does seem pretty interesting.

605
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,460
I cannot be the Emperor.

606
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,140
However, helping someone to become the Emperor

607
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,020
doesn't sound

608
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,340
that bad.

609
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,220
Really?

610
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,940
Yes.

611
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,660
I assume you will die

612
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,740
without my presence.

613
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,060
I don't have much kin left.

614
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,580
I hope that you two

615
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,260
can stay alive.

616
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,340
Excellent.

617
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,420
Now, I have an emergency

618
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,740
I need you to help me with.

619
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,340
You're assigning missions to me

620
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,740
right after I agreed to your proposal?

621
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,660
Don't you think you're too hasty?

622
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,860
I'm in a rush.

623
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
Xiao Chong, also known as Lord Bai,

624
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,980
has taken action.

625
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,060
They're tracking someone down.

626
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,540
That man is very important.

627
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,820
We mustn't let Xiao Chong get his way.

628
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,380
I need you to steal him

629
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,060
or kill him.

630
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,860
Don't tell me

631
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,540
that person has the surname Xiao too?

632
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,100
That's right.

633
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,540
Xiao Se?

634
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,500
I don't care what his name is.

635
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,220
Anyway, you're right.

636
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,420
It's that person you're thinking about.

637
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,180
Seems like you two are very close.

638
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,580
That's right.

639
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,420
He's my friend.

640
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,420
I don't have many friends.

641
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,940
He's one of them.

642
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,740
But don't worry.

643
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,660
I will agree to your request.

644
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,580
But there's only one thing.

645
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,980
What is it?

646
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,340
I will promise

647
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,220
that Xiao Chong won't get his hands on him.

648
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,740
However, you won't get him either.

649
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,620
Xiao Se mustn't die.

650
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,780
That's my bottom line.

651
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,420
Fine.

652
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,660
I promise.

653
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,300
Also,

654
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,460
I need someone

655
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,220
to accompany me on the journey.

656
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,020
You shall follow me.

657
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,020
You're taking him?

658
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,740
After all, we have seen

659
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,740
each other before.

660
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,820
It's a shame

661
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,420
that he ended up like this.

662
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,460
Why don't you

663
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,980
entrust him to me?

664
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,740
You can take him away then.

665
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,620
After the deed is done,

666
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,740
I will find you in Tianqi City.

667
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,340
Remember,

668
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,900
Xiao Se mustn't die.

669
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,780
That's my bottom line.

670
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,660
He left?

671
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,220
He didn't even stop for a moment.

672
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,220
Maybe he's in a hurry

673
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,540
to do something else.

674
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,740
I'm glad that he's gone.

675
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,220
Did you send Miss Sikong here

676
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,140
because you expected him to do so?

677
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,420
Sometimes, you need to shed blood

678
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,260
to resolve certain issues.

679
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,820
It was inappropriate for me to show myself.

680
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,060
That's why I told Qianluo to do it for me.

681
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:53,940
Xiao Se,

682
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,300
I heard from Qianluo

683
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,340
that you're hurt.

684
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,620
It's just a minor injury.

685
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
There's no need to overreact.

686
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,420
Tang Lian,

687
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,700
Old Master Tang said

688
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,580
he suddenly had an idea.

689
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,580
It might be able

690
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,900
to cure Miss Ye's disease.

691
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,820
You should bring Miss Ye

692
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,420
to the Tang Clan when you're free.

693
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:13,940
Yes.

694
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,700
Lian, you're leaving?

695
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,460
Don't tell me you're leaving too?

696
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,420
Lei Fortress's hero banquet

697
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,260
will start soon.

698
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,500
Besides,

699
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,740
according to the promise my sister made to me,

700
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,820
she has to follow me

701
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,820
and see my master at least once.

702
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,060
I forgot about that.

703
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,540
This year's hero banquet

704
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,700
is held by the Lei Clan.

705
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,700
So, Lian,

706
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,500
do you want to join me?

707
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,700
After I return to the Tang Clan,

708
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,740
if I have nothing else to do,

709
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,020
I think I will join the banquet

710
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,100
together with Old Master Tang.

711
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,620
That's great.

712
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,780
Listen.

713
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,940
I heard that there's even

714
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,420
a martial arts contest.

715
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,740
Are you going to join it?

716
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,540
Of course I will take the top spot.

717
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,940
Your eldest martial brother was once
a three-time winner of the contest.

718
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,540
Don't embarrass

719
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,660
your eldest martial brother.

720
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,940
What about Xiao Se?

721
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,060
Xiao Se, are you joining it?

722
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,060
You're more familiar

723
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,540
with a martial arts contest than me.

724
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,620
Scram.

725
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,940
He can't go.

726
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,660
The accounts of Xueyue City

727
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,380
are piling up.

728
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,620
I'm going.

729
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,060
You wish to go?

730
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,820
I want to see

731
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,500
how this fool will embarrass himself.

732
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,100
That's impossible.

733
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,340
Listen.

734
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,300
I'll definitely defeat everyone there.

735
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,540
[Meeting Hall]

736
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,740
Is this how Wushuang City

737
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,620
treats their guests?

738
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,420
His Highness is already here,

739
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,460
yet the City Lord of Wushuang City
hasn't shown himself yet.

740
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,620
Don't tell me you want us to wait for him?

741
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,540
What?

742
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,620
I'm already sitting here, aren't I?

743
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,580
What?

744
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,100
A little boy like you

745
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,500
is actually the City Lord of Wushuang City?

746
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,940
Zang Ming, what's wrong?

747
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,540
Your Highness,

748
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,260
Song Yanhui isn't here.

749
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,260
That's a random boy over there.

750
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Are they joking with us?

751
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,900
Such audacity!

752
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,100
I'm Wushuang, the new City Lord

753
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,220
of Wushuang City.

754
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,460
Zang Ming.

755
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,260
So, you must be the Mr. Xiao

756
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,460
that Mr. Ling had mentioned.

757
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:12,860
A pleasure to meet you.

758
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,580
I'm Xiao Chong.

759
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,380
Xiao Se, you're something else.

760
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,940
No wonder I couldn't find you.

761
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,740
So, you were skiving up here.

762
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,900
I just finished doing the accounts.

763
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,580
I just came here to take a sip,

764
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,260
and now, you're here.

765
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,620
How's your proficiency with the Yinyue Spear?

766
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,180
I've mastered the fourth level.

767
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,300
What? Do you wish to spar with me?

768
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,100
Forget it.

769
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,940
We can talk about it tomorrow.

770
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,420
Listen,

771
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,100
you'd better don't offend me.

772
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,060
If you do,

773
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,060
I'll wield Wuji Staff

774
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,100
and beat you to the ground.

775
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,260
I've listened to that

776
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,140
so many times.

777
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,860
Fight me if you dare.

778
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,580
You're so childish.

779
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,460
Money-grubber.

780
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,900
Have you been to Tianqi before?

781
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,700
You mean the imperial capital?

782
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,540
No.

783
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,900
How's the city compared to Xueyue City?

784
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,420
It isn't as beautiful as Xueyue City.

785
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,620
However, it's huge.

786
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
It's about the size

787
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,580
of seven or eight Xueyue Cities.

788
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,220
All kinds of people gather there.

789
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,660
It's interesting over there.

790
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,980
They will hold a grand bazaar

791
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,300
at the middle and the end of the year.

792
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,540
You'll find all kinds of

793
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,900
interesting trinkets over there.

794
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,660
Once, I saw a shard of crystal

795
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,020
that was purely natural.

796
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,580
It was about

797
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,740
the size of a liquor vat.

798
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,220
There's a place

799
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,380
called Qianjin Gambling House.

800
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,820
I once gambled

801
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,340
and won a city over there.

802
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,500
Bring me to Tianqi

803
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,300
when you have the chance, okay?

804
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,340
Sure.

805
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,700
Go now.

806
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,940
You've been in Mount Cang

807
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,620
for too long anyway.

808
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,220
What about you?

809
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,740
Baili hasn't returned yet,

810
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,380
and now, I'm leaving.

811
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,100
I'm the City Lord of Xueyue City.

812
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,780
Xueyue City

813
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,380
is my martial arts world.

814
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,460
How's your disciple doing?

815
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,740
He's getting better,

816
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,980
but he still cannot endure any hardships.

817
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,940
Even so, he insists on heading

818
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,340
to Lei Fortress.

819
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,860
Why does he want to go to Lei Fortress?

820
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:37,980
He says

821
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,620
he wants to witness

822
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,180
Lei Wujie wins the contest personally.

823
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,460
What a ridiculous reason.

824
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,580
What's more ridiculous is

825
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,340
that I actually said yes.

826
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,380
Why did you say

827
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,460
that you want to go to Lei Fortress?

828
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,420
Just now, it was unsuitable for me to say so.

829
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,500
But Xueyue City is definitely

830
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,620
the best place for you to rest and recuperate.

831
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,300
Your whereabouts have been exposed.

832
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,540
If you leave

833
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
Xueyue City right now,

834
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,380
plenty of people

835
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,140
will pursue you.

836
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,900
I have Xueyue Sword Deity with me.

837
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,260
With her around,

838
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,300
no one can kill me.

839
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,140
What's the reason then?

840
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,740
I want to see Lei Wujie win the contest.

841
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,820
What kind of excuse is that?

842
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,180
It seems like he has accepted

843
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,060
the Azure Dragon Token

844
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,820
without knowing who I am.

845
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,500
I'm curious

846
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
as to how much Lei Wujie

847
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,260
can grow

848
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,700
if he keeps this up.

849
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
That's all?

850
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,140
Moreover, that silly kid

851
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,300
wants to venture out into the martial arts world.

852
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,540
He might get himself killed

853
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,820
if I'm not with him.

854
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,940
I'm still worried.

855
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,460
But I know

856
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
that you won't heed my words.

857
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,580
When you tried to persuade me to return to Tianqi,

858
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,260
I realized

859
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,980
that it wasn't something

860
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,860
you would say.

861
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,540
I said so

862
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,540
because I wanted to test you.

863
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,020
Xie Xuan said

864
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,060
some people

865
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,580
would never change.

866
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,700
Thus,

867
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,420
I made a bet with him.

868
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,580
How did it turn out?

869
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,300
I lost the bet.

870
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,300
But I was happy about it.

871
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,900
Great, then.

872
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,020
Fine.

873
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,260
Xie Xuan will head to Lei Fortress too.

874
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,980
They can see each other

875
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,180
and talk about

876
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,740
the secret of the Circulation Art.

877
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,100
That might be one of the reasons

878
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,580
I'm willing to let him go.

879
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:26,860
I'll join him.

880
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,220
Don't worry.

881
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,260
Hanyi,

882
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,820
it's been a long time since you left Xueyue City.

883
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,860
Don't you wish

884
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,220
to head to somewhere you like for once?

885
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,220
No.

886
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,700
Don't be so absolute about it.

887
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,140
If you want to do so,

888
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,380
I'll invite Baili

889
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,180
back.

890
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,380
We will make the call for you.

891
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,020
You can head to Mount Wangcheng.

892
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,020
No need for that.

893
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,860
I know

894
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,740
what I'm doing.

895
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,580
Look at you.

896
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,740
Forget it.

897
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,460
[Meeting Hall]

898
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,260
City Lord.

899
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,180
Have they left?

900
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,020
Yes.

901
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,700
This prince isn't someone ordinary.

902
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,580
Have we ever

903
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,700
had a blind emperor before?

904
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,940
This is the first time Wushuang City

905
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,260
has a city lord with such a bad memory.

906
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,980
There's always a first time.

907
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,380
Have you remembered him then?

908
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,380
Xiao Chong, also known as Lord Bai.

909
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,410
He inherited his breathing technique

910
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,740
from Jinyu, Director of Record.

911
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,060
He is a calm person.

912
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,060
He learned his sword skills

913
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,980
from Yan Zhantian, the Wrathful Sword Deity.

914
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,100
He has a serious killing intent.

915
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,540
I have a bad memory

916
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,820
because I only

917
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,820
remember the people

918
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,700
worth remembering.

919
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,820
However,

920
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,500
you have to be careful in the future.

921
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,140
Did he want anything from you?

922
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,860
He told me to wait for the right chance

923
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
before entering Tianqi.

924
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,020
I shouldn't get myself involved

925
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,140
in their power struggle before that.

926
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,060
If we see the world as a board of weiqi

927
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,500
and Wushuang City

928
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,700
as a piece,

929
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,540
it's not our time yet.

930
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,100
I don't want to be

931
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,900
anyone's pawn.

932
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,180
I want to be the weiqi player instead.

933
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,700
I've lived in Xueyue City

934
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,580
for three months.

935
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,420
Now that we're parting ways,

936
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,180
I don't know when we'll see each other again.

937
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:26,900
Everyone,

938
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,900
the world

939
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
remains unchanged.

940
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,820
See you all again.

941
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,980
You're bidding farewell, right?

942
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,260
You should do it in front of Xueyue City's gate.

943
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,620
Why are you doing it in front of Dengtian Tower?

944
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,860
I'm carrying it through the end.

945
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,340
We're about to leave.

946
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,980
Why isn't Lian here

947
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,740
to see us off?

948
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,380
Who are you badmouthing?

949
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,580
Lian.

950
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,620
Miss Ruoyi is here too.

951
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,900
We know that you are leaving today.

952
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,460
So we came here to see you off.

953
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,100
Xiao Se,

954
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,740
are you sure you want to go?

955
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,460
I...

956
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,260
Him?

957
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,060
He's just bored

958
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,300
from doing accounts all the time.

959
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,220
That's why I'm bringing him to the hero banquet

960
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,060
so that he can take a breather.

961
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,130
We'll return once we're done.

962
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,820
Great timing.

963
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,140
I need to bring Miss Ye

964
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,260
back to the Tang Clan too.

965
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,900
Miss Ruoyi,

966
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,460
if the Tang Clan cannot cure you,

967
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,180
you can come to Lei Clan.

968
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,060
My master is...

969
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,900
The eldest disciple of the Tang Clan is here.

970
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,140
It's inappropriate for you to say that.

971
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,460
That's not what I mean.

972
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,420
I...

973
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,340
It doesn't matter.

974
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,220
By the way,

975
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,580
where's Second Master?

976
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,940
Isn't she heading there as well?

977
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,620
Hanyi said she could travel 1,000 li a day.

978
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,780
She told us to depart first.

979
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,740
She would catch up to us later.

980
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,060
All right.

981
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,940
Lian,

982
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,460
we'll head to Lei Fortress first.

983
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,220
You guys must come, okay?

984
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,380
Don't worry.

985
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,220
I'll be there to witness your victory.

986
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,060
Okay.

987
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,060
Farewell.

988
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,700
Miss Ye,

989
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,300
what do you think

990
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,780
about my junior?

991
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,060
He's full of vigor and youth.

992
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,860
Don't worry.

993
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,780
He'll return.

994
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,980
You'll be standing by his side

995
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,860
when he returns to Tianqi.

996
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:48,980
Xiao Se.

997
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,660
Here, take this.

998
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,420
Are you sure the Lei Fortress

999
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,220
is in this direction?

1000
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,860
Of course not.

1001
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,380
We're heading to Mount Wangcheng.

1002
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,820
Why are we heading to Mount Wangcheng?

1003
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,860
Naturally, we're heading there

1004
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,060
to invite the deity.

1005
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,700
Think about it.

1006
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,580
Three old friends gathering in Lei Fortress.

1007
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,260
I'm sure it'll be interesting.

1008
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,100
What is wrong with you?

1009
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,370
I was just thinking

1010
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,660
that my master,

1011
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,660
my sister,

1012
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,300
and the figure on Mount Wangcheng

1013
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,980
have been trapping themselves

1014
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,220
all these years.

1015
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,540
Actually, they're just

1016
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,260
waiting for each other

1017
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,940
to take the first step.

1018
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,100
Since I've already left the mountain,

1019
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,140
it's time

1020
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,220
for the stalemate to be broken.

1021
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,380
Zhao Yuzhen has never left the mountain

1022
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,460
all these years.

1023
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,980
Do you really think he'll leave the mountain

1024
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,380
because of a silly kid like you?

1025
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,260
Never try,

1026
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,140
never know.

1027
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,300
Fine.

1028
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,580
What do you intend to do then?

1029
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,100
Naturally,

1030
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,380
I'll spar with him.

1031
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,220
Suit yourself.

1032
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,540
[Be Open-Minded]

1033
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,580
You've left the mountain for one year.

1034
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,220
Did you have enough fun?

1035
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,140
I did.

1036
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,100
Where did you go?

1037
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,100
I went to admire the flowers in Chaisang City.

1038
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,500
I also viewed the sea in Gu City.

1039
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,460
I summoned tidal waves with a flick of my sword.

1040
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,780
All those fishermen

1041
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,500
thought

1042
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,580
I was a deity.

1043
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,340
Besides that,

1044
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,020
I also hiked Mount Kunlun.

1045
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,100
There's actually a place

1046
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,100
where the snow never melts.

1047
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,420
The world down there

1048
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,660
is so interesting.

1049
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,820
Master,

1050
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,940
it's a shame

1051
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,940
that you cannot leave the mountain.

1052
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,740
Did you forget

1053
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,500
about one more place?

1054
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,260
Xueyue City wrote to me.

1055
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,180
The one who wrote to me

1056
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,300
was Superintendent Xiao of Xueyue City.

1057
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,340
He wants us

1058
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,660
to compensate him with 800,000 silver taels.

1059
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,500
800,000...

1060
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,740
Why is he requesting money from us?

1061
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,020
In his letter,

1062
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,820
he said that a disciple of Mount Wangcheng

1063
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,780
called Li Fansong

1064
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,300
razed the Dengtian Tower to the ground

1065
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,300
which had just been renovated.

1066
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,700
Master, it was my fault.

1067
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,060
I did go to Xueyue City

1068
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,020
and challenge the Dengtian Tower.

1069
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,500
However, I wasn't the one

1070
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,380
who destroyed it.

1071
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,620
I...

1072
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,740
Of course I know

1073
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,380
it wasn't your doing.

1074
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,580
If you were this strong,

1075
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,460
I would've pawned

1076
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,020
my precious Qingxiao Sword

1077
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,700
to repay the debt for you.

1078
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,260
However,

1079
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,780
Superintendent Xiao

1080
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,460
is so mean.

1081
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,580
I think he intends

1082
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,700
to blackmail us using this opportunity.

1083
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,380
Have you met Xueyue Sword Deity?

1084
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:29,660
I have.

1085
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,540
And?

1086
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,740
I challenged her.

1087
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:32,580
What's her Sword Art?

1088
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,060
Beautiful Day.

1089
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,820
Beautiful Day?

1090
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,820
You're just as lucky as me.

1091
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,380
When I was

1092
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,380
your age,

1093
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,060
I had once witnessed
the same beautiful sword art you witnessed.

1094
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,460
Beautiful Day.

1095
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,900
