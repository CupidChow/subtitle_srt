than my eldest martial brother, Tang Lian.

91
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:46,830

The sword is lonely,

102
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,830
and so is the swordsman.

so I have to do it for him.

193
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,830
Why did you reopen the rank?

194
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,140
I want to put an end

195
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,900
to the past martial era

196
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,430
and mark a start

197
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,710
for the new martial era.

198
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,990
Interesting.

199
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,620
Mister Spear Deity, you have made it

200
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,310
to third place on the Top-Rank List this time,

201
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,190
but you're still a little behind Luo Qingyang.

202
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,740
Mister Spear Deity,

203
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,860
are you confident that you can stop him?

204
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,380
My eldest martial brother

205
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,590
has made it to second place too,

206
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,710
but when we were in Xueyue City,

207
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,740
I beat him up every day.

208
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,260
He's the Principal City Lord,

209
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,470
yet all he does is drink and make liquor every day.

210
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,230
Whenever I see someone like him,
I'll always beat them up.

211
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,070
This

212
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,860
is my tribute

213
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,900
to the City Lord of Melancholy City.

214
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,590
Melancholy City?

215
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
When Beili was founded,

216
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,230
this city

217
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,350
was once prosperous,

218
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,350
but due to climate change,
the inhabitants moved south.

219
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,660
It ended up becoming ruins.

220
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,860
People call it Melancholy City.

221
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,140
Later, the Sword Deity lived here alone,

222
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,620
and so people call it Muliang City
to show their respect.

223
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,860
He guards this city all on his own.

224
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,830
This kind of spirit

225
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,260
is truly admirable.

226
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,230
He's here.

227
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,190
Let's go.

228
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,990
He has no intention of leaving the city.

229
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,430
How do you know that?

230
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,710
The sword thoughts on his scabbard

231
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,830
told me that.

232
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,230
This is really a duel

233
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,860
between masters of the Top-Rank List.

234
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,230
I can never

235
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:55,900
get it.

236
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:56,900
But I haven't

237
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,620
delivered my gift yet.

238
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,230
You can follow his example.

239
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,110
Throw the liquor over to him.

240
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,310
I'll give it a try.

241
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,260
Now that the gift has been delivered,

242
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,020
I should get going.

243
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,660
So this is Ji Ruofeng's daughter,

244
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,740
the new successor of Baixiao Sect.

245
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,140
And the new White Tiger.

246
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,950
Sir, here's your tea.

247
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,310
Does it rain a lot here?

248
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:58,860
Yes.

249
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,620
It often rains here,

250
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,380
especially in this season.

251
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,230
Sometimes,

252
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,380
it rains for two weeks.

253
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,380
Do you come

254
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,540
from far away, sir?

255
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,070
Yes.

256
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,190
I have two homes,

257
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,350
both in faraway places.

258
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,350
What brings

259
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,140
you here then?

260
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,380
To kill someone.

261
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,380
Sir,

262
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,190
that's very funny.

263
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,190
Waiter,

264
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,020
do you have liquor here?

265
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,070
Yes,

266
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,740
but it's not the shop's.

267
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,660
It's the liquor

268
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,380
I kept for myself.

269
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,230
Can I buy it from you?

270
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,380
I'll pay you three times the original price.

271
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,380
It's just common liquor.

272
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,660
That's very generous.

273
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,950
Please wait a moment.

274
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,190
Sir, here's your liquor.

275
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:13,740
What is the name of this liquor?

276
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,500
This jug of liquor is worth only ten copper coins.

277
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,430
There is no name.

278
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,310
It's just homemade plain liquor.

279
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,740
Plain liquor?

280
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,710
I've always heard them talk about it.

281
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,900
I wonder if the liquor here

282
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,310
is the same as those

283
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:28,950
in Snowfall Villa.

284
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,310
Snowfall Villa?

285
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,540
What place is that?

286
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,190
I don't know either.

287
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:37,950
One of them said

288
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,110
it was an elegant manor

289
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,190
with snow falling in front of it
and flowers flying at the back,

290
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,020
and the other said

291
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,310
it was a wrecked inn,

292
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,350
which is just a little bigger

293
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,190
than your tea shop.

294
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,260
There was leakage everywhere

295
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,740
and holes in the roof.

296
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,540
Waiter,

297
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,260
I've reserved

298
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,310
this tea shop for now.

299
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,830
Come back

300
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,590
four hours later.

301
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:05,540
Sir,

302
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,620
what do you mean?

303
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,470
Did you forget

304
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,190
what I just said?

305
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,830
I'm here

306
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,070
to kill someone.

307
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,190
Leave now

308
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,990
before it's too late.

309
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,230
Tang Lian.

310
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,470
Do you know

311
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,350
what the real power of the real Heart Sword is?

312
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,830
The real power of it

313
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,070
is it can command all swords.

314
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,070
All your swords are afraid of me.

315
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,260
So, of course you are no match for me.

316
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,430
All right.

317
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,740
I've shown all my cards.

318
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,020
Isn't it time

319
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,470
for you to show your cards too?

320
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,660
I've been looking forward

321
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,660
to your Wushuang Sword Box.

322
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,500
Master.

323
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,660
Half-step Insouciant Phase.

324
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,590
Half-step Sword Deity?

325
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:05,990
What are you doing here?

326
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,350
Have you no shame?

327
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,260
You brat, mind your mouth.

328
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,780
Maybe you shouldn't be

329
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,540
called Wushuang City.

330
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,020
You should change it to

331
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,540
Shameless City.

332
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,500
At first, you were ganging up on me.

333
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,780
I was outnumbered.

334
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,310
I can let that slide.

335
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,780
But even your former city lord
is here to fight me now.

336
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,780
You're bullying a kid. Do you have no shame?

337
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,620
City Lord Song,

338
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,780
you are a few years older

339
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,710
than my master.

340
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,020
And you

341
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,260
want to draw your sword on me?

342
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,070
All I can practice
is theories inside the sword hut,

343
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,230
and I can only put them into use outside.

344
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,310
I've stayed in my hut for too long.

345
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,990
I haven't made any improvement.

346
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,660
That's why I left my city and came here today.

347
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:52,950
Are you saying

348
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,620
that you want to forge your path

349
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,190
with my blood?

350
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,860
My surname is Lei, Lei of the Lei Fortress.

351
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,740
You know

352
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,060
we are powerful.

353
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,060
We don't get intimidated easily.

354
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,060
I heard

355
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,230
that when you were young,

356
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,470
you struck your sword toward the sky.

357
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,540
It was so beautiful

358
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,820
that even the migrating swallows

359
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,190
turned back

360
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,950
and flew around

361
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,780
the residual sword qi,

362
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,230
hovering above it.

363
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,020
That's why your name is Song Yanhui,
which means the return of the swallows.

364
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,820
But after what I just saw,

365
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,780
I'm really disappointed.

366
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,500
You!

367
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,020
When a swordsman

368
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,950
forgets the reason for drawing his sword,

369
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,820
he loses the heart of the sword.

370
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,100
How can a person who has lost the heart of a sword

371
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,630
become a sword deity?

372
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,670
City Lord Song,

373
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,430
do you remember

374
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,190
the reason for drawing your sword?

375
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,430
The reason for drawing my sword?

376
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,820
Back then,

377
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,670
you swung your sword at me.

378
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,230
You made me realize

379
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,780
that the reason I drew my sword is to protect.

380
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,300
Today,

381
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,990
I shall return what you gave me.

382
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,500
If you want to become a sword deity,

383
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:26,870
perhaps you will

384
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,710
have to start learning from drawing the sword.

385
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,870
Just one swing

386
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,540
to determine victory.

387
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,430
You're too arrogant.

388
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,470
I'm still young.

389
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,870
I can afford to be arrogant.

390
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,340
Master!

391
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,670
When one practices

392
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,430
sword techniques for the sake of practicing,

393
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,780
he loses the soul of the sword.

394
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,740
I'm leaving the city today.

395
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,020
Why must you leave the city?

396
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,430
To practice sword techniques.

397
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,020
Can't you practice it in Wushuang City?

398
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,150
Why do you have to go outside of the city?

399
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,020
Because there is injustice outside the city.

400
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,500
I will draw my sword for injustice,

401
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,230
for all the people of the world,

402
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,260
and for all the people

403
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,500
who are suffering.

404
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,230
You are right.

405
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,540
All these years,

406
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,230
I only draw my sword

407
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,150
because I want to win Xueyue City.

408
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,740
I have forgotten all those things.

409
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,470
Master,

410
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:23,670
should we go after him?

411
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,150
No.

412
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,340
We can't catch up with him anymore.

413
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,780
[Tianqi]

414
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,180
[Tianqi]

415
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,340
[Luo City Army]

416
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,260
How many more men can you kill?

417
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,020
300? 500?

418
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,340
Or 1,000?

419
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,900
I don't want to kill anyone,

420
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,900
but if you don't withdraw your troops,

421
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,820
then I'll kill as many as I can.

422
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,860
You are very strong,

423
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,860
but you've underestimated

424
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,140
the strength of the Luo City Army.

425
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,540
Today,

426
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,980
we shall

427
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,300
fight you till the end.

428
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:04,980
It's Ye Battalion!

429
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,780
Charge!

430
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,980
Kill!

431
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,100
Oh, no. They're going to charge
and break our formation.

432
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,620
Line up for defense!

433
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Attack!

434
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,820
Will many more die in the future?

435
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,380
Yes.

436
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,820
This is war.

437
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,660
The faster and quicker you win,

438
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,900
the fewer people will die.

439
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,060
It's not about killing the enemy,

440
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,580
it's about

441
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,300
winning the war.

442
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,340
All right.

443
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,180
Let's win it fast then.

444
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,340
You really like Chuhe, don't you?

445
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,260
His name is Xiao Se.

446
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,940
You again.

447
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,820
I thought there would be

448
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,300
a large troop here to stop me,

449
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,300
but you are the only one.

450
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,980
I heard that in the past few years,

451
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,300
although you couldn't use
your inner force anymore,

452
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,580
you never stopped

453
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,940
the practice of staff skills.

454
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,460
I've been waiting for this day.

455
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,940
This day?

456
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,780
A day for a rematch.

457
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,340
Don't bluff.

458
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,940
Your meridians have just been reshaped.

459
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,100
Your power is just

460
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,900
at the Carefree Phase, at most.

461
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,540
How are you going to fight me?

462
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,900
There will be no one to save you today.

463
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,980
I don't need others to save me.

464
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,660
You're at Sturdy Phase,
you think you can take me down?

465
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,060
Very well.

466
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,900
After these years of honing your skills,

467
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,260
you are indeed much stronger than back then.

468
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,300
You are good enough to fight with me.

469
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,300
Perhaps you would wonder

470
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,900
why you had not encountered any obstacles

471
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,380
on your way back to Tianqi.

472
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:47,780
That's because

473
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,100
someone stopped them for you,

474
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,580
and they

475
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,580
couldn't stop me.

476
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,180
It's a pity

477
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,180
that I don't want to kill you yet

478
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,300
because my disciple

479
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,620
wants to have

480
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,820
a fairer duel with you.

481
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,900
I look forward to the day

482
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,420
when you become a true master.

483
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,260
When that day comes,

484
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,420
I will come back to kill you.

485
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,660
The eldest martial disciple of Xueyue City,

486
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,860
you're just as I heard.

487
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,620
Black Tortoise of Tianqi's Four Guardians,

488
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,180
the guardian of the North,

489
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,460
that's who I came here as.

490
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,100
I heard that despite your young age,

491
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,780
you have already mastered

492
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,980
the best hidden weapon technique
of the Tang Clan,

493
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Fatal Blossom Shower.

494
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,380
It would be an honor

495
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,940
to see it today.

496
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,900
I'm from the Tang family,

497
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,220
but I'm here for the Xiao family today.

498
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,660
I didn't bring any hidden weapons.

499
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,660
All I have

500
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,780
are my fists

501
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,580
and these seven cups of liquor.

502
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,140
Dubhe, Merak, Phecda,

503
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,660
Megrez, Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid.

504
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,460
The Seven Starry Nights.

505
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,580
Insouciant Phase.

506
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,460
This is good liquor.

507
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,100
These are the real Hanging Heaven
and Distant Seas.

508
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,180
Those were

509
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,380
just children's plays.

510
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,740
I traveled around the world when I was younger.

511
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,020
I have seen the spectacles of the world.

512
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,300
I have sung all the songs of the world

513
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,780
and met a man who had no regrets.

514
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,660
I also had a dream of ten years.

515
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,060
I saw blood and bones everywhere.

516
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,300
Heroes drew their swords and shouted!

517
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:44,940
Yes.

518
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,540
[Tianqi]

519
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,660
Chuhe.

520
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:05,900
Uncle.

521
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,180
You're back.

522
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,620
I haven't seen the city yet.

523
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,540
Make way for him!

524
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,940
He is still the same as back then,

525
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,740
like an untamed wild horse.

526
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,100
Only now the pony has grown up.

527
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,460
I think no one

528
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,420
can control him anymore.

529
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:30,900
Your Highness,

530
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,300
a group is approaching.

531
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,260
How many of them?

532
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,380
Sounds like

533
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,500
a few hundred people.

534
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,460
Why are there so many people here?

535
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,060
How much further?

536
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:44,860
Less than a li.

537
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,260
Get all troops on alert.
Get prepared to face the enemy.

538
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,100
Stay alert!

539
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,100
Your Highness.

540
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,300
Like father,

541
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,340
like daughter indeed, Miss Ye.

542
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,540
I have always heard that you are weak,

543
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,180
that you couldn't even stand for a long time.

544
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,220
I didn't expect to see you

545
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,300
to be as imposing as your father

546
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,620
when you rode the horse.

547
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:17,940
You flatter me, Your Highness.

548
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,020
I left Tianqi without permission this time,

549
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,660
please forgive me.

550
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,420
Never mind.

551
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,020
You and Chuhe

552
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,380
are best friends who grew up together.

553
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,340
I trust you.

554
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,380
Are you implying

555
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,980
that you don't trust my father?

556
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,900
Your Ye Battalion is called

557
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,100
the Tiger and Wolf Battalion,

558
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,380
and your father is the head of the Tiger and Wolf.

559
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,300
It's a pity that we can work together

560
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,140
to conquer the world,

561
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,220
but we can't trust each other completely.

562
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,500
I assume we're here

563
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,340
for the same man.

564
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,020
Your father and I made a deal

565
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,460
to see who could get him

566
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,740
after a year.

567
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,220
You are still

568
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,140
thinking about that?

569
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,740
Looks like this girl from Xueyue City

570
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,420
has been through

571
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,740
a great battle.

572
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,700
What's the matter? You ran into an enemy?

573
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,660
Luo City Army isn't strong enough

574
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,020
to be considered an enemy.

575
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,980
You are quite arrogant.

576
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,500
I guess you've fended off

577
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,140
a group of enemies for him.

578
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,060
On our way here from Tianqi,

579
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,340
we haven't really done anything.

580
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,780
We are in no position
to compete over him with you.

581
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,300
I suppose you understand,

582
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,370
right, Miss Ye?

583
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,580
Yes, I understand.

584
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,020
None of us can get him

585
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,140
because he won't listen to us.

586
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,420
But we can support him.

587
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,700
Just like what we are doing now.

588
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,500
We are chasing after him.

589
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:30,540
Come on.

590
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,660
Let's go back to Tianqi.

591
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:36,620
Young Lady,

592
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,860
should we go after them?

593
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,660
We will follow them until the gate of Tianqi City,

594
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,700
then, you all can turn back.

595
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,020
Yes, Young Lady.

596
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,820
Ye,

597
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,980
you don't trust Marquis Lanyue?

598
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:45,700
Qianluo,

599
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,300
don't simply trust people from Tianqi City.

600
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Especially those

601
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,820
from the imperial family.

602
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,380
Miss Ruoyi,

603
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,860
are you going to Tianqi?

604
00:31:59,540 --> 00:31:59,940
Of course.

605
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,220
What are the odds?

606
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,580
I'm going to Tianqi too.

607
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,660
How about we travel together?

608
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,620
Well, well, Lei Wujie,

609
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,500
didn't you see me here?

610
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,500
You only greeted Ye

611
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,580
but not me.

612
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,220
Qianluo,

613
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,380
I've just escaped

614
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,180
from Wushuang City's men.

615
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,050
Please cut me some slack.

616
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,020
Wushuang City?

617
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,540
Lord Bai made a move too?

618
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,940
Yes,

619
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,260
but they probably

620
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,340
only wanted to stop him.

621
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,900
They don't intend to kill him.

622
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,260
Everyone is here.

623
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,780
Tang Lian should've departed too.

624
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,500
I wonder where he is.

625
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,940
There is no need to worry about him.

626
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,140
With him here,

627
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,780
every problem can be solved.

628
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:40,980
We just need

629
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,060
to wait for him in Tianqi.

630
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,540
Qianluo has got

631
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,220
a very good point.

632
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,100
Everyone knows how reliable

633
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,980
the eldest martial disciple of Xueyue City is.

634
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,620
We will see him in Tianqi City.

635
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,380
You have two cups of liquor left.

636
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,300
But there's only

637
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,060
one of you left.

638
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,220
I can see

639
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,580
that you have no strength left.

640
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,740
You have one last cup left,

641
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,300
but I don't think

642
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,460
you will drink it anymore.

643
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,020
Won't I?

644
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,700
This is the first time

645
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,140
I've seen such incredible liquor,

646
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,020
but I know

647
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,700
if you drink another cup,

648
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,820
you will die.

649
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,020
But if I don't drink,

650
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,620
how can I live?

651
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,140
You can go your own way, and I will go mine.

652
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,940
Some of you are dead,

653
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,100
and some are maimed.

654
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,020
They are incompetent.

655
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,420
As assassins,

656
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,060
they failed to kill and were killed by others.

657
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,060
They have nothing to complain about.

658
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
You people from Dark River

659
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,940
can be really coldhearted.

660
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,980
But what makes you think

661
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,660
you can negotiate terms with Xueyue City?

(Lian,)

686
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,980
your mother and I are going away today.

687
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,100
Take good care

688
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,140
of yourself in Tang Clan.

689
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,140
Father,

690
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,660
where are you going?

691
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,100
A place far away,

692
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,620
but we will

693
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,620
come back a year later.

694
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,460
All right.

695
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,420
Father, Mother,

696
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,180
why aren't you back yet?

697
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,780
I can't hang in there anymore.

698
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:28,820
Is your name Tang Lian?

699
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,980
Yes, my name is Tang Lian.

700
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,900
Every year on this day,

701
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,300
you are here waiting for someone.

702
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,980
It's been three years.

703
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,780
My parents

704
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,300
said they would be back a year later.

705
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,580
Your parents

706
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,500
aren't coming back.

707
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:58,820
You

708
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,620
will live with me from now on.

709
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,900
I'm Tang Lianyue,

710
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,260
and I am now your master.

711
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:15,940
Father,

712
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:16,980
Mother,

713
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:18,940
were you also

714
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,380
lying in a place

715
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,380
where no one knew

716
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,940
and dying

717
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,420
like me?

718
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,740
Would you like

719
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,660
a cup of liquor to warm you up?

720
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,300
Lying here in the rain,

721
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,060
you must be freezing.

722
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,220
Want to drink it?

723
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,620
Why don't you want it?

724
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,500
If you came to humiliate me,

725
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,220
I'd advise you to give up.

726
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,380
You're just like Tang Lianyue described,

727
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,620
you're a rock.

728
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,060
You will have one more master from now on.

729
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,820
I'm Baili Dongjun.

730
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,660
You are Baili Dongjun?

731
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:47,500
Yes.

732
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,940
I'm Baili Dongjun,

733
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:50,780
who is even stronger

734
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:51,980
than Tang Lianyue.

735
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:56,980
Lian,

736
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,180
once you leave,

737
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,140
how long will it be
before we see each other again?

738
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,340
I...

739
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,180
We only see each other

740
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,060
when there is an assignment.

741
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,700
When there isn't,

742
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,540
it's as if I don't exist.

743
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,300
Is it that in your heart

744
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,980
I don't matter at all?

745
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,340
No.

746
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,380
It's just that I...

747
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,260
In front of others,

748
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,500
you are the eldest martial brother
who carries a lot of responsibilities.

749
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,610
Why is it

750
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,100
that you stutter whenever you speak to me?

751
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,460
Are you afraid that I will swallow you?

752
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,380
Master Lianyue told me

753
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,980
to wait for someone in Xueyue City.

754
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,060
And I will protect this someone

755
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,460
when he tries to finish a very important mission.

756
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,780
It's just that this mission can be very dangerous.

757
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,300
I'm afraid...

758
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:54,980
I'm afraid that I would implicate you.

759
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,340
But I'm not afraid of being implicated.

760
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,180
Rui,

761
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,060
I will come back to you.

762
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:11,900
By then,

763
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,220
I won't be here as Xueyue City's
eldest martial disciple

764
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,050
or the Tang Clan's disciple.

765
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,500
I will come to you as Tang Lian.

766
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,260
When?

767
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:22,820
When I complete

768
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,860
the mission given by my master.

769
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,580
I wish I could drink

770
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,340
