I wouldn't dare to.

42

I just think

that you have more important things to do.

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,830
These people are funny.

191
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,830
When they want to do something big,

192
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,560
they choose to do it in this gambling house.

193
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,680
Qianjin Gambling House is well located.

194
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,870
It's surrounded by small streets.

195
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,280
The streets are narrow and crowded.

196
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,920
If they try

197
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,750
to mobilize soldiers around

198
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,990
for a siege,

199
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,320
it will inevitably cause chaos.

200
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,990
No one would want to do that.

201
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,350
That's why Baixiao Sect chose this place.

202
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,830
A felon is being offered for sale

203
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,750
in the gambling house,

204
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,560
while everyone outside is trying to catch him.

205
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,870
Baixiao Sect only cares about

206
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,400
the conduct of the Three-Party Meeting.

207
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,280
He will choose

208
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,920
whoever

209
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,680
is fully prepared

210
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,990
to save his life.

211
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,920
That person's perfect preparation

212
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,470
must have one thing,

213
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,680
that is, he can leave

214
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,960
Qianjin Gambling House safely.

215
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,110
Chong, you're here.

216
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,870
I guessed it right.

217
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
You are here too.

218
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,080
You look so calm.

219
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,320
You must have confidence that you would beat me.

220
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Lord Chi,

221
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,510
please.

222
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,080
Chong,

223
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,200
I will go first then.

224
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,470
I had already guessed

225
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,680
that you

226
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,040
are behind this,

227
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,920
but I didn't expect

228
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,710
that you would

229
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,470
be here in person, Eunuch Jade Deity.

230
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,630
Even though it's Baixiao Sect's

231
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,920
Three-Party Meeting

232
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,080
and everyone's attendance
will be kept confidential,

233
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,510
you've got

234
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,510
a lot of nerves.

235
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,230
I never intend

236
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,230
to hide my identity.

237
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,400
After this,

238
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,470
if Jinyan is safe,

239
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,920
I will ask His Majesty to punish me.

240
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,280
I will resign from all official positions

241
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,750
and go to guard the mausoleum.

242
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,510
Even if His Majesty wants to execute me,

243
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,400
I won't say a word of complaint.

244
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,160
How

245
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,830
loyal of you.

246
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,710
Let's cut to the chase.

247
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,230
Jinyan

248
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,710
just wants to stay alive.

249
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,630
He will trade for the protection of his life

250
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,680
with the list he possesses.

251
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,200
Can you protect him,

252
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,680
Your Highness?

253
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,400
So, he just wants to stay alive?

254
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,320
You don't want to go to the mausoleum

255
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,080
and guard it until you are old.

256
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,830
You can't let go of the power you have today.

257
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,230
If you become a commoner,

258
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,830
you can still be powerful
in the martial arts world.

259
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,080
Those powerful people

260
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,710
will still kneel at your feet

261
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,470
to butter you up.

262
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,990
You are the Director of Seal.

263
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,590
You deserve more.

264
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,280
Why do you just want to stay alive?

265
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,110
It's not enough.

266
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,510
I can give you more.

267
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,920
As long as

268
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
you give me the list,

269
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,960
I will keep you alive for a year.

270
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,320
What about

271
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,280
a year later?

272
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,320
You will get your power back.

273
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

274
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,200
Please wait outside.

275
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,560
How sure are you of making this happen?

276
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,680
Ninety percent.

277
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
What about the other ten percent?

278
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,510
Eunuchs,

279
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,710
you both made the wrong choice.

280
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,680
There are

281
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,710
no absolutes in the world.

282
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,560
Jinyan,

283
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,230
you've told so many lies.

284
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,710
How can you not tell

285
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,040
when people are lying to you?

286
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,830
Miss Ji,

287
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,280
please ask Lord Bai to come in.

288
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,680
Farewell.

289
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,710
Your Highness,

290
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,920
Jinyan committed a crime

291
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,200
and deserves to be executed,

292
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,870
but I'm a little selfish.

293
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,590
I want to help him stay alive.

294
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,510
I can grant that.

295
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,200
Do you have any other questions?

296
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,560
I'd like to know

297
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,750
how you will keep him alive.

298
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,510
First of all,

299
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,990
he needs to hand over the list.

300
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,040
Then, we will take away
all his martial arts skills,

301
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
and he'll be thrown into the Heavenly Prison.

302
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,750
I promise you

303
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,080
that he won't be abused in prison.

304
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,280
He will be served two meals a day

305
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,560
and won't need to do any work.

306
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,830
However,

307
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,830
he can't leave his cell.

308
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,080
He won't have cellmates.

309
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,320
The guards won't talk to him either.

310
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,800
Although his life will be a bit boring,

311
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,040
there is also something to look forward to.

312
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,560
If there is a new emperor's wedding

313
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,510
or a natural disaster,

314
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,320
an amnesty will be announced.

315
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
As he is a traitor,

316
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,080
he is not within the scope of the amnesty,

317
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,630
but he turned himself in.

318
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,040
Besides, he offered to hand in the list

319
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,320
to help me investigate the case.

320
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,280
I will convince my father.

321
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,320
This is

322
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,510
how

323
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,960
you will keep me alive?

324
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,710
As long as it is stated

325
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,350
in their written judgment,

326
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,040
the prisoners
in the Heavenly Prison will remain alive.

327
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,160
How sure are you of making this happen?

328
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,750
Nearly 100 percent.

329
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,350
Why nearly?

330
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,040
You should know

331
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
that

332
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,830
there is no absolute in the world.

333
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
If someone tells you

334
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,040
he's 100 percent sure,

335
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,280
he must be lying then.

336
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,200
If you believe him,

337
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,200
you will all die.

338
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,470
I see.

339
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

340
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,160
I have one last thing

341
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,630
to say to you, Eunuch Jade Deity.

342
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,040
If you choose someone else,

343
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,470
then I am 100 percent sure

344
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,510
that I will kill Jinyan.

345
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,830
I'm leading the Court of Judicature
to investigate the case.

346
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,870
The Court of Judicature

347
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,200
never lets any prisoner get away.

348
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,870
Even if they flee to the corners of the earth,

349
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,350
we will hunt them down.

350
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,230
I have no doubt

351
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,560
that someone has the ability

352
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,750
to take Jinyan away from Tianqi.

353
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,400
However,

354
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,470
for the rest of his life, Jinyan will be hunted

355
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,200
by the Court of Judicature.

356
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,160
Chong, you're out.

357
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,120
How did it go?

358
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,550
You seem to have a lot of confidence.

359
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,990
As it's a case you are investigating,
you have more leverage than me.

360
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,880
However,

361
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,840
I've known Jinyan for a long time.

362
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,510
I know him better than you do.

363
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,750
We will choose Lord Bai.

364
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,790
I... I don't want to go to the Heavenly Prison.

365
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,680
You will only lose your martial arts skills

366
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,960
and a few years of freedom.

367
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,510
When you come out of the Heavenly Prison,

368
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,070
you can still

369
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,470
live freely.

370
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,710
They won't try

371
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,710
to kill you again.

372
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,600
And I can keep you safe.

373
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,960
But...

374
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,230
(Why do you just want to stay alive?)

375
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,680
(You deserve more.)

376
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,030
(You are the Director of Seal.)

377
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,880
(Staying alive isn't enough.)

378
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
No buts.

379
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,120
You mustn't choose Lord Chi, Xiao Yu.

380
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,840
The reason you ended up like this today

381
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,550
is that you are too greedy

382
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,880
and too obsessed.

383
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,030
You mustn't make the same mistake.

384
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,120
I know. I know, but...

385
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,310
But

386
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,160
I don't want to go to the Heavenly Prison.

387
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,870
Heavenly Prison.

388
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,540
This is the only ending you can offer him.

389
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,910
He knows that place

390
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,710
better than many people.

391
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,060
It's daytime.

392
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,950
You two seem free and comfortable.

393
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,340
What are you doing in a gambling house

394
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,060
when you're supposed to work?

395
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,020
Xiao Chuhe,

396
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,990
what are you doing here?

397
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,060
Since I'm here in the gambling house,

398
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,910
I'm going to join the game, of course.

399
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,500
One of you threatened him,

400
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,910
the other tempted him,

401
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,710
while I am going to do a different thing.

402
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,540
What different thing?

403
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,060
I am going to flip the table.

404
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,630
Calm down, Eunuch Jade Deity.

405
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,020
It's me.

406
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,820
I don't think

407
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,950
we have the name of Lord Yong'an on our list.

408
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,540
But your list

409
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,540
includes Baixiao Sect.

410
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,260
And Baixiao Sect

411
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,670
can be represented

412
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,500
by Lord Yong'an.

413
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,060
That's right.

414
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,190
A felon like you

415
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,670
is meeting with a prince

416
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,430
and the acting minister
of the Court of Judicature.

417
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,230
You sure are bold.

418
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,340
But I get it.

419
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,190
You have got nothing to lose now.

420
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,500
Only a few people can help you.

421
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,780
There is only one thing you want now,

422
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,950
and that is, to live, right?

423
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,020
Your Highness,

424
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,580
what do you propose?

425
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,230
You don't have to go to the Heavenly Prison.

426
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,820
And you won't be hunted
by the Court of Judicature anymore.

427
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,950
You can live your life happily.

428
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,060
Can you

429
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,500
make that happen, Your Highness?

430
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,390
Of course not.

431
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,500
Why don't you just cut to the chase, Your Highness?

432
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
You are very smart indeed,

433
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,150
Eunuch Jade Deity.

434
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,710
I can't make that happen,

435
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,230
but it can.

436
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,540
What is this?

437
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,950
This is the edict that exonerates you.

438
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,630
Take a good look at it.

439
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,300
[Exempt from execution,
a lighter sentence for Jinyan.]

440
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,670
Looks like

441
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,630
His Majesty sent you here.

442
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,870
Jinyan is the Director of Seal.

443
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,780
You should know

444
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,150
the seal on it best, right?

445
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,300
I want you to see His Majesty with me.

446
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,300
Take your most precious thing

447
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,430
that everyone outside wants with you.

448
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,150
Looks like they were all wrong.

449
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,100
There is really

450
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,150
someone in this world

451
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,580
who can give Jinyan 100 percent of hope,

452
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,990
and he's not lying.

453
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,710
They did not expect him

454
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,740
to come forward.

455
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,540
Eunuch Jade Deity,

456
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,150
you are trying to make a choice?

457
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,630
That's good.

458
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,060
I love a scene like this.

459
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,390
Once in the game,

460
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,430
I will make sure

461
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,390
to leave the other players with no choice.

462
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,990
We choose you.

463
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,300
As expected of you, Eunuch Jade Deity,

464
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,190
you never disappoint me.

465
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,580
Then let's depart now.

466
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,260
Can you

467
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,100
take us

468
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,300
into the palace safely, Your Highness?

469
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,670
Behind me,

470
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,820
I have a talented young swordsman

471
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,390
and a future female spear deity.

472
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,820
Tiger Soldiers are waiting by the door.

473
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,820
Plus Baixiao Sect's guards.

474
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,340
Is this not enough?

475
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

476
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,740
Don't mention it.

477
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,820
Everyone,

478
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,500
I won the game.

479
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:58,990
Thank you.

480
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,260
Everyone,

481
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,340
Jinyan has chosen

482
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,670
Lord Yong'an.

483
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,870
As promised before,

484
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,150
please leave

485
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,060
Qianjin Gambling House for now.

486
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,230
Don't come

487
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,950
near here again for a day.

488
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,710
Xiao Chuhe!

489
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,300
Don't yell out my name.

490
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,260
What did you offer them?

491
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,740
Would you believe me

492
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,390
if I said I had given him

493
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:38,820
the edict of exoneration?

494
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,950
I have to admit

495
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,150
that you always think one step ahead of me.

496
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,870
You are better than I am on this.

497
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,020
I've assigned

498
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,950
the case to Chong.

499
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,710
You assigned the case to Chong

500
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,150
because

501
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,340
you need to do this

502
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,710
to appease the Imperial Court and commoners.

503
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,670
But what if

504
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,390
Chong really finds him

505
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,910
and presents the list?

506
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,300
How will you deal with it then?

507
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,540
Are you going to read out the names

508
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,190
in front of the officials

509
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,780
and punish them?

510
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,950
What do you need?

511
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,820
I need a secret edict.

512
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,300
A secret edict

513
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,500
that can exempt Jinyan from execution.

514
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,500
Xiao Se,

515
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,180
why didn't His Majesty

516
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,790
just give the exoneration edict to Lord Bai?

517
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,020
Lord Bai is the acting minister
of the Court of Judicature now.

518
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,310
His every move is being watched.

519
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,150
If Father had given it to him directly,

520
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,750
it would have been

521
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,300
like revealing his selfish concern.

522
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,350
And an emperor's selfish concern

523
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,980
must not be known by others.

524
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,220
I get it now.

525
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,910
To avoid criticism,

526
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,150
His Majesty has to

527
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,150
assign someone
to investigate the matter openly,

528
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,350
but he also wants to get

529
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,060
the petition in secret first.

530
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,460
So, you went to him

531
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,780
and asked for that secret edict.

532
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,300
I am the only one in the world

533
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,050
who dares to speculate the Emperor's mind.

534
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,670
And I'm the only one who dares to say it to him.

535
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,740
Like father, like son,

536
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,950
you are both cunning foxes.

537
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,870
So have we achieved our goal?

538
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,260
One more step to go.

539
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,300
I believe that person is about

540
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,830
to lose his patience and make a move.

541
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,630
This time,

542
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,670
I will make sure Xiao Yu lose
one of his right-hand men.

543
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,780
Eunuchs,

544
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,300
you are still as cautious as ever.

545
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,870
I've offered so much help,

546
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,220
yet you still want to travel at night.

547
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,700
You misunderstood me, Your Highness.

548
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,910
I'm just used

549
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,110
to traveling at night.

550
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,020
Are you coming with us too, Eunuch Jade Deity?

551
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,590
I'm untalented.

552
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,740
I just want to give you one more helping hand.

553
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,150
Thank you for your help then.

554
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,950
Songyu Street is right in front.

555
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,590
I can feel

556
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,980
that the aura here

557
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,060
can be described with these words,

558
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,020
demons and spirits.

559
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,950
Right description, Eunuch Jade Deity.

560
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,390
Why did you

561
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,540
make it sound so scary?

562
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,460
Is it scary?

563
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,190
You've killed

564
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,300
a lot of people in your life.

565
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,740
Do you know

566
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,870
how much fear

567
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,870
these people felt before they died?

568
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,870
At this point,

569
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,950
stop lecturing me.

570
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,020
I know I'm sinful.

571
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,590
I'm sinful,

572
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:19,740
but

573
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,590
I still want to live.

574
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,060
Someone has put out knockout gas.

575
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,740
Who are you?

576
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,150
Someone who wants you dead.

577
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,780
I recognize you.

578
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
You're Grand Preceptor Dong Zhu's

579
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,540
guard.

580
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,260
Is the Grand Preceptor on the list too?

581
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,220
Darn it.

582
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,460
I will leave

583
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,500
the rest to you, Lord Yong'an.

584
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,700
Be careful.

585
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:31,950
Director of Seal,

586
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,350
are you feeling honored

587
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,700
to be escorted into the city by me?

588
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,540
Your Highness,

589
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,150
thank you for your hard work.

590
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,950
Your martial arts skills have improved a lot

591
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,390
compared to the past, Your Highness.

592
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,910
If you hadn't destroyed

593
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,830
my hidden pulse,

594
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,110
I wouldn't have improved so much.

595
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,740
Sounds like

596
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
you owe me a thank you,

597
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,630
Your Highness.

598
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,630
To repay the favor,

599
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,220
I will destroy

600
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,500
your hidden pulse today then.

601
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,390
Jinxuan!

602
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,190
Go now.

603
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,630
The Art of Detachment?

604
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,870
You killed Jinyu?

605
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,780
So what if I did?

606
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,390
You...

607
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,590
An edict from His Majesty!

608
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,350
Lord Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe,

609
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,110
is summoned to the palace.

610
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,630
Greetings, Father.

611
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,060
Your Majesty.

612
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,590
I

613
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,260
deserve to die.

614
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,500
Jinyan,

615
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,910
you didn't want to guard the mausoleum,

616
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,500
so you led the Langya Army into the capital.

617
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,780
That was already a capital offense.

618
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,870
You also tried

619
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,150
to use a treasonous list

620
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,870
in your hands

621
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,630
to make my sons fight against each other.

622
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,190
How should I

623
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,740
punish you for this crime?

624
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,150
Slow

625
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:12,870
slicing.

626
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,500
Yes, slicing you until you're dead.

627
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,460
But since Chuhe

628
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,740
has told you

629
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,700
that I won't kill you,

630
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,630
I will keep my word.

631
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,980
And I won't

632
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,870
send you to the Court of Judicature.

633
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,590
Thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty.

634
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,300
Thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty!

635
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,300
Hand over

636
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,540
the petition.

637
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,150
You must really want

638
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,150
to know the names on this.

639
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:22,950
I don't want to.

640
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,630
If it was in my hands,
of course I would want to know.

641
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,300
But it's in your hands now, Father.

642
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,230
This secret

643
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,780
should only be known by one person.

644
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,740
If you want to read out the names, go on.

645
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,150
I can guess whose names

646
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,540
are on this without looking.

647
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,540
The first name

648
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,300
must be

649
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,820
Grand Preceptor Dong Zhu.

650
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,190
Father!

651
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,710
Actually,

652
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,780
most of the people on the list

653
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,540
didn't really want to rebel.

654
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,150
They just believed

655
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,150
that I couldn't go on.

656
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,020
Beili belongs to the Xiaos,

657
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,390
but it doesn't have to be mine.

658
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,910
Some of you

659
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,190
want to arrest the people on the list.

660
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,190
If you had really caught them,

661
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,300
I'm afraid

662
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,910
it would be the end of the Imperial Court then.

663
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,340
But after this,

664
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,670
no one will want to

665
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,300
get a new heir from the Xiao family

666
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,150
to inherit the throne again.

667
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,500
Thank you, Father.

668
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,230
My days are numbered.

669
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,350
There's not much I can do to help you.

670
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,270
You

671
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:18,350
need to learn to help yourselves.

672
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,620
When an emperor rules a nation,

673
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,990
he must win the hearts of the people first.

674
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,660
People's hearts are fickle.

675
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,350
Even if they are grateful

676
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,790
for your mercy this time,

677
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,950
what will happen

678
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,700
if they want to rebel again?

679
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,180
Kill them then.

680
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,580
All of them.

681
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,870
Summon Jade Deity.

682
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,830
Summon Jade Deity!

683
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:56,350
Your Majesty.

684
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,790
If I release

685
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,990
Jinyan into the martial arts world,

686
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,140
he will be taken advantage of and hunted.

687
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,430
If I send him to the Heavenly Prison,

688
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,660
I suppose

689
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,140
he will resent me.

690
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,790
I will leave him to you.

691
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,950
Jinyan, Jade Deity,

692
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,430
do you have a problem with my decision?

693
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,580
I wouldn't dare to.

694
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

695
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,100
I wouldn't dare to.

696
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,350
Such a slave.

697
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,350
Jade Deity,

698
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,220
take Jinyan away.

699
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

700
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,220
Chong'er.

701
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,220
Yes, Father.

702
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,390
About the destruction of this list,

703
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,180
find a way

704
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,390
to let the whole Tianqi City

705
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,220
know about it today.

706
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,060
Yes, Father.

707
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,620
Father,

708
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,990
I have something I need to report.

709
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,100
Go ahead.

710
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:16,870
When Tiger Soldiers

711
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,060
were escorting Jinyan,

712
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,100
Eunuch Jinxuan disobeyed your order

713
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,750
and tried to stop us.

714
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,100
Please judge this fairly, Father.

715
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,390
Jinxuan!

716
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,910
Come in!

717
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,500
Your Majesty.

718
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,700
Was what Chuhe said just now true?

719
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,540
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

720
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,390
I was trying

721
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,350
to save Jinyan before he entered the palace.

722
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,020
How...

723
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,750
How... How dare you!

724
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,430
Your Majesty,

725
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,270
I entered the palace with Jinyan

726
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,580
when we were little.

727
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,270
We're not brothers,

728
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,140
but we're closer than real brothers.

729
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,390
His mistake this time

730
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,350
is irredeemable.

731
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,790
I did have selfish intentions.

732
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,020
I wanted to save Jinyan.

733
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,180
But I would still hand over

734
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,060
the list to you, Your Majesty.

735
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,140
Director Jinxuan,

736
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,910
don't you think

737
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,580
you sounded ridiculous when you said that?

738
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,340
Father,

739
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,430
Jinxuan's actions

740
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,220
can't be justified

741
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,100
by his own selfish intentions.

742
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,910
Please give a fair judgment, Father.

743
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,350
Jinxuan,

744
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,540
starting today,

745
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,580
you are grounded at Pingxin Hall.

746
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,350
You are not allowed

747
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,310
to step foot outside without my permission.

748
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:55,870
Chong'er.

749
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,870
Father.

750
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,750
You will investigate the case of Jinxuan
leaving the palace without permission

751
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,270
and trying to take the list.

752
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,750
Yes, Father.

753
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,180
Eunuch Jinxuan

754
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,830
was Father's studying companion.

755
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,540
They grew up together.

756
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,140
You want Father to kill him.

757
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,830
It won't be that easy.

758
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,390
I know.

759
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,660
I didn't intend

760
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,580
to kill him today.

761
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,220
I'm content

762
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,950
that Father has grounded him.

763
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,340
As for what to do next,

764
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,910
I will have to count on you.

765
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,910
This is a hot potato.

766
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,990
However, compared to Director Jinxuan,

767
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,020
Eunuch Jade Deity

768
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,180
seems to be more trustworthy.

769
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,790
I never thought

770
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,790
he could go this far for Jinyan.

771
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,790
He is just a stupid man.

772
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,270
He has the ability and power,

773
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,790
yet all he wanted was to save

774
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,100
a martial brother from a different clan.

775
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,220
That's why

776
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,310
we've taken very different paths.

777
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,660
Have you taken the same path then?

778
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,390
Eunuch Jade Deity and I

779
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,350
have nothing in common either.

780
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,060
In terms of willpower,

781
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,270
I'm not as strong-willed as him.

782
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,310
What about you two then?

783
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,140
Are you now on the same page

784
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,750
because of the small favors
you did for each other?

785
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,060
Some ideas we have are the same,

786
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,140
but the paths

787
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,020
we take are completely different.

788
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:25,950
Chuhe,

789
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,790
looks like we have nothing in common too.

790
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,390
Yes.

791
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,350
We're on two different paths,

792
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,220
but our paths

793
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,350
occasionally cross,

794
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,140
and we'd walk together for a while.

795
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,620
We will eventually have to go our separate ways.

796
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:42,790
Chong,

797
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,350
the path ahead will only be more challenging.

798
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,660
Father's physical condition...

799
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,830
All diseases are curable.

800
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,830
But it's not easy to treat the illness of the heart.

801
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,020
Your Majesty,

802
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,990
do you have a deep friendship

803
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,750
with Director Jinxuan?

804
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,620
Yes.

805
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,620
Jinxuan

806
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,870
was my studying companion.

807
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,220
He

808
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,100
grew up with me.

809
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,390
That explains why you only locked him up

810
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,430
despite the grave crime he committed.

811
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,350
Being in Tianqi,

812
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,350
especially in high positions,

813
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,540
it's inevitable to make some silly mistakes.

814
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,910
Look at those people

815
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,270
I was with,

816
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,870
one by one,

817
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,060
some are dead,

818
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,020
some have left Tianqi,

819
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,310
and only Jinxuan is still here.

820
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:14,390
I

821
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,270
really don't want to kill him.

822
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:19,700
Your Majesty,

823
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,350
you are a nostalgic man.

824
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,270
Hua Jin,

825
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,100
how long do I have to live?

826
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:30,910
Your Majesty,

827
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,220
don't think about things like this.

828
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,140
You just need to trust me.

829
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,660
Of course I trust you.

830
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,540
I

831
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,220
just have a favor I need to ask.

832
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,390
What is it?

833
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,390
Extend my life

834
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,180
for a few more days

835
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,580
