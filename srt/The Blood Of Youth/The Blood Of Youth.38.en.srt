[The Blood of Youth]

24
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,940
[Episode 38]

25
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,320
I thought

26
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,790
you were a man of extraordinary stature

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,630
to have this kind of cultivation,

28
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,870
but when faced

29
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,320
with such a talented young man,

30
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,680
City Lord Luo,

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,150
why were you so determined to kill him?

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,430
I have my reasons.

33
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,830
But you can't kill

34
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,320
this person today.

35
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,350
Chong,

36
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,630
get Wushuang out of here.

37
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,160
Thank you.

38
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,160
I should thank you.

39
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:24,950
Go now.

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,070
So you are

41
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,760
Xiao Chuhe?

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,550
I heard that three days later,

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,760
you'll take a person away

44
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,550
and kill a person.

45
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,160
Am I the person you want to kill?

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,550
That's right.

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,000
But not today.

48
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,510
I've given Tianqi three days

49
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,040
to prepare for the sword fights.

50
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,880
But you're holding a staff.

51
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,320
You're not qualified for the battle.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,000
What about me?

53
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,390
The Heart Sword?

54
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,040
You're the descendant of Li Xinyue?

55
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm the disciple of Li Hanyi,
Xueyue Sword Deity of Xueyue City,

56
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,440
and Lei Hong, one of the Two Heroes

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,670
of the Lei Clan of Lei Fortress,

58
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,920
the heir of the Sword Heart Tomb's Heart Sword,

59
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,630
Lei Wujie.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm here to challenge you.

61
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,350
You fool.

62
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,510
Do you think

63
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,350
the long title will impress him?

64
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,480
Good.

65
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,600
Wait!

66
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,760
Wait for what?

67
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,600
You've fought two battles successively.

68
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,670
Besides,

69
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,830
the two opponents are strong.

70
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,760
You look completely

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,550
fine now,

72
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,600
but I'm sure

73
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,280
your physical strength is not the same

74
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,390
as it was in the beginning.

75
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,440
I'm fine.

76
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,440
Stop!

77
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,760
You wanted to go easy on me.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,230
But I can't accept it.

79
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,230
We swordsmen are sincere.

80
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,200
How can we mistreat our swords?

81
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,600
Didn't you just say

82
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,480
you'd stay in Tianqi City for a few more days?

83
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,000
Three days later,

84
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,550
after you rest up,

85
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,720
we'll come here again for a sword battle.

86
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,350
I...

87
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:02,920
Mr. Luo,

88
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,280
we'll excuse ourselves.

89
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,720
See you in three days.

90
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,480
Let's go, hurry up.

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,630
Quickly.

92
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,840
Quick.

93
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:20,990
Come on.

94
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,640
Lei Wujie, are you out of your mind?

95
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,600
How could you possibly fight him?

96
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,480
Lei,

97
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,550
you look naive and ignorant.

98
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,480
In fact, you're quite smart.

99
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,840
How so?

100
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,350
After the two exciting showdowns,

101
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,600
Lone Sword Deity's radiance

102
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,720
is outstanding among the swordsmen.

103
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,350
Lone Sword Deity was on a roll

104
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,960
and asked for a sword fight,

105
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,110
but no one came forward.

106
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,430
Yet, Lei Wujie stepped forward

107
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,870
and joked around.

108
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,110
He even made a three-day covenant with him.

109
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,960
The moment was totally ruined.

110
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,190
It caused Lone Sword Deity to fail

111
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,230
in making it look like the master

112
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,550
was seeking defeat.

113
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,280
Miss Ye knows me well.

114
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,670
What about the fight three days later?

115
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,310
Lei Wujie, what will you do?

116
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,520
I'm no match for any of the three persons

117
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,080
in the battles today.

118
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,080
Especially

119
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,040
the Lone Sword Deity, Luo Qingyang.

120
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,960
We remain far apart.

121
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,480
So you know this.

122
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,280
But he chopped off

123
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,640
Lord Yong'an's plaque with his sword.

124
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,920
He was trying to crack the whip.

125
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,750
Whether we challenge him or not,

126
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,790
he'll come to us eventually.

127
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,920
Rather than letting him start a fight,

128
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,720
why don't we take the initiative?

129
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,400
At least we can...

130
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,400
What?

131
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,110
We can make ourselves known.

132
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,790
You're such a peculiar man.

133
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,980
[Lord Bai's Residence]

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,870
You're fine.

135
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,160
It's no big deal.

136
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,040
Just get some rest.

137
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,230
Thank you, sir.

138
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,430
Mr. Xie Xuan.

139
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,750
Wushuang.

140
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,400
Wushuang.

141
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,350
These

142
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,160
are the best tonics I got

143
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,670
from Xiao Se's dispensary.

144
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,670
You know

145
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,160
how petty he is.

146
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,080
It's not easy to get these.

147
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,110
You're here to ask for advice.

148
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,990
Cut the crap.

149
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,790
Just get to the point.

150
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,600
Are you trying to ask about Luo Qingyang's sword?

151
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,350
Yes.

152
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,640
As the saying goes, know thy self,

153
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,960
know thy enemy.

154
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,920
Well, I can't make my sword technique

155
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,840
stronger than his in such a short time.

156
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,720
But

157
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,960
I have to look for his weakness

158
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,840
in his sword technique.

159
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,230
So I can start with his weakness,

160
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,160
launch a surprise attack,
and defeat him in one hit.

161
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:20,960
Okay.

162
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,790
Go ahead.

163
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,110
Here's my question.

164
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,600
From which direction

165
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,310
did his final sword attack you?

166
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,920
It was from all directions.

167
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,400
Okay.

168
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,670
Well,

169
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,790
at that time,

170
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,160
which part of his sword qi was the strongest

171
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,480
and which was the weakest?

172
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,310
It was everywhere.

173
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,960
There's nothing to say, then.

174
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,190
It was how I felt.

175
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,960
Having a sword fight

176
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,670
with Luo Qingyang is different.

177
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,820
We were standing there.

178
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,110
But it felt like

179
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,020
I was in a brand-new place.

180
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,310
That place

181
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,580
belonged to Luo Qingyang.

182
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,510
No.

183
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,950
It belonged to Luo Qingyang's

184
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,070
Nine-Song Sword Technique.

185
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,990
The wind was desolate.

186
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,700
It was a boundless field.

187
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,110
I vaguely heard

188
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,190
someone singing in my ears.

189
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,780
And for a moment, I wanted to cry.

190
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,630
This is so-called

191
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,870
the sword deity's sword tendency.

192
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,220
With a swing,

193
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,510
he can create a brand new place.

194
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,750
In that place,

195
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,220
he's the ruler.

196
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,820
Is there any way

197
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,630
to break the sword deity's sword tendency?

198
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,870
Every sword deity

199
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,780
has its own sword tendency.

200
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,580
It's like a small world.

201
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,580
If you want to break this small world,

202
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,820
instead of doing what the sword wants,

203
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,220
you have to do the other.

204
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,340
The sword tendency

205
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,340
of Lone Sword Deity gives a sense of melancholy.

206
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,630
I got it.

207
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,340
You learn fast.

208
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,140
You're quite smart.

209
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,630
What is the solution?

210
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,110
I'll scold him.

211
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,020
The sword tendency is the crucial part
of the desolate sword.

212
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,820
Once the Martyr Sword is drawn,

213
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,220
the desolate wind blows.

214
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,020
It's the time when the warriors sing.

215
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,430
This is when the tension rises.

216
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,700
I go on a rampage and yell,

217
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,140
"Luo Qingyang,

218
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,550
you old man!

219
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,750
Why did you come

220
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,900
to Tianqi City

221
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,870
for no reason?

222
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,750
What has

223
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,990
Tianqi City got to do with you?

224
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,990
Why have you

225
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,190
chosen to come at this time?

226
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,510
You held sword fights at Tianqi.

227
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,670
Did Tianqi City agree on it?

228
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,110
You even crashed the plaque.

229
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,670
Do you know how expensive the plaque is?

230
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,990
Just get lost!"

231
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:32,910
Mr. Xie Xuan.

232
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,580
As I yell at him like this,

233
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,980
do you think he'll still be able

234
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,460
to create an aura of melancholy?

235
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,860
Actually, about what you said,

236
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,030
I think

237
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,620
it's got some points.

238
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,190
Mr. Xie,

239
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,460
you don't have to

240
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,910
care about this fool's feelings.

241
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,100
Just tell the truth.

242
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,670
I'm not comforting him.

243
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,150
If we do

244
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,860
as Lei said,

245
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,100
that desolate sword tendency

246
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,150
will indeed be easily thwarted.

247
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,910
Of course.

248
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,150
You can yell at him.

249
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,500
But it only plays a supporting role.

250
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,430
It's impossible

251
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,550
to defeat a sword deity like this.

252
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,430
Don't you think?

253
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,550
By the way,

254
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,740
the Sword Heart Technique

255
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,310
of your family is about honing the sword heart.

256
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,700
If you could cultivate in seclusion for two days

257
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,220
and practice the technique
with the pure sword heart.

258
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,980
You might have a window of opportunity.

259
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,100
You're right.

260
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,550
I'm thinking about this too.

261
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,860
Well, we'll excuse ourselves.

262
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,670
Sir, please come and watch the fight

263
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,950
three days later.

264
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,670
[Snowfall Villa]

265
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,340
Xiao Se,

266
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,980
I'll name the sword technique of mine

267
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,220
as Insulting Sword Technique,

268
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,670
what do you think?

269
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:43,860
I defeat

270
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,270
the sword deity while insulting him.

271
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,740
Isn't it domineering?

272
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,460
But I don't think

273
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,190
it's domineering enough.

274
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,030
You're a good writer, help me with it.

275
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,220
Do you have any idea

276
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,790
what kind of an opponent you're facing?

277
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,500
He's the number one swordsman

278
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,820
on the Top-Rank List,

279
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,910
the one-of-a-kind master

280
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,030
who's as good as Baili Dongjun.

281
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,390
That's why I need two days

282
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,620
to focus on cultivating my sword.

283
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,820
By the way,

284
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,500
Xiao Se,

285
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,860
yesterday, I only said

286
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,150
I'd see him in three days.

287
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,740
But I didn't mention the time.

288
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,790
Whatever.

289
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,790
I'll just

290
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,070
go there in the evening

291
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,150
so that I can stall for more time

292
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,090
to cultivate my sword.

293
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,460
Do you understand what I'm saying?

294
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,430
Don't worry, I didn't lose my mind.

295
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,620
I have my sword

296
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,790
and my pride.

297
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,460
I'll go cultivate my sword heart.

298
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,430
I'll rise to fame this time.

299
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,340
Go on.

300
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,580
This way.

301
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,220
He wants to obtain the sword heart?

302
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,460
Yes.

303
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,430
Back then, Aunt Xinyue

304
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,150
once cultivated the sword for seven days.

305
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,980
At last, she made it to the execution ground alone
with her sword.

306
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,740
What are the chances
that he can win against Luo Qingyang

307
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,860
in this way?

308
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,220
Ten percent.

309
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,430
It's better than I thought.

310
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,550
Not even close.

311
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,700
Can't you finish the sentence

312
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,700
all at once?

313
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,550
Xiao Se,

314
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,500
you should talk Lei Wujie out of it.

315
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,700
Yesterday, Wushuang

316
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,190
was nearly killed by Lone Sword Deity.

317
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,620
If he knows about your relationship,

318
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,430
I'm sure he'll go even further.

319
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,100
Lei Wujie is the brother

320
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,670
of Xueyue Sword Deity, after all.

321
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,500
There are different levels

322
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,390
of closeness between the Five Sword Deities,

323
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,910
but they have compassion for one another.

324
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
In this regard,

325
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,980
I guess Luo Qingyang

326
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,390
won't kill him.

327
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,190
This silly guy

328
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,390
knew that he'd suffer.

329
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,620
Perhaps this fight

330
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,190
will do him good.

331
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,670
Ruoyi,

332
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,340
no matter how strong Luo Qingyang is,

333
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,030
he's just a human.

334
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,500
Besides, is it really that easy

335
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,790
to kill Xiao Se

336
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,460
in Tianqi City?

337
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,580
Xiao Se doesn't want others

338
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,190
to get hurt because of him.

339
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,220
Luo Qingyang is here for him.

340
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,390
Then, he should take

341
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,070
the responsibility for this war.

342
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,430
This has been his choice since childhood.

343
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,270
But

344
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,820
we can

345
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,150
have our own choices too.

346
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,310
Hanyi.

347
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,820
Why didn't you

348
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,620
inform us that you came back

349
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,310
from the Sword Heart Tomb?

350
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,430
How did I fall asleep?

351
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,030
Why do you ask me that?

352
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,220
It's getting cold.

353
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,140
Beware of catching a cold.

354
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,500
How was it?

355
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,620
How was the progress of restoring

356
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,030
your power at the Sword Heart Tomb?

357
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,220
I've got thirty percent of my power back.

358
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,430
Don't worry.

359
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,190
I barely received any news
at the Sword Heart Tomb.

360
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,070
I was worried.

361
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,220
So I'd like to stay in Xueyue City for a while.

362
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Did you dream of him?

363
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,270
If he was here now,

364
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,310
maybe things would be easier

365
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,580
for Tianqi City now.

366
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,620
After all,

367
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,100
he was the son-in-law of Xueyue City.

368
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,860
He should fight Luo Qingyang on our behalf.

369
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,860
I heard

370
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,910
that Luoxia left.

371
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,740
Luo Mingxuan suddenly confessed his love

372
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,980
to his master.

373
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,190
She, as his master,

374
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:18,910
didn't know

375
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,220
what to do at that point.

376
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,620
So she chose

377
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,220
to leave.

378
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,190
What about Luo Mingxuan?

379
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,430
He left with her.

380
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,910
She'll eventually accept him.

381
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,740
There's been love between a master and a disciple

382
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,460
in the martial arts world.

383
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,790
But

384
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,980
it's hard to be accepted.

385
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,310
In a relationship,

386
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,950
one side must be braver.

387
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,620
As long as one of them is willing to be brave,

388
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,220
they

389
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,860
will eventually end up together.

390
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,270
He was the person

391
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,790
who was braver than me.

392
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,500
Who are you referring to?

393
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,150
Luo Mingxuan

394
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,790
or Zhao Yuzhen?

395
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,550
But if it was me

396
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,500
who was the brave one,

397
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,550
would things

398
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,100
have ended up differently now?

399
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,700
Hanyi,

400
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,260
it's all in the past.

401
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,670
Stop bringing it up.

402
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,150
How are things going on in Tianqi?

403
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,550
We can't help them

404
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,100
fight Luo Qingyang this time.

405
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,030
What will happen to them?

406
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,790
I have faith in Xiao Se.

407
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,860
When he returned from Penglai Island,

408
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,390
I talked to him once.

409
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,150
He said he got a solution.

410
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,390
And this is something Luo Qingyang

411
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,700
will never think of.

412
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,620
Xiao Se.

413
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:42,790
News.

414
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,340
We got word from the military.

415
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,430
What is it

416
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,460
that makes you so panic?

417
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,030
Nanjue invaded our border.

418
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,390
They've conquered

419
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,460
three of our cities in one day.

420
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,820
What?

421
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,430
Now of all times?

422
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,550
Yes.

423
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,430
It happens now of all times.

424
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,220
Now, Lone Sword Deity

425
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,220
is in Tianqi City asking for sword fights.

426
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,490
Nanjue has invaded the border.

427
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,130
It must be Xiao Yu who plotted all of this.

428
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,650
I don't care if it's a plot.

429
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,650
I've ordered the Langya Army to be on red alert.

430
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,300
They're rushing over to the border
to fight against the enemy.

431
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,420
Unexpectedly,

432
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,250
Langya Army

433
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,340
that marched to Tianqi a while ago

434
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,010
is going to guard the country

435
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,010
on Beili's behalf.

436
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,980
I suppose

437
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,490
the old soldiers will have complaints.

438
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:33,980
It's inevitable

439
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,610
to have complaints.

440
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,130
But since Langya is carved on their armors,

441
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,530
they have to carry

442
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,890
the will of Langya.

443
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,010
These days,

444
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,250
I stayed in the military camp outside the city.

445
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,340
But I've heard

446
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,180
of the matter of Lone Sword Deity.

447
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,890
You don't have to worry about me.

448
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,580
I have a solution.

449
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,700
Are you sure?

450
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,060
I heard that the Wrathful Sword Deity

451
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,700
and the City Lord of Wushuang City

452
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,100
were defeated.

453
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,650
Yes.

454
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,420
So I'm going to the Directorate of Astronomy

455
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,610
to ask him to open
the Heavenly Sword Pavilion for me.

456
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,300
Are you going to ask for a sword?

457
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,420
That's right.

458
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,580
The people think

459
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,180
the staff technique is my only skill

460
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,340
as I'm Ji Ruofeng's disciple

461
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,610
and I inherit his Wuji Staff.

462
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,530
In fact, my sword technique

463
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,980
is better than my staff technique.

464
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,250
But even my father

465
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,820
couldn't break through

466
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,460
that Sword Pavilion.

467
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,890
Someone must give it a try.

468
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,640
You'll guard the country.

469
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,130
I'll pacify Tianqi.

470
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,650
You want to open the Heavenly Sword Pavilion?

471
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,700
Yes.

472
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,180
Sorry to trouble you.

473
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,530
Why didn't

474
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,010
your friend, Lei,

475
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,060
come today?

476
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,340
When it comes to the critical moment,

477
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,300
someone must be here to protect you.

478
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,300
Are you not willing to protect me?

479
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,460
I'm really sorry.

480
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,250
Since the fight at the celestial mountain,

481
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,380
I've suffered a severe injury.

482
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
I see.

483
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,730
Let me do it.

484
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,620
Why are you here?

485
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:15,900
State Preceptor,

486
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,220
I'll protect him when he enters

487
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
the Heavenly Sword Pavilion.

488
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,700
Sure.

489
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,380
What now?

490
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,620
You promised me

491
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,660
that you'd stay with me.

492
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,700
But now, you act alone.

493
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,620
You went back on your word.

494
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,460
Come on.

495
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,420
This way, please, Your Highness.

496
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,730
Why does this place

497
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,570
look so familiar?

498
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,010
Miss Qianluo, have you been
to the Sword Heart Tomb?

499
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,330
It looks

500
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,570
exactly like the place.

501
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,250
No wonder.

502
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,730
The late owner of the Sword Heart Tomb

503
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,530
once visited this place.

504
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,660
Then, he went back to the Sword Heart Tomb

505
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,460
and built

506
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,940
a sword pavilion that looked just like here.

507
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,180
But he didn't make that door.

508
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,010
Because even if

509
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,570
he made the door,

510
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,620
he still couldn't make the thing

511
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,140
inside the door.

512
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,730
I, Xiao Se of the Xiao family,

513
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
came to the Heavenly Sword Pavilion for a sword.

514
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,620
Please enlighten me.

515
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,010
That's it?

516
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,380
This was the sword of Princess Hualuo
a hundred years ago,

517
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,620
Falling Flowers Sword.

518
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,570
Rumor has it that when Princess Hualuo was alive,

519
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,010
she liked charming young men.

520
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,620
Hence,

521
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,330
he can gain a lot of benefits with his appearance.

522
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:13,810
Xiao Se,

523
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,420
I thought you only practiced
the staff technique.

524
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,490
I didn't know you excelled

525
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,420
in sword technique as well.

526
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,620
What is this sword technique?

527
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,090
This is the Nation-Breaking Sword Technique,

528
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,620
created by Xiao Yi, the first emperor of Beili.

529
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,980
It's only passed down
to the imperial descendants.

530
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,980
It's bold and unconstrained.

531
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,380
It's also domineering.

532
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,460
Those untalented can't practice this technique.

533
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,090
Nation-Breaking Sword Technique
contains four phases.

534
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,290
Life-Destroyer,

535
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,420
Wind-Breaker,

536
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,150
Dragon-Shocker, and Sky-Crusher.

537
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,180
Most people have spent
their lives learning this

538
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,460
but still can't reach the Life-Destroyer Phase.

539
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,900
In hundred years,

540
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,810
Lord Langya, Xiao Ruofeng, was the person
with the highest achievement

541
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,490
in this technique.

542
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,110
He reached the Wind-Breaker Phase.

543
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,910
Including Falling Flowers Sword,

544
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,670
Your Highness has obtained

545
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,870
nine swords in total.

546
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,590
Are you trying

547
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,300
to empty the Heavenly Sword Pavilion?

548
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,950
These nine swords are just a sign of good luck.

549
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,060
About the thing I want,

550
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,390
you should know better than anyone else.

551
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,540
Even Lord Langya

552
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,700
couldn't open this door

553
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
back then.

554
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,870
In terms of the sword technique,

555
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,150
I'm stronger than Uncle Langya.

556
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,220
The Dragon-Shocker Technique?

557
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,500
Xiao Se, you go in there.

558
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,780
I'll guard here.

559
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,980
Be careful.

560
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,500
Wait for my return.

561
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,670
Father?

562
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,260
It's strange, isn't it?

563
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,740
Why would you see me

564
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,540
at the Sword Pavilion?

565
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,020
The Sword Pavilion is mysterious.

566
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,630
I must've entered

567
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,950
some sort of magic array.

568
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,910
You're as calm

569
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,110
as always.

570
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,260
Judging from your healthy

571
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,830
complexion

572
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,020
and clear voice,

573
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,430
you're like the father

574
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,630
in my mind.

575
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,500
You're very smart.

576
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,260
Because I

577
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,190
am just the father

578
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,950
in your memory.

579
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,910
The father

580
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,980
you once respected

581
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,700
but hated in the end.

582
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,670
No wonder.

583
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,630
When I entered the pavilion,

584
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,500
it gave off the light fragrance of sandalwood.

585
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,350
It seems like I've fallen

586
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,830
into Inner Demon Imaginary Array.

587
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,740
So my inner demon

588
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,950
is actually you, Father.

589
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,740
The old case has been settled

590
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,780
and the past is the past.

591
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,780
Does everything

592
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,300
have really ended?

593
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,390
You still can't let go of the past.

594
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,430
Why didn't you

595
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,670
gather the courage,

596
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,060
barge into the execution ground,

597
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,740
and fall out with me on that day?

598
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,670
I do blame myself

599
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,110
because of this decision.

600
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,950
You hate me,

601
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,020
both in the past

602
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,350
and present.

603
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,630
You'll continue

604
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,460
to hate me in the future.

605
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,060
The old case has been settled.

606
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,350
Just that Lord Langya

607
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,260
will never come back again.

608
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,980
Those things you lost

609
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,060
will never come back again.

610
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,910
Kill me.

611
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,110
Kill me.

612
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,060
So you can end your resentment.

613
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,190
A life

614
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,830
for a life.

615
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,590
This is what you've always thought.

616
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,740
This is also what was in your mind

617
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,630
when you lay in the mud during a downpour

618
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,830
after you lost all of your martial arts skills.

619
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,980
No.

620
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,150
That's not true.

621
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,670
What's wrong?

622
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,350
Are you afraid?

623
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,460
I did

624
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,870
hate you so much.

625
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,740
Though you

626
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,150
have made amends now,

627
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,300
I still resent you.

628
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,670
I resent you

629
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,260
for choosing to compromise back in the day.

630
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,300
The choices my father

631
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,630
and Uncle Langya made back then

632
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,220
were for the sake of the peace of the nation.

633
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,700
It was a shame

634
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,740
that my father

635
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,670
couldn't be braver

636
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,700
to overcome

637
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,830
his inner demon

638
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,220
and save his brother.

639
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,950
What's done is done.

640
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:12,910
If I encounter

641
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,700
the same problem in the future,

642
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,540
I'll leave

643
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,460
no regrets.

644
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,060
You're going to kill me?

645
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,300
It's not my father that I want to kill

646
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,780
but my inner demon.

647
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,630
Your friends

648
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,500
died saving you.

649
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,460
How could you not

650
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,500
have regrets?

651
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:47,950
Don't do this!

652
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,670
It really is Inner Demon Imaginary Array.

653
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,460
What a shame.

654
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
You broke the door with Dragon-Shocker

655
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,700
and put the inner demon to the sword.

656
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,110
But Tianzhan Sword

657
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,350
[Sword Guardian]
still rejected you.

658
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,740
Why?

659
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,950
When you put the inner demon to the sword,

660
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,630
I saw your high aspirations,

661
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,220
but afterward,

662
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,020
you were trapped in comradeship.

663
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,390
How are you supposed

664
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,740
to follow Heaven's will

665
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,190
and pierce the sky?

666
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,390
This is what's restricting you.

667
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,190
What's restricting me.

668
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,150
The holder of Tianzhan

669
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,540
shouldn't be restricted.

670
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,300
If it really is the case,

671
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,830
then I shall reject Tianzhan.

672
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,460
Wait.

673
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,700

674
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,670

675
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,780
who made it this far.

to apprehend the sword phase.

678
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,980
The longer she holds on,

679
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,950

as it came out from here.

712
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,460
It was tough for Miss Qianluo.

713
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,060
With just a spear,

714
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,590

718
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,950
it was only half an hour in there.

719

it can never be opened again.

As you fail to obtain the sword,

724
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,460
I'm afraid you'll lose

725
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,540
your fight against Luo Qingyang.

726
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,780
This sword

727
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,830
is not meant to be mine.

728
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,630
What it reckons that is restricting me

729
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,630
is everything

730
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,430
that accompanies me along the way.

731
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,260
It is completely different

732
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,190
from what I believe in.

733
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,540
I'm better off without it.

734
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,830
Besides, I don't think

735
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,390
I can defeat Luo Qingyang

736
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,110
in this way.

737
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,740
Since you can't defeat him,

738
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,220
you can call it quits.

739
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,630
Call it quits?

740
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,740
I can call it quits,

741
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,670
but Tianqi can't.

742
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,430
I quit once

743
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,630
and it made me regret it ever since.

744
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,630
So I'll never quit this time.

745
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,740
I won't quit,

746
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,630

a sword fight here today?

752
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,870

753
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,060
here yet?

754
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,390

756
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,700

757
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,700
his final move will be.

758
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,780
So now,

759
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,190
even the breathing time

760
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,540
is extremely precious to him.

761
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,670
It's no use stalling for time.

762
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,830
Once the time has come,

763
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,220
my godfather will take

764
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,830
the initiative to go to Xiao Chuhe.

765
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,590
Besides,

766
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,590
Xiao Chuhe is not someone

767
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,190
who will quit.

768
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,260
Someone is here.

769
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,740
Xiao Se

770
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:16,910
from Tianqi

771
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,260
comes for a sword fight.

772
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,500
Nation-Breaking Sword Technique?

773
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,540
Xiao Se came with nine swords.

774
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,390
So it's to use Nation-Breaking Sword Technique.

775
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,950
The swords

776
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,670
he chose are the best.

777
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,500
But Mr. Xie, do you think

778
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,060
the nine swords are sufficient for him?

779
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,110
Well, it depends on which phase

780
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,870
of Nation-Breaking Sword Technique he's reached.

781
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,190
It's you.

782
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,190
Where is

783
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,260
your friend that holds the Heart Sword?

784
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,630
The Heart Sword

785
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,830
should be used in the purest battle.

786
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,460
He doesn't have to come.

787
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,830
I'll fight you.

788
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,460
Nation-Breaking Sword Technique,
the Wind-Breaker Phase?

789
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,390
I didn't expect

790
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,980
to see the sword

791
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,220
the imperial family used
to win over the world again in my life.

792
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,740
It's an honor.

793
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,220
It knows where to go,

794
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,830
a sword does it all.

795
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,190
Again!

796
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,150
Nation-Breaking Sword Technique
is indeed strong.

797
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,150
But with just the Wind-Breaker,

798
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,350
it's still not enough.

799
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,430
Then, I'll show you

800
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,190
the Dragon-Shocker.

801
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,150
What...

802
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,540
What's going on?

803
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,150
Did Xiao Se also master

804
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,830
the Flying Sword Technique of Wushuang City?

805
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,020
No.

806
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,870
This is not the Flying Sword Technique.

807
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,460
Those six swords

808
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,150
just yield to his sword tendency.

809
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,590
If I'm not wrong,

810
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:16,910
this is...

811
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,220
The Dragon-Shocker Phase.

812
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,630
To return the favor on the Golden Stage,

813
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,950
I tote my Jade Dragon to die for the Emperor.

814
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,540
Impressive.

815
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,390
Dragon-Shocker Technique

816
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,630
is indeed remarkable.

817
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,060
Since I've shown my technique,

818
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,350
I'd like to see your Martyr Sword.

819
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,350
As you wish.

820
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,700
This is it.

821
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,670
This is the sword that defeated Wushuang.

822
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,100
By angry powers' order, our men should be slain.

823
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:24,350
And here and there,
our warriors' corpses strew the plain.

824
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,350
You, old man, have hidden

825
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,950
at home for over a decade

826
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,950
like a coward.

827
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,790
You came to Tianqi City

828
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:30,750
and found fault with us

829
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,270
after mastering a peerless technique.

830
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,830
What has it got to do with you?

831
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,750
Are you nuts?

832
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,950
You asked for sword fights at Tianqi.

833
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,100
Did Tianqi agree to it?

834
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,390
You crashed the plaque of Tianqi City.

835
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,710
Did the Xiao family agree to let you do so?

836
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,830
Isn't it the Insulting Sword Technique

837
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,100
Lei Wujie created?

838
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,460
An elegy, my foot.

839
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,830
Are you the only one who's miserable

840
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,620
and upset?

841
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,310
No one in the world has it easy.

842
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,100
You old man,

843
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,350
just get lost!

844
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,100
Everyone knows who you're looking for.

845
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,390
That martial sister of yours...

846
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,270
That's enough!

847
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,710
The melancholy

848
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,310
has been ruined.

849
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,540
You want me to stop?

850
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,710
Not a chance.

851
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,060
I'm going to yell

852
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,790
at a coward like you.

853
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,710
What does love

854
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,660
have to do with the ranking

855
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,180
of the person?

856
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,100
Tell me!

857
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,430
I said that's enough!

858
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,950
He has made my godfather mad.

859
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,230
But this

860
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,950
is not melancholy

861
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,310
but wrath.

862
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,580
Have I won?

863
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,230
You're good.

864
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,580
After so many days,

865
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,980
you're the first person

866
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,870
who made me use this sword.

867
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,090
It's the Etiquette Soul.

868
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,350
He finally stepped out of that city.

869
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,020
What is an Etiquette Soul?

870
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,230
It's the strongest among the Melancholy Swords.

871
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,430
As he's able to use the Etiquette Soul,

872
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,870
it means Luo Qingyang

873
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,270
has reached the Unbeatable Phase.

874
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,460
Stop!

875
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,740
Sword's heart flares in a flash.

876
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,540
Xiao Se, why did you

877
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,220
come alone

878
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,180
without me?

879
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,100
Are you trying

880
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,140
to steal my chance to become famous?

881
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,380
Cultivate the sword for three days,

882
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,980
and the sword's heart flares in a flash.

883
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,060
This is strong.

884
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,420
But do you have a second move?

885
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,780
Back off!

886
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,740
I, East of Tianqi's Four Guardians,

887
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,860
Azure Dragon, Lei Wujie,

888
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,980
won't back down!

889
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,300
I, West of Tianqi's Four Guardians,

890
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,660
White Tiger, Ji Xue,

891
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,500
won't back down!

892
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,220
I, North of Tianqi's Four Guardians,

893
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,900
Tang Ze, won't back down!

894
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,220
I, South of Tianqi's Four Guardians,

895
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,740
Vermilion Bird, Sikong Qianluo,

896
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,860
won't back down!

897
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,100
You guys!

898
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,860
Since you refuse to back down,

899
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,660
just die then!
