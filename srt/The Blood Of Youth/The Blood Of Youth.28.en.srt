[The Blood of Youth]

24
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,940
[Episode 28]

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,680
They must think

26
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,920
that we are silly.

27
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,120
Yes.

28
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,720
Exhausting ourselves of all favors

29
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,830
to invite the State Preceptor,

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,630
the backbone of the country.

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,000
We organized

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,040
such a grand banquet.

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,070
In the end,

34
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,510
it's turned into a funeral.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,110
This

36
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,440
could've been
a good opportunity for negotiation.

37
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,000
Thanks to

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,200
the attendance of the three individuals,

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,440
we could have had a chance

40
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,630
to talk to the rich and powerful.

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,040
Who knows,

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,830
it could put a dent

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,950
in Lord Bai's

44
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,070
and Lord Chi's plans.

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,040
You're right.

46
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,760
You must think I'm stupid.

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,600
If you had done that,

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,480
then that

49
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,000
would have made you another Lord Bai and Lord Chi.

50
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,160
But you are Xiao Chuhe.

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
In your heart,

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,480
gathering everyone in Tianqi City

53
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,110
to commemorate Lian

54
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,760
at this moment

55
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,480
is the most important.

56
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,200
That person

57
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,350
must be at his limit.

58
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,350
This is the only way

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,950
to draw out the shadow

60
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,950
lurking in the dark.

61
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,320
And only that

62
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,760
will make Lian rest in peace.

63
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,780
[Lord Chi's Residence]

64
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,440
What was that?

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,040
What just happened?

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,720
Isn't he ill?

67
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,160
Isn't he about to die?

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,670
So why was he there?

69
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,480
Please calm down, Your Highness.

70
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,000
There could be spies.

71
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,000
Longxie.

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,230
Send word to that person.

73
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,440
I want to see him.

74
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,760
Your Highness.

75
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,230
I failed to do a good job.

76
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,830
I deserve to be punished.

77
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,000
It wasn't your fault.

78
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,830
He has always been the favored son

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,200
of Tianqi City.

80
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,790
His banquet

81
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,200
is supposed to be like that.

82
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,630
It's just that we had thought

83
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,880
that after being away for so long,

84
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,480
his glory days

85
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,720
would've come to an end.

86
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,920
His Majesty's showing up today...

87
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,160
Father was letting everyone know

88
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,760
that although he's crippled Chuhe,

89
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,520
and Chuhe refuses

90
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,670
to stay in the prince's residence,

91
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,280
he...

92
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,110
He is still

93
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,960
Father's favorite son.

94
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,670
Father's love for him

95
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,550
is something Yu and I

96
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,110
never received

97
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,710
over the years.

98
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,640
The news

99
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,790
we received from the palace

100
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,040
said that His Majesty

101
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,720
was in an unconscious state all this while.

102
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,750
No one expected him
to be able to leave the palace.

103
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,840
I guess the Divine Healer

104
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,550
is truly capable.

105
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,480
Then shouldn't we

106
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,960
ask the Divine Healer

107
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,350
to take a look at Your Highness's eyes?

108
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,600
I heard

109
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,400
she's pretty close to Chuhe.

110
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,080
I'm afraid...

111
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
I personally think

112
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,280
their relationship

113
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,670
is merely that of a physician and a patient.

114
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,990
All that the Divine Healer thinks about

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,430
is how to treat illnesses.

116
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,400
We could ask

117
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,550
Your Highness's second master,

118
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,920
the Director of Record, to invite her.

119
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,870
Yes.

120
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,640
We could ask Master Jinyu to help.

121
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,190
Okay.

122
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,640
Your Highness.

123
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,920
This

124
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
is a good opportunity for us.

125
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,750
We must make good use of it.

126
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,230
Right.

127
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,640
It could also be

128
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,040
my last chance.

129
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,430
[Great diction lends to overwhelming momentum]

130
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm sure you're all aware.

131
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,310
Merchants of Qingzhou

132
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,750
are not fond of visiting Tianqi.

133
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,480
Because Tianqi

134
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,430
has too many rules.

135
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,160
As for Qingzhou,

136
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,990
we don't care about rules.

137
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,840
So what is your reason for coming?

138
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,920
I have a friend.

139
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,520
He has something

140
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,400
he wants to do.

141
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
But you all

142
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,080
could be a hindrance.

143
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,230
Hence,

144
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,790
I'd like to ask

145
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,520
that you make way.

146
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,960
You said it yourself.

147
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,190
Tianqi City has a lot of rules.

148
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,040
Wanting us, the hosts, to make way.

149
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,310
Isn't that a little inappropriate?

150
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,840
I've made it clear, haven't I?

151
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,790
I

152
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,870
do not care about rules.

153
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,960
But if you insist on going by the rules,

154
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,110
then be prepared

155
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,960
to go broke

156
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,480
and lose everything.

157
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,600
Whatever the Mu family wants of you,

158
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,040
it will be like

159
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,840
a walk in the park.

160
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,640
That's all I have to say.

161
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,350
Good day.

162
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,960
-What?
-He...

163
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,480
Butler Liang.

164
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,400
How was my performance just now?

165
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,870
You exuded the Mu family's elegance.

166
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,400
Now,

167
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,040
I'm about to do

168
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,080
something even more elegant.

169
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,870
What would that be, Young Master?

170
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,160
You are as fine as can be.

171
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,230
Is there really

172
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,040
a person

173
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,160
with such amazing talent on the island?

174
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,550
Not a person, but an immortal.

175
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,110
It's hard to describe.

176
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,840
Well, congrats.

177
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,190
You have one less thing to worry about.

178
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,520
As for you,

179
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,190
you'll probably be troubled again.

180
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,870
So you're Hua Jin.

181
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,920
The Divine Healer?

182
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,280
An apprentice of the Medicine King?

183
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,670
Who are you?

184
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,720
Is there a problem?

185
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,400
Tread lightly, Mr. Mu.

186
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,670
You might get pricked.

187
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,920
Divine Healer.

188
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,640
Please accept my bow.

189
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,160
I am the third son of the Mu family

190
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,990
of Qingzhou's Yunjian City, Mu Chunfeng.

191
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,840
I wonder if I could have the honor

192
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,190
to be accepted as your pupil.

193
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,550
You don't.

194
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,640
I have a sprig of Qianxin Herb.

195
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,640
I could gift it to you.

196
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,520
I also have a manor in Tianqi.

197
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,830
The Autumn Cottage.

198
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,760
Dozens

199
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,470
of precious medicinal herbs are grown there.

200
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,040
Such as?

201
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,400
Oh, not much.

202
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,040
Things like Dutchman's Pipe,

203
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,710
Fairy Lian, the Blood of Qilin,
and Immortal Crane Stone.

204
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,120
There are also Heart-Reviving Herb,

205
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,190
King Dragon Leaf,

206
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,040
and five, six, seven...

207
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,520
eight-hundred-year-old Lingzhi.

208
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,360
Listen to him brag.

209
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,670
That's how

210
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,790
rich people like to talk.

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,430
If you're interested,

212
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,550
I could take you

213
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,640
on a tour of the cottage.

214
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,950
You could give me an answer then.

215
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,920
How is that?

216
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,830
Sounds good.

217
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,070
Master, please accept my bow.

218
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,790
I haven't agreed to take you as an apprentice.

219
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,920
Master, I'm a businessman.

220
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,640
I have a good eye.

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Once you go with me,

222
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,790
you'll definitely take me in.

223
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,830
Well then,

224
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,880
I shall take my leave, Master.

225
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,880
Young Master Chunfeng, how could you

226
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,120
simply give away the Autumn Cottage like that?

227
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,760
That is the most important business

228
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,520
the Mu family runs in Tianqi City.

229
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,920
Butler Liang.

230
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,310
I gifted the Autumn Cottage to my master.

231
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,070
Master will later pass it down to me.

232
00:09:59,470 --> 00:09:59,950
In the end,

233
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
the Autumn Cottage will still belong to us.

234
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,670
You always think of everything.

235
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,710
Say no more.

236
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,190
Divine Healer.

237
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,790
Marquis Lanyue.

238
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,520
Don't you know the time?

239
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,710
You should return to the palace.

240
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,470
I know.

241
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,950
I'm not your daughter.

242
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,120
Daughter?

243
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,430
Chuhe.

244
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,880
Am I that old?

245
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,950
Save it, Uncle.

246
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,670
I address you as an uncle.

247
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,360
What else

248
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,280
do you expect her to call you?

249
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,550
Blame it on the seniority in the family.

250
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,190
All right, I'll take you back to the palace.

251
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,900
[Lord Chi's Residence]

252
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,670
Father has recovered.

253
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,360
He slept after getting back.

254
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,360
But he hasn't woken up since.

255
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,360
I heard that the ban in the city

256
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,640
has been lifted.

257
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:01,950
It has.

258
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,400
The moment His Majesty showed up,

259
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
it put an end to many of the rumors.

260
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,470
Imperial Medical Academy
made a public statement,

261
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,430
announcing that His Majesty has recovered.

262
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,710
He only needs to rest a bit more.

263
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,190
But in truth,

264
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,280
His Majesty's illness persists.

265
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,190
Meaning to say,

266
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,400
Father forced himself

267
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,360
to attend the banquet.

268
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,790
Now the entire Tianqi City

269
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,830
is talking about

270
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,520
the banquet at Qianjin Gambling House.

271
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,880
They are talking about Xiao Chuhe.

272
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,550
They are saying

273
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,400
the name on the Dragon Seal Scroll

274
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,190
will surely be his.

275
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,760
Your Highness.

276
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,310
Everyone looks out for themselves.

277
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,670
Particularly in Tianqi City.

278
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,710
Then I'll make sure

279
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,280
no one dares to seek their own benefit
in this matter.

280
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,040
What is Your Highness's plan?

281
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,710
Who are you?

282
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,590
I'm going to remind everyone.

283
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,670
In Tianqi City, whoever dares to help Xiao Chuhe

284
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,040
had better be prepared to lose their lives.

285
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,190
Two slashes.

286
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,280
One in the front, the other on the back.

287
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,790
The one on the back

288
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,190
pierced his lower back.

289
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,190
The one in the front

290
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,760
pierced his heart.

291
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,880
I had seen Master Jiu fight.

292
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,830
He wasn't that skilled

293
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,070
in single combat.

294
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,070
But it was good enough to keep himself alive.

295
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,760
There's poison in his body.

296
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,670
This means that someone drugged

297
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,400
his liquor.

298
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,470
The final posture before he died

299
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,520
was the taking off of the Flying Swallow.

300
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,790
It shows that he was trying to run away.

301
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
But the person who killed him

302
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,190
only needed one strike.

303
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,670
It was swift and deadly.

304
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,670
The work of a professional assassin.

305
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,710
So was it them?

306
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,070
Dark River again.

307
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,590
What? The Dark River is in Tianqi City?

308
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,640
I feel bad for Master Jiu.

309
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,760
Master Jiu was a capable martial artist
in his own right.

310
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,190
The killer had resorted

311
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,430
to such a despicable method just to kill him.

312
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,760
First, it's revenge for Lian,

313
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,120
my sister, and my brother-in-law.

314
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,040
Now, it's Master Jiu.

315
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,760
We'll make them pay once and for all.

316
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,120
I'm going to eradicate them!

317
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,190
Trust me.

318
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,430
It will happen soon.

319
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,400
[Lord Bai's Residence]

320
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,240
I heard

321
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,190
Jiu Jiudao is dead.

322
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,360
That's right.

323
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,240
I suppose everyone thinks

324
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,190
I'm the one who killed him.

325
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,040
After all,

326
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,070
I did visit the Dark River.

327
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,590
But we are pretty sure

328
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,590
that this was a plot by the Dark River and Lord Chi.

329
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,400
Pointing the finger elsewhere

330
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,640
is what

331
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,950
that prince does best.

332
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,790
Do you have any good solutions?

333
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,520
Your Highness could wait for the right time

334
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,760
to extend goodwill to Lord Yong'an.

335
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,880
Let it be a reminder to Lord Chi.

336
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,120
If he dares to challenge us again,

337
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,360
we could very well

338
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,430
ally ourselves with Lord Yong'an.

339
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,190
The problem is that Lord Yong'an

340
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,360
might not accept our goodwill.

341
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,670
So, Longxie.

342
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,000
An insignificant thug

343
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,120
in Tianqi City died.

344
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,240
Is this chaotic enough?

345
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,710
With Jiu Jiudao's death,

346
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,880
those people will sense the danger.

347
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,520
Their support for Xiao Chuhe

348
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,310
will waver.

349
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,520
It will affect

350
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,670
his standing in Tianqi City.

351
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,160
It's not enough.

352
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,400
That

353
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,790
doesn't yet meet my requirement.

354
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,790
I want chaos in Tianqi.

355
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,830
The world will be in chaos
only if Tianqi is in chaos.

357

in order to create chaos in the world?

358

Well...

359
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,830
Rest assured.

360
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,670
I'm not after the Emperor.

361
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,400
Get the Dark River to send their best assassin.

362
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,550
The person I want dead is...

363
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,710
That's...

364
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,710
That's how you turn the world upside down.

It's cold outside.

367
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:15,920
Hold this.

such cold winters in the South.

372
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,190
Yeah.

381
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,760
What?

382
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,400
Who will be next?

383
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,670
We don't know who's behind

384
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,640
the Dark River.

385
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,520
But if the mastermind

386
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,040
is plotting against me,

387
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,840
Jiu Jiudao won't be the only victim.

388
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,750
After all, a person in the martial arts world

389
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,360
will not cause any waves in the Imperial Court.

390
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,380
If they wish

391
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,940
to deter the support from the big names,

392
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,500
I reckon they will take out

393
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,220
someone important in the Imperial Court.

394
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,020
The civil and military officials
who attended the banquet that day

395
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:20,820
were mostly

396
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,820
just following their superiors.

397
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,980
They had to come.

398
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,660
So the ones in the greatest danger

399
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,300
are those who willingly support you.

400
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,100
When did you

401
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,540
start to think about these matters?

402
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,620
I'm the Young Lady of Xueyue City.

403
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,380
Did you really think I only spoke

404
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,060
with my fists?

405
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,180
I didn't bother with these matters before

406
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,140
because firstly, I didn't like them.

407
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,220
Secondly, Lian was there.

408
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,660
Lian was a much better strategist than I am.

409
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,060
I was used to relying on him.

410
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,500
Now that he's gone,

411
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,940
I reckon

412
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,460
I should prove my mettle

413
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,340
as the Guardian Vermilion Bird.

414
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,860
All right. Qianluo.

415
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,380
You will go to a place tonight.

416
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,700
Where?

417
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,980
I want to verify the assumption.

418
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,580
Grand Preceptor.

419
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,460
Tianqi City hasn't been really safe lately.

420
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,860
I think

421
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,340
you should cut back on your habit

422
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,020
of taking a stroll late at night.

423
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,460
When the mind is troubled,

424
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,180
it's hard to fall asleep.

425
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,140
Taking a walk outside

426
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,940
helps to calm the mind.

427
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,100
His Majesty is gravely ill.

428
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,780
The princes

429
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,820
are busy fighting for power.

430
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,780
There are wolves

431
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,980
coming from all sides in the Imperial Court.

432
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,300
In the South, Nanjue is posing a threat.

433
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,300
There is no situation worse than this.

434
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,460
But you are not the only one

435
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
tasked to manage the nation, Grand Preceptor.

436
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,700
Marquis Lanyue...

437
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,540
Marquis Lanyue?

438
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,500
It's not that Marquis Lanyue
doesn't want to take the helm.

439
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,420
His identity is special.

440
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,540
It could cause misunderstandings.

441
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,860
Grand Preceptor.

442
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,380
No need to send signals.

443
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,260
The fact that he's standing here

444
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,020
means that the secret bodyguards

445
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,460
have been dispatched.

446
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,580
Those men were pretty skilled.

447
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,700
It took me some effort.

448
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,380
Who sent you?

449
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,900
My apologies, Grand Preceptor.

450
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,060
So you're the real secret bodyguard.

451
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,060
You are the head of Dark River's Su family,

452
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,460
Su Muyu.

453
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,340
I'm guessing you're not just a nobody.

454
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,500
He's not only famous.

455
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,500
In fact, he's too famous.

456
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,700
You flatter me, Grand Preceptor.

457
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,700
No need to be so humble.

458
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,820
The Annihilator, Li Tian.

459
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,420
Back then on Mount Qilei,

460
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,380
you were surrounded by dozens of elite fighters.

461
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,940
You managed to escape with grave injuries.

462
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,500
I never thought I'd see you here.

463
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,180
Umbrella-Holding Demon.

464
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,060
The regret

465
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,860
of not being able to fight you before

466
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,020
looks to be remedied today.

467
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,700
Li Tian.

468
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,620
You're getting too far from me.

469
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,980
I'm Mu Yumo. It's a pleasure
to meet you, Grand Preceptor Dong.

470
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,170
Who do you think you are?

471
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,260
Guxu...

472
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,100
Save it.

473
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,500
My father is the Spear Deity

474
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,060
who broke through

475
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,180
the Night Parade of 100 Ghosts' Guxu Formation.

476
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,500
You dare show off

477
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,100
your pathetic version of the Guxu Formation?

478
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,540
That was pretty exhilarating.

479
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,100
The Dark River is becoming brazen.

480
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,420
Dark River is not the one who's brazen.

481
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,780
Li Tian.

482
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,900
Yes.

483
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,660
Now that Miss Qianluo is here,

484
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,460
that must mean Lord Yong'an

485
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,180
has found out who the mastermind

486
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,860
behind Dark River is.

487
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
Everyone knows that Grand Preceptor Dong

488
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,100
is non-partisan.

489
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,820
He doesn't support any of the princes.

490
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,740
It was like that when Father ascended the throne.

491
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,180
And it remains the same now.

492
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,620
Killing him

493
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,260
won't affect the name

494
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,980
being put

495
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,340
on the scroll.

496
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,700
But it will impact

497
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,180
the Imperial Court and the world

498
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,740
in a big way.

499
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,180
According to what you just learned,

500
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,780
Lord Bai had gone to the Dark River.

501
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,940
Both Xiao Jingxia and Lord Bai

502
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,180
went to the Dark River.

503
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,780
It corresponds with Dark River's reappearance

504
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,020
and working together

505
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,100
with the Tang Clan.

506
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,980
I don't think Dark River's appearance

507
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,060
was planned by Chong.

508
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,980
He was most likely set up.

509
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,460
How could you be so sure?

510
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,860
When we were young,

511
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,460
we studied at the government-run academy.

512
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,860
The chancellor at the time

513
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,300
was the Scholarly Sword Deity, Xie Xuan.

514
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,380
He asked the three of us

515
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,620
to choose the Ways of the King and Emperor.

516
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,180
Chong chose the Way of the Monarch,

517
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,780
prioritizing virtue and benevolence

518
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,380
and winning people over with righteousness.

519
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,220
Yu chose the Way of the Dictator.

520
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,900
A dictator is a ruler of chaos.

521
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,220
Subduing people by force

522
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,540
and governing with the blade.

523
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,260
He said it himself.

524
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,140
Every dynasty is chaotic.

525
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,740
Those words are considered treason.

526
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,220
But Xie Xuan did not rebuke him.

527
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,660
Thinking back,

528
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,940
even if Chong kept trying to stop me

529
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,900
from going to the capital
for the sake of the throne,

530
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
he would never go against

531
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,500
the Way of the Monarch.

532
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,620
He would never attempt

533
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,500
to kill the Grand Preceptor.

534
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,780
What way did you choose?

535
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,060
Me?

536
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,260
I chose the Way of the Ranger.

537
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,660
What is the Way of the Ranger?

538
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,900
Swashbuckling across the lands
and getting drunk in high towers.

539
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,740
I was ten at the time.

540
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,300
It's what I wanted to do the most.

541
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,620
That sounded more

542
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,540
like what Lei Wujie would say.

543
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,620
I heard someone calling my name.

544
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:09,980
Miss Ye.

545
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,180
Why did you call me?

546
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,380
Xiao Se was talking about his childhood.

547
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,020
It reminded me of you.

548
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,460
Him? How could a feeble dude like him

549
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,780
be like me?

550
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,100
Feeble dude?

551
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,460
That's what you are.

552
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,740
You're always so sluggish.

553
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,140
As if you're frozen.

554
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Who else is feeble if not you?

555
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,220
Airhead.

556
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,220
Young Master, a message from the palace.

557
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,060
What is it, Xiao Se?

558
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,900
It's from Marquis Lanyue.

559
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,540
He said Chong sent a request early today

560
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,820
to ask Father to look into

561
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,740
the Dark River's assassination attempt.

562
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,500
He's taking advantage of the situation.

563
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,460
With this, Lord Bai not only made a clean break

564
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,620
with the Dark River

565
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,620
but also gave a warning

566
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,900
to the mastermind.

567
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,180
This way.

568
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,780
If old Mr. Mu of Qingzhou

569
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,580
saw how

570
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,980
Mu Chunfeng is behaving,

571
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,260
would he still pass

572
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,940
the position of head of the family to him?

573
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,820
Hush.

574
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,940
It's been a while, Divine Healer Hua.

575
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,340
Please sit.

576
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:32,660
Thank you.

577
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,220
But why did it sound like

578
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,580
you were calling an old man?

579
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,580
Next time, you may call my master

580
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,740
Miss Divine Healer.

581
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,900
Is she already your master?

582
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,020
I brought Master to visit the Autumn Cottage.

583
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,140
Master is very pleased.

584
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,780
I do pity Butler Liang.

585
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,020
You did well, my dear apprentice.

586
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,580
Thank you for the compliment, Master.

587
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,940
When I met you on the boat,

588
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,580
I thought you were merely suave.

589
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,380
Seeing you today,

590
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,500
it seems like you've also got

591
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,020
the gift of an apple polisher.

592
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,220
Thanks for the compliment.

593
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,980
Did you come here

594
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,180
because of my father's condition?

595
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,220
That's right.

596
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,060
I've cured

597
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,180
your father's ailment.

598
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,140
Although his heart condition

599
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,260
is due to his heart disease,

600
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,740
a recurrence is inevitable.

601
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,540
But it's abnormal

602
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,140
for him to remain unconscious for so long.

603
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,620
I suspect

604
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,140
there is another Divine Healer in the palace.

605
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,570
His Majesty's repeated flare-ups

606
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,740
could be due to him.

607
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,660
Someone is drugging him?

608
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,660
That could be the case.

609
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,660
But if it was simply poisoning,

610
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,260
I would have easily noticed.

611
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,740
It's something rather subtle.

612
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,820
Something I don't quite understand myself.

613
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,620
I discovered something off

614
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,740
in the food a few days ago.

615
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,060
While yesterday, I found an odd drug

616
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,060
in the incense.

617
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:52,980
Looks like

618
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,260
there's somewhere I have to go.

619
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,780
Where?

620
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,980
You'll come with me.

621
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,260
Ye.

622
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,860
Did you guys often come here before?

623
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,180
Not just me.

624
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,260
There's also Lord Bai, Xiao Chong.

625
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,300
The three of us

626
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,620
used to play together all the time.

627
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,300
There's something I've been wanting to ask.

628
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,220
How did you

629
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,620
and Xiao Se meet?

630
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,140
I've been waiting for you to ask me.

631
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,900
I've waited so long

632
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,660
that I thought you didn't care.

633
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,700
That's a story from when I was really young.

634
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,780
I was sickly back then.

635
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,700
So I couldn't go outside and play.

636
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,460
I would often

637
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,820
stay alone in the courtyard.

638
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,860
Who are you?

639
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,140
Am I disturbing you?

640
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,860
[Young Ye Ruoyi]
Why are you in my house?

641
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,660
I'm Xiao Chuhe.

642
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,500
I came with my uncle

643
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,340
to see General Ye.

644
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,380
Why are you sitting

645
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,580
in this chair?

646
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,140
I'm not well.

647
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,820
Although Master said

648
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,700
I should walk more

649
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,660
in order to strengthen my body,

650
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,780
I can only manage a few steps

651
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,700
before I start to feel the pain.

652
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,620
That's why Father

653
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,700
made this chair for me.

654
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,660
Come, stand up.

655
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,860
I know it hurts.

656
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,380
But if it's you,

657
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,260
you'll surely be able to do it.

658
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,580
(I was seven at the time.)

659
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,140
Xiao Chuhe was nine.

660
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,180
That's how we met.

661
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
(I know it hurts.)

662
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,620
But if it's you,

663
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,420
you'll surely be able to do it. Hang in there.

664
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,420
No wonder.

665
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,300
Ye.

666
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,220
So are you and Xiao Se...

667
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,060
That's already in the past.

668
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,860
The future is more important.

669
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,020
So this is Baixiao Sect.

670
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,900
Xiao Chuhe.

671
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,940
I'm surprised to see you again.

672
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,060
Greetings to the six Iron Masks.

673
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,980
You've only met four

674
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,780
of the Iron Masks.

675
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,180
You should know

676
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,740
that we have a lot to do in a day.

677
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,370
And few can live to a ripe old age.

678
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,580
Even after so long,

679
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,460
the Iron Mask

680
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,060
still loves to self-deprecate.

681
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,300
Xiao Chuhe.

682
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,460
We are busy people.

683
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,260
What information do you want?

684
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,580
None of you

685
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,660
can give me the information I want.

686
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,100
Xiao Se.

687
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,180
Regardless,

688
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,540
we're on their turf.

689
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,100
Shouldn't we be more courteous?

690
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,900
It doesn't matter.

691
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,620
Xiao Chuhe.

692
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,820
Are you really so naive to think

693
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,500
that just because His Majesty
reinstated your position,

694
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,260
people would start

695
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,860
treating you like a prince?

696
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,020
Xiao Se.

697
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:03,740
Didn't you say

698
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,340
they work for your master?

699
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,820
Don't tell me they defected.

700
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,740
Ji Ruofeng has been missing for a year.

701
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,300
Who said Baixiao Sect

702
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,180
was still under his control?

703
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,260
Xiao Se.

704
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,100
The staff he's wielding

705
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,220
looks just like your Wuji Staff.

706
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,860
That's because I'm also

707
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,900
a member of the Baixiao Sect.

708
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,700
You're a woman.

709
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,300
She's my master's daughter.

710
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,020
Ji Xue.

711
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,020
Where is Master?

712
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:46,980
He's dead.

713
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,180
What?

714
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,660
Just kidding.

715
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,900
But

716
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,060
he's as good as dead.

717
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,940
When my father saved you,

718
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,060
he sustained grave injuries.

719
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,060
Over the years,

720
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,860
he's been recuperating in Medicine Valley.

721
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,100
But it's undeniable

722
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,100
that he's concerned about you.

723
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,620
When you left the Snowfall Villa,

724
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,340
he personally went to find out about you.

725
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,820
Now that you're back,

726
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,820
he asked me to hurry along and assist you.

727
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:09,980
Assist me?

728
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,100
That's right.

729
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,940
[White Tiger Token]

730
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,940
That will be all of them!

731
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,260
The White Tiger stands in the West.

732
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,620
Since Master

733
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,500
passed the title of Polymath

734
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,500
and this token on to me,

735
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,660
then congratulations.

736
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,100
Next time I come to acquire information,

737
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,740
I don't have to pay.

738
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,500
We owe you that.

739
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,660
So what about

740
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,260
the matter I had asked Master

741
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,460
to investigate?

742
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,420
Regarding who hurt you,

743
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,460
according to the information we got,

744
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,300
it was

745
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,420
a very subdued inner force

746
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,740
that obstructed your meridians.

747
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,540
I've checked

748
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,740
all known martial art manuals.

749
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,660
I did find

750
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,700
a martial art

751
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,300
that had the capability to do so.

752
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,460
Which martial art?

753
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,220
The Art of Detachment.

754
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,060
Director Zhuoqing.

755
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,020
That's right.

756
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,220
The master of the current Five Eunuchs,

757
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,500
the former Director, Zhuoqing.

758
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,060
The Art of Detachment that he practices

759
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,020
is the world's most sinister
and subdued martial art.

760
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,620
Not to mention powerful.

761
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,900
But it's too bad.

762
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,820
None of his five pupils

763
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,340
could master the art.

764
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,260
So that was the end

765
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,140
of the lead.

766
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,090
The end?

767
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,580
How so?

768
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,020
Because Zhuoqing is dead.

769
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,820
Got it.

770
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,180
Xiao Chuhe.

771
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,500
You should've come and looked for us

772
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,580
the moment you returned.

773
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,700
You know it.

774
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,580
Baixiao Sect

775
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,860
is your biggest help.

776
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,060
But you didn't come.

777
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,020
And we didn't want to go to you,

778
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,900
lest we interfered in your plan.

779
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,140
There's not really a plan.

780
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,420
I just thought

781
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,620
the time wasn't right yet.

782
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,540
And? Has the right time come?

783
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,780
I have three things

784
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,140
that require answers from you.

785
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,220
Three things right off the bat.

786
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,460
You really are demanding.

787
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,260
What is it? Do you wish to know

788
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,220
who is behind

789
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,220
Dark River?

790
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,020
No.

791
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,900
I already have an answer

792
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,780
regarding that matter.

793
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,780
So there's no need

794
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,060
to get the Baixiao Sect to investigate further.

795
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,820
The Dark River

796
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,300
will pay

797
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,420
for their actions.

798
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,060
So will the mastermind behind it.

799
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,540
But the first thing

800
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,580
I'd like to ask

801
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,700
is about the scroll.

802
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,980
So that's what you want after all.

803
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,100
What exactly are you trying to find out?

804
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,060
Does the scroll actually exist?

805
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,820
What is written on the scroll?

806
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,940
Or,

807
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,740
where exactly is the scroll?

808
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,740
Everything.

809
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,420
I want to know

810
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,900
everything about the scroll.

811
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,620
That is one big ask.

812
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,660
What else?

813
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,660
I want you to find out

814
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,900
the toxin experts that came to Tianqi

815
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,060
within the year and have not left.

816
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,340
Give me a name list.

817
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,260
That's not difficult.

818
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,060
But I'll need some time.

819
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,260
As for the third request.

820
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,300
I have a friend.

821
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,020
He should've arrived in Tianqi City

822
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,700
much earlier than me.

823
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,220
But he hasn't come to see me even till now.

824
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,340
I'd like to know where he is right now.

825
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,540
Perhaps he's left.

826
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,220
No.

827
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,860
If he was leaving,

828
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,580
he'd definitely

829
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,060
meet up with me first.

830
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,580
Who is he exactly?

831
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,220
He

832
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,860
is a troublesome friend.

833
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,700
Congrats on coming out of seclusion.

834
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,780
Good day, Eunuch Jade Deity.

835
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,420
You seem

836
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,700
to be in much better spirits

837
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,420
since the last time we met.

838
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,340
Are you still bringing that up?

839
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,740
You almost scared me to death the last time.

840
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,140
It was my bad.

841
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,580
I wasn't able to give you a heads-up

842
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,140
before I entered your sedan chair.

843
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,660
(Can you tell me now,)

844
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,580
why you came to Beili?

845
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,220
And why did you show up in the imperial city?

846
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,460
Don't you bluff me.

847
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
Or else,

848
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,780
I'll haul you off

849
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,780
to His Majesty right away.

850
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,660
I guess I have to oblige

851
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,660
when I'm the guest.

852
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,780
All right then.

853
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,140
I'll tell you.

854
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,370
I'm actually here

855
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,980
to see my birth mother.

856
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,340
Consort Xuan.

857
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,940
As predicted.

858
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,340
It's what I thought.

859
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,420
Because you miss her?

860
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,260
Because I'm curious.

861
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,620
Curious?

862
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,260
Don't give me that look.

863
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,780
I'm truly curious.

864
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,340
Back in Tianwaitian,

865
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,180
I heard many stories from White-Haired Deity

866
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,180
regarding my father,

867
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,780
Ye Dingzhi's many meritorious deeds.

868
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:56,980
In those stories,

869
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,420
there is no shortage

870
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,900
of matters concerning Consort Xuan.

871
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,700
After hearing all that,

872
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,740
I couldn't help

873
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,780
but think that there was more

874
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,020
to Consort Xuan.

875
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,420
Especially the part where she uttered

876
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,060
one phrase to my father,

877
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,340
and it made him turn the blade on himself.

878
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,740
I'm very curious

879
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,060
about what she said.

880
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,220
All for one phrase.

881
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,700
Is it worth it?

882
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,700
Would you rather I ask her

883
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,900
why she abandoned me?

884
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,340
Anyway,

885
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,180
I checked your wound.

886
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,980
You were injured by the Director.

887
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,060
I didn't think there would be

888
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,420
someone so formidable in the imperial city.

889
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,780
I guess you've underestimated Tianqi.

890
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,300
I advise you to leave here immediately

891
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,140
once you've recovered.

892
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,660
You're not safe here.

893
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,700
Understood.

894
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,820
By the way,

895
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,340
has Xiao Se returned to Tianqi?

896
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,220
Not only has he returned,

897
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,540
but he's also caused an uproar.

898
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,220
But too bad.

899
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,940
You didn't see him with your own eyes.

900
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,380
Why?

901
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,620
Do you want to see him?

902
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,260
Shouldn't I

903
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,020
see him?

904
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,820
But I thought I'd have completed

905
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,380
what I set out to do

906
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,820
before meeting with him.

907
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,660
You haven't come to the palace in a while.

908
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,060
So why have you come

909
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,900
to see me today?

910
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,260
Can I not come

911
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,300
and just have a chat with you?

912
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,580
[Yi Wenjun, Consort Xuan]
What is it that you wish to talk about?

913
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,980
Xiao Chuhe is back.

914
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,900
Have you heard?

915
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,140
I've lived in Jingtai Palace for a long time.

916
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,460
I stay away from outside affairs.

917
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,500
I did not know.

918
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,180
Everyone in Tianqi

919
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,500
knows the impact

920
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,980
of his return on me.

921
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,100
All except my birth mother, who can't be bothered.

922
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,380
The Eight Treasures Tea

923
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,860
I brought back from the outer region.

924
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,620
How come you're not drinking it?

925
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,180
I tried it.

926
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,020
It's not to my taste.

927
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,660
So I put it away.

928
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,860
Since you don't like it,

929
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,140
just throw it away.

930
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,580
I have one more question

931
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,500
to ask you, Mother.

932
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,340
Yes?

933
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
If it's a matter

934
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,380
regarding your other son,

935
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,780
are you interested to know

936
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,540
or not?

937
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,100
What are you saying?

938
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,140
I was just joking.

939
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,980
He's gone back to Tianwaitian.

940
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,340
And he won't ever return.

941
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,020
[Tai'an Hall]

942
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,580
Your Majesty.

943
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,180
Is something troubling you?

944
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:53,780
Why?

945
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,540
If you're troubled,

946
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,100
you could throw or smash something.

947
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,540
Or maybe shout it out.

948
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,660
Don't keep it inside.

949
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,340
I thought

950
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,100
you were concerned about me.

951
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,460
But it's because I'm affecting you.

952
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,220
I'm not affected.

953
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,540
I'm worried about you.

954
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,340
Your blood circulation is not good.

955
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,420
If you don't adjust yourself,

956
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,100
no amount of acupuncture will do any good.

957
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,580
I prefer not to be troubled, of course.

958
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,540
However,

959
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,020
I can't help but think about it.

960
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,140
Chuhe...

961
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,620
When he was younger,

962
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,860
he'd tell me everything.

963
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,620
Since when

964
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,380
has he become so distant toward me?

965
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,860
Perhaps he thinks he's achieved

966
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,220
a tacit understanding with Your Majesty.

967
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,500
So some things need not be said out loud.

968
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,100
I like that explanation.

969
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:55,860
Not bad.

970
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,980
I am Chuhe's father.

971
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,620
As father and son,

972
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,940
we should have a tacit understanding.

973
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,340
[Tai'an Hall]

974
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:08,780
Master.

975
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,500
Should we go to Diaolou Parlor

976
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,380
to eat first

977
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,580
or grab medicine at Autumn Cottage?

978
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,540
Divine Healer.

979
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,820
You are...

980
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,180
Nowadays, Divine Healer Hua's skills

981
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,980
are well known in officialdom.

982
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,460
Getting requests

983
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,060
is to be expected.

984
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,570
If you're not willing to help,

985
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,780
you can just say no.

986
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,580
Who is that person?

987
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,380
He said his name is Jinyu.

988
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,820
Director of Record?

989
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,140
He's not the one who's sick.

990
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,420
He asked me to help him

991
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,220
treat someone.

992
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,180
I wasn't sure if I should agree.

993
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,020
I asked Marquis Lanyue,

994
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,980
and he asked me to get your opinion.

995
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,980
Who does he want you to treat?

996
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,620
According to him, it's a blind patient.

997
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,500
When he was young,

998
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,100
he ate a snack he got from someone.

999
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,140
He lost his sight after that.

1000
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,980
It's been 20 years.

1001
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,820
I'm not sure if it can be cured.

1002
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,900
