157

And that leads her zhenqi

166
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,740

00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,940
Taoist Xie,

192
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,300
it's been a long while.

193
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,180
State Preceptor.

194
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,940
Are you here for Zhao Yuzhen?

195
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,010
However, a night passed,

196
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,300
and I haven't seen you

197
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,650
talking to him.

198
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,580
You only stare at him.

199
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,180
I wonder what's on your mind,

200
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,730
State Preceptor.

201
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,250
How does a wilted tree thrive?

202
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,650

203
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,980
This is deep,

205
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,300

206
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,530
who's Yuzhen's master,

207
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,820
to do him a favor.

208
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,180
Sadly, I'm late.

209
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,180
But he came at the right time.

210
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,650

211
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,100

212
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,370

213
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:46,730
(I've been thinking about)

214
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,100
(how it'd be when we meet each other again.)

215
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,420
(When I left Mount Wangcheng,)

216
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,890
(I passed by a peach blossom grove.)

217
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,580
I think

218
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,730

219
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,890
where we meet.

220
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,940
Hence, I've brought some flower petals.

221
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,420

222

224

225

227

Let's go.

228

229
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,250
True.

230

233

234

236
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,340

237
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,730
This name sounds ominous.

238
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,770
Let's come up with a new name.

239
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,820

240

Li Taohua. What do you think?

242

That sounds gaudy.

243
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,420
The name sounds gaudy
only when it's used by others.

244
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,340
(However, if it was for you,)

245
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,100
(the name would sound elegant and gorgeous.)

246
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,180

250

in the midst of peach blossom petals falling.

251
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,100
Before you were up,

252
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,650
I'd asked Mr. Xie Xuan

253
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,180
to seek me a place.

254

What does the place look like?

255
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,890

256
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,530

257
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,010

As we reunite here,

261
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,940
I can finally ask the question

262
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,250
I wanted to ask you when I was young.

263
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,100
Little Fairy,

264
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,460

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,700
What did you see?

378
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,050
After this strife,

379
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,130
we start a feud with Xueyue City

380
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,610
and Mount Wangcheng

381
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,220
who used to stay out of secular grudges.

382
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:54,810
Is it really worth it?

383
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,610
Muyu.

384
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:57,810
I never raise doubt

385
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,330
against Leader's plan.

386
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,810
However, I'd like to ask

387
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,330
if it's worth it.

388
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,180
Regardless of Xueyue City

389
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,090
or Mount Wangcheng,

390
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,130
they'll cease to exist

391
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,850
before long.

392
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:22,740
State Preceptor.

393
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,810
Did you hear that?

394
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,570
It's the omen of demonic invasion.

395
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,660
I'll go take a look.

396
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,290
What's wrong?

397
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,420
Nothing.

398
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,370
Somehow I feel ill at ease

399
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,420
and upset.

400
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,420
Let's be on our way.

401
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,330
Your Majesty.

402
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,330
[Xiao Yueli, Marquis Lanyue]

403
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,770
I wonder why you summon me on short notice,

404
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,980
Your Majesty.

405
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,570
It's said that Chong'er is back.

406
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,500
Lord Bai?

407
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,370
I heard that he just returned to his residence.

408
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:26,700
Probably he'll come

409
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:27,810
to pay you a visit later.

410
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:28,980
Do you miss him,

411
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,090
Your Majesty?

412
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,320
Did he come back alone?

413
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,020
Shouldn't he

414
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,090
come back alone?

415
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,770
Let's go out.

416
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,660
Where are we going?

417
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,810
Lord Bai's residence.

418
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,360
[Lord Bai's Residence]

419
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,370
Greetings, Father.

420
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,090
Rise.

421
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,660
Thank you, Father.

422
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,330
Why have you lost so much weight

423
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,810
in just a few days?

424
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,460
Father.

425
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,940
I caught a cold

426
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
after returning from the journey.

427
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,740
I've been recuperating at home lately.

428
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,010
You're weak.

429
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,260
Do take great care of yourself.

430
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,570
Thank you for your concern, Father.

431
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,020
Father.

432
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,260
Regarding Chuhe...

433
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,420
Your Majesty.

434
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,980
His Highness had tried his best.

435
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,290
However, Sixth Prince
made his position very clear.

436
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,090
He was insistent to stay

437
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,130
even though I hurt him with my sword.

438
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,130
I know

439
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,500
you must have tried your very best, Chong'er.

440
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,180
Everything in this world

441
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,260
can't be decided by humans.

442
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,700
We shall obey destiny.

443
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:50,850
Thank you, Father.

444
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,220
Is Chuhe all right?

445
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,260
Father.

446
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,610
Chuhe's faring very well.

447
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,940
Chuhe...

448
00:22:59,090 --> 00:22:59,940
Chuhe said

449
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,700
he misses you very much.

450
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,610
Did Chuhe really say this?

451
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,130
My child,

452
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,770
you have a kind soul.

453
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,530
Take care of yourself.

454
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:13,940
I'll head back now.

455
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,090
I bid you farewell, Father.

456
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,900
You're indeed

457
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:26,980
an amusing prince.

458
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,940
I bid you farewell, Uncle.

459
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:36,940
Your Majesty.

460
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,370
Where are we going now?

461
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,220
To Lord Chi's residence.

462
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,390
[Lord Chi's Residence]

463
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,500
Father.

464
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,610
You started practicing archery
when you were young.

465
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,050
Yet you still missed the target now.

466
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,020
It'll be better

467
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,090
to give your eyes to Chong.

468
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,090
You may not know about this, Father.

469
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,220
I've fallen sick

470
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,850
for one whole month.

471
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,570
And both my hands

472
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,700
feel strengthless now.

473
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:31,740
Pass it to me.

474
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,220
Are you able to shoot with this heavy bow

475
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,530
when you're sick?

476
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,500
That's why I missed the target.

477
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,770
Father.

478
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,500
I'm at fault.

479
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,050
I didn't fall sick.

480
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,460
But I'm much bothered by something.

481
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:06,980
What's it about?

482
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,570
I don't feel like going to the imperial court.

483
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,050
Father, you're amazing.

484
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,180
Kneel down.

485
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,850
Since you don't feel like
going to the imperial court,

486
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,330
do as you wish.

487
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,290
From today on,

488
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,770
stay at home.

489
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,740
Tomorrow,

490
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,850
the Chief Academician of the Imperial Library

491
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,770
will lead twelve academicians
to your residence

492
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,530
to compile the Chronicle of Beili.

493
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,050
Chronicle...

494
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,290
Chronicle of Beili?

495
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,050
But it

496
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,130
hasn't been accomplished

497
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,050
after several decades?

498
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:53,900
Yet you assign me this task.

499
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,420
Do you want to lock me down

500
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,570
in the residence till my last breath?

501
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,180
Father, please spare me.

502
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:58,940
Yueli.

503
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,810
Let's leave.

504
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,570
Yes.

505
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,330
Uncle, please plead on my behalf to Father.

506
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,420
Uncle, I'm at fault.

507
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,500
I... This...

508
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,740
You want me to plead on your behalf?

509
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,700
Little nephew.

510
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,330
You gave me a cold shoulder
when I conveyed to you the decree

511
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,220
to enter the imperial court a few days before.

512
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,610
Don't you think

513
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,090
it's too late to beg me now?

514
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,020
Uncle.

515
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,850
I'll go to the imperial court.

516
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,530
Uncle...

517
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,420
Let go.

518
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,180
Your Majesty.

519
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,660
I almost couldn't help myself

520
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,570
and give this pathetic brat a spanking.

521
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,180
Yueli.

522
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,610
Get on the carriage.

523
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,740
I have something to tell you.

524
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,740
Your Majesty.

525
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,130
Are you going

526
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,500
to task me with some kind of hassle?

527
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,850
Not really.

528
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,770
Actually, I've learned something

529
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:18,900
that Jade Deity

530
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,700
didn't convey to me.

531
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,700
Probably Eunuch Jade Deity

532
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,290
reckoned it was something trivial.

533
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,220
No.

534
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,740
It's very important.

535
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,220
There's a young chap in a red outfit

536
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,500
beside Chuhe,

537
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,700
named Lei Wujie.

538
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,850
Lei Wujie?

539
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,500
I gave him

540
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,460
this name.

541
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,500
No sword unsheathes

542
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,810
in a righteous world.

543
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,260
No rebellion emerges

544
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,570
in a peaceful empire.

545
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,130
I held him in my arms

546
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,530
when he was small.

547
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,570
Is he the son of General Lei

548
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,530
and Guardian Li?

549
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,770
He's a bright chap.

550
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,330
Much to my surprise,

551
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,050
he still

552
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,740
returned to Lei Clan, after all.

553
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,220
Well.

554
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,530
Do me this favor.

555
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,460
I didn't anticipate much

556
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,290
when I sent Chong'er over.

557
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,980
I just wanted to portray

558
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,050
my attitude.

559
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,130
I'm only at ease

560
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,090
if I task you with this.

561
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,700
I understood.

562
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,130
Go ahead.

563
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,050
Sure.

564
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,020
There's one more thing.

565
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,260
When you meet Chuhe

566
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,020
or that Lei's chap,

567
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,810
please pass my message to them,

568
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,500
"I feel guilty for what I did."

569
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:01,810
Let's take a rest here.

570
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,130
I'm out of breath.

571
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,220
I, the mighty Young Head of Tianwaitian,

572
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:07,850
am chased by a man carrying a sword,

573
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,050
and I hardly stopped for breath.

574
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,290
This is so embarrassing.

575
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:14,770
Stop looking for him.

576
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,460
We're weak enough

577
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,130
to be tracked by him, but not the other way around.

578
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,610
Brats.

579
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,290
I appreciate that you know your limitation.

580
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,020
Sir, your swordsmanship is unrivaled.

581
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,330
We still lack behind by years of cultivation

582
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,290
to catch up with you

583
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,180
even though we're gifted.

584
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,980
You have nowhere to run now.

585
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,770
Exactly.

586
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,420
However, someone came to be of my help.

587
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,460
Stupid scholar.

588
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,980
Demon.

589
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,700
Glad that you reach on time.

590
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,020
Since you reunite here, Sword Deities.

591
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,220
You may get on with it.

592
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,290
We shall take our leaves now.

593
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,770
Until next time, hopefully.

594
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,740
Minghou, run.

595
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,460
I can't believe Ye Dingzhi

596
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,810
has given birth to a useless son.

597
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,130
Wrathful Sword Deity.

598
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:04,980
If you're better than me,

599
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,260
catch me if you can.

600
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,980
Demon.

601
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,900
Let him be.

602
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,900
Do me a favor now.

603
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,180
What's it?

604
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,020
According to the book,

605
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,370
after one is possessed by obsession,

606
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,050
the veins flow reversely
and both blood and qi surge.

607
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,500
The power will then boost by manifold

608
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,610
as compared to before.

609
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,810
However, such conditions only do the person harm

610
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,500
and end his life in no time.

611
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,940
What nonsense are you talking about?

612
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,330
Possessed by obsession?

613
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,530
Demon.

614
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,330
She's possessed.

615
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,290
Li Hanyi?

616
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,020
Where's Su Changhe?

617
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,460
I'm going to kill him!

618
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,660
Stupid scholar.

619
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,660
It turns out you wanted me

620
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,610
to restrain her.

621
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:46,740
Why should I help you?

622
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,130
Calm down.

623
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:48,940
I've figured out the method

624
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:49,980
to solve this.

625
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,290
Firstly, render her unconscious
and halt the qi inside her.

626
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,530
Then, find the...

627
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,500
Cut your crap.

628
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:55,700
It's easy.

629
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,090
Knock her out.

630
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,500
Su Changli is dead.

631
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,900
But why are you still alive?

632
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,810
The strength of the target

633
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,180
is far from matching the information we had.

634
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:08,530
Plus, there was Li Suwang

635
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,700
from Sword Heart Tomb.

636
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:10,770
In my estimation,

637
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,770
I should pull out from the task

638
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,810
in a situation like that.

639
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,290
I see.

640
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,290
Your mission

641
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,980
ends for the time being.

642
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,290
As for Changli's death,

643
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,610
it has nothing to do with you.

644
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,420
Thank you, Leader.

645
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,810
You may leave now.

646
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,090
Leader.

647
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,460
Those young brats...

648
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,330
Mu Ying and Changli

649
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,660
have bought enough time for us.

650
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,330
Now that our deployment

651
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,050
is all set.

652
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,050
Those mere young brats

653
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,370
won't affect our plan.

654
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,570
You intended to kill Mu Ying just now.

655
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,020
When killers fail the mission,

656
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,660
it's normal for them
to surrender their lives in return.

657
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:06,700
However,

658
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,500
Changli is different from them.

659
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,420
He's a swordsman

660
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,980
rather than a killer.

661
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,290
He doesn't deserve to end up like this.

662
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,900
As Changli's blood brother,

663
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,460
Leader was overly calm just now.

664
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,740
[Lei Fortress]

665
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,260
Mr. Xu.

666
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,900
Congratulations, Fort Leader Lei.

667
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,460
Welcome.

668
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:57,980
Please come in.

669
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,530
Congratulations, Fort Leader Lei.

670
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,530
[Lei Tianhen, Lei Clan]

671
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,020
Clan Leader.

672
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,180
Almost all of our guests

673
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,020
have arrived.

674
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,050
Only guests from Xueyue City

675
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,130
and Tang Clan haven't arrived.

676
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,260
What if...

677
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,370
They are important guests.

678
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,570
Naturally, they're worth

679
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,740
the wait.

680
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,850
Understood.

681
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,050
Tang Xuan, the best poison alchemist
of the Tang Clan.

682
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,660
How come he attends the banquet?

683
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,180
No.

684
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,370
Tang Huang, Elder of External Academy.

685
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,420
Qianhu.

686
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,050
I'll come down after I finish smoking.

687
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,570
You can take your time.

688
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,130
We're almost there.

689
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,020
It's five li

690
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,090
away from Lei Clan.

691
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,730
Hopefully, we can reach there on time.

692
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,500
Someone's ahead of us.

693
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,090
Again, it's Dark River.

694
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,570
Indeed, it's Dark River.

695
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,020
However, it's something different this time.

696
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,380
Su Muyu of Dark River, head of the Su family.

697
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,530
Code name, Umbrella-Holding Demon.

698
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,050
Xie Qidao, head of the Xie family.

699
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,900
Code name, Grim Reaper.

700
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,420
We seem to be important to them.

701
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,020
Even the killers from Dark River await us.

702
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,530
That's very flattering.

703
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,690
Heart Sword, the famous sword ranked fourth.

704
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,020
That's Lei Wujie.

705
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,860
The one who killed

706
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,020
Su Changli.

707
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,210
I'll leave him to you.

708
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,500
As for the rest,

709
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,610
I'll take care of them.

710
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,980
It's the Eight Knights of the Lei Clan.

711
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,900
[Lei Jingbu, Lei Clan]
Pathless mountains but endless streams,

712
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,300
the exit appears when one least expects to.

713
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,020
It's been a while, Wujie.

714
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,170
You're as eloquent as expected,

715
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,130
Jingbu.

716
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,170
The clan leader ordered us to come down

717
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:17,860
and see you in.

718
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,210
However, I failed to find you.

719
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,300
I thought about returning

720
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,610
and taking my punishment.

721
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,420
Unexpectedly, I'd meet you up here
at the entrance of the mountain.

722
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,340
By the way,

723
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,690
who are they?

724
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,940
I'm Tang Lian from Xueyue City.

725
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,650
They are my juniors.

726
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,300
Oh, you're from Xueyue City.

727
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,170
I should've greeted you earlier.

728
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,340
Have you finished chatting?

729
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,380
Judging by that tone,
he doesn't seem to be your friend.

730
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:40,730
Jingbu.

731
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,500
Are you all right, Jingbu?

732
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,610
Wujie.

733
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,500
Lead them to Lei Fortress first.

734
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,300
A hero banquet without heroes from Xueyue City

735
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,340
won't live up to its name.

736
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,210
Jingbu.

737
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:55,900
Shut up!

738
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:56,730
I shouldn't let others

739
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,650
look down on Lei Fortress.

740
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,500
Brothers.

741
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,610
Formation!

742
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,650
I shall thank you in advance.

743
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,250
Let's go.

744
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,090
Don't let them go.

745
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,380
It's Thunder Shield Array.

746
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:16,860
Brothers,

747
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
give them all a good look.

748
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,720
[Lei Fortress]

749
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,130
I've kept you waiting, Qianhu.

750
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,980
Since you're coming to the banquet,

751
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,050
I'm willing to wait for you

752
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,610
one day and one night.

753
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,730
You're more polite than your father.

754
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,820
Clan Leader.

755
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,050
The guests from Xueyue City...

756
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,300
Well, we shall start the banquet

757
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,300
without them.

758
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:57,730
Sure.

759
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,690
The banquet commences now!

760
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,610
Pathless mountains but endless streams.

761
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,460
Don't you dare set your foot anymore.

762
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,820
[Lei Fortress]

763
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,060
Let's drink up.

764
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,340
Bottoms up.

765
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,130
Let's drink up.

766
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:30,900
Mr. Yao.

767
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,290
Let's drink.

768
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:33,540
Let's drink.

769
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,250
Here.

770
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,290
Bottoms up.

771
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,770
Let's drink.

772
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:36,820
Let's drink.

773
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,610
At this banquet,

774
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,650
we, Lei Fortress, are honored

775
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,130
to have Old Master Tang here.

776
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,460
Qianhu.

777
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,540
If you do feel so,

778
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,570
drink it up.

779
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,730
Many years ago,

780
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,210
I had a battle with the Demon Sect,

781
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,170
and the toxic cold penetrated my system.

782
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,540
I've quit drinking

783
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,650
for many years.

784
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,980
It's a mere toxic cold.

785
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,860
I've added some Blazing Heart Weed to it.

786
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,690
It helps to ward off the cold.

787
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,250
Why?

788
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,460
Are you worried

789
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,460
that I might add something

790
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,420
into the liquor?

791
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,170
Of course not.

792
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,170
Tang Xuan.

793
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,650
I've quit drinking

794
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,540
for years.

795
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,420
But since this brew

796
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,570
is requested by Old Master Tang...

797
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:41,770
Very well.

798
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,130
What's wrong with me?

799
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,290
I feel giddy.

800
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,090
Spider.

801
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,500
Spider.

802
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:01,900
This...

803
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,170
This is the Array of Thousand Arachnids
from Dark River.

804
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,170
We're being ambushed.

805
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,420
Fort Leader!

806
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,090
Fort Leader.

807
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,090
Fort Leader, whoever drank the brew,

808
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,330
including the disciples on duty,

809
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:17,250
are all poisoned.

810
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,650
All of them?

811
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,380
Yes.

812
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,900
They've been poisoned.

813
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,770
I wonder why are Old Master Tang

814
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,340
and the two guests from Tang Clan

815
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,540
sitting here well?

816
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:39,860
Qianhu.

817
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,380
Aren't you standing here well too?

818
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,340
After being attacked by the toxic cold,

819
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,730
I'm immune

820
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,380
to all poisons.

821
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,130
Oh, I miscalculated this.

822
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:52,940
You miscalculated?

823
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,170
I'm the one who miscalculated this though.

824
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,730
Despite I have asked Qianhen to handle
everything discreetly,

825
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,820
we still fail this.

826
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,250
The most secretive

827
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,460
poisonous array

828
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:07,980
gangs up with

829
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,130
the most secretive Divine Afterglow Dew
of the Tang Clan.

830
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,820
It's really out of my depth.

831
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,170
Old Master Tang.

832
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,770
Array of Thousand Arachnids

833
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,210
is only mastered by one family,

834
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,770
that's the Mu family, the Dark River.

835
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,820
It's been a long while, Qianhu.

836
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,380
You're the clan leader of Lei Fortress

837
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,570
and I'm the head

838
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,090
of the Mu family, Dark River.

839
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,540
It's been so long.

840
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:38,980
I knew it was you.

841
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,570
Spider Maiden,

842
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,210
Mu Yumo.

843
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,020
Old Master Tang.

844
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,980
Although both of our families are on bad terms,

845
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,170
you betray the entire martial arts world

846
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,130
by conspiring with Dark River.

847
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,610
What does it do you good

848
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,130
by ganging up with them?

849
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,940
Dark River?

850
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,290
I only came here

851
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,730
for a drink.

852
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,690
I know nothing but the brew.

853
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,340
Are you using someone else to do the dirty work?

854
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,060
Why would I do that?

855
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,380
As you know, we have to pull our weight

856
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,170
while collaborating in a business.

857
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:15,980
Where are the Eight Knights?

858
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,380
Supposedly, they should reach soon.

859
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,500
No one will come to your aid.

860
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:42,650
What has happened?

861
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,980
Did someone invade Lei Fortress?
