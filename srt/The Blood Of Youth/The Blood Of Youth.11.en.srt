00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,820
♪Hidden within them is your tenacious faith♪

191
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,380
♪A hero never sighs easily♪

192
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,260
♪He'll only spend his life pacifying the world♪

♪The past turns into dust♪

♪The flowers bloom and wither

198
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,780
This is the real elegance.

199
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,820
This is...

200
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,820
Ruoyi Sword Dance.

201
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,540
General Ye created

202
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,300
this dance on the battlefield.

203
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,700
This sword dance is divided into two parts.

204
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,900
The first part is about Celestial Gate.

205
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,860
It's like fluid running peacefully.

206
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,580
The second part is about Killing Array.

207
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
The killing intent permeates the area.

208
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,700
You can even sense it from afar.

209
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,140
[Flora Spectacle]

210
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,940
I guess

211
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,740
this must be Celestial Gate.

212
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,260
But there's no background music,

213
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,620
it's a shame.

214
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,460
What a talented player.

215
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,660
Indeed.

216
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,620
Sikong,

217
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:11,980
I think I've found

218
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,700
an answer.

219
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,140
I'll give you

220
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,540
what you want.

221
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,500
Really?

222
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,900
Lend me your flute.

223
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,420
Scholarly Sword Deity.

224
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,260
Xie Xuan?

225
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,060
Don't mind me.

226
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,980
It's a pleasure being able

227
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,060
to watch the real Ruoyi Sword Dance

228
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,780
once in my life.

229
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,300
I wish to travel north with the wind,

230
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,860
watching the snow sweeping across the land.

231
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,060
I wish to travel east with the ship,

232
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,180
seeing the elegant fairy brave the wind.

233
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,300
I wish to travel far with the clouds,

234
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,100
even the emperor ruling the court cannot stop me.

235
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,460
I will bathe in sunlight
on the top of Mount Kunlun.

236
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,420
I will witness lush mountains rise
at the edge of the ocean.

237
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,660
We shall reunite after a long journey.

238
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,500
But I won't go home unless I've seen the world.

239
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,060
Look over there.

240
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,820
-It's so pretty.
-Yes.

241
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,740
It's gorgeous.

242
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,300
What a coincidence.

243
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,660
We met again.

244
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,260
I don't know what has happened between them.

245
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,060
But isn't this

246
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,100
a bad opening line?

247
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,020
It's awfully bad.

248
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,100
Yes.

249
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,420
We met again.

250
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
A beauty

251
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,820
is unforgettable.

252
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,420
One day apart

253
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,100
makes one long for her.

254
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,740
A friend is coming over.

255
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,740
Xie,

256
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,820
what are you waiting for?

257
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,060
Being able to meet

258
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,260
the young disciples of Xueyue City,

259
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,060
I only realize it stays true to its reputation

260
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,020
as the First City of the Martial Art World.

261
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,540
I guess this is it.

262
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,660
I'll give you several books.

263
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,100
This is for you.

264
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,220
This is...

265
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,340
Ruoyi Sword Dance

266
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,540
is a good dance,

267
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,420
but it's filled with a sense of hostility.

268
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,700
You're in poor health,

269
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,580
you can't do the dance too often.

270
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,100
This dance is astonishing.

271
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,140
It's like a swan goose

272
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,540
soaring in the sky

273
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,220
during the dance.

274
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,140
It's more gentle and has less hostility.

275
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,140
Thank you, sir.

276
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,940
This is for you.

277
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,420
Sir,

278
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,660
what is this?

279
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,460
Late Snow.

280
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,460
This is the work of Xie Feixuan,

281
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,660
a gifted female scholar from Jiangnan.

282
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,060
It's very touching.

283
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,980
Rumor has it that even the concubines
in the Imperial Harem

284
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,860
cried while reading it.

285
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,260
Learn more from the main character.

286
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,820
When you meet her next time,

287
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,100
don't say

288
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,500
something so awkward.

289
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,980
Your master always complained to me.

290
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,300
He said

291
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,100
he got

292
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,140
a prudish disciple.

293
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,700
However,

294
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,860
when I heard you singing poems just now,

295
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,980
you got the style

296
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,300
of your master when he was young.

297
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,020
This is a book for you.

298
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,380
When your master was young,

299
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,940
he liked to read it too.

300
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,180
I've only learned martial arts from my master.

301
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,420
I didn't learn how to make alcohol from him.

302
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,980
You should savor

303
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,180
its taste yourself.

304
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,900
Thank you, sir.

305
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,460
I guess you don't want me

306
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,380
to call you by that name.

307
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,260
But after all, you and I

308
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,460
are acquaintances.

309
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,260
Mr. Xie Xuan.

310
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,380
Seeing that you are all laid-back now,

311
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,100
I almost forgot

312
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,260
that you were

313
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,740
the unrestrained young man in the classroom.

314
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,220
Appearances can be deceiving.

315
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,260
But the zither music can't.

316
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,020
I can sense your spirit

317
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,700
in your zither music.

318
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,900
I'm gratified.

319
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,780
I don't understand what you mean.

320
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,300
You don't have to.

321
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,660
I'm just happy

322
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,060
that I'm not wrong about you.

323
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,980
This book is for you.

324
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,620
I wrote it myself.

325
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,660
But I haven't named it.

326
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,740
If you come up with a better name

327
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,180
after reading it,

328
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,300
you can write it down.

329
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,380
Changfeng,

330
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,660
some people

331
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,260
will never change.

332
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,900
Thanks, Xie.

333
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,340
Well,

334
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,180
I'll get going.

335
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,420
I just came,

336
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,900
and you're leaving.

337
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,060
Are you really so scared of me?

338
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,090
We might as well not see each other.

339
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,860
We don't have to meet in person.

340
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,660
It's all in the heart.

341
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,940
Stupid scholar.

342
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,660
Fierce woman!

343
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,060
Master.

344
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,420
Good evening.

345
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,300
When I was at Mount Cang,

346
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,460
I suddenly saw

347
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,820
a sword qi over here.

348
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,780
The sword technique

349
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,180
was not bad.

350
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,780
Master,

351
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,900
you're complimenting me?

352
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,100
Having said that,

353
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,620
who allowed you

354
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,980
to go down the mountain?

355
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,380
Master,

356
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,020
how come you never

357
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,020
join the Flora Spectacle?

358
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,740
No matter how beautiful the flowers are,

359
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,780
you'll get tired after seeing them
for over ten years.

360
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,260
There's nothing more to see.

361
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,780
By the way,

362
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,900
was that person

363
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,060
Xie Xuan who got

364
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,860
the title of Sword Deity by reading books?

365
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,100
He's as elegant

366
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,340
and domineering as advertised.

367
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,780
Stupid scholar.

368
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,260
He even gave me a book

369
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,580
called Late Snow.

370
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,700
But the books he gave the others

371
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,780
are quite special.

372
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,220
I heard that the book he gave me

373
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,900
can be bought
from Rustling Bamboo Book Pavilion.

374
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,900
Do you like

375
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,140
the girl who's called Ye Ruoyi?

376
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,660
Why?

377
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,660
Because...

378
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,380
she's pretty.

379
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,740
Is that all?

380
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,900
I don't seem to have other reasons for it.

381
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,540
You're quite honest.

382
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,140
Master,

383
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,540
I said she looks pretty

384
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,620
not because I like

385
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,140
all those pretty ladies in the world.

386
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,380
It's just that I felt a bit weird

387
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,780
the moment

388
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,620
when I saw her.

389
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,620
But come to think of it,

390
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,700
I don't know about her past

391
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,420
and her personality.

392
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,900
I don't even know

393
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,500
what she likes or hates.

394
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,260
After much thought,

395
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,900
maybe it's love

396
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,340
at first sight.

397
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,100
Or it's because...

398
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,020
She looks pretty.

399
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,300
But good-looking people

400
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,500
like to cheat others.

401
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,460
Master,

402
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,900
does this mean

403
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,820
that you've been hurt by good-looking people?

404
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,260
(Master said)

405
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,540
good-looking people will always cheat others.

406
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,180
(It's indeed true.)

407
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,980
I was wrong, Master.

408
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,300
(Head down the mountain with me)

409
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,100
when I come to Mount Wangcheng

410
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,860
for the third time.

411
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,860
I'll come again next year.

412
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,460
I'll test your swordsmanship

413
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,780
two months later.

414
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,540
You'll become a sword deity three years later.

415
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,460
This is the deal between us.

416
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,260
When did we

417
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,180
have such a deal?

418
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,260
Mas...

419
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,140
Wait for me, Master.

420
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,140
Did you ask Mr. Xie Xuan over?

421
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,740
I did.

422
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,300
I told him about you.

423
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,780
He said that lately, he's been practicing

424
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,100
a kind of martial skill

425
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,700
that's good for you.

426
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,780
So I invited him to Xueyue City

427
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,180
to teach you

428
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
this martial skill.

429
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,380
Thank you.

430
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,500
You don't have to thank me.

431
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,300
Xie Xuan is close

432
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,020
to both of us.

433
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,620
But we can't ask him to teach you

434
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,820
this martial skill

435
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,500
solely on account of our friendship.

436
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,700
He'll only pass on

437
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,060
his martial skills to those whom he thinks

438
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,860
that deserve them.

439
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,700
He made this decision

440
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,620
right when you played the zither.

441
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,260
It looks like this book can do wonders.

442
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,740
After reading a few lines,

443
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,460
you can already tell some tricks of it.

444
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,660
The circulation of zhenqi

445
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,100
can help work everything out.

446
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,780
Mr. Xie Xuan

447
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,380
named this martial art Circulation.

448
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,740
It looks like Xie Xuan

449
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,060
didn't fool me.

450
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,180
He said if you practice this skill

451
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,460
for three years,

452
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,980
most of your power

453
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,620
will be slowly

454
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,580
restored.

455
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,780
Combined with my medical skills,

456
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,340
you might even get stronger

457
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,900
than you used to be.

458
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,220
But

459
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,940
you must keep this in mind.

460
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,540
What is it?

461
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,300
He didn't mention it in the book,

462
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,340
but with your intelligence,

463
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,780
you'll soon find out

464
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,780
that not only can the Circulation Art

465
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,340
help you

466
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,900
slowly restore your power,

467
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,060
it can also help you

468
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,900
return to your most powerful state
for a brief moment.

469
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,180
But if you do this,

470
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,700
everything will come to naught.

471
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,620
Even your life

472
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,980
will be in danger.

473
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,380
Return to the most powerful state

474
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,620
for a brief moment?

475
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,460
Three years

476
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,340
is not that long.

477
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,580
Indeed.

478
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,460
(I've stayed at the inn)

479
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,060
(for more than three years.)

480
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,580
But the word magical power

481
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,980
shows that magic and power are reciprocal.

482
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,460
What is power?

483
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,180
Power

484
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,660
means your heart.

485
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,060
Physical diseases are curable.

486
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,940
But what about psychological diseases?

487
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,500
I know.

488
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,860
That incident has brought you great harm.

489
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,500
But I really hope

490
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,860
you could stay strong and get over it.

491
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:21,980
Father.

492
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,220
Qianluo.

493
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,020
Father,

494
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,460
why did you end the Flora Spectacle

495
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,620
before I came?

496
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,940
You brat.

497
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,340
You ignored me when I asked

498
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,060
you to come.

499
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,610
Now that everyone has left,

500
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,180
you blame us for ending it too soon.

501
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,220
Geez, you brat.

502
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,380
I heard

503
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,740
that Mr. Scholarly Sword Deity came too.

504
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,580
He even gave

505
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,660
everyone a book as a gift.

506
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,860
Where's mine?

507
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,940
Yours?

508
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,380
Of course you have one.

509
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,300
He asked me to give you this.

510
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,580
This brat said

511
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,180
the spear techniques I passed on to her

512
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:56,940
were too manly.

513
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,060
So she clamored for it.

514
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,380
Look, look.

515
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,500
Father.

516
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,620
Yanhui,

517
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,060
you've done great all these years.

518
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,780
Great Elder, please get to the point.

519
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,940
All these years,

520
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,900
from the fall to the rise

521
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,500
of Wushuang City,

522
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,580
it's all thanks to your contribution.

523
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,700
You have the talent to revive a country.

524
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,780
But

525
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,860
what Wushuang City needs now

526
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,580
is a person who can expand the territory.

527
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,180
An ambitious person?

528
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,860
Yes.

529
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,700
From now on, you don't have to worry

530
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,620
about the affairs in the city.

531
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,020
Leave it to Songtao.

532
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,620
Yanhui,

533
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,220
long time no see.

534
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,660
I was never interested in the position

535
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,020
of the City Lord

536
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,820
of Wushuang City.

537
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:54,940
But

538
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,180
Songtao

539
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,340
is ineligible to take this position.

540
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,620
What did you say?

541
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,260
Songtao's martial skills were not

542
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,300
as good as mine.

543
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,860
That's why he left Wushuang City.

544
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,500
Now that you ask him back,

545
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,020
it's just because

546
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,580
it's easier to control him.

547
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,700
He'll obey your orders

548
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,820
and do what he is told.

549
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,500
Yanhui,

550
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,380
you've crossed the line.

551
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,940
I can quit being the City Lord.

552
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,340
But I'd like to recommend someone.

553
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,860
I guess I have this right, don't I?

554
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,860
Of course.

555
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,420
You mean this kid?

556
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,500
A brat like you

557
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,100
wants to be the City Lord?

558
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,500
You must fight me before that.

559
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,260
He's indeed a little kid.

560
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,740
Wushuang!

561
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,140
Coming, Master.

562
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,260
Wushuang Sword Box?

563
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,420
It's you, little brat?

564
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,660
Mister,

565
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,020
who are you?

566
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,140
I'm Ye Songtao.

567
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,220
I don't think you are that well-known.

568
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,820
You...

569
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,900
He's not well-known.

570
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,220
You're right this time.

571
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,620
Wushuang,

572
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,420
next, you'll have to battle

573
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,580
with your martial uncle.

574
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
If you win,

575
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,020
you'll be

576
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,300
the City Lord of Wushuang City.

577
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,180
Okay, I understand.

578
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,780
Let's battle.

579
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,340
How are we going to battle

580
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,820
when you stand there?

581
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,580
You caveman.

582
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,580
Cloud, Frost, Wind,

583
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,980
Thread, Jade.

584
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,380
Have fun with this mister.

585
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:11,860
Slaughter.

586
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,900
Your blade's name is Spirit-Reaping.

587
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,380
This flying sword of mine is called Slaughter.

588
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,820
It's kind of a give-and-take.

589
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,340
It's Soul-Reaping, not Spirit-Reaping.

590
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,260
It's Ye Songzi's Soul-Reaping Blade.

591
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,740
It's Ye Songtao.

592
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,900
I miss pine nuts.
(*Songzi means pine nuts)

593
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,780
Yanhui,

594
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,500
you've got a good disciple.

595
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,380
I can't believe he can control
six flying swords at the same time.

596
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,860
I haven't seen

597
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,580
such a talent in Wushuang City

598
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,820
for a century.

599
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,460
But still,

600
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,340
it's very disrespectful of you to point

601
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,980
the sword at your elder.

602
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,860
Disrespectful?

603
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,180
Young man,

604
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,300
you've got great talent.

605
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,820
It's praiseworthy.

606
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,340
But you don't respect

607
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,420
your elders.

608
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,140
Great Elder, you're quite good.

609
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,780
Why don't you be the City Lord?

610
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,420
I'm old.

611
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,980
I'm quite young.

612
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,420
Do you think I can be the City Lord?

613
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,340
Yanhui,

614
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,380
you've raised

615
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,620
an owner of Wushuang Sword Box.

616
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,580
Yes.

617
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,060
We ought to choose a man

618
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,740
who can lead Wushuang City

619
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,900
back to the time

620
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,900
when it was unparalleled in the world.

621
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,420
Are you really going to put

622
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,740
the destiny

623
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,900
of a city in a kid's hands?

624
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,020
Master,

625
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
I'm forgetful,

626
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,300
but I'm not a kid.

627
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,660
I'm Wushuang.

628
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,620
The invincible Wushuang.

629
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,900
Wasn't I destined to take this position

630
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,620
from the moment

631
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,660
I got this name?

632
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,620
Step down, Master.

633
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,980
How dare you!

634
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,500
Even if you're the owner

635
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,020
of Wushuang Sword Box,

636
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,220
without the consent of the Five Elders,

637
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,260
you won't be able

638
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,740
to take the seat.

639
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,060
I already sat in the seat.

640
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,260
So what?

641
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,900
Great Elder,

642
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,340
can I take

643
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,620
this position?

644
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,820
-Greetings, City Lord.
-Greetings, City Lord.

645
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:27,100
[Two months later]

646
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,460
Master,

647
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,140
I'm here to fulfill my promise.

648
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,100
I've got three techniques.

649
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,100
Please test them.

650
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,460
Okay.

651
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,860
The first technique

652
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,540
was passed on by Xueyue Sword Deity.

653
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,060
Beautiful Day.

654
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,620
In the end, Minghou

655
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,220
risked his life to kill Sage Tianquan.

656
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,580
He was also severely injured

657
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,900
and rescued by Yueji who rushed there.

658
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,060
Third Master,

659
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,020
what's wrong?

660
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,380
That silly kid went down the mountain.

661
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,460
Went down the mountain?

662
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,780
Go now.

663
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,020
Maybe

664
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,140
you can still

665
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,500
see his last technique.

666
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,780
Well done.

667
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,980
Lei Hong was not as good as you

668
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,980
when he was your age.

669
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,420
Go!

670
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,820
Master,

671
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,100
does this count

672
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,620
as a successful defense?

673
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,100
You barely managed it.

674
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,180
But if this

675
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,740
is all you can manage,

676
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,660
you won't be able to take the other two strikes.

677
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,580
This is the only way I have.

678
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,740
Come back, my sword!

679
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,220
[Dengtian Tower]

680
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,540
What is that?

681
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:34,940
What is it?

682
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,580
It looks like a sword.

683
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,420
The sword is connected to him.

684
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,980
Being able to reach this state,

685
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,060
this martial brother of yours

686
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,060
has achieved the Carefree Phase.

687
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:15,980
The second technique,

688
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,900
Two-Handed Sword Technique.

689
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,060
The first move was passed on

690
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,340
by the swordsman

691
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,140
of the Lei Clan, Lei Hong.

692
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:24,820
The second move

693
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,500
was passed on by Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi.

694
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,740
It's called

695
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,420
Unpredictable Cloud and Mist.

696
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,020
Master, please test

697
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,900
the second skill.

698
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,620
Sure.

699
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,180
I'll show you a technique as well.

700
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,260
It also has a name.

701
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,380
It's called Astonishing Thunder.

702
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,100
Nice defense.

703
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,500
But I guess this was meant to be

704
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,620
the third technique

705
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,380
you prepared.

706
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,540
If there's no other stronger move,

707
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,460
then, the test today...

708
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,300
You...

709
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,940
What is this?

710
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,260
This is my third technique.

711
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,340
It was passed on by my sister.

712
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,100
Go, stab.

713
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,540
Bent your right leg more.

714
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,100
Eyes straight ahead.

715
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,260
Good.

716
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,700
Sancai Sword Technique.

717
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,340
Flat Stab.

718
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,660
Stab.

719
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,220
Sweep.

720
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,180
Back.

721
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:45,900
You

722
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:47,940
already knew it?

723
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,180
Hanyi.

724
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,580
You're a crybaby as always.

725
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,140
Jie,

726
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,300
you've suffered

727
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,740
all these years.

728
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,980
Third Master,

729
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,500
what's going on?

730
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,420
Just now, Second Master...

731
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,700
Hanyi entered the sect

732
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,860
a month earlier than me.

733
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,940
But in fact,

734
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,460
she's four years younger than me.

735
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,940
Her mother

736
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,860
is Li Xinyue, the heiress of Sword Tomb.

737
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,100
Her father is Lei Mengsha of the Lei Clan.

738
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,660
She didn't join the Lei Clan,

739
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,940
so she took her mother's family name.

740
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:21,980
Your Highness,

741
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,020
please don't make things hard for us.

742
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,180
His Majesty has given his order.

743
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,820
If you insist on getting out of here,

744
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,780
you'll be convicted of defrauding the Emperor.

745
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,500
We can execute you before notifying His Majesty.

746
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,780
You can't stop me.

747
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,780
We know you're a martial arts expert.

748
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,380
But we're fearless.

749
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,420
You'll have to go out

750
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,460
over our dead bodies.

751
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,180
Then, try me.

752
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,300
Wait, Your Highness.

753
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,900
[Li Xinyue, Guardian Azure Dragon]

754
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,340
Your Highness,

755
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,380
due to your special status,

756
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,660
you can't go to the execution ground.

757
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,140
Aunt Xinyue,

758
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,020
why are you stopping me too?

759
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:53,940
No.

760
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,380
Leave this to me.

761
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,500
I'll go get His Highness back.

762
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,620
Trust me.

763
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,820
One of the Four Heroes of the Lei Clan,

764
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,940
Lei Mengsha?

765
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,180
Xiao Se,

766
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,780
why are you staring vacantly into space?

767
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,100
Something

768
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,780
is really predestined.

769
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,060
Hanyi,

770
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,660
this is...

771
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,340
This is Mother's Azure Dragon Token.

772
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,620
Twenty years ago,

773
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,660
Mother and Father attacked Pingqing Hall

774
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,220
while protecting the Emperor.

775
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,100
Then, Father

776
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,980
was appointed as one of the Eight Pillars

777
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,780
and served in the expedition against Nanjue.

778
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,220
He died on the battlefield.

779
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,220
Mother and the other three martial arts people

780
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,860
who refused to be officials

781
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,580
were granted the vanity title

782
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,860
of Tianqi's Four Guardians.

783
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,620
[Azure Dragon]
Mother was posted at East.

784
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,220
Her code name was Azure Dragon.

785
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,700
Azure Dragon?

786
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,180
It sounds very strong.

787
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,740
I once

788
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,700
hated this token.

789
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,380
Because I thought

790
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,420
it was this token

791
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,580
that got our mother killed.

792
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,940
But after all, this is Mother's relic.

793
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,460
About Mother,

794
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,900
my master refused to tell me in detail.

795
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,580
I heard it

796
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,260
from the others.

797
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,460
But I don't know

798
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,060
why Mother

799
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,420
would leave me all alone

800
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,420
at Lei Fortress

801
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,540
when I was a kid.

802
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,660
That's because Mother was used

803
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,460
to witnessing the conspiracy in Tianqi City.

804
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,620
She didn't want

805
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,100
you to grow up in such an environment.

806
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,220
She wanted you

807
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,220
to return to the martial arts world

808
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,900
and grow up freely

809
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,300
while staying away from disputes.

810
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,460
Was that so?

811
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,180
Or maybe

812
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,380
Mother could foresee

813
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,420
the coming of that day.

814
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,980
What had exactly happened?

815
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,420
After Mother

816
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,740
was appointed as one of Tianqi's Four Guardians,

817
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,140
she had been working hard

818
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,140
to protect the imperial city.

819
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,820
Until that year,

820
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,500
(Lord Langya's alleged treason)

821
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,060
(shocked everyone in the country.)

822
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,500
(Lord Langya used to be
the backbone of the country.)

823
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,140
(He helped Beili to repel)

824
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,180
(the invasion of Nanjue many times.)

825
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,060
(He was the big hero who everyone admired.)

826
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,580
But he was suddenly imprisoned.

827
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,020
He was convicted

828
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,340
of treason.

829
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,140
Did he do it?

830
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,020
No one believed that it was true.

831
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,100
But ever since he was imprisoned,

832
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,740
Lord Langya had remained silent.

833
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,820
He had never spoken a word.

834
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,140
He didn't admit it

835
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,900
(or defend himself.)

836
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,180
(Among Tianqi's Seven Censors
who interrogated him,)

837
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,860
(three of them reckoned he was innocent.)

838
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,260
(But on the next day,)

839
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,260
(they were found dead at their houses.)

840
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,940
Emperor Mingde wanted him dead.

841
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,180
So no reason was needed.

842
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,370
It didn't even need evidence.

843
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,580
But that day

844
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,740
when he was executed...

845
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,660
What happened?

846
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,860
[Execute]

847
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,740
Your Highness.

848
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,100
[Xiao Ruofeng, Lord Langya]

849
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:06,980
Who are you?

850
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,260
Azure Dragon?

851
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,820
Li Xinyue?

852
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:14,980
Mother showed up.
