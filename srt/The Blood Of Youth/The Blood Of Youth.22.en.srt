Xiao Chuhe?

26
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,650
Lord Yong'an?

27
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,530
Do you need to get so worked up about this?

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,860
Why can't I?

29
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,220
It's too late

30
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,220
to throw us off the ship now.

31
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,730
You're the Lord Yong'an

32
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,010
who'd rather get punished

33
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,090
for protecting Lord Langya

00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,570
than change the decision

35
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,500
despite losing his title and status

36
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,650
and ending up wandering the martial arts world?

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,250
Good!

38
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,250
Great!

39
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,570
I've heard many things about you!

40
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,850
I admire you!

41
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,370
The world thinks

42
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,650
I am guilty.

43
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,570
Well,

44
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,130
that's only what they think.

45
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,130
Who is Lord Langya?

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,740
He would never commit treason!

47
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,500
There is no such reasoning in books.

48
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,570
And there shouldn't be

49
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,340
such nonsense

50
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,530
in this world.

51
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,810
I'm only upset

52
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,570
that I can't stand by your side

53
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,780
and fight for justice

54
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,370
with you.

55
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,220
You really are

56
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,810
the silly son of a wealthy family.

57
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,900
Mr. Mu,

58
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,620
if you encounter trouble on the island,

59
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,570
find the Golden Marquis Lanyue.

60
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,620
He will help you.

61
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,220
Golden Marquis Lanyue.

62
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,850
He is an admirable character too.

63
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,500
All right.

64
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,530
I'll remember that.

65
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,460
Come on.

66
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,460
Let's drink.

67
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,130
This liquor is called Qiulubai.

68
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,620
It's produced by the Diaolou Parlor

69
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,690
in the imperial capital, Tianqi.

70
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,130
They only bring out three jugs of this

71
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:11,530
to serve their guests

72
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,060
on the 15th

73
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,220
of every month.

74
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,570
Even for us, the Mu family of Qingzhou,

75
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,460
it took quite a bit of effort

76
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,780
to acquire this one jug.

77
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,780
You're a member of the imperial family, Xiao.

78
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,370
You must miss this liquor.

79
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,020
Mu Chunfeng,

80
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,940
let me give you a piece of advice.

81
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,180
You know Xiao Se's identity now.

82
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,020
It's not a big deal

83
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,340
if you want to get close to him
and form connections.

84
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,900
But you should ask him

85
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,370
whether he wants to be the Emperor first.

86
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,410
Be careful so that you don't misjudge
another person again.

87
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,130
Does it matter whether he wants
to be the Emperor or not?

88
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,970
I'm a merchant.

89
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,530
You can suspect my intentions,

90
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,130
but you can't doubt

91
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,650
my judge of character.

92
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,250
This is Hantanxiang.

93
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,340
It's a famous liquor of Luoxiang City in Nanjue.

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,370
Once the liquor is made,

95
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,130
it is stored underneath a deep cold pond

96
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,370
and taken out after one year.

97
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,500
It is chilly when you drink it,

98
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,900
and it has a faint peach blossom fragrance.

99
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
It's even better than Qiulubai.

100
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,370
Hantanxiang.

101
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,770
It is a rare liquor indeed.

102
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,300
You guys don't drink much, do you?

103
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,540
I do.

104
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,810
I love drinking!

105
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,060
What do you guys

106
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,130
usually drink?

107
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,740
Beauty of Four Seasons is on the milder side,

108
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,330
but it's the one I drink the most.

109
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,890
Different festivities

110
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,980
call for different liquors.

111
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,180
Sangluo, Xinfeng, and Tusu

112
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,370
are all fine liquor.

113
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,010
But the best

114
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,890
is the Seven Starry Nights.

115
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,620
I don't get many chances to drink it, however.

116
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,180
But sometimes, I get to savor it,
thanks to Third Master.

117
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,660
You get to drink Seven Starry Nights?

118
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,540
I often drink that liquor too.

119
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,210
What's the big deal?

120
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,620
I think

121
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,570
it's not as good as Beauty of Four Seasons.

122
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,330
It's too strong

123
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,540
and not sweet enough.

124
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,540
Did you forget

125
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,660
who my master is?

126
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:15,810
Come.

127
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:16,890
Let's drink Han…

128
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,980
Let's drink.

129
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,450
Xiao.

130
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,180
A toast to everyone.

131
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,370
The smell of the peach blossoms is so fragrant!

132
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,890
Good liquor.

133
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,500
It is great liquor indeed.

134
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:44,890
Tang,

135
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,010
I'm a liquor enthusiast as well.

136
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,620
Will you let me try

137
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,860
some of the Seven Starry Nights

138
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,220
when we go back to Beili?

139
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,010
It's a little embarrassing to say this,

140
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,740
but we snuck out and finished

141
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,940
the last pot

142
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,260
of that liquor last time.

143
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,890
My master is away on a trip.

144
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,180
We don't know

145
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,450
when he will return.

146
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:03,940
Never mind then.

147
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,660
Scholarly Sword Deity gave you

148
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,300
the Book of Liquor, didn't he?

149
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,210
Shouldn't that book include the method to make it?

150
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,210
The Book of Liquor?

151
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,860
May I have a look at it, Tang?

152
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,540
Are you interested in making liquor?

153
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,500
[The Book of Liquor]
So this is the book…

154
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,100
It really is this book…

155
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,130
Is it valuable?

156
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,940
It's priceless!

157
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,210
No.

158
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,620
I mustn't keep reading.

159
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,060
If I do,

160
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,180
I would be no better than a thief.

161
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,810
You're too harsh on yourself.

162
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,370
It's just a book about making liquor.

163
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,660
I'm not interested in it anyway.

164
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,770
But it was a gift from an elder,

165
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,210
so I can't let you have it.

166
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,250
If you like it,

167
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,620
you can keep it with you for a few days.

168
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,180
Fool…

169
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,420
Foolish!

170
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,500
Drink 30 cups of liquor in a row,

171
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,500
and your inner force and aura
will be greatly improved.

172
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,010
I've only heard

173
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,130
them say this,

174
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:09,770
so I don't know much about it,

175
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,940
but what I cherish

176
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:12,860
will not be as simple

177
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,940
as you think it is.

178
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,010
I…

179
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,540
I just remembered.

180
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,940
After drinking Principal City Lord's liquor,

181
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,980
my power and skill improved by leaps and bounds

182
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,210
the next morning.

183
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,540
Could that method of making the liquor

184
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,740
be written in this book too?

185
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,370
It's true that the liquor Master made

186
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,660
can boost one's cultivation.

187
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,450
Did he really learn how to make liquor

188
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,250
from this book?

189
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,330
Even if it isn't true,

190
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,660
you can make liquor for us

191
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,300
after studying

192
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,500
that book.

193
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,980
Don't drink too much.

194
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,770
It's good liquor,

195
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,180
but it's one of the strongest there is.

196
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:54,890
Great liquor!

197
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,860
Lei Wujie!

198
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,300
Where are you going?

199
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,500
I wish to travel north with the wind,

200
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:10,300
watching the snow sweeping across the land.

201
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,810
I wish to travel east with the ship,

202
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,770
seeing the elegant fairy brave the wind.

203
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,890
I wish to travel far with the clouds,

204
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,940
even the emperor ruling the court cannot stop me.

205
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,450
I will bathe in sunlight
on the top of Mount Kunlun.

206
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,210
I will witness lush mountains rise
at the edge of the ocean.

207
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,180
We shall reunite after a long journey.

208
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,970
But I won't go home unless I've seen the world.

209
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,730
"But I won't go home unless I've seen the world."

210
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,730
Great poem.

211
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,660
It is poetic and bold.

212
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,300
But I've never heard it before.

213
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,180
Who wrote this poem?

214
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,180
A peculiar man in this world

215
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,140
who also happens to be my friend.

216
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:11,970
One.

217
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,210
Two.

218
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,020
Three.

219
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,260
Lift that sword higher.

220
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,260
Position your fingers correctly.

221
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,660
Lunge.

222
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,610
-Go lower in your horse stance.
-Look.

223
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,140
With all of them gone,

224
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,490
Luo Mingxuan

225
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,540
has become

226
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,420
the eldest disciple here now.

227
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,330
Four.

228
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,300
He isn't the best cultivator himself.

229
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,660
He had better not misguide the others.

230
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,090
Keep going.

231
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,420
-We have a guest.
-Hold it.

232
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,450
Baixiao Sect?

233
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:45,940
One.

234
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,540
City Lord Sikong.

235
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,090
Elder Yin.

236
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:50,730
It is an honor to meet you.

237
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,300
What brings a disciple of the Baixiao Sect

238
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,210
to Xueyue City?

239
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,850
The storm has calmed.

240
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,850
Martial artists are ranked
on the Golden Ranking.

241
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,260
The Golden Ranking?

242
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,570
The Baixiao Sect hasn't released

243
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,940
the Golden Ranking in many years.

244
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,940
It seems that Baixiao Sect believes

245
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,970
the battle at the Lei Fortress

246
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,540
marks a new beginning for the martial arts world.

247
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,690
Spear Deity, please read the ranking.

248
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,450
Let me see it.

249
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,060
You read it.

250
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,690
Thank you, Third City Lord.

251
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,090
The first ranking of the Golden Ranking.

252
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,260
Weapon Mastery Ranking.

253
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,020
Spear Deity, Sikong Changfeng.

254
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,420

255
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,610

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,660

259
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,940

00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,690
Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi.

262
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,970
Weapons, Iron Glacier and Peach Blossom.

263
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,660
The Tao Sword Deity has fallen.

264
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,450
Only four Sword Deities remain.

265
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,090
What a pity.

266
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,020
Indeed.

267
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,900
Blade Deities.

268
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,810
Tyrant Blade, Tan Taipo.

269
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,330
Weapon, Kirin Moon.

270
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,020

Weapon, Yinyang.

Tender Blade, Su Yuluo.

273
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,810
Weapon, Chiluo.

274
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,780
Liquor Deity,

275
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,180
Baili Dongjun.

276
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,780
Weapon…

277
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,090
Fists and everything else.

278
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:30,490
Master,

279
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,210
I see my name!

280
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,260
Look!

281
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,090
I'm in eighth place on the second ranking,

282
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,660
the Jade Ranking.

283
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,570
Luo Mingxuan, a disciple of Xueyue City.

284
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,380
Master, I made it into the ranking!

285
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,490
You only barely made it.

286
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,810
What's there to be happy about?

287
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,490
Next year,

288
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,060
I'll get a higher ranking for sure!

289
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,450
Let's see who is in seventh place.

290
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,490
It's Qianluo!

291
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,300
Sikong Qianluo,

292
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,450
a disciple of Xueyue City.

293
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,810
In sixth place, Li Fansong,
a disciple of Mount Wangcheng.

294
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,210
In fifth place,

295
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,450
Lei Wujie, a disciple of the Sword Heart Tomb

296
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,490
of Xueyue City's Lei Fortress.

297
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,210
That's a long title.

298
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,450
In fourth place,

299
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,020
Tang Ze, a disciple of the Tang Clan.

300
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,850
In third place, Tang Lian,
a disciple of Xueyue City.

301
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,300
There is no second place.

302
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:12,940
No second place?

303
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,540
Second place?

304
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,020
There are two people in first place!

305
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,380
Two people in first place?

306
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,140
Jade Ranking.

307
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,490
First place.

308
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,210
Wushuang, a disciple of Wushuang City.

309
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,660
First place.

310
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,940
Ye Anshi, a disciple of Tianwaitian.

311
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:27,660
This…

312
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,450
Four of Xueyue City's disciples
made it on the list.

313
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,850
But none of them

314
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:31,850
was able to take first place.

315
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,450
The martial arts world is filled
with capable talents.

316
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,260
It's not a big deal even if we don't get first place.

317
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:39,970
There is one more ranking

318
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,210
that I will relay verbally.

319
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,090
What?

320
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,900
The Top-Rank List.

321
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,730
The Top-Rank List?

322
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,300
I've never heard of that.

323
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,380
Hasn't that been stopped

324
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,090
a long time ago?

325
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:48,660
It was stopped a long time ago.

326
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,610
Why are they bringing it up again?

327
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,420
Master, what does this mean?

328
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,490
The top.

329
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,730
As the name implies,

330
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,140
it means the top of the world.

331
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,610
Once the names are listed on that ranking,

332
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,660
the first place and second place will emerge.

333
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,610
The second place

334
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,140
will always go after the first place.

335
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,180
And the one in first place

336
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,020
will have to face challenges
from the entire world.

337
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,660
From what I know,

338
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,610
Ji Ruofeng sealed that list

339
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,780
over ten years ago.

340
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,330
And now, it has been brought back.

341
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,180
Is the competition for the most powerful

342
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,690
in the world

343
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,180
about to end here?

344
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,300
I'm just the messenger.

345
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,090
If Xueyue City does not wish to hear it,

346
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,180
I will take my leave.

347
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,570
No.

348
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,140
Tell us.

349
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,180
In fourth place on the Top-Rank List,

350
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,210
Yan Zhantian.

351
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,090
Tan Taipo.

352
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,660
Xie Xuan.

353
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,180
Li Tian.

354
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,180
In third place on the Top-Rank List,

355
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Sikong Changfeng.

356
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,420
Moon Snatcher.

357
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,260
Tang Lianyue.

358
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,380
In second place on the Top-Rank List,

359
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,260
Luo Qingyang.

360
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,090
It looks like

361
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,020
Principal City Lord is in first place, after all.

362
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,300
And Baili Dongjun.

363
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,330
I still haven't heard my name

364
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,690
even until now.

365
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,090
Could it be that I am in first place?

366
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,490
The Head of Baixiao Sect says

367
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,970
that you have fallen
from your initial phase for some time now.

368
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,940
Now, you've returned to the Insouciant Phase.

369
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,540
On Mount Wangcheng,

370
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,330
your battle with Zhao Yuzhen

371
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:14,970
ended in a tie as well.

372
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,540
Although Zhao Yuzhen held back,

373
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,090
you will surely return

374
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:18,850
to the peak soon.

375
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,690
No need to fret.

376
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,420
This is all within expectations.

377
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,140
What surprised me
is the fact that there is someone else

378
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,420
that can rank above

379
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,090
Baili Dongjun

380
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,540
and Luo Qingyang.

381
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,450
That's right.

382
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,810
The first place should either be Luo Qingyang

383
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,780
or Baili Dongjun.

384
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,060
And you put them both in second place.

385
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,020
Then…

386
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,970
First place on the Top-Rank List.

387
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,210
There is someone in first place?

388
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:40,690
Really?

389
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,380
Is there someone even more powerful
than Principal City Lord?

390
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:42,780
Who?

391
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,450
In first place on the Top-Rank List,

392
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,900
Mo Yi.

393
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,810
Who is that?

394
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,210
-I don't know him.
-I've never heard of him.

395
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,020
Where did he come from?

396
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,020
Tell me.

397
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,610
Who is Mo Yi?

398
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,140
I've been the superintendent of the Lei Fortress

399
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,260
for 20 years.

400
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,420
I know the martial arts world
like the back of my hand.

401
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,330
Yet, I've never heard

402
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,970
of this name.

403
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,730
Mo Yi…

404
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,730
It has been so long since I last heard that name.

405
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,140
We've been traveling for so long.

406
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,450
We're finally close to our destination.

407
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,330
The Sanshe Island is up ahead.

408
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,850
Rest assured, Mr. Mu.

409
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,020
We will get you

410
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,730
what you need.

411
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,450
That won't be necessary.

412
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,730
His body can't hold on much longer.

413
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,180
You guys should get a move on.

414
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,180
We, the Mu family,

415
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,610
will handle the matter

416
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,940
on Sanshe Island ourselves.

417
00:15:59,490 --> 00:15:59,780
All right.

418
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,810
Thank you.

419
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,330
Oh, right.

420
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,090
I have some poison with me.

421
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,450
It might be useful

422
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,090
when catching snakes.

423
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,490
Take this.

424
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,420
Thank you.

425
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,570
Mr. Mu,

426
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,300
you've already come this far.

427
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,540
Are you sure you won't follow us to the island

428
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,900
to see the immortal?

429
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,380
I'll pass.

430
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,060
Compared to immortals and divine beings,

431
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,210
my brother's happiness

432
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,090
is more important.

433
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,660
Xiao,

434
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,810
no one has ever seen the world

435
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,330
beyond Sanshe Island.

436
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,450
Will you be able to find what you seek?

437
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,660
Besides, how will you

438
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,730
navigate your way

439
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,940
in the vast sea?

440
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,810
What's your suggestion, Mr. Mu?

441
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,940
To prevent any accidents,

442
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,420
we've recruited

443
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,060
an astrologer

444
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
before embarking on this trip.

445
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,540
I studied astrology too.

446
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,090
I can find my own way.

447
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,490
What good

448
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,900
will your limited skills be?

449
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,900
-Miss Ye!
-Ye!

450
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,300
Miss Ye,

451
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,970
didn't you return to Tianqi

452
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,620
with the general?

453
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,340
I didn't really want to go back,

454
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,100
so I slipped out when I found a chance.

455
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,290
Then, you're here…

456
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,900
To help him, of course.

457
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,660
I don't know what my father thinks.

458
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,530
All I want is to help him return to Tianqi.

459
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,250
Because I helped you when we were younger?

460
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,050
No.

461
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,140
Because we're friends.

462
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,250
That's right!

463
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,340
We're friends!

464
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,340
Friends will travel thousands of miles

465
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,690
to help one another.

466
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,730
Well, I bet you're happy.

467
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,050
I haven't seen you in a while.

468
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
It has been a while.

469
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,290
Um…

470
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,820
You look even more beautiful now.

471
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,940
Miss Ye, you may be young,

472
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,970
but you're far more capable

473
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,770
than the masters

474
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,210
who've studied astrology for decades.

475
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,140
I was wondering

476
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,180
why you would answer

477
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,290
my recruitment.

478
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,140
So you came

479
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,820
for Xiao.

480
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:58,900
Perfect.

481
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,940
We have a map

482
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,580
of Sanshe Island.

483
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,580
Miss Ye,

484
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,970
you should go to the island

485
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,620
with Xiao.

486
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:05,820
Thank you.

487
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:07,820
Xiao,

488
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,380
when should I come and retrieve you?

489
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,490
How much time do I have left?

490
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:18,620
Five days.

491
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,450
Make it seven days then.

492
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,580
Come and get me in seven days.

493
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,580
All right.

494
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,290
I will come and pick all of you up

495
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,290
in seven days.

496
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,420
Please stay safe,

497
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,940
everyone.

498
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,970
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

499
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,140
Thank you.

500
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,770
I will.

501
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,290
Is this the undercurrent

502
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,010
Principal City Lord mentioned on the map?

503
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,340
Yes, the undercurrent is up ahead.

504
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,490
Be careful, Lei Wujie!

505
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,290
Hold on to the oars!

506
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,380
Hold on tight, everyone!

507
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,660

I'm in no mood

523
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,010
to appreciate the scenery.

524
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,340
I just want

525
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,970
to find a place

526
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,010
to sleep.

527
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,100
It's a pity

528
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,970
there isn't an immortal
in this beautiful scenery.

529
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,010
There's a deity on the island.

530
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,140
He can ride clouds,

531
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,490
harness wind,

532
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,420
co-exist with Heaven and Earth,

533
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,180
and live as long as the sun and the moon.

534
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,290
He must be what they were talking about.

535
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,900
Guests have arrived.

536
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,010
[Mo Yi]
A pleasure to meet you.

537
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,250
Immortal,

538
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,820
we apologize

539
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,140
for intruding.

540
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,010
Few have been able

541
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,530
to reach this place

542
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,660
over the years.

543
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,380
Since you're here,

544
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,010
it must be fate.

545
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,340
There is no intrusion to speak of.

546
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,940
He seems like

547
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,770
an approachable guy.

548
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,490
Let's go!

549
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,010
I sense a familiar aura

550
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,940
on that immortal.

551
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,820
Have you met him before?

552
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,970
Yes and no.

553
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,900
I can't be sure.

554
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,970
Where did you guys come from?

555
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,970
From Beili.

556
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,100
Beili?

557
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,970
I haven't heard that name

558
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,690
for a while.

559
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,380
Do you know Beili, Immortal?

560
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,660
Not only do I know the name,

561
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,530
but it's also my birthplace.

562
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,900
I spent a long time there

563
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,530
in the past.

564
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,140
It seems

565
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,340
that you have traveled far.

566
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,210
You must be tired.

567
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,210
Since you're here,

568
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,340
there is no need to hold back.

569
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:38,900
Thank you, Immortal.

570
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,380
Immortal,

571
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,620
instead of pointing at me with your finger,

572
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,140
can you please touch my head?

573
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,050
Why?

574
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,180
It is written in the books
that if an immortal touches your head,

575
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,450
you will be granted longevity.

576
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,730
I wish to have a long life.

577
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,380
Someone once asked me

578
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,450
to do that.

579
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,770
And?

580
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,450
I shattered the cliff he was cultivating on

581
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,900
in one hit.

582
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,140
Um…

583
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,420
You can just point at me then.

584
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,450
Just pointing between my eyes will do.

585
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,100
So you two are the ones who seek my aid.

586
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,530
Why do you think it is us?

587
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,660
The three of them

588
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,900
may be physically and mentally exhausted,

589
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,820
but their auras remain strong.

590
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,140
They'll recover after a night's sleep.

591
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,340
But the two of you are different.

592
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,970
The aura of one of you is in a state of disarray.

593
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,770
You're on the verge of death.

594
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,730
The other was born with a defect.

595
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,210
You should already be dead.

596
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:58,970
As expected of an immortal.

597
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,770
He doesn't even need to check their pulse.

598
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:01,580
One look,

599
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,210
and he already knows what's wrong with them.

600
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,010
You are correct, sir.

601
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,140
You carry

602
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,420
a familiar presence.

603
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,580
Have we met before,

604
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,530
Immortal?

605
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,180
No need to call me that.

606
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,970
My name is Mo Yi.

607
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,530
Mo Yi…

608
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,450
Sir,

609
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,010
are you an immortal or…

610
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,340
I am already 64 years old.

611
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,860
You look like

612
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,140
you're only Lian's age!

613
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,420
You really are an immortal!

614
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,940
My master once told me

615
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,380
that the celestialhood
is something entirely different.

616
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,900
In my current state,

617
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,730
I can only be considered an Earth Deity.

618
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:47,970
Earth Deity?

619
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,140
An earth deity

620
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,820
can only change matters of the earth

621
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,380
but not of heaven.

622
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:54,580
Sir,

623
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,140
is our case

624
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,140
a matter of the earth?

625
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,380
Of course.

626
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,940
I can heal both of them

627
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,690
and they can be cured.

628
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,010
That's great!

629
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,450
However,

630
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,730
I have a condition.

631
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,940
Deities have conditions too?

632
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:11,820
Of course.

633
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,900
I will help you with your problem on earth,

634
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,900
and you must help me change heaven's will.

635
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,140
What do you wish to change?

636
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,420
I want to bring someone who's gone

637
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,490
back to this realm.

638
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,900
How can we help you?

639
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,290
You only have three days at most.

640
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,620
Tomorrow,

641
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,380
I will ask one thing from you.

642
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,050
If you can give me that item,

643
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,420
I will cure you.

644
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,140
What is it?

645
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,660
You'll know when the time comes.

646
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,250
Mr. Mo Yi,

647
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,100
have you ever met my master,

648
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,900
Baili Dongjun?

649
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,010
He left the city a year ago

650
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,180
for the immortal realm across the seas

651
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,900
in search of a brew.

652
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,340
Did you ever

653
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,660
come across him?

654
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,250
I met him once many years ago.

655
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,450
He is an interesting man.

656
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,420
He makes fine liquor.

657
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,340
I haven't seen him

658
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,290
since we parted ways.

659
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,940
Perhaps

660
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:14,940
he deceived you.

661
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,140
(Three days from now,)

662
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,260
(I will give you a new body.)

663
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,470
(You will give me what I seek.)

664
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,470
He is no deity.

665
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,150
What kind of deity makes demands and deals?

666
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,300
You burn incense

667
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,390
when you pray at the temples.

668
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,060
Moreover,

669
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,300
we're the ones who seek his help.

670
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,580
It's only natural that we have to pay the price.

671
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,780
But I am curious.

672
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,300
What do we have

673
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,500
that he would need?

674
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,820
I have an inkling.

675
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,710
Instead of the immortal realm,

676
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,470
it's closer to another legendary phase

677
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,020
we speak of in the martial arts world.

678
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,820
The Unbeatable Phase.

679
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,580
Yes.

680
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,060
You sit and concentrate in silence,

681
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,150
but your mind and soul wander
a thousand lis away.

682
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,020
It is the highest phase

683
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,230
that reigns above the Insouciant Phase.

684
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,910
Even my master was never able

685
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,870
to reach this phase.

686
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,470
Mr. Mo Yi's footwork that allows him

687
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,020
to move as swiftly and fleetingly as the wind

688
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,390
resembles more of one that has reached

689
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,870
the Unbeatable Phase.

690
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,910
It doesn't matter if he is a deity

691
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,340
or if he has reached the Unbeatable Phase.

692
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,950
I think something's strange

693
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,630
about him.

694
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,740
I have cultivated for a long time

695
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,540
under Supervisor Qi.

696
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,910
He has an aura that is similar

697
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,020
to that of the State Preceptor.

698
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,710
They might have cultivated
under the same master.

699
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,540
What's more,

700
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,630
the aura he carried

701
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,990
was stronger than the State Preceptor.

702
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,780
But when he spoke of his wish,

703
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,260
the look in his eyes changed.

704
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,060
How did it change?

705
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,990
From that of a deity to a demon.

706
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,470
It sends a shiver down one's spine.

707
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,780
Mr. Mo Yi

708
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,990
is different from what we imagined.

709
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,780
What should we do then?

710
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,950
Xiao Se only has three days left

711
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,020
to live.

712
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,910
Let's wait and see what happens first.

713
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,820
See if we can find

714
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,470
any clues

715
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,500
within these three days.

716
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,340
Maybe we're overthinking it.

717
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,150
You guys stay here.

718
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,670
I'll look for my master.

719
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:02,990
Lian,

720
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,300
you…

721
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,230
Don't worry.

722
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,630
I know my master.

723
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,100
He will do it

724
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,740
as long as he promised.

725
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,540
I have faith

726
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,670
that he is in this celestial mountain.

727
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,670
I think Baili Dongjun

728
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,190
was here too.

729
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,620
[Young Mo Yi,
selling oneself for the burial of family]

730
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:45,950
Master.

731
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,870
[Young Qi Tianchen]
Can we help him?

732
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,850
[Taoist Qingfeng]

733
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,580
Are you a deity?

734
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,670
No.

735
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,950
I'm just an ordinary person.

736
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,670
Will you buy me, sir?

737
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,190
I can help you bury your sister,

738
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,740
but I won't buy you.

739
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,230
You only need to become my disciple

740
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,260
and cultivate with me.

741
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,230
Cultivate?

742
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,430
As in, become a deity?

743
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,260
If I become one,

744
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,910
can I bring my sister back to life?

745
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,020
I can't do that.

746
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,430
Neither have I ever met anyone capable of it.

747
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,300
But you'll be much more powerful than me

748
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,340
in the future.

749
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,670
I'm not as powerful as you are.

750
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,060
It's not for me to say if you can do it or not.

751
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,060
All right. I'll do as you say.

752
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,910
What's your name?

753
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,390
My name's Mo Yi.

754
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,190
Mo Yi.

755
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,630
Ruoyi,

756
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,430
yesterday, you said Mo Yi and Qi Tianchen

757
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,740
carried a similar aura.

758
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,870
Could he be
from the Directorate of Astronomy too?

759
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,580
Before joining the Directorate of Astronomy,

760
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,540
the State Preceptor once studied
under Taoist Qingfeng

761
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,910
of Mount Huanglong.

762
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,260
He once told me

763
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,470
that in his later years,

764
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,780
Taoist Qingfeng took in a young disciple.

765
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,630
That disciple had incredible talent.

766
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,060
Within three years,

767
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,670
his cultivation and attainments

768
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,470
have reached the top two in the ranking,

769
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,820
second only to the State Preceptor.

770
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,670
But at that time, the State Preceptor

771
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,630
had already been cultivating for 16 years.

772
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,540
Yet, it only took
that disciple three years to catch up.

773
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Three years.

774
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,190
If he had stayed in Beili,

775
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,190
he would've been sure
to take the highest rank someday.

776
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,470
Yet, he insisted on going out to sea

777
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,470
to seek the path of immortality.

778
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,260
He wants to get away from the mortal world

779
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,670
and become a true immortal.

780
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,500
Taoist Qingfeng couldn't change his mind

781
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,950
and set out with him.

782
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,060
But he has never returned since.

783
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,190
So you suspect

784
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,910
that disciple is Mo Yi.

785
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,950
If it is him…

786
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,990
Then what he said
about changing the mandate of heaven

787
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,300
would mean reviving his little sister.

788
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,580
She has already been deceased for so many years.

789
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,990
Even her remains

790
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,260
would be long gone now.

791
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:20,990
How can she be revived?

792
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,500
Mortality is heaven's will.

793
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,470
Going against that would mean
going against heaven's will.

794
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,340
But we must cure you.

795
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,990
There is no turning back.

796
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,260
Listen closely to what I'm about to tell you next.

797
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,990
This is our only chance.

798
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,150
Is anyone in?

799
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,430
Can you spare me a steamed bun?

800
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,870
I'll repay you when I grow up.

801
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,190
Is anyone inside?

802
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,390
Is anyone there?

803
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,260
Can you give me some congee?

804
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,580
My little sister is starving!

805
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,500
I can work for you! I don't need any money!

806
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,820
Is anyone in?

807
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,020
Anyone?

808
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:22,990
Is anyone in?

809
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,710
Is anyone inside?

810
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,260
If my father

811
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,470
hadn't saved you back then,

812
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,630
all of you would be dead!

813
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,470
I can't believe you guys would leave us to die!

814
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,060
Yi,

815
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,500
you're back.

816
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:41,950
Lyu'er,

817
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,500
I'm useless.

818
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,740
I didn't manage to find any food.

819
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,190
Look what this is, Yi!

820
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,100
Flatbread?

821
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,260
Where did you get this from?

822
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,540
A kind abbot

823
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,910
passed by earlier.

824
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,500
He gave me two pieces of flatbread.

825
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,060
I've already eaten one.

826
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,340
I saved this one for you.

827
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,430
You've already eaten?

828
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,180
Lyu'er?

829
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:31,700
Lyu'er?

830
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:33,830
Lyu'er!

831
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:34,830
Wake up!

832
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,750
(Lyu'er, Lyu'er!)

833
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,220
My dear Lyu'er,

834
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,390
I have faith

835
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,430
that we will be reunited soon.

836
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:15,830
Mr. Mo Yi.

837
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,830
Even though
you're just an insignificant character,

838
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,580
you are a nuisance.

839
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,390
Why did you do that, Mr. Mo Yi?

840
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,270
An immortal is unaffected by emotions.

841
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,350
So these are your true colors.

842
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,830
You're clever

843
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,620
and capable.

844
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,660
Unfortunately,

845
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,310
this time,

846
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,500
you must die.

847
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,390
Master…

848
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,700
Is it you, Master?

849
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,350
Master, are you here?

850
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,350
Has he awoken?

851
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,540
Impossible.

852
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,390
Are you here?

853
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,100
So he isn't awake.

854
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,310
He is familiar

855
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,620
with your aura,

856
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,500
and he protected you instinctively.

857
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:35,790
So be it.

858
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,790
He will never wake up

859
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,060
after drinking the Oblivion Broth.

860
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,790
I'll seal him and his disciple

861
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,990
in this cave forever.

862
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,540
Could my master be in here?

863
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,100
Master!

864
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,910
Master?

865
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,910
Master, wake up.

866
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,700
It's me, Tang Lian.

867
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,310
Master.

868
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,140
Master!

869
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,470
What did he drink

870
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:47,790
that put him in such a deep sleep?

871
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,500
Oblivion Broth.

872
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,310
(Third place on the Top-Rank List.)

873
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,390
(Baili Dongjun of Xueyue City.)

874
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,020
Master!

875
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:02,870
Master!

876
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,700
I've made a name for myself in the world!

877
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,830
I don't understand.

878
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,470
Why are you so determined

879
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,470
to make yourself renowned in this world?

880
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,220
When I was young,

881
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,910
I met a girl.

882
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,470
It was love at first sight.

883
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:17,910
She told me…

884
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,140
When you become

885
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,270
someone famous,

886
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,790
I'll know where you are

887
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,470
and come to find you.

888
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,220
The time I become famous

889
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,060
is the time we will be reunited.

890
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,430
I think she's here.

891
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,540
(Who are you?)

892
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,580
(Are you asking for my name?)

893
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,660

00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,500

you remember those that you've forgotten,

and the ones you've lost will return.

934
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,910
