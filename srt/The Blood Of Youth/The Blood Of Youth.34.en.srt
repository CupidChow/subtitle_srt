[The Blood of Youth]

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,970
[Episode 34]

25
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,960
If I'm right,

26
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,080
the war

27
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,800
in Tianqi City

28
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,360
has started by now.

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,800
Yes.

30
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,270
I wonder

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,110
how my crazy nephew

32
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,000
is doing now.

33
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,600
I guess he's being

34
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,640
condemned and accused

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,430
of being a traitor.

36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,270
Many people

37
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,710
can't wait to tear him apart

38
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,800
and gobble him up.

39
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,110
Looking at the bright side,

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,110
maybe he has reunited

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,830
with Xiao Lingchen

42
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,800
and avenged Lord Langya.

43
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,520
Perhaps they're

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
sharing the throne now.

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,550
It seems

46
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,760
like you still don't trust us.

47
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,430
Watch out!

48
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,200
What are you doing, Jinwei?

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,240
Are you insane?

50
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,270
All of you have forgotten

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,920
about Master's wish.

52
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,110
But I still remember it.

53
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,800
I just didn't expect

54
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,270
we would eventually count on

55
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
a good-for-nothing.

56
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,710
A good-for-nothing?

57
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,270
For the sake of your interests,

58
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,640
you used my father's prestige

59
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,670
and the public's confidence in him

60
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,920
to make him take the throne,

61
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,150
sowing discord among the Emperor and officials

62
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,960
and destabilizing the kingdom.

63
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,920
My father sacrificed himself

64
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,480
for the common good.

65
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,320
Do you want me to make

66
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,390
the same mistake again?

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,830
Lord Langya's name

68
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,640
was written on the scroll, to begin with.

69
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,760
He was supposed to be the Emperor!

70
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,390
It's ridiculous.

71
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,430
There are people who want to be the Emperor.

72
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,110
But I didn't know

73
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,320
that someone must be the Emperor.

74
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,520
My father didn't like that position.

75
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,270
He refused to take it.

76
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,360
What can you do?

77
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,040
I'm not interested either.

78
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,590
How do you like me now?

79
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,200
Jinwei,

80
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,520
stop it.

81
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,110
Stop making it worse.

82
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
My sword technique is no match for you.

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,320
If it wasn't for Master,

84
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,870
I would've died when I was five.

85
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,040
I just want to do something for him.

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,320
There's a thing I must tell you.

87
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,430
The person who killed Jinyu

88
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,200
was neither me

89
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,080
nor Jinyan.

90
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,680
We aren't capable of doing that.

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,790
Jinwei!

92
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:26,960
General,

93
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,080
what should we do now?

94
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,440
Go forward!

95
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,880
Here comes the news!

96
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,790
Stop!

97
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,230
General,

98
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,590
there's an army ahead.

99
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,080
An army?

100
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,880
Is it Chen Kui's lower army

101
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,000
that comes and meets us?

102
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,760
At his pace,

103
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,270
they shouldn't be here so soon.

104
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,080
It's not the lower army.

105
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,680
It's Wangli Heavenly Soldiers

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,270
who guard Tianqi City.

107
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,000
Wangli Heavenly Soldiers?

108
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,120
Stay alert!

109
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,320
Watch out, General!

110
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,960
It really is Wangli Heavenly Soldiers.

111
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,120
Why would they

112
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,270
show up here?

113
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,960
Mr. Cheng,

114
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,000
you must be confused.

115
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,790
My father

116
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,960
is attacking Tianqi City.

117
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,030
Yet, I show up here

118
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,880
with Wangli Heavenly Soldiers,

119
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,470
trying to stop the upper and lower armies.

120
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,520
Sometimes when the lord is too smart,

121
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,350
the counselor

122
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,520
might seem to be redundant.

123
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,640
I was worried at first.

124
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,150
But seeing them

125
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,120
cower in fear,

126
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,590
it gives me more confidence.

127
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,880
It seems like Xiao Se

128
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,350
has made

129
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,760

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,790
he's exonerated

192
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,950
and granted the posthumous title
of "Distinguished".

193
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
He's readmitted
to the Imperial Ancestral Shrine.

194
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,760
He'll be worshipped and honored forever.

195
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,070
His son,

196
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,040
Xiao Lingchen,

197
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,000
inherits

198
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,310
the title of Lord Langya,

199
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,280
named General Xuanwu.

200
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,070
He's allowed to reassemble

201
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,160
the former Langya Army.

202
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,120
It's independent of the Three Armies

203
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,000
and directly under the Emperor.

204
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,040
His son, Xiao Lingchen,

205
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,640
inherits the title

206
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,920
of Lord Langya,

207
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,670
named General Xuanwu.

208
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,470
He's allowed to reassemble
the former Langya Army.

209
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,640
It's independent of the Three Armies

210
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,280
and directly under the Emperor.

211
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,000
I

212
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,120
trusted the wrong people

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,880
and killed my beloved brother.

214
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,240
I deeply regretted it.

215
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,790
I'll burn incense for him

216
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,880
at the Imperial Ancestral Shrine

217
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,120
once every three days until I die.

218
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:43,920
I

219
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,070
trusted the wrong people

220
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,160
and killed my beloved brother.

221
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,430
I deeply regretted it.

222
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,240
I'll burn incense for him

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,430
at the Imperial Ancestral Shrine

224
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,670
once every three days until I die.

225
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,310
Yes,

226
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,590
Your Majesty.

227
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,000
My father,

228
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,280
Xiao Ruofeng, Lord Langya,

229
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,830
sent himself to jail

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,710
to end the insurgency.

231
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,310
It was me and my father

232
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,470
who plotted the chaos in Tianqi City that night.

233
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,000
For the stability of the kingdom,

234
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,280
my father forwent his glory

235
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,470
and committed suicide
at the execution ground to pacify the world!

236
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,670
You,

237
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,240
as the subordinates of my father,

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,240
didn't obey the order of the general

239
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,470
and marched to the imperial city,

240
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,590
trying to revolt.

241
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,520
Do you deserve to be in the Langya Army?

242
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,640
General!

243
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,240
Why were you so reluctant

244
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,280
to be the Emperor?

245
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,160
Your Majesty!

246
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,190
Father!

247
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,830
Your Majesty!

248
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,430
Father!

249
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,040
Father.

250
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,520
Father.

251
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,880
Father!

252
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,640
(In the 22nd year of Mingde, in spring,)

253
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,590
(Emperor Mingde admitted)

254
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,950
(that the mutiny of Lord Langya was a misjudgment.)

255
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,000
(He reproached himself)

256
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,760
(and cleared Lord Langya's name.)

257
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,400
(Ye Xiaoying, the Golden Armor General,)

258
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,830
(led the troops to Tianqi.)

259
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,710
(Zhuoxin and Jinwei were brought to justice.)

260
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,310
(Jinyan went missing.)

261
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,070
(It was then known as Langya Mutiny.)

262
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,310
Father.

263
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,620
Enough.

264
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,390
Say no more.

265
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,820
I've lost

266
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,190
to those kids this time.

267
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,500
Actually,

268
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,980
true to my nature,

269
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,030
I couldn't wait to raze the palace to the ground

270
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,790
and kill all of them at that time.

271
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,500
You're brave

272
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,670
but not brutal.

273
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,100
Xiao Se has already seen through this.

274
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,310
Yes.

275
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,620
I value the army force.

276
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,030
And that kid is a judge of character.

277
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,150
Causing the 200,000 soldiers of mine

278
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,500
to be withdrawn

279
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,980
by several kids

280
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,340
and some sort of ridiculous

281
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,030
confession.

282
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,500
Xiao Se said

283
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,500
if you hadn't withdrawn the troop,

284
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,820
Tianqi City would've no longer been

285
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,030
adorned

286
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,620
by the divine bird flag of the imperial family

287
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,030
but

288
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,030
the army flag of Ye Battalion.

289
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,500
Right.

290
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,100
When I was

291
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,340
holding the blades,

292
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,100
I thought

293
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,070
if I should

294
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,500
kill all the Xiaos

295
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,430
and take the throne by myself.

296
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,340
However, I'm just good

297
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,580
at fighting and battling.

298
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,190
I'm not fit to be an emperor.

299
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,340
So I gave up.

300
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,670
Besides, in the past,

301
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,390
His Highness

302
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,030
took his own life.

303
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,390
So there's no reason

304
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,220
for me to hold it against them.

305
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,270
Father.

306
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:10,670
Ruoyi,

307
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,820
I'm getting old.

308
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,740
Back in the day,

309
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,670
the buddies who fought with me

310
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,580
in Tianqi City

311
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,910
are all gone.

312
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,100
Over years,

313
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,030
I've fed

314
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,310
on vengeance.

315
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,950
Now that is gone too.

316
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,310
It's over.

317
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,100
Well,

318
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,910
stop talking about this.

319
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,100
Ruoyi,

320
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,150
how do you feel?

321
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,740
I haven't had the episodes for so long.

322
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,430
I've asked the State Preceptor.

323
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,910
He said the zhenqi that the master

324
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,150
on the celestial mountain left on me

325
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,460
has protected my heart.

326
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,870
I'll be fine in the next ten years.

327
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,500
Ten years later

328
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,350
when the master wakes up,

329
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,020
I'll go to the celestial mountain again.

330
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,670
All right, then.

331
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,020
Ruoyi,

332
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,150
I guess

333
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:27,980
you

334
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,150
are not ready to leave Tianqi.

335
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,830
After all, you've got

336
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,350
many friends here.

337
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,390
Am I right?

338
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,110
Do you want to be

339
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,060
Xiao Se's wife?

340
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,540
Xiao Se

341
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,830
is a good friend who I grew up with.

342
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
It's not a love affair.

343
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:44,980
You've misunderstood, Father.

344
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,110
So it's the kid from the Lei family.

345
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,700
You know,

346
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,190
he's different from his father.

347
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,950
Back in the day,

348
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,430
Lei was quite

349
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,700
a ladies' man.

350
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,830
But that kid

351
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,590
looks dorky.

352
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,830
Father, what are you trying to say?

353
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,700
Ruoyi,

354
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,020
I'm just thinking about

355
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,870
who can take care of you

356
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,780
after I leave.

357
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,350
Where are you going?

358
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,460
Silly girl,

359
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,830
after everything that happened,

360
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,350
do you think

361
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,590
I still can stay here?

362
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,430
Emperor Mingde didn't condemn me

363
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,150
because he wouldn't dare to do it.

364
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,980
If I didn't admit mistakes and resign,

365
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,150
those people

366
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,150
would always think

367
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,670
that I still want to rebel.

368
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,190
If so, they couldn't get a good sleep.

369
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,460
Well,

370
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,430
you draft a memorial to the throne

371
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,950
and say that I'm going to retire.

372
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:57,910
Of course.

373
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,630
There's no rush.

374
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,300
Let's wait another month.

375
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,980
So that those ill-intentioned people

376
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,830
can't sleep well this month.

377
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,910
You're going to Mount Fengxi?

378
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,220
Yes.

379
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,150
Your mother was buried there.

380
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,190
-Greetings to Father.
-Greetings to Your Majesty.

381
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,340
You're here.

382
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,190
Come.

383
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,870
Come closer.

384
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,060
Did you two

385
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,670
plan this

386
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,590
together?

387
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,430
He gave me a riddle.

388
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,500
So I made a bet.

389
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,110
You and I grew up together.

390
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,300
How could you not know that?

391
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,740
Obviously, you made such a strange change

392
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,460
in the troop movement

393
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,390
because of what I said.

394
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,780
You opened the city gate, welcomed the mutineers,

395
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,100
and sent Wangli Heavenly Soldiers

396
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,350
to stop the two army forces
who were dispatched to save the Emperor.

397
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,540
I can't believe you could think of that.

398
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,500
I would believe it if he was the inside man

399
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,390
of the Langya Army.

400
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:15,630
Father,

401
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,260
it was my idea to stop the army forces

402
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,190
from saving you.

403
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,350
Please don't blame Uncle for that.

404
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,780
I understand

405
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,950
why you sent forces to stop them.

406
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,390
Now

407
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,700
that I'm severely ill

408
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,110
and the country is in tumult,

409
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,110
it's inevitable

410
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,020
that the army becomes disloyal.

411
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,150
This behavior of yours

412
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,830
has avoided conflicts from many sides.

413
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,700
No soldiers in Beili

414
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,300
are sacrificed.

415
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,430
Well done.

416
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,980
Father,

417
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,540
someone

418
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,670
must've colluded with the forces.

419
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,500
Please severely punish them.

420
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,630
Sure.

421
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,980
I'll ask Yueli to look into it.

422
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,460
Lingchen,

423
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,060
from what you said and did in front of the hall,

424
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,590
I can tell that you got it

425
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,670
from your father.

426
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,460
All I did

427
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,500
was uphold my father's will.

428
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,150
If I did rebel

429
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,740
and take the throne,

430
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,910
my father would whip me

431
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,150
to death

432
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,350
when I met him

433
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,110
in the afterlife.

434
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,390
Moreover, with my personality,

435
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,700
I can't be an emperor.

436
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,260
Then, what kind of a person

437
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,220
is suitable to be an emperor?

438
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,830
Someone like you, Your Majesty.

439
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,700
You're a scheming man

440
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,150
with a calm mind.

441
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,590
And you're thoughtful.

442
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,630
My father was too carefree.

443
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,910
It's all right to be a general.

444
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,260
But it's exhausting to be

445
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,300
an emperor.

446
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,350
So he gave up on the throne.

447
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,150
So did I.

448
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,870
The Emperor

449
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,980
is the most powerful person in the world.

450
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,950
But meanwhile,

451
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,390
he's most constrained.

452
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,830
Those eunuchs

453
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,740
bet everything

454
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,110
on me and my father.

455
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,870
They were wrong about us.

456
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,870
Back in the day, we brothers

457
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,390
were the Emperor

458
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,590
and the general.

459
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,060
We thought

460
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,060
that the fate of Beili

461
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,670
was in our hands

462
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,630
and that we could make the country prosper.

463
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,950
Yet, I didn't expect

464
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,950
that we would be used by others.

465
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,390
I've been blaming myself

466
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,540
for what happened to your father all these years.

467
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,220
You should.

468
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,390
Go on.

469
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,540
Now, I've got a clear picture

470
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,630
of that matter.

471
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,110
My father established

472
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,870
brilliant achievements in war.

473
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
The people respected him.

474
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,540
Many people in the army,

475
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,540
including General Ye Xiaoying,

476
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,390
tried to promote him to Emperor.

477
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,540
Especially that time

478
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,980
when he returned from Nanjue with victory,

479
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,950
the street was smothered in flowers,

480
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,590
and all the people were there to welcome him.

481
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,220
Many people in the army

482
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,390
started to be provoked.

483
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,350
So the treacherous officials

484
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,980
found that scroll,

485
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,350
trying to make an issue of it.

486
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,350
It was said that they had talked

487
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,630
to many generals in the army.

488
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,150
A chance was all they needed

489
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,500
to promote my father to Emperor.

490
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,110
At last, my father would rather kill himself

491
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,910
and ruin his own reputation

492
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,830
to pacify the world.

493
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,540
But why

494
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,190
did you

495
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,830
remain silent all this time?

496
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,630
I understand.

497
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,350
That this

498
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,590
was the tacit agreement between you two.

499
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,540
You were aware of his plan.

500
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,020
He knew your thought.

501
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,350
But actually,

502
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,020
there was another solution at that time.

503
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,630
You could've found out

504
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,390
those officials who tried to revolt

505
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,630
and killed them all.

506
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,140
You could've worked with my father

507
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,350
and told the world,

508
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,260
"Yes,

509
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,300
the name on the scroll is Xiao Ruofeng,

510
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,060
so what?

511
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,830
I, Xiao Ruojin, am still the Emperor.

512
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,500
Xiao Ruofeng is still Lord Langya."

513
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,670
This was the choice

514
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,430
you two made.

515
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,740
No one can change it,

516
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,500
not the Dragon Seal Scroll,

517
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,980
and neither can the people.

518
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,950
But why

519
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,260
couldn't you do that?

520
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,110
Because it was risky to do that.

521
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,110
If you had done that,

522
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,980
it would've endangered
the stability of your throne

523
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,500
and deeply affected the safety

524
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,830
and peace in Tianqi City.

525
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,020
Those lords who lost

526
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,950
in fighting for the throne

527
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,390
would march to Tianqi at any time.

528
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,500
The officials who were against you

529
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,540
would take a chance to make a move.

530
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:57,870
Your Majesty,

531
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,910
am I right?

532
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,060
Yes,

533
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,020
you're right.

534
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,500
That's why I've been

535
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,060
feeling guilty all these years.

536
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,110
I can deceive myself

537
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,110
that this was Ruofeng's choice.

538
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,220
I can also tell myself

539
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,780
that one day,

540
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,950
I'll exonerate Ruofeng

541
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,700
and readmit him

542
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,630
to the Imperial Ancestral Shrine.

543
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,430
But until the moment

544
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,670
you set foot in the palace,

545
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,540
I

546
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,780
still haven't done this.

547
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,260
My father

548
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,630
always remembered his promise to you

549
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,060
when you were young.

550
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,700
But then,

551
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,980
you forgot about it.

552
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,980
I don't know

553
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,670
why you asked me

554
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,740
to come over today.

555
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,460
But this is all

556
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,670
I wanted to say.

557
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,350
And I don't wish to listen

558
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,430
to some

559
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,350
sort of repentance.

560
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,300
If there's nothing else

561
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,110
you want to say,

562
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,300
I'll excuse myself.

563
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,630
I understand why my father did that.

564
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,220
But it doesn't mean

565
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,150
I will forget about this.

566
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,260
I lost the person closest to me.

567
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,220
Whatever

568
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,590
the reason is,

569
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,540
it's unforgivable.

570
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,190
Be it the kingdom

571
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,740
or the nation,

572
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,780
there's nothing special about the throne.

573
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,950
I didn't come here

574
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,980
to catch up with you

575
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,700
or to claim credit,

576
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,540
I just want to spit out the words

577
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,670
that I've kept inside

578
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,670
all these years!

579
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,590
I can't

580
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,540
tell people about it.

581
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,980
I can only say it to you.

582
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,190
I hope

583
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:15,980
you can understand.

584
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:17,910
I do.

585
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,590
There's one more thing

586
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,020
I want to ask you.

587
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,220
What should

588
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,700
I choose this time?

589
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,460
Your Majesty,

590
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,540
it's actually very simple.

591
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,060
Which son do you hate the most?

592
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,830
Just reserve the throne for him.

593
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,830
The Emperor

594
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,630
is destined to be a loner.

595
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:50,870
He'll never be happy.

596
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
I didn't expect

597
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,020
he'd give me an answer like this.

598
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,110
You've heard

599
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,670
Lingchen.

600
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,670
What happened in the past

601
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,260
is just like he said.

602
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,700
I got it.

603
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,500
Back then,

604
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,390
I was afraid those treacherous officials

605
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,630
would lay a hand on you again.

606
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,980
So I brought myself

607
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,020
to evict you out of Tianqi.

608
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,150
Don't blame me for that.

609
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,180
Thanks to this,

610
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,670
I've met a lot of friends.

611
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,700
They

612
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,150
are the friends

613
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,870
that you can rely on.

614
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,980
Just like how

615
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,910
I relied on Ruofeng back then.

616
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,830
Over years,

617
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,460
I've been thinking

618
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,500
about the way

619
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,110
Ruofeng looked at me at the execution ground.

620
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,190
Guess

621
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,190
what I saw.

622
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,590
I wasn't there that day.

623
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,350
But I guess

624
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,190
you saw disappointment

625
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,980
in his eyes.

626
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,670
To the people,

627
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,910
he was like a deity.

628
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,390
To the officials,

629
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,060
he was a saint.

630
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,980
But at the moment

631
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,500
when I gave the command to execute him,

632
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,260
he

633
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,630
must've been very disappointed

634
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,060
in me.

635
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:34,700
Father.

636
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:36,830
Yes?

637
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,540
I've also got

638
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,630
a question.

639
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,430
But you might feel upset

640
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,390
after hearing it.

641
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,780
Just say it.

642
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,910
I ask you guys to come over today

643
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,780
because I want you to talk

644
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,540
about what happened back then.

645
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:58,870
Just say it.

646
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,430
I was thinking

647
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,700
if the situation back then

648
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,540
was that urgent.

649
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,830
The period between Lord Langya being framed

650
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,590
and imprisoned

651
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,590
until his execution

652
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,870
was too short.

653
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,780
Would it have caused a rebellion

654
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,980
if you hadn't executed him?

655
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,700
Would a rebellion

656
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,980
break out that easily?

657
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,950
If it was the case,

658
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,740
how could

659
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,220
the people allow him to be executed?

660
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,910
You said something

661
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,260
Lingchen dared not to say.

662
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,550
Chuhe,

663
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,460
very well.

664
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,220
All these years,

665
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,420
you haven't changed a bit.

666
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,500
Yes.

667
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,500
I killed him so soon

668
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,700
because I was afraid.

669
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,910
Actually, it wasn't that complicated.

670
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,020
It was because

671
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,790
I was tied

672
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,020
to the throne

673
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,220
at that time.

674
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,180
You know?

675
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,110
Thank you

676
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,460
for sorting out my confusion.

677
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,870
I'll excuse myself.

678
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,420
I...

679
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,020
am disappointed in myself as well.

680
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,550
[Lord Chi's Residence]

681
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,420
I've failed completely this time.

682
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,110
Thoroughly.

683
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,180
Your Highness.

684
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,660
I thought

685
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:06,980
this time,

686
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,550
the world would be in tumult

687
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,310
and that both sides would lose.

688
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,390
We just have to sit back and watch the show.

689
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,110
But in the end, be it Tianqi City

690
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,020
or Langya Army,

691
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,630
they're all safe and sound.

692
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,420
It's absurd.

693
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,020
Ridiculous.

694
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,590
It was remiss of me.

695
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,220
No.

696
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,630
It wasn't because of Xiao Lingchen

697
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,940
but Xiao Chuhe.

698
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
He let Wangli Heavenly Soldiers

699
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,590
leave Tianqi City

700
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,660
to stop the two army forces
from protecting the Emperor.

701
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,550
I just received

702
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,420
a letter from Luo City Army.

703
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,460
He said the leader of the soldiers was in green,

704
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,150
who was Ye Ruoyi, Ye Xiaoying's daughter.

705
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,910
They thought

706
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,830
Ye Ruoyi was sent over by Ye Xiaoying.

707
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,830
This step that Xiao Chuhe took

708
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,460
has ruined

709
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,110
all of my plans.

710
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,590
Your Highness,

711
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,940
just forget about it.

712
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,660
But,

713
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,020
after this dispute,

714
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,150
there was something left behind.

715
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,590
Are you referring

716
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,940
to the joint petition from the officials?

717
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,050
[Snowfall Villa]

718
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,460
I thought this matter

719
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,630
has finally come to an end.

720
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,980
But after hearing

721
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,660
everything,

722
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,020
there's still

723
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,180
one important thing missing.

724
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,590
Is it the name list that Jinyan's got?

725
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,070
Eunuch Jinyan got

726
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,420
a name list of all the officials

727
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,660
that participated in the Langya Mutiny.

728
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,180
But

729
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,180
this is also why

730
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,910
Xiao Lingchen could successfully lead

731
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,550
the 200,000 soldiers

732
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,460
to charge into Tianqi.

733
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,940
With this name list,

734
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:37,590
we can have

735
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,910
those officials by their throats.

736
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,350
Why don't we try to snatch it?

737
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,630
You seem to be in a good mood recently.

738
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,420
You even tell jokes.

739
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,740
After all, a load

740
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,660
has been lifted off my mind.

741
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,220
But this

742
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,630
is not a joke.

743
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,180
If Xiao Yu

744
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,740
got this name list,

745
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,660
he'd surely stir up trouble again

746
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,940
and use this name list

747
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,020
to threaten those officials

748
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,830
to work for him.

749
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,470
We can't let him have it.

750
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,900
Now that Tianqi City

751
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,980
is heavily guarded,

752
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,270
Jinyan can't get out of the city.

753
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,190
He must be hiding somewhere.

754
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,100
Where do you think he'll hide?

755
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,460
Could it be...

756
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,230
He'll go

757
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,310
to the only person who cares

758
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,790
about his life in Tianqi City.

759
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,020
(There's a thing I must tell you.)

760
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,190
(The person who killed Jinyu)

761
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:37,940
(was neither me)

762
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,310
nor Jinyan.

763
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,230
We aren't capable of doing that.

764
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,500
Are you

765
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,670
copying and reciting the scripture?

766
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,420
Is it for Jinyu? It's very kind of you.

767
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,790
Why are there two copies?

768
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,940
Another one is for Jinwei.

769
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,750
We were brothers.

770
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,190
It's the least we can do.

771
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,230
When we were young,

772
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,230
we didn't get together often.

773
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,670
Jinyan

774
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,230
was always with Eunuch Zhuoxin.

775
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,580
In fact,

776
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,460
it was you, Jinyu, and Jinwei

777
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,460
who grew up together.

778
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,630
So I must avenge them.

779
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,790
Indeed, something is fishy

780
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,500
about Jinyu's death.

781
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,540
You can seek revenge for him.

782
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,710
But Jinwei died in the rebellion.

783
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,750
Who can you take revenge on?

784
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,100
I guess Langya Army wouldn't have expected

785
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,150
that it could be

786
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,500
so easy

787
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,790
to enter Tianqi City.

788
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,790
I always have this feeling

789
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,460
that someone is behind

790
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,500
promoting the development of everything.

791
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,460
Jinwei and the others

792
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,630
were just a pawn.

793
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,230
Jinwei

794
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,380
wasn't an ambitious person.

795
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,750
He just wanted

796
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,580
to fulfill Master's wish.

797
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,670
But there's a person,

798
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,630
I'm sure

799
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,630
he's not our ally.

800
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,750
You mean Jinyan?

801
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,060
Yes.

802
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,270
He must die.

803
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,710
If he comes to you,

804
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,500
keep him here

805
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,870
and inform me.

806
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,900
But if you don't do as I say,

807
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,460
there'll only be one person left

808
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,230
in the Five Eunuchs.

809
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,500
Are you threatening me?

810
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,460
No, I'm not threatening you.

811
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,190
I'm just worried you'll do something silly.

812
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,060
Director,

813
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,900
you were involved in this rebellion

814
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,830
and you supported Lord Chi.

815
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,580
So what?

816
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,540
But the Five Eunuchs

817
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,750
should be loyal to Emperor Mingde

818
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,420
only.

819
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,900
Do you know why our masters

820
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,750
remained silent

821
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,060
when Lord Langya

822
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,310
tore the scroll apart?

823
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,900
They

824
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,420
had long yielded

825
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,630
to the majesty of the new emperor.

826
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,540
Will you

827
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,540
kill me

828
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,460
as he said?

829
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,020
I will.

830
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,900
Unless you give me

831
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,420
the name list.

832
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,980
No one will kill me

833
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,900
as long as I have that name list.

834
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,060
If I hand it over,

835
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,190
even you

836
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,980
will kill me.

837
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,830
Then, why did you come to me?

838
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,580
I've made the wrong choice once.

839
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,350
I'd like

840
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,870
to choose again.

841
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:44,940
Master,

842
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,060
His Highness Lord Bai is here.

843
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,710
In Tianqi City,

844
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,500
I suppose there's no better tea

845
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,580
than the one I have

846
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,310
here.

847
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,830
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

848
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,150
But

849
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,420
I guess

850
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,980
you're not here just to enjoy tea.

851
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,710
That day, at the front of Tai'an Hall,

852
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,630
Zhuoxin, Jinyan, and Jinwei

853
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,790
used the forged Dragon Seal Scroll

854
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,790
to initiate an insurrection.

855
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,790
The Dragon Seal Scroll was ruined.

856
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,060
But there's another scroll

857
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,310
in Jinyan's hands.

858
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,230
The signatures

859
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,150
of hundreds of officials are on the scroll.

860
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,060
Since everyone said

861
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,090
it was a forged Dragon Seal Scroll,

862
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,900
then the signatures

863
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,940
can be forged as well.

864
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,710
But everyone

865
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,790
has heard of it

866
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,790
and it has gotten around.

867
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,460
Everyone in the city

868
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,630
cares a lot about this.

869
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,380
So,

870
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,830
you're also interested in this name list?

871
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,060
Father has issued a verbal edict.

872
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,580
From this day forward,

873
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,870
I'll be the acting minister
of the Court of Judicature,

874
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,710
and I'm in charge of this case.

875
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,150
Lord Bai actually went to Hongqing Hall.

876
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,230
So everybody has figured out

877
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,190
that Eunuch Jade Deity

878
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,500
is the last refuge of Eunuch Jinyan.

879
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,580
Just that

880
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,310
Eunuch Jade Deity is a hard man

881
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:09,980
to deal with.

882
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,630
Chong has the verbal edict from His Majesty.

883
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,380
It's easy

884
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,020
for him to deal with everyone in Tianqi.

885
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,350
After all, no one wants to go to
the Heavenly Prison.

886
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,100
There's one thing I don't understand.

887
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,630
Why did His Majesty leave this

888
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,350
to Lord Bai?

889
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,630
Chong is prudent.

890
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,380
It's convincing

891
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,190
to put him in charge.

892
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,830
What about us?

893
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,630
We were the ones

894
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,940
who settled the mutiny.

895
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,270
We?

896
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,830
To them,

897
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,350
we're with Langya Army.

898
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,940
If we were in charge,

899
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,670
I'm afraid

900
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,710
those officials in Tianqi City

901
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,270
would be restless.

902
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,020
What should we do, then?

903
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,580
Since Lord Bai

904
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,830
is in charge of this,

905
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,540
it's hard for us to interfere.

906
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,270
We can't possibly just take it from him.

907
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,310
There was a special guest

908
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,750
who just visited Baixiao Sect.

909
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,270
Was it Jade Deity's man?

910
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,060
As you're so smart,

911
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,190
it'll show that I look dorky.

912
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,100
Say it.

913
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,350
Eunuch Jade Deity

914
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,060
has contacted us.

915
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,630
He said he'll send Jinyan

916
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,790
to Baixiao Sect,

917
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,460
and he asked us to protect him.

918
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:14,980
Great, then.

919
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,020
When Jinyan is sent to Baixiao Sect,

920
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,190
we can arrest him.

921
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,420
Then, we can get

922
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,310
the name list.

923
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,500
Ji Xue is our friend,

924
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,750
but we can't ruin

925
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,830
Baixiao Sect's

926
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,580
years of reputation.

927
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,670
Connection and business

928
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,710
are two different things.

929
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,540
What to do, then?

930
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,900
We have to wait

931
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,230
for Eunuch Jade Deity's terms.

932
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,060
We can't just wait like this.

933
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,460
I know

934
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,790
what Eunuch Jade Deity needs.

935
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,060
We have to be prepared for this.

936
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:45,980
Ruoyi,

937
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,710
what's the situation out there?

938
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,980
There are more people

939
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,460
guarding out there.

940
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,310
The street

941
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,420
is surrounded by spies.

942
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,900
There were only men of Lord Bai and Lord Chi

943
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,980
who kept eyes on us back then.

944
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,310
But now,

945
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,980
half the people in Tianqi City

946
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,580
are watching us.

947
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,060
We

948
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,190
have more enemies now.

949
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,100
It's not only us who are interested

950
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,350
in the name list.

951
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,060
I'm sure there are many people

952
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,060
watching Xiao Yu

953
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,580
as well.

954
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,380
So,

955
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,870
