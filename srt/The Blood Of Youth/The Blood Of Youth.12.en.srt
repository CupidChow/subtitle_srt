24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,970
[Episode 12]

25
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,470
Your Highness.

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,360
Who are you?

27
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,870
The Azure Dragon?

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,280
Li Xinyue,

29
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,280
is this a mutiny?

30
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,910
It was never my intention,

31
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,430
but Your Majesty forced me.

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,680
You're crazy.

33
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,030
Take her down!

34
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,240
Your Highness,

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,910
Ye Xiaoying has gathered

36
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,080
30,000 Langya Army.

37
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,430
One order from you

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,360
and they

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,430
will draw their swords.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,750
Your Highness.

41
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,560
The 800,000 Langya Army in Beili

42
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,800
is waiting for your order.

43
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,840
[Director Jinxuan]
Azure Dragon, after training in solitude,

44
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,310
I see you have mastered Sword Heart Technique.

45
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,360
Powerful as that technique might be,

46
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,280
it is naive of you to think

47
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,910
that you can rescue him alone.

48
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,150
State Preceptor.

49
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,470
What did you see?

50
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,470
I saw a sword qi.

51
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,120
Sword qi?

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,630
It can destroy ten thousand cities.

53
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,120
What kind of sword

54
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,590
can destroy ten thousand cities?

55
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,030
I am the Emperor.

56
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,840
I will not surrender to a mortal's sword.

57
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,400
The sword of a sword deity
can destroy ten thousand cities.

58
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,240
Sword deity?

59
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,800
She is here.

60
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,400
Careful!

61
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,310
Who are you?

62
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,080
Li Hanyi, how dare you!

63
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,560
Just because

64
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,870
you are a sword deity now

65
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,630
doesn't mean you are invincible.

66
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,840
The Second City Lord of Xueyue City.

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,070
The daughter of Azure Dragon.

68
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:17,920
Speak.

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,510
What do you want?

70
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,240
I want to

71
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,040
take them with me.

72
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,360
Sure.

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,390
But only one of them.

74
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,800
Xinyue.

75
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,270
Do not sacrifice in vain.

76
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,310
Live your life.

77
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,430
I count on you

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
to take care of the rest.

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,240
My dear brother...

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Your Highness!

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,830
That's all?

82
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,920
Although it's unfair,

83
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,950
Lord Langya did die

84
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,830
in that conflict.

85
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,830
My mother

86
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,360
was badly injured,

87
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,560
and she

88
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,600
passed away

89
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,240
shortly after she left with me.

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,560
So among the imperial family,

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,630
no one

92
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,270
defended

93
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,070
Lord Langya at all?

94
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,510
There was someone.

95
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,750
(The Sixth Prince,)

96
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,160
(Xiao Chuhe.)

97
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,000
(Lord Langya groomed him personally.)

98
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,630
(And at a young age,)

99
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,270
(he attained the Insouciant Phase.)

100
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,190
(Many people thought)

101
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,870
(he was the best candidate)

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,750
(to inherit the throne.)

103
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,920
After Lord Langya was imprisoned,

104
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,720
Xiao Chuhe alone fought for his cause.

105
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,000
He pointed out the 13 inconsistencies

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,360
in Lord Langya's mutiny accusation.

107
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,190
(His speech was passionate)

108
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,800
(and moving.)

109
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,630
(Some senior ministers)

110
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,950
(even shed tears.)

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,950
After Lord Langya passed away,

112
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,480
the Sixth Prince still worked hard

113
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,040
to clear his name.

114
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,190
But that angered His Majesty

115
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,510
and the Prince was demoted to a commoner.

116
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,680
He was then exiled to Qingzhou.

117
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,870
Perhaps Lord Langya
already knew what was coming.

118
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,040
(So one month before his death,)

119
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,160
he asked Tianqi's Four Guardians

120
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,310
to promise him something.

121
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,240
What is it?

122
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,510
He asked

123
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,870
the keepers

124
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,950
of the Four Guardians' Tokens

125
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,360
to continue their duty,

126
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,160
to protect

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,040
the one who holds

128
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,190
the future of the dynasty.

129
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,430
The Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe?

130
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,600
Yes.

131
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,920
My mother's passing

132
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,180
[Azure Dragon]
filled me with so much pain,

133
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,830
so I didn't take this seriously.

134
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,360
But I saw

135
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,390
you unsheathe Tingyu Sword.

136
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,070
And I knew

137
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,560
you're like my mother.

138
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,310
You draw your sword to protect.

139
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,870
Of course,

140
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,560
you have the right

141
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,000
to refuse

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,040
to take this token.

143
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,270
If that is our mother's last wish,

144
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,600
I will do it.

145
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,680
Besides, the Sixth Prince

146
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,600
is a virtuous man.

147
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,430
I respect him.

148
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,240
Okay.

149
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,830
From today onward,

150
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,720
you

151
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,750
are the East

152
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,070
of Tianqi's Four Guardians,

153
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,240
the Azure Dragon.

154
00:07:59,310 --> 00:07:59,800
I won't

155
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,000
let our mother down.

156
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:06,950
Oh,

157
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,560
Hanyi.

158
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,310
You said he was exiled.

159
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,720
Where should I go

160
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,390
to seek the Sixth Prince?

161
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,240
You

162
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,000
don't know?

163
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,390
Should I know?

164
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,390
He

165
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,270
is not much older than you.

166
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,800
After he was deposed,

167
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,000
he was ambushed by his enemy

168
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,000
and he lost his martial prowess.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
After that, he went missing.

170
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,150
Missing?

171
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,550
Then,

172
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,630
I have to look everywhere.

173
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,440
It's okay.

174
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,960
No need to know all that.

175
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,870
Perhaps following the current path

176
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,720
will lead to the best outcome.

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,510
Hanyi.

178
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,150
What are you on about?

179
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,840
Nothing.

180
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,080
No need to find him.

181
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,870
Trust me.

182
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,390
When he

183
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,390
is in real danger,

184
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,840
you will be by his side.

185
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,440
That dummy...

186
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,840
I hope Li Hanyi

187
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,720
did not pass the Azure Dragon Token to him.

188
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,240
Greetings, Father.

189
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:34,960
Chong'er, you're here.

190
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,030
Come on.

191
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,030
Have a seat.

192
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,200
Thanks, Father.

193
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:44,670
Chong'er.

194
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,960
[Xiao Chong, Lord Bai]
Among my sons,

195
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,030
you are the most reliable one.

196
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,000
Have some tea.

197
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,360
And I

198
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,480
trust you the most.

199
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,000
Keep it up.

200
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,790
But I am worried

201
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,630
about your eyesight.

202
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,240
Did those imperial physicians

203
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,790
find you better treatment?

204
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,480
Father,

205
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,630
I have been taking herbal broth.

206
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,270
For years,

207
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,840
I can only

208
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,670
see shadows.

209
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,670
I will ask them

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,240
to look for more competent physicians.

211
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:25,960
Chong'er.

212
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,510
One day,

213
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,750
your eyesight will return.

214
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,440
Thank you, Father.

215
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,030
Oh, Father.

216
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,390
May I know why you asked

217
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,030
for my presence?

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,630
I heard

219
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,240
the hostage from Tianwaitian

220
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,630
went back.

221
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,270
It's been 12 years.

222
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,480
By right,

223
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,910
he should head back.

224
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,030
Father,

225
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,910
wasn't this

226
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,750
handled

227
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,150
by Eunuch Jade Deity?

228
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,910
If he

229
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,750
agreed to let him leave,

230
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,440
he must have thought

231
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,360
that the hostage no longer

232
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,670
poses a threat to Beili.

233
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,550
He's just a kid.

234
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,200
He can't possibly cook up a big storm.

235
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,510
That's not my concern.

236
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,200
But I

237
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,720
received news

238
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,120
that he was accompanied

239
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,360
by someone.

240
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,120
And that someone

241
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,840
is Chuhe.

242
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,960
Chuhe?

243
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,320
It must be a lie.

244
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,150
Chuhe will not collude

245
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,030
with the son of the Demon Sect.

246
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,670
That's not my concern either.

247
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,000
Father,

248
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,670
I

249
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,870
don't get it.

250
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,960
I searched for Chuhe for many years

251
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,030
to no avail.

252
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,600
And now,

253
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,150
there is someone

254
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,320
who's similar to him.

255
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,480
It doesn't matter

256
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,150
who his companion is.

257
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,360
Jade Deity said

258
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,750
the heir of the Demon Sect is elegant.

259
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,390
Not unlike

260
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,360
Chuhe.

261
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,030
It's not hard to imagine

262
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,670
that they get along well.

263
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,080
You mean

264
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,720
you want me

265
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,600
to verify its veracity?

266
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,630
Yes.

267
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:31,910
Chong'er.

268
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,670
Will you

269
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,000
help me?

270
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,360
I will.

271
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,910
If the rumor is proven true,

272
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,080
I will do my best

273
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,270
to bring Chuhe back.

274
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,080
Okay.

275
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,360
Chong'er.

276
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,240
Carry this message too.

277
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,870
Tell him

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
that as long as he comes back,

279
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,360
I

280
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,840
can pardon him.

281
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,790
I will reinstate him as a prince.

282
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:01,870
I can even

283
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,720
give his lordship back.

284
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,020
When he returns,

285
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,440
he'll be Lord Yong'an,

286
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,720
Xiao Chuhe.

287
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,510
Noted.

288
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,020
[Xiaoqing Pavilion]

289
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,750
Any reaction?

290
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,150
Hello?

291
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,670
It's only been a day

292
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,960
and you ran away again.

293
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,080
After I blocked

294
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,000
three slashes from my sister,

295
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,030
I no longer need to train

296
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,910
on Mount Cang.

297
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,750
She said

298
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
I only need to train for a few hours

299
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,910
every day.

300
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,750
And after that,

301
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,390
I can roam freely in Xueyue City.

302
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,960
After she took off her mask

303
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,840
and you two reunited,

304
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,150
she starts pampering you.

305
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,270
Older sisters never change,

306
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,270
do they?

307
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,670
Even the Xueyue Sword Deity

308
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,870
is still bound by mortal desires.

309
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,630
Why aren't you surprised

310
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,960
by the fact that my sister

311
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,240
is the Xueyue Sword Deity?

312
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,960
Why should I?

313
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,480
You're from the Lei Clan.

314
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,440
Li Hanyi is the daughter of Lei Mengsha.

315
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,000
You two should be relatives, to begin with.

316
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,440
I just don't know how close

317
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,870
or how distant.

318
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,360
Rumor has it that Li Xinyue,
the heiress of Heart Sword,

319
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,080
is one of the Four Beauties

320
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,480
and is very smart.

321
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,200
How did she

322
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,320
give birth to an idiot like you?

323
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,080
Well, I guess it's all thanks to my father.

324
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,360
How is he?

325
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,480
In war, he donned silver armor

326
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,360
and rode a fine steed.

327
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,360
He inspired fear.

328
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,790
And in his daily life?

329
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,720
Talkative and bratty.

330
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,630
For Lord Langya, he was a pain in the bum.

331
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,360
So I am my father.

332
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,360
No.

333
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,000
I took after my father.

334
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,360
Hanyi took after my mother.

335
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,630
So why

336
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,270
did you come here?

337
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,790
Oh, right.

338
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,910
You weren't surprised

339
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,240
by the fact that my sister

340
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,140
is Xueyue Sword Deity.

341
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,670
But this thing

342
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,790
will

343
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,000
definitely blow your mind.

344
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,200
Really?

345
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,240
I know many things,

346
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,320
so I don't get surprised

347
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,200
easily.

348
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,270
Qianluo is getting married.

349
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,670
See?

350
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,750
Surprised?

351
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,480
Who said that?

352
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,000
Hanyi, of course.

353
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,910
So Qianluo has been busy

354
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,120
looking for suitors?

355
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,120
What suitors?

356
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,120
She is busy practicing martial arts.

357
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,000
Lei Wujie.

358
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,600
I am not used

359
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,030
to the dynamics now.

360
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,270
It feels like we swapped

361
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,910
positions.

362
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,750
You

363
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,320
are supposed to be

364
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,870
the idiot.

365
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,750
I just didn't want to steal your thunder.

366
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,120
Anyway,

367
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,510
let me finish this.

368
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,960
It began

369
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,960
three years

370
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,750
ago.

371
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,390
When Qianluo reached adulthood,

372
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,360
the Young Master of Jiangnan's Duan family
came to propose.

373
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,320
The leaders from ten sects,

374
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,510
the entire Duan family,

375
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,960
and three horse carriages worth of bride price

376
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,220
came to Xueyue City.

377
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,340
The Third City Lord did not like

378
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,170
that Duan kid, of course.

379
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,930
And so, he came out with a plan to buy some time.

380
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,100
A tournament?

381
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,050
I thought you didn't know.

382
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,410
I can deduce

383
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,140
with my brain.

384
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:38,930
You're right.

385
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,460
He held a tournament

386
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,890
that would take place

387
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,020
in three days.

388
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,220
If it's a tournament,

389
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,620
why is Sikong Qianluo practicing martial arts?

390
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,020
Because she

391
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,220
added a rule.

392
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,620
Her husband

393
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,740
has to be able to defeat her.

394
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,650
The Duan family wasn't too happy.

395
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,740
They said

396
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,220
a woman

397
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,860
should be soft-spoken and graceful.

398
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,570
She shouldn't

399
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,980
toy with swords.

400
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:02,810
And so,

401
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,530
the rule

402
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,500
was slightly modified.

403
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,420
If a disciple of Xueyue City

404
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,130
wins the tournament,

405
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,940
he has to defeat Qianluo too.

406
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,810
I see now.

407
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,570
She

408
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,810
doesn't want to marry anyone at all.

409
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,130
She wants the disciples of Xueyue City

410
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,420
to win first

411
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:21,740
before

412
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:22,980
defeating them herself.

413
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,180
Yes.

414
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:24,900
Exactly.

415
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,090
All of you always slack

416
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,810
on your training.

417
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,370
And you crumble down

418
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,220
when you need to fight.

419
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,370
Not only

420
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,020
does Qianluo train very hard,

421
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,900
but she helps others in their training too.

422
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,090
She can easily defeat

423
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,900
that Duan fellow.

424
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,940
I saw him fight that day.

425
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,900
His final hidden weapon

426
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,330
gave Tang Lian a hard time,

427
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,980
but that was because

428
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,740
Tang Lian didn't want to hurt him.

429
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,050
So he went easy on him.

430
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,530
In terms of skillfulness,

431
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,980
Tang Lian is way better than him.

432
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,700
Did someone

433
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,980
compliment me?

434
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,460
Lian.

435
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,940
I was stating a fact.

436
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,050
Your young lady

437
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,980
is in a pickle now.

438
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,900
As her eldest martial brother,

439
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,570
shouldn't you intervene?

440
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,570
I can't.

441
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,260
Why not?

442
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:22,980
If I do,

443
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,180
it will

444
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,660
just be a duel between Qianluo and me.

445
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,330
Knowing Xueyue City's rules

446
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,330
and Qianluo's personality,

447
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,900
I cannot

448
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,850
go easy on her in public

449
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,050
like I did to Lei Wujie

450
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,810
in Dengtian Tower.

451
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,770
Besides,

452
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,220
all these years,

453
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,260
Qianluo and I

454
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,260
are like siblings.

455
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,740
I can't possibly

456
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,420
marry her.

457
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,610
Excuses.

458
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,770
You just don't want

459
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,090
Fairy Rui to find out

460
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,740
that you're in this tournament

461
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,570
because that might ruin
your relationship with her.

462
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,180
You...

463
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,180
Say that again

464
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,180
and I'll hit you.

465
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,260
I believe

466
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,850
in Lian.

467
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,180
You're the best, Wujie.

468
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,290
What do you believe in?

469
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,460
That he loves Fairy Rui.

470
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,090
You need a beating too, it seems.

471
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,660
I'll keep my mouth shut.

472
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:07,770
Wait.

473
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,700
I can't go,

474
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,420
but you can, Lei Wujie.

475
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,020
I can't.

476
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,090
How so?

477
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,330
I...

478
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:16,700
Well...

479
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,980
I'll be frank.

480
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,050
If

481
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,900
Miss Ruoyi knows about this,

482
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,980
she'll think that I'm in love

483
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,850
with Qianluo.

484
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,770
It'll be hard to explain the whole situation.

485
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,020
You're overthinking.

486
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,420
I'm sure Miss Ye

487
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,570
doesn't care.

488
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,360
What if she does?

489
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,050
What are you talking about?

490
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:36,770
Lei Wujie here

491
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,220
wants to fight you.

492
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,180
It's

493
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,500
none of your business.

494
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,610
Qianluo.

495
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,220
-Stay there!
-Qianluo.

496
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,770
A thought came to my mind,

497
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,420
Lei Wujie.

498
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:54,610
Lian.

499
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,180
After seeing this,

500
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,090
I

501
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,770
share the same thought too.

502
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,850
Don't you run, Xiao Se.

503
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,530
Why are they

504
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,610
fighting again?

505
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,530
It has begun again

506
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,810
after several days of peace.

507
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,050
Oh, this daughter of mine...

508
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,290
I beg to differ.

509
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,980
At her age,

510
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,090
the more she likes someone,

511
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,570
the more she wants his attention.

512
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,460
Unfortunately,

513
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,090
I do not have a solution

514
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,570
for the tournament

515
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,570
that will begin in three days.

516
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,050
Pull a cheeky act then.

517
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,610
The Principal City Lord

518
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:30,810
always does that.

519
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,660
You can try.

520
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,570
He can afford to be shameless

521
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,290
because I am dealing with his mess.

522
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,610
If I do that,

523
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,530
Xueyue City will lose

524
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,130
its entire reputation.

525
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,700
So you want

526
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,090
to marry Qianluo off then?

527
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,850
She will marry

528
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,290
whomever

529
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,420
she likes.

530
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,330
I

531
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:51,850
will handle this then.

532
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,330
The way I see it,

533
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,610
the only one who can fight her in Xueyue City

534
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,330
is your disciple,

535
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,740
Luo Mingxuan.

536
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:08,570
Master.

537
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,220
What brought you to Dengtian Tower?

538
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,330
I'm here to check

539
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,500
if you are training.

540
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,570
Don't worry, Master.

541
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,180
I have been

542
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,500
studying

543
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,940
this Liubo Puzzle

544
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,370
and I'm getting some ideas now.

545
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,260
I'm sure

546
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,610
I can decode

547
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,810
the sword technique within.

548
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,530
I know

549
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,090
they are all boastful and whatnot.

550
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,250
But when I become a sword deity,

551
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,020
I'll make you proud.

552
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,090
You can

553
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,130
make me proud now.

554
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:36,940
Do you want to know how?

555
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,740
Master, are you saying I should take part

556
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,330
in Qianluo's tournament?

557
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,500
I don't like her.

558
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,260
And she wields a mean spear.

559
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,770
It scares me.

560
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:50,810
What's there to be afraid of?

561
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,330
She's a girl.

562
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,900
When she has a husband,

563
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,050
she turns meek.

564
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:56,980
Back then,

565
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,900
Qianluo's mother was so powerful.

566
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,290
Once she

567
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,900
caught up to Sikong Changfeng,

568
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,770
she kicked him

569
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,460
off his steed.

570
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:04,980
But then,

571
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,940
she became the most beautiful

572
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,130
and graceful woman in Xueyue City.

573
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,180
But I think

574
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,050
you're more beautiful than her.

575
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,130
Nonsense.

576
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,420
When you became my disciple,

577
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,770
her mother already passed away.

578
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,980
You have never seen her before.

579
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:20,900
Tell me.

580
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,850
Why you don't want to fight?

581
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:25,810
I'm already

582
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,810
in love with someone.

583
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,570
You are?

584
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,090
Why didn't you tell me?

585
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,900
I see now, Luo Mingxuan.

586
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,290
You are in love,

587
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,130
but you won't tell me.

588
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,900
Master...

589
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:38,700
No, Master...

590
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
The one I'm in love with

591
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,370
isn't

592
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,530
in love with me.

593
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,740
Calm down, Master.

594
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,020
Tell me now.

595
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,090
Who is that girl?

596
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,900
I'll help you out.

597
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,220
It's still too early, Master.

598
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,130
Stop asking me.

599
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,130
I have to train.

600
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,330
Don't disturb me.

601
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,220
Sikong Changfeng

602
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,260
asked me to do this.

603
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,610
I have no other option.

604
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:04,770
You know what?

605
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,420
Defeat others

606
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:08,850
and then

607
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,570
lose to Qianluo.

608
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,220
That will work?

609
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,530
Yes.

610
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,900
Just one small mistake

611
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,130
and you lose.

612
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,090
You return so soon.

613
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,570
It's settled.

614
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:24,810
Okay.

615
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:26,770
Why?

616
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,500
Why are you upset?

617
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,460
Not because of it.

618
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,180
What happened?

619
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,330
A special guest is visiting Xueyue City.

620
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,700
What special guest

621
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,980
can make you sulk?

622
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,660
Because this special guest is a certain

623
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,460
Mr. Xiao.

624
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,740
Xueyue City

625
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,180
must have received my letter.

626
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,420
Your Highness.

627
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,260
[Zang Ming, Lord Bai's Guard]

628
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,770
Do you think Xueyue City
will hide Xiao Chuhe away

629
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,660
when they receive the letter?

630
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,330
Perhaps,

631
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,260
but

632
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,810
knowing Chuhe,

633
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,530
he won't

634
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,700
go into hiding again.

635
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:08,700
But he has

636
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,420
remained hidden for many years.

637
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,810
Since he's decided

638
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:11,810
to set foot in Xueyue City,

639
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,370
it means he doesn't care if he's found out

640
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,810
nor is he ready to surrender.

641
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,020
Your Highness,

642
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
are you truly bringing Xiao Chuhe

643
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,370
back to Tianqi City?

644
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,020
I carry

645
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,530
my father's message.

646
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,180
But...

647
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,260
Just be forthcoming.

648
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,050
I know you are loyal, Your Highness.

649
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:32,980
But please

650
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:33,850
reconsider this.

651
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,500
Why does

652
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,770
Xiao Chuhe reappear

653
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,810
at this precise timing?

654
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,700
Why does Sikong Changfeng

655
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,290
want to take him in as a disciple?

656
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,610
Xueyue City used

657
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,530
to serve Lord Langya.

658
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,020
I'm sure

659
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,570
Xiao Chuhe will make use of this.

660
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,460
I do not wish to be out of line,

661
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,770
but Xiao Chuhe's objective of usurpation

662
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,700
cannot be more apparent.

663
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,050
If he returns to Tianqi City...

664
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:55,940
There are many things

665
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,570
that I cannot change.

666
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:00,940
Besides,

667
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,660
maybe that person

668
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,660
isn't Chuhe.

669
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,660
Maybe it's just a normal innkeeper,

670
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,700
Xiao Se.

671
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:12,900
Your Highness!

672
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,090
Get up.

673
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,290
Send another letter to Xueyue City.

674
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,460
Tell them our arrival

675
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,220
is not to be interrupted

676
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,130
or announced.

677
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,610
We will sneak into the city

678
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,610
and meet Xiao Se

679
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,180
in private.

680
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,500
[Xiaoqing Pavilion]

681
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,770
Sikong Qianluo is getting stronger

682
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,610
by the day.

683
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,220
You could have dodged it.

684
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,220
Why did you give up?

685
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,740
If I dodged it,

686
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,810
my sleeve would be torn.

687
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,290
This sleeve

688
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,090
costs 200 silver taels.

689
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,530
You would rather die

690
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,460
just to save your sleeve?

691
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,020
The Dragon Needles tell me

692
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,420
Lian is here.

693
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:25,940
Why should I fight?

694
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:27,850
Besides,

695
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,370
I was being hunted

696
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,290
all day long.

697
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,460
Do I have to run away

698
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,420
from my home now too?

699
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,500
I know

700
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,180
your qinggong is amazing.

701
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,980
But the small test just now

702
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,330
tells me

703
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,610
that your reflexes are quick and accurate.

704
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,900
You just lack the inner force.

705
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,370
Why are you bringing this up?

706
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,610
Lian and I

707
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,500
made a decision.

708
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,180
Stop.

709
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,500
It's a no.

710
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,530
We haven't even said it.

711
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,460
You can't say no yet.

712
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,940
I already guessed it.

713
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,180
We have been through a lot

714
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,850
on our journey here.

715
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,020

716
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,770
Don't play

the sentimental card.

718
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,740
Mr. Xiao, we just hope

719
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:13,770
that you're willing

720
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,980
to take one for the Four Heroes

In a while,

734
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,290
we'll have to fight.

take

740

three hits from me.

Martial prowess

742
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,050
is not the only criterion.

743
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,460
What about their looks?

744
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:02,770
Their looks?

746
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,220
than them.

Zang Ming.

776
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,090
Yes.

777
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,180
We definitely have to

778
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,460
join in this fun.

779
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,130
Okay.

780
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:18,610
Let's go.

781
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,130
Careful.

782
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:24,850
Xiao Se.

783
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,050
Go down now.

784
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,850
Fighting people like him

785
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,460
will only dirty my hands.

786
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,330
But if you don't go now,

787
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,360
it'll be too late.

788
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,500
Exactly.

789
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,050
Look.

790
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,500
Anyone else?

791
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,770
No one is challenging him.

792
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:39,980
Xiao Se!

793
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:40,980
Go train for a few more years.

794
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,660
Luo Mingxuan?

795
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,130
I am the disciple of the prettiest elder

796
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,770
in Xueyue City, Yin Luoxia.

797
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:54,570
I am Luo Mingxuan.

798
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,130
Here to challenge you.

799
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,130
So Luo Mingxuan

800
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,180
secretly admires Qianluo.

801
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,940
He intervenes

802
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,700
when the moment calls for it.

803
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,570
How heroic.

804
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:08,900
Indeed.

805
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,090
I didn't see this coming.

806
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:12,940
Luo Mingxuan

807
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,500
is always with his master.

808
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:15,980
He hardly

809
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,660
talks to us.

810
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,570
What a surprise.

811
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,050
What a surprise.

812
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,660
Let's watch his performance then.

813
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,460
You look

814
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,940
confident.

815
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,700
Should we have a bet?

816
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,900
I bet that I'll win.

817
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,500
100 silver taels.

818
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,050
Sure.

819
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,290
I bet that you'll die.

820
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,740
200 taels.

821
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:40,740
Xiao Se.

822
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,700
Who do you think

823
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,370
will win?

824
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,420
Bravo, Luo!

825
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,180
Luo Mingxuan.

826
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,370
Why?

827
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,370
He isn't using a weapon.

828
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,050
That's bad.

829
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,530
Luo Mingxuan

830
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,020
studies Luoxia Splitting Palm.

831
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,980
It can split a river,

832
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,020
let alone a normal long sword.

833
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,020
Right.

834
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,700
It seems like

835
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,180
Luo Mingxuan will marry

836
00:30:59,180 --> 00:30:59,900
Qianluo.

837
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,090
What a shame.

838
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,020
Why are you lamenting?

839
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,330
I want to see you

840
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,900
marry Qianluo.

841
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,220
You two are perfect together.

842
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,610
Look.

843
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,700
Qianluo is righteous.

844
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,810
And you are cunning.

845
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,090
If the two of you are together,

846
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,130
it'll be a perfect balance.

847
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,500
Bugger off.

848
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,370
As expected of Luo.

849
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,130
Right?

850
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,370
The winner

851
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,370
goes to Xueyue City.

852
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,370
Thank you.

853
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,660
Thanks.

854
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,420
Wow.

855
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,050
I'm Duan Xuanyi from the Duan family.

856
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:48,770
Greetings.

857
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,660
He is here too.

858
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:51,900
Is he strong?

859
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,020
Among our generation,

860
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,180
only Tang Lian

861
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,260
can certainly defeat him.

862
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,850
But judging

863
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,940
from Luo Mingxuan's palm just now,

864
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:01,940
he can win too.

865
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,180
Young Master Duan.

866
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,260
Your reputation precedes you.

867
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,020
You defeated my brother.

868
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,570
I am kind of impressed.

869
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,530
But you can't

870
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,090
defeat me.

871
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:27,810
(What is happening?)

872
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,330
What is happening?

873
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,220
Luo Mingxuan was poisoned.

874
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,130
Something is wrong with Mingxuan.

875
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,850
Mingxuan!

876
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,460
Are you all right?

877
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,130
Come on.

878
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:52,220
Master.

879
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,740
How are you feeling?

880
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,650
Sorry.

881
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,220
I was careless.

882
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,170
So the Elder of Xueyue City

883
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,540
can take part

884
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,570
in the tournament too?

885
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,940
I surrender on my disciple's behalf.

886
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,330
The winner

887
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,890
goes to Duan Xuanyi.

888
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:10,780
Elder Yin.

889
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,130
Let me have a look.

890
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,220
The poison is called Three-Cun Snake Venom.
(*a traditional Chinese unit of length)

891
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,780
It is not fatal.

892
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,130
Don't worry.

893
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,460
I will detoxify him

894
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,780
in an hour.

895
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:20,980
I count on you.

896
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,090
Anyone

897
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,370
else?

898
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,130
A shameless man like you

899
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:27,850
should eat

900
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,650
a humble pie.

901
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:29,570
Well,

902
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,940
if Luo lost to him too,

903
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:31,940
who among us

904
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,300
could

905
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:33,940
defeat him?

906
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:34,740
Yeah.

907
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,500
Shame on him.

908
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,410
He used poison.

909
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:37,850
Your Highness.

910
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,540
We might have arrived late.

911
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,810
Is it over already?

912
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,020
It seems that way.

913
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,260
I don't think there'll be

914
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:47,980
another challenger.

915
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:49,500
Qianluo.

916
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,260
Duan Xuanyi

917
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,650
[Wukui Parlor]
is not a disciple of Xueyue City.

918
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,090
You cannot challenge him.

919
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,410
But, Father,

920
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,460
he used poison.

921
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,460
It isn't against the rules.

922
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,570
Besides,

923
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,020
Duan Xuanyi didn't poison him.

924
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,090
It was from

925
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,810
the previous challenger, Duan Xuanheng.

926
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,090
You...

927
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,250
Why did you get down?

928
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:10,690
You two

929
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,650
asked me to.

930
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,060
Wait.

931
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,090
Knowing you,

932
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,210
it'll take a lot of

933
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:15,980
begging from us

934
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,130
before you get down

935
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,170
reluctantly.

936
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,420
Shut up.

937
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,060
No way.

938
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,500
Why would he challenge him?

939
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,060
Who?

940
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:29,570
Who are you?

941
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,380
Xiao Se of Snowfall Villa.

942
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,060
You are

943
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,860
the disciple of the Spear Deity?

944
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,090
If you say so.

945
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:42,770
Your Highness,

946
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,460
we have an answer

947
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,770
to one of our questions already.

948
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,650
Chuhe stepped in?

949
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:49,650
Yes.

950
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,380
The Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe,

951
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,460
is attending a tournament

952
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,420
in Xueyue City.

953
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,610
The one using a fan

954
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,650
doesn't sound very strong.

955
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,130
Why does Chuhe keep dodging then?

956
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,730
I don't get it.

957
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,900
24 Fan Blades.

958
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,420
Your qinggong is exceptional

959
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,420
and your knowledge is broad.

960
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:25,730
Unfortunately,

961
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,090
you can't defeat me

962
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,500
by dodging.

963
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,380
That

964
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,650
we shall see.

965
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,610
The Walking on Clouds of the Sixth Prince

966
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,340
has improved,

967
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,210
but I do not feel

968
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,020
any inner force

969
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,770
from him.

970
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,420
Does that mean his martial skills

971
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,060
was truly crippled?

972
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,570
I now understand your movement.

973
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,540
You will lose

974
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,130
within the next ten attacks.

975
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,900
Try me.

976
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,210
Explosives from the Lei Clan.

977
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,020
One will stun you.

978
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,820
Two will send you home.

979
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:11,730
Keep bragging.

980
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,610
We are sending you home.

981
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,290
Say that again?

982
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:13,980
Mind your mouth.

983
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:14,690
Just go home.

984
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:15,210
You're cheating.

985
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,250
You used the firearm from the Lei Clan.

986
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,090
You used poison.

987
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,500
So shut up.

988
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:20,380
You...

989
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:21,860
Xiao Se.

990
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,940
Use

991
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,020
all those bombs.

992
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,250
Sure.

993
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,020
I used too many of them,

994
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,340
so there are only two left.

995
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,940
Die now!

996
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,090
Beautiful!

997
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,540
Good.

998
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,940
That was an amazing usage

999
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,250
of Death Letter.

1000
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,060
Come on.

1001
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,540
I talked to Lian.

1002
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,460
We decided

1003
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,460
to lend you our weapons

1004
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,540
so that you can have the upper hand

1005
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,210
and win it.

1006
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,730
What weapons?

1007
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,020
Both of my bombs

1008
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,610
and three Death Letters from Lian.

1009
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,940
They are worth 1,000 silver taels.

1010
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:08,770
For the next three days,

1011
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:09,940
Lian and I

1012
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,980
will teach you how to use explosives
and hidden weapons.

1013
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,340
You know

1014
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,420
the best qinggong in the world.

1015
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,200
And now, you're equipped with explosives

1016
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,210
and hidden weapons.

1017
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:17,940
No one

1018
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,060
can defeat you.

1019
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:19,980
Exactly.

1020
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,500
24 Fan Blades.

1021
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,980
23 of them are on the front,

1022
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,060
representing grace.

1023
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,020
One blade is on the rear.

1024
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,650
It's called Mortality.

1025
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,940
The end of grace is mortality.

1026
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,770
And you lack grace.

1027
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,540
Who are you?

1028
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,820
Xiao Se of Snowfall Villa.

1029
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,500
The one who defeated you.

1030
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,170
The winner goes to Xiao Se of Xueyue City.

1031
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,500
He

1032
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,650
actually won?

1033
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:53,980
Yes, he did.

1034
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,540
He fought wonderfully too.

1035
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,170
Chuhe can always

1036
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,500
do the unexpected.

1037
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,900
Even in the bleakest of situations,

1038
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,210
he can still turn the tide.

1039
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,340
Your Highness.

1040
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:07,610
He cannot win.

1041
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,290
Are you worried

1042
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,650
that he will ally with Xueyue City
with this marriage?

1043
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,090
If he forges an alliance with Xueyue City

1044
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,420
as Xiao Se,

1045
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,090
when we bring him the news

1046
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,210
that His Majesty is ready to pardon him,

1047
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:18,860
his power

1048
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,650
will grow

1049
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,730
out of our control.

1050
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,090
Xiao Se.

1051
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,130
You did very well.

1052
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,210
I didn't expect your compliment,

1053
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,250
Miss Sikong.

1054
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,170
Your Highness,

1055
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,730
a prince's marriage should be decided
in the ancestral shrine.

1056
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,650
He cannot decide on his own.

1057
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,090
But he is now

1058
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,980
Xiao Se,

1059
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,340
not a prince.

1060
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,380
Your Highness.

1061
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,210
When you deliver His Majesty's message,

1062
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,250
he'll become Xiao Chuhe.

1063
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,020
I just want to know

1064
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,090
the final outcome

1065
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,340
of this tournament.

1066
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,690
All the best, Qianluo.

1067
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,690
Good luck!

1068
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,500
Good luck.

1069
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:58,980
Qianluo!

1070
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,170
All the best, Xiao Se!

1071
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,020
You can do this, Qianluo.

1072
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:01,650
Qianluo!

1073
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,290
You defeated them,

1074
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,820
but you still have to

1075
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,820
fight my spear.

1076
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:10,860
I admit defeat.

1077
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,170
Can't you play along

1078
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,340
even though you have completed

1079
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,610
your mission?

1080
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:21,650
Zang Ming.

1081
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,650
Chuhe

1082
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,090
surely does the unexpected.

1083
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,420
So full of surprises.

1084
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:29,730
Xiao Se!

1085
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:30,980
What is going on?

1086
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,060
I lost.

1087
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,340
But the fight hasn't even begun.

1088
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,290
How did you lose?

1089
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,900
I used all the explosives and hidden weapons

1090
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,650
you gave me.

1091
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,020
How am I supposed to fight now?

1092
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,060
Qianluo will go easy on you.

1093
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:42,500
Lei Wujie.

1094
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,460
Don't spout nonsense.

1095
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,900
No one will go easy on him.

1096
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,290
A rigged match in Xueyue City!

1097
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:48,690
Mind your mouth.

1098
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,380
A rigged match is unacceptable.

1099
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,170
Who rigged the match?

1100
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:51,940
How can Xueyue City do this?

1101
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,770
How is this a rigged match?

1102
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:55,770
Rigged?

1103
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,540
Shut up now,

1104
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:58,820
losers.

1105
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,690
How annoying.

1106
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,210
The tournament is over.

1107
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,570
Take it

1108
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,380
as you wish.

1109
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,290
Let's go.

1110
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,290
Stop them.

1111
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,650
Xueyue City has to give us an answer.

1112
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:16,820
Zang Ming.

1113
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,500
The final outcome is out now.

1114
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,130
Help them out, will you?

1115
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,690
Lord Bai of Beili Kingdom

1116
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,340
has arrived.

1117
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,420
Kneel before His Highness.

1118
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,290
Greetings, Your Highness.

1119
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,210
Xiao Se!

1120
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,980
