00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,980
I really want to drink the liquor

made by my master once more.

27
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,890
I feel uneasy about it.

I'm back.

31
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,460
You haven't grown up to the point

32
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,620
of not needing your eldest martial brother yet.

33
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,180
Are we still going to wait for Lian?

34
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,060
We'll wait for him in Tianqi.

35
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,850
Let's enter the city.

36
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,210
A bunch of useless beings!

37
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,130
Calm down, Your Highness.

38
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,180

39
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,980

that they had 3,000 cavalries, didn't they?

If we continue to fight him,

Be patient, Your Highness.

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,300
You are too soft-hearted.

58
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,620
Although he is back in Tianqi,

59
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,100
Tianqi is no longer the same

60
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,370
as before.

61
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,130
I look forward to having a fight with him.

62
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,250
A fair fight.

Xiao Se.

64
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,420
Your mansion is too luxurious.

65
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,370
You can buy a city

66
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,860
with this land.

67
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,300
No. You can buy two with it.

68
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,330
That's an exaggeration.

69
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,860
It's just a mansion.

70
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,540
Xiao Se.

71
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,890
Why do you name your royal residence

72
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,500
the Snowfall Villa?

73
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,500
I have falling snow in front

74
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,060
and a tranquil lake at the back.

75
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,620
I have a villa

76
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,010
named Snowfall.

77
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,370
What an elegant name.

00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,940
Doesn't it sound nice?

79
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,770
Besides, this is not my royal residence.

80
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,980
I dislike living in a royal residence.

81
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,300
I prefer this place.

in the past few years.

Not really.

Yes, Young Master.

102

This way, please.

103
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,570
You brat.

104

Uncle?

105
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,420
I thought

106
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,500
that you would return to the palace first.

107
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,420
I've already sent someone to the Sword Heart Tomb

108
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,690
to invite the Divine Healer.

109
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,210
I've already brought the Divine Healer
back with me.

110
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,210
She's treating your father at Tai'an Hall

111

as we speak.

112
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,940
According to her,

113
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,940
your father will regain consciousness.

114
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:12,740
Don't worry.

115
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,740
Thank you, Uncle.

116
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,540
There's no need to thank me.

117
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,010
I'll take my leave now.

118
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,690
Farewell.

119
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,370
Did I wake you?

120
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,980
I've been awake for a long time.

121
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,500
Usually, I'll have already finished
picking the medicinal herbs

122
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,450
at Sword Tomb by this time.

123
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,180
Why are you here so early?

124
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,100
His Majesty won't wake up today.

125
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,330
I know.

126
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,450
I'm here to tell you

127
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,300
that your patient has returned.

128
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,500
Xiao Se is back?

129
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,810
Has he really recovered?

130
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,330
That's great.

131
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,500
So, immortals really exist in this world.

132
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,330
If I have the chance,

133
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,740
I want to become his disciple.

134
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,250
So, when you come back

135
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,370
after learning at the celestial mountain,

136
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,420
am I not going to be able

137
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,420
to hire you anymore?

138
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,940
I hope

139
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,570
that you'll never have to hire me again.

140
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,130
You are right.

141
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,300
Your Majesty.

142
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,140

since they entered Tianqi City, right?

147
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,730
Many have requested to pay a visit

148

to Snowfall Villa.

149
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,660
But they were stopped by the butler.

150
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,780
Xiao Chuhe doesn't seem

151
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,260
to want

152
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,300
anything to do

153
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,900
with Tianqi City now.

154
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,810
They are still waiting for someone.

One of their companions

156
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,140
is not here yet.

157
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,900
He is the strongest one

158
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,940
among them.

159
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,570
Unfortunately,

160
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,780
they will see him no more.

Do you have news about Lian?

167
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,850
Nonsense!

168
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,940
Did you see him die?

169
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,330
How could you say this?

170
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,570
His body has been sent back to the Tang Clan.

171
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,850
I saw it myself.

172
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,060
You must have been mistaken.

173
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,450
Get lost now.

174
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:56,940
Xiao Se.

175
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,090
Send someone to the Tang Clan now
to find out more about it.

176
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,060
Maybe he really was mistaken.

177
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,420
Our clan leader said

178
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,260
that Lian fulfilled his duty

179
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,380
and hence died without any regrets.

180
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,970
So, don't be sad

181
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,570
and put the big plan first.

182
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,420
How did he die?

183
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,330
He drank

184
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,730
the Seven Starry Nights

185
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,420
and died of exhaustion.

186
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,210
Who killed him?

187
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,140
The head of the Xie family,
Xie Qidao, from the Dark River.

188
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,060
Together with 21 assassins.

189
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,900
He killed them all by himself

190

That's impossible.

to escape death.

Why couldn't he do it this time?

201
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,660
This time, he didn't have us holding him back.

202

He didn't have us holding him back.

203

How could he die?

204
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,380
The clan leader said

205
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,380
that Lian told him

about Dark River being the culprit

behind our Old Master's death.

is the Dark River.

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,210
of our enemy in the dark

379
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,210
to avenge Lian

380
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,620
by killing them myself.

381
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,940
I don't know

382
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,180
most of them

383
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,620
in this name list.

384
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,860
But I trust your judgment.

385
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,490
Ask Mr. Xu to draft the invitation letters

386
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,010
and send them out.

387
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,250
What is the identity that you want to use?

388
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,770
Do you want to invite them in the name
of the Sixth Prince or Lord Yong'an?

389
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,900
Xiao Se.

390
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,490
Just this.

391
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,570
Okay.

392
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,010
As for the venue,

393
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,730
Diaolou Parlor

394
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:02,770
and Tianxia Pavilion

395
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,860
are both good choices.

396
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,580
Diaolou Parlor.

397
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,530
Tianxia Pavilion.

398
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,970
They are too small.

399
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,210
They are too small for my banquet.

400
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,620
There's only one place

401
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,420
that I want.

402
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,050
The Qianjin Gambling House.

403
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,770
[Qianjin Gambling House]
Come.

404
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,380
No second thoughts.

405
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,490
Big or small?

406
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,580
Big!

407
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,490
No second thoughts.

408
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:33,690
Sixth...

409
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,140
Sixth Prince.

410
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,420
You are back.

411
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,010
I knew

412
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,450
that I would meet one of you first.

413
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,420
But I never thought
that it would be you, Master Jiu.

414
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,210
You are too kind.

415
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,620
There's no need to call me Master Jiu.

416
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,250
My buddies flattered me.

417
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,290
Stop teasing me, Sixth Prince.

418
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,210
Go up and tell them

419
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,580
that we have an important guest. Go now.

420
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,450
Sixth Prince.

421
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,420
Are they your friends?

422
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,340
Let me introduce them to you.

423
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,970
This is Lei Wujie,
the Second City Lord of Xueyue City,

424
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,050
Li Hanyi's disciple.

425
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,820
This is the daughter of Sikong Changfeng,

426
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,970
the Third City Lord.

427
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:07,900
She is Sikong Qianluo.

428
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,180
Amazing.

429
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,530
This man is called Jiu Jiudao.

430
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,620
Because he holds power

431
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,530
over all the streets

432
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,770
in Tianqi City.

433
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,770
So, everyone calls him Master Jiu.

434
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,530
Young Lady, Mr. Lei.

435
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,290
Just call me Jiu Jiudao.

436
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,870
This is how Miss Ruoyi addresses me too.

437
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,060
You know Ruoyi?

438
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,390
Miss Ruoyi

439
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,540
is in the top three

440
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,430
of the Beauty List in our city.

441
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,390
Everyone knows her.

442
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,260
The Beauty List? Who made the list?

443
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,470
I made the list.

444
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,950
But don't worry,

445
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,260
you'll be

446
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,430
in the top three

447
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,430
next time.

448
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,910
Master Jiu.

449
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,020
They are ready to serve our guests upstairs.

450
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,500
Okay. I got it.

451
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,430
Let's go upstairs, my noble guests.

452
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,630
This way, please.

453
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,060
This way, please.

454
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,230
Second Master Tu.

455
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,630
Thank you, Master Jiu.

456
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,780
My pleasure.

457
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,630
Sixth Prince.

458
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,910
You still look

459
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,150
as dashing as ever even after so many years.

460
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,580
Second Master Tu.

461
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,300
How have you been?

462
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,150
Did we interrupt you

463
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,230
with our sudden visit?

464
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,300
I was just drinking tea. Nothing to interrupt.

465
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,340
I was just thirsty.

466
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,820
Have a seat, everyone.

467
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,740
Sixth Prince.

468
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,910
Please drink some tea.

469
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,670
Or should I call you Lord Yong'an, Your Highness?

470
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,260
Be at ease.

471
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,540
You can just call me Xiao Se.

472
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,540
Good name.

473
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,060
It sounds poetic.

474
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,710
From what they told me,

475
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,870
both of you

476
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,100
are powerful people as well.

477
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,230
Come.

478
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,470
Please drink some tea.

479
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,670
Qianluo, Lei Wujie.

480
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,430
He is the owner of Qianjin Gambling House.

481
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,260
Second Master Tu.

482
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,190
Second Master Tu?

483
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,300
Does it mean

484
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,740
that there's a Master Tu?

485
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,500
Yes, there was.

486
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,870
But in the end,

487
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,390
I killed him.

488
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:16,910
Enough.

489
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,340
That's it for small talk.

490
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:19,990
To be honest,

491
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,430
I'm here today

492
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,580
because I have a favor to ask.

493
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,540
If you need my help,

494
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,540
I'm sure it'll be trouble.

495
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,470
It won't be.

496
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,340
I just want some food.

497
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,190
That's easy.

498
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,670
Order what you want.

499
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,910
I have all kinds of delicacies here.

500
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,340
Good.

501
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,190
This is the promise that I want from you.

502
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,540
Take it out.

503
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,300
Here.

504
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,020
This...

505
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,950
Do you know

506
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,260
what's written on this?

507
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,710
A royal banquet.

508
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
This is a royal banquet

509
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,150
for the most prestigious

510
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,260
and noble guests.

511
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,870
Second Master Tu,
don't misunderstand my intentions.

512
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,740
Those useless chefs in the imperial kitchen

513
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,780
can't satisfy my palate.

514
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,020
But the chefs of Qianjin Gambling House

515
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,910
are the best of the best

516
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,540
in Tianqi.

517
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,500
Don't try to flatter me

518
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,230
with compliments.

519
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,100
This is a gambling house.

520
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,150
Not a restaurant.

521
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,780
This banquet will take at least a day

522
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,150
from noon to midnight.

523
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,100
I'll lose a lot of money

524
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,820
if I don't open for a day.

525
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,870
I know that.

526
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
But I don't think

527
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,630
it'll make a dent in your savings.

528
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,780
Make money

529
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,630
or make Tianqi City

530
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,740
tremble in awe.

531
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,020
What will you choose?

532
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,710
You have to give me some money then.

533
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,670
Food is not cheap.

534
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,260
How about

535
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,870
I give my Snowfall Villa to you?

536
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,820
Are you really going to give it to me?

537
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,430
If you are willing to give it to me,

538
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,710
I'll give you

539
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,740
ten more baskets of pearls.

540
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:08,870
Xiao Se.

541
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,190
If you give him the villa,

542
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,710
where are we going to stay?

543
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,630
That's right.

544
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,190
I'm not done yet.

545
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,990
But we still need to stay
in that villa in Tianqi City

546
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,780
for a while.

547
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,430
I have another secluded villa

548
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,470
in the martial arts world.

549
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,340
It has green mountains behind it
with a crystal-clear lake in front.

550
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,990
It's an elegant place.

551
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,060
(When the snow falls,)

552
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,990
(it's like an other-worldly place.)

553
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,580
[Snowfall Villa]
(It is also called the Snowfall Villa.)

554
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,060
I can give that to you.

555
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,300
Deal!

556
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,500
It's a deal then.

557
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:42,990
Wait.

558
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,630
This banquet

559
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,470
can't be handled

560
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,470
by either Diaolou Parlor or Tianxia Pavilion.

561
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,390
Only the Qianjin Gambling House
is grand enough for it.

562
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,190
But don't you think that the scale of this banquet

563
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,470
is too grand?

564
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,580
Now that my father is seriously ill,

565
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,990
he can't rule for the moment.

566
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,300
Is there anyone in Tianqi City who will dare

567
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,500
to say that my banquet is too grand?

568
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,430
A banquet in Qianjin Gambling House?

569
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,910
Only he can come up with this idea.

570
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,950
Marquis.

571
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,190
Not only

572
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,710
those prestigious royal families

573
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,670
have received an invitation,

574
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,710
but even those powerful people

575
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,820
in Tianqi City

576
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,230
who run the underworld

577
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,670
are also invited.

578
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,670
This is indeed his way of doing things.

579
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,190
[Sincerely, Xiao Se]
Xiao Se.

580
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,020
Looks like

581
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,580
he really likes this name.

582
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,430
[Lord Bai's Residence]
Your Highness.

583
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,950
Do you think

584
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,430
we should attend this banquet or not?

585
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,740
What do you think?

586
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,670
If it was up to me,

587
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,060
no.

588
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,390
Why?

589
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,430
We won't go,

590
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,500
and we can't let others go.

591
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,950
Sixth Prince has invited

592
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,300
many of the royal families,
merchants, and rich people.

593
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,020
These people

594
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,430
are close to you.

595
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,870
If you don't go,

596
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,950
they won't dare to attend it either.

597
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,150
Have you sent them out?

598
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,950
Yes.

599
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,820
Soon, those residences

600
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,870
will receive the information.

601
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,150
Good.

602
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,540
I won't let anyone

603
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,430
attend his banquet.

604
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,470
I heard that after Lord Bai's Residence

605
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,740
received the invitation,

606
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,950
they sent their men

607
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,230
to visit those who are close to them.

608
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,430
I think they have the same mindset as ours.

609
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,100
He made his own bed.

610
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,670
You've worked hard, Divine Healer.

611
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,950
The best way for you to thank me

612
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,580
is to not disturb my patient.

613
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,470
I can't say yes to that.

614
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,390
I have something very important

615
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,100
to report today.

616
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,990
I need to tell His Majesty about it.

617
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,340
Fine.

618
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,100
I know

619
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,260
that this is a state affair.

620
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,470
His Majesty will be awake

621
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,670
for a while after an hour.

622
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,630
You can wait for him to wake up.

623
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,540
Okay.

624
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,230
How is he?

625
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,580
His Majesty has heart disease.

626
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,190
I can treat his disease.

627
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,430
But I can't treat his heart.

628
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,470
My master told me

629
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,870
that the most difficult illness to treat

630
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,870
is the illness of the heart.

631
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,260
It's not something

632
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,500
that a physician can heal.

633
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,150
But there's something

634
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,060
that I can promise you.

635
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,710
He's not in fatal danger now.

636
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,300
You are indeed a Divine Healer.

637
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,580
Stop patting my head.

638
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,990
Or else, I can't grow taller.

639
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,470
"If you are not willing to attend,

640
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,710
I won't force you."

641
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,340
Nonsense.

642
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,100
Who says that I don't want to attend it?

643
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,580
I haven't attended a banquet

644
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,740
at this scale

645
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,630
for many years.

646
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,990
He is trying to read my mind

647
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,990
with his commoner's mindset.

648
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,820
Go.

649
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,780
Prepare a gift

650
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,470
according to the letter

651
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,260
and deliver it to Snowfall Villa

652
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,100
before noon tomorrow.

653
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,780
Yes, Master.

654
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,950
It'll be lively

655
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,740
at Qianjin Gambling House tomorrow.

656
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,100
Unfortunately,

657
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,990
His Highness

658
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,540
has guessed it right.

659
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,990
I really don't want to attend it.

660
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,430
Master.

661
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,060
Why are you back?

662
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,230
You have guests

663
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,500
from Mount Wangcheng.

664
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:16,990
Invite them in.

665
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,150
Yes, Master.

666
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,540
We've sent out the invitation letters.

667
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,540
And the Qianjin Gambling House has replied

668
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,820
that we can proceed with the banquet tomorrow.

669
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,100
Xiao Se.

670
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,340
Why do you

671
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,190
still look so worried?

672
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,060
Xiao Se.

673
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,190
Are you worried

674
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,670
that someone will not attend
the banquet tomorrow?

675
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,390
So what if they don't attend it?

676
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,580
Some

677
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,390
will have more important things to do.

678
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,950
What if everyone

679
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,470
has more important things to do?

680
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,870
Really?

681
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,670
Will there be no one tomorrow?

682
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,580
It's possible.

683
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,470
After all, Tianqi City

684
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,150
is different now.

685
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,430
But I'm sure something
will remain the same, right?

686
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,190
If no one attends the banquet,

687
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,150
it'll be super awkward.

688
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,060
The thing

689
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,470
that remains the same

690
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,630
is they were not my match back then.

691
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,740
And they

692
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,540
are still no match for me now.

693
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,910
Young Master.

694
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,820
This is the last one.

695
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,390
But Jiu Jiudao

696
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,390
still can't find anyone

697
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,820
who can accept this invitation letter.

698
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,670
He's supposed to have reached

699
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,470
Tianqi City a long time ago.

700
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,630
Why can't he be found?

701
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,870
According to Jiu Jiudao,

702
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,390
they had looked for him

703
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,580
everywhere.

704
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,990
Can it be that he has already left?

705
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,150
Forget it.

706
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,260
It's a pity that he won't get

707
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,780
to witness this interesting banquet.

708
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,300
Who are you talking about?

709
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,390
It'll be a surprise for you.

710
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,870
You'll find out later.

711
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,820
By the way,

712
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,670
where's Miss Ye?

713
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,390
Why isn't she here tonight?

714
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,390
Ye has already gone back
to the General's Residence.

715
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,950
Father.

716
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,390
What is it?

717
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,540
Are you worried

718
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,500
about tomorrow's banquet?

719
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,390
I'm worried that someone will do something

720
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,740
to stop at least half

721
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,910
of the people from this list

722
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,950
from attending the banquet tomorrow.

723
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,910
If only the restraining order was not in effect.

724
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,300
If I could attend it,

725
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,740
everyone would attend it as well.

726
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,390
If they didn't attend it,

727
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,100
I would send the Ye Battalion

728
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,230
to surround their residences.

729
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,190
Stop joking around.

730
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,340
Are you the one who made this list?

731
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:50,950
Not bad.

732
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,230
Everyone on this list

733
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,340
holds power

734
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,740
over this city.

735
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,990
As expected of my daughter.

736
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,150
I'm not as powerful as Lei Wujie and Qianluo.

737
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,710
They

738
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,260
are the tip-top martial artists
among the young people

739
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,020
of this age.

740
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,870
But even if I'm not good at martial arts,

741
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,500
I can still be Xiao Se's strategist

742
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,230
in Tianqi City.

743
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,910
But someone

744
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,150
is missing

745
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,340
from this list.

746
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,300
Are you referring to...

747
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,740
Yes. Him.

748
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,190
But I'm not confident
that he will accept my invitation.

749
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,470
Yes.

750
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,260
No one is able

751
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,190
to make him attend anything.

752
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,670
Even if it was me,

753
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,500
I wouldn't be able to make much difference.

754
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,100
What if I ask Marquis Lanyue to help me with it?

755
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,190
Him?

756
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,150
Although he's the Director of Nation now,

757
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,190
he's not that influential yet.

758
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:52,870
I've been looking

759
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,230
for this sword.

760
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,100
I never thought that you had it all along.

761
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,190
Uncle Langya

762
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,630
gave this sword to me

763
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,580
because he wanted me

764
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,910
to travel the world with it.

765
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:04,950
Not bad.

766
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,670
Are you willing to part with it?

767
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,220
After all,

768
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,180
this is from your uncle.

769
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,700
He's not here anymore.

770
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,660
If you keep this sword,

771
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,020
you'll have something to remember him by.

772
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,220
Why will I be unwilling to part with it?

773
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:17,620
I'm not the kind of person

774
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,620
who can't let go of something.

775
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,750
You are the kind of person

776
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:20,910
who can't let go of anything.

777
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,350
Or else, you would've come back a long time ago.

778
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,660
Anyway, I'll have to trouble you

779
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,660
to deliver this sword

780
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,950
to that person.

781
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,580
Are you sure?

782
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,500
This sword

783
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:34,700
represents

784
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,060
an important friendship.

785
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,390
And you want to exchange it for a banquet.

786
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:39,870
Is it worth it?

787
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,180
This sword is not just

788
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,580
a symbol of friendship.

789
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,420
It's also a representation
of my purpose for coming back.

790
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,060
Even though I'm back now,

791
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,220
I have not forgotten

792
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,880
about what happened four years ago.

793
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,500
Hopefully, that person

794
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,310
will appreciate your painstaking effort.

795
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,600
[Qianjin Gambling House]

796
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,830
This...

797
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,500
According to the banquet rules

798
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,500
of the prestigious and royal families,

799
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,470
the guests have to be there four hours

800
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,790
prior to the official start of the banquet.

801
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,170
There are only two hours left
before the start of the banquet.

802
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,570
But no one is here yet.

803
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Calm down.

804
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,140
I've just checked the time,

805
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,460
they have only two hours before the start

806
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,620
of the banquet at Qianjin Gambling House.

807
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,190
I've just received a piece of news

808
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,340
that there's no one there yet.

809
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,170
Will this be an empty banquet?

810
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,850
Maybe they are thinking

811
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,130
about what to wear.

812
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,700
Miss Ruoyi.

813
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,180
How about you go in and take a rest?

814
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,330
I'll stay here.

815
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,020
Your guests are here.

816
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,270
How can you leave before you welcome your guests?

817
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,780
You are that man

818
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,530
with a very special name.

819
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,020
Jiu Jiudao.

820
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,620
Yes. Jiu Jiudao.

821
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,620
Welcome, Master Jiu.

822
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,840
I knew

823
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,990
that he would be the first to arrive.

824
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,740
The first to arrive

825
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,180
will be remembered by the whole city of Tianqi.

826
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,870
It means

827
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,270
that he's my closest friend.

828
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,700
Do you know

829
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,560
what they call him now in Tianqi City?

830
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,100
Master Jiu.

831
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,310
But when he was still known

832
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,530
as the Lowly Jiu,

833
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,300
it was you who saved him.

834
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,140
Even if

835
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,490
he'll attract everyone's attention,

836
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,530
he'll still want to be the first to arrive.

837
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,270
Miss Ruoyi,

838
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,580
we meet again.

839
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,020
Master Jiu.

840
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,870
You are the first to arrive today.

841
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,500
It's because

842
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,990
you are the one welcoming the guests today.

843
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,380
I can't bear

844
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,100
to make you wait.

845
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,630
Thank you.

846
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:22,600
Jiu!

847
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:23,980
This way, please.

848
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,220
After you.

849
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,060
The head of Tianming Abode, Jiu Jiudao,

850
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,100
has arrived with his disciples
from the three clans

851
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,030
and nineteen residences.

852
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,820
Three clans and nineteen residences.

853
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,310
You addressed him as Master Jiu.

854
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,470
Is he a powerful person?

855
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,950
The three clans and nineteen residences

856
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,180
are an underworld alliance

857
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,170
in Tianqi City

858
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,610
led by Tianming Abode.

859
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,830
They can handle things

860
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,430
that the government of Tianqi City can't handle.

861
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,700
They can take part in the underworld industry

862
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,260
that the major merchants can't.

863
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,860
They can find information that escapes

864
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,460
even the Court of Judicature.

865
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,350
In short,

866
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,660
even the dragon in the sky

867
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,430
can't kill them.

868
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,940
The three clans and nineteen residences.

869
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,060
Before this,

870
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:03,790
I suspected

871
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,860
that they were working for Lord Bai.

872
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,380
Now, it seems

873
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,060
like they've been

874
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,430
working for Xiao Chuhe all along.

875
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,860
These three clans

876
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,740
don't look like much.

877
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,100
But we still have to be on our guard against them.

878
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,140
But it's better for them

879
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,350
to attend it rather than not.

880
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,910
Why is it better

881
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,580
for them to attend it?

882
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,030
Chuhe will be considered capable

883
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,690
to have connections with them.

884
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,130
But if these people

885
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,430
are his only connections,

886
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:31,970
it means

887
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,180
that this prince

888
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,910
only has power over these lowly merchants.

889
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,660
And these people

890
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,250
will only prove how powerless he is now.

891
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
It won't do good for his reputation.

892
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,570
Young Master.

893
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,250
We've entered the city.

894
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,570
What should we do next?

895
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,860
Of course we need to let

896
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,090
the entire Tianqi know

897
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,580
that we are here.

898
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:40,950
Look at his outfit.

899
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,950
I can tell that he's royalty.

900
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:42,860
Yes.

901
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,820
He has a commanding presence.

902
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,500
Look at this nobleman.

903
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Which family is he from?

904
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,570
He looks dashing.

905
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:51,570
Yes.

906
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,060
He looks extraordinary.

907
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,020
He's not a commoner.

908
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,500
Yes.

909
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,820
He looks outstanding.

910
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:58,970
I heard

911
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,140
that due to the heavy snow not long ago,

912
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,540
many of the farmers in the suburbs
were affected by it.

913
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,340
So, there are some refugees
in the south of the city.

914
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,660
Donate a box of silver ingots to them

915
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,140
to help them out.

916
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,950
Roger that.

917
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:16,930
In the north of the city,

918
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,700
a gambling house

919
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,060
tricked its customers
and caused them to go bankrupt.

920
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,860
They are even colluding with the officials.

921
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,580
And they have not received
the punishment they deserve.

922
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,540
Butler Liang.

923
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,350
That gambling house

924
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,510
is owned by the Li family, right?

925
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,650
Yes.

926
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,060
Since

927
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,060
the Li family owes

928
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,260
the Mu family 5,000 taels of silver,

929
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,660
they can pay off their debt

930
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,820
with that gambling house.

931
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,820
Close it down.

932
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,350
Roger that.

933
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,380
Just like that?

934
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,830
Next, my own Chunfeng Parlor

935
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,860
in the west of the city

936
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,910
is going to give out free food

937
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,570
to everyone in the city

938
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,090
on behalf of Lord Yong'an.

939
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:56,620
Roger that.

940
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,580
This is great!

941
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,350
Yes.

942
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,650
As for the rest of you,

943
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,060
go to the salt merchant Li's Residence,

944
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,180
the Grand Entertainment House,
Gongsun Pawn Shop,

945
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,140
