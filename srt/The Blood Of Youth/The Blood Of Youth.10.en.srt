Why can't Zhao Yuzhen

189
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,980
leave the mountain?

190
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,860
There are many rumors

191
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,780
about Zhao Yuzhen.

192
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,060
When he was born,

193
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,540
a ray of sun shone into the room.

194
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,820
The Senior Celestial Master of Mount Wangcheng

195
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,180
came to receive him in person

196
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,340
because Zhao Yuzhen
is the reincarnation of a deity.

197
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,700
He then brought Zhao Yuzhen
back to Mount Wangcheng.

198
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,420
Zhao Yuzhen stayed there since then.

199
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,420
They say Zhao Yuzhen

200
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,420
can't leave the mountain

201
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,620
because of a prophecy

202
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,060
by the Senior Celestial Master, Lyu Suzhen.

203
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,050
Apparently, if he leaves the mountain,

204
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,020
it will bring unrest.

205
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,300
It might even become a threat
to a certain someone

206
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,500
in Tianqi City.

207
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,940
Therefore, 5,000 Iron Troops are stationed

208
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,140
30 li away from Mount Wangcheng.

209
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,300
Just in case Zhao Yuzhen leaves the mountain.

210
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,620
Some also say

211
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,540
that Zhao Yuzhen

212
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,860
contains the fate

213
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,540
of Mount Wangcheng.

214
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,020
But the prophecy

215
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,460
is most likely fictional.

216
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,380
They're just worried that he won't come back.

217
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,460
So with his power,

218
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,700
no one can stop him

219
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,500
as long as he wants to leave?

220
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,940
For a decade, he hardly leaves

221
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,820
his courtyard,

222
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,900
let alone the mountain.

223
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,380
I think he's waiting for someone.

224
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,220
If that person doesn't show up,

225
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,100
I think he'll keep waiting.

226
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,020
Something's on your mind.

227
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,460
I was born to the Tang Clan.

228
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,140
I am a disciple

229
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,180
of Tang Lianyue, an elder of the Tang Clan.

230
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,500
I thought I would live and die

231
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,660
for the Tang Clan,

232
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,220
but I was sent to Xueyue City out of a sudden.

233
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,620
And now, I'm a disciple

234
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,860
of the Liquor Deity, Baili Dongjun.

235
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,420
Master Lianyue told me

236
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,380
to wait for someone here.

237
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,180
And I have waited for six years.

238
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,620
The Tang Clan always does this.

239
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,540
All of you were born

240
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,980
with countless duties and responsibilities.

241
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,740
So you lead a life of burdens.

242
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,140
You have to meddle in Xueyue City's affairs

243
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,540
while performing the duty your clan gave you.

244
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,580
People try to live

245
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,300
every day too,

246
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,660
but they live

247
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,740
for themselves.

248
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,820
They don't have that many other things
to worry about.

249
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,220
Are you sure you're here in Xueyue City

250
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,860
for money alone?

251
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,100
Money

252
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,660
is important.

253
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,460
Eight hundred taels.

254
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,100
It sure is important then.

255
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,180
You're wrong.

256
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,980
It's eight million taels.

257
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,980
If you had that much money,

258
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,860
what would you do?

259
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,420
Assemble an army

260
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,780
and raze Tianqi City to the ground.

261
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,460
I'll join you.

262
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,020
Why?

263
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,980
You came to Xueyue City with me.

264
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,420
So I'll go to Tianqi City with you.

265
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,820
Sure.

266
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:08,940
You're not

267
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,860
the person I'm waiting for?

268
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,100
Why is a man

269
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,140
waiting for another man?

270
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,220
Don't speak to your senior like that.

271
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,700
I will beat you up.

272
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,700
You're just taking advantage

273
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,620
of my lack of martial skills.

274
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,100
Do you want a fair fight with something else?

275
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,020
Sure.

276
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,420
Try me.

277
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,780
You're a disciple of Liquor Deity.

278
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,660
So let's compete with our alcohol tolerance.

279
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,540
Sure.

280
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,620
I'll get some liquor here.

281
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:33,820
Come on.

282
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,620
[Mount Wangcheng]

283
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,860
Mount Wangcheng.

284
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,300
The elders are discussing

285
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
if they should expel you.

286
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,420
Let them be.

287
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,220
I must practice my sword skill

288
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,420
and become a sword deity.

289
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,860
Hong, I know you are headstrong

290
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,380
and I'm not here to persuade you.

291
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,140
But tell me,

292
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,580
why are you doing this?

293
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,060
Because I saw it

294
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,860
on Mount Wangcheng.

295
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,740
What is that?

296
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,900
No sword aura

297
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,100
can be this powerful.

298
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,820
Miss.

299
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,700
You

300
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,340
did that?

301
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,300
Yes. So?

302
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,780
Nothing.

303
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,220
No.

304
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,420
It's not nothing.

305
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,580
You... You...

306
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,580
Miss.

307
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,060
I'm Lei Hong.

308
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,940
The beauty of that slash.

309
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,300
Mount Wangcheng?

310
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,900
[Mount Wangcheng]
Who's there?

311
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,900
How dare you venture into Mount Wangcheng?

312
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,340
I'm Lei Yunhe

313
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,860
from Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

314
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,500
I'm here to scale the mountain.

315
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,940
Zhao Yuzhen.

316
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,100
Come out now.

317
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,020
In your dreams!

318
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,540
Thunderclap Finger.

319
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,900
Purge!

320
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,020
My friend saw your technique

321
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,980
and he said the sword is the most beautiful

322
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,060
of all martial arts.

323
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
I'd like to see if it's true.

324
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,260
Zhao Yuzhen.

325
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,380
I am here again.

326
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,500
I am Lei Yunhe

327
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,180
from Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.
I'm here to scale the mountain.

328
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,980
The spring moon illuminates the courtyard.

329
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,420
The silver light waltzes on the cup of wine.

330
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,100
As I traverse the corridor,

331
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,180
a waft of the half-fallen plum blossom
enters my nose.

332
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,100
Under the misty moon

333
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,220
is where the youngsters entertain themselves.

334
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,940
Unlike the autumn moon

335
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,660
that guides lost souls.

336
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,220
This is the last pot.

337
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,660
You won, Lian.

338
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,940
Come on, Lian.

339
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,740
Lian?

340
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,020
Lian?

341
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,500
Wow.

342
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,220
He passed out while seated.

343
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,700
Oh, I forgot to inquire about the lady in green.

344
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,140
Someone sneaked into Xueyue City at night.

345
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,660
That's where Master is training!

346
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,340
Who are you?

347
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,580
I should ask you that question.

348
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,500
I can tell you my name,

349
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,060
but do you have the guts to hear it?

350
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,060
My master is training in solitude.

351
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,660
No one is to disturb her.

352
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,900
Please return after a few days

353
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,860
if you want to see her.

354
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,220
After two days,

355
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,380
I won't stop you if you come here.

356
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,980
So you are a disciple of Li Hanyi.

357
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,740
She has a disciple now?

358
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,980
What is your name?

359
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,140
Lei Wujie.

360
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,620
Okay.

361
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,780
Move aside now.

362
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,180
I have to see Li Hanyi.

363
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,660
Don't waste my time.

364
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,260
I just said

365
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,100
she is busy training now.

366
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,580
I may not be strong,

367
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:12,820
but I can't let you

368
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,780
enter like this either.

369
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,260
Ridiculous.

370
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,060
You can't stop me.

371
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,420
Fire Infusion from the Lei Clan.

372
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,500
And Wushuang Fist.

373
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,100
Not bad.

374
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,780
Who are you?

375
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,500
Why did you enter Xueyue City at night?

376
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,500
Do you know this sword?

377
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,740
It's a broken sword.

378
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,420
Li Hanyi

379
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,980
broke my sword.

380
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,740
Its name is Severance.

381
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,460
One slash to sever the water

382
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,420
and a thousand rivers change their course.

383
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,700
You're the City Lord of Wushuang City, Song Yanhui.

384
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,500
[Song Yanhui, Wushuang City]

385
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,900
Is Wushuang City invading

386
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,780
Xueyue City now?

387
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,140
What are you on about, brat?

388
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,100
I'm here to test my sword with your master.

389
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,820
I don't have time for you.

390
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,060
Move aside.

391
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,900
City Lord Song, if you want to enter,

392
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,220
you'll have to fight me.

393
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,580
You're not worth

394
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,620
my time.

395
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,140
Let go of me.

396
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,060
Like I said,

397
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,180
as long as I still live,

398
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,140
you can't enter.

399
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,980
Tingyu.

400
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,740
Find the reason to draw your sword.

401
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,500
(The reason to draw my sword...)

402
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,420
Sword Art.

403
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,700
I too have my technique.

404
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,060
Sword Art,

405
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,180
Beautiful Day.

406
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,820
Beautiful Day.

407
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,340
A technique by Xueyue Sword Deity, Li Hanyi.

408
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,260
Please enlighten me, City Lord Song.

409
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,500
It is beautiful.

410
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,860
You are now worth my time.

411
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,100
Master.

412
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,620
The Beautiful Day passed down

413
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,020
by a sword deity, you said?

414
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,100
When did I ever teach you

415
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,140
a lousy technique like that?

416
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,580
If this gets out,

417
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,460
it will make me

418
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,220
look very bad.

419
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,340
Master,

420
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,620
I now have a reason to draw my sword.

421
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,020
If that is enough to make you

422
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,300
this elated,

423
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,380
how am I supposed to teach you

424
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,460
even stronger techniques?

425
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,780
He drew his sword to protect someone.

426
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,780
You found yourself a good disciple.

427
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,660
Why does it

428
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,020
always come to this?

429
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,380
I heard you have found a disciple too.

430
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,500
He managed to unlock the Wushuang Sword Box

431
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,300
and is training to command the 13 swords.

432
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,900
My disciple

433
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,060
is far more talented than I am.

434
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,740
Within five years,

435
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,300
he'll become a sword deity.

436
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,700
Sure.

437
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,300
Five years.

438
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,380
Within three years, my disciple

439
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100
will become a sword deity.

440
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,620
As confident as always.

441
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,940
Song Yanhui,

442
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,100
you sparred with me thrice

443
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,580
and you failed thrice.

444
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,900
Today

445
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,300
will be your final attempt.

446
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,900
After today,

447
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,660
you will stop hoping

448
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,980
that you can surpass me.

449
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,340
Bring it on.

450
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,940
Third City Lord.

451
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,140
Luoxia.

452
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,380
Have you seen what a sword deity is like
when he is mad?

453
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,500
They say a sword deity is above emotion.

454
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,420
They don't experience happiness, rage,

455
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,100
sadness, or sorrow.

456
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,300
Other than the Wrathful Sword Deity

457
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,060
who made a name with his imposing aura,

458
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,980
other sword deities

459
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,780
don't get angry easily.

460
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,700
They don't

461
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,820
because if they do,

462
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,260
the world will be sundered.

463
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,860
Hanyi is angry now.

464
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,980
Song Yanhui hurt Lei Wujie?

465
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,780
Lei Wujie managed to unsheathe Tingyu Sword

466
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,460
but for the reason Hanyi

467
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,700
fears the most.

468
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,820
Luoxia.

469
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,100
Song Yanhui and you

470
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,020
have a history

471
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,900
in Canglan River, don't you?

472
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,180
Go save him.

473
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,460
Otherwise,

474
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,540
the City Lord

475
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,260
of Wushuang City

476
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,740
will die in Xueyue City.

477
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,980
Any regrets for dying

478
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,980
under my sword?

479
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,660
None

480
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,500
at all.

481
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,500
You're weighed down by your duty.

482
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,700
If you weren't the City Lord of Wushuang City,

483
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,660
you would have reached a greater height.

484
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,180
Please spare him.

485
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,860
Why?

486
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,220
You already failed thrice.

487
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,500
Why do you have to do this again?

488
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,740
Give up already.

489
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,100
You drew your sword

490
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,820
to protect others.

491
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,100
I hate

492
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,500
to see this,

493
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,500
but I see why.

494
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,380
Because your father is Lei

495
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,860
and your mother is Li.

496
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,180
I'll accept this.

497
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:57,940
You...

498
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,100
[Luoxia]
Why are you in Xueyue City?

499
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,180
Stop moving.

500
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
And don't play dumb.

501
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:05,980
You know very well

502
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,740
I'm in Xueyue City.

503
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,980
Whether you're here or not,

504
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
what difference does it make?

505
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,860
Whether you win or not,

506
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,380
what difference does it make?

507
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,900
I have a disciple now.

508
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,060
His vast potential

509
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,540
is second to none.

510
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,140
I'm sure he can restore

511
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,700
Wushuang City to its former glory.

512
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,620
I lost,

513
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,460
but my disciple

514
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,660
won't.

515
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,740
Is restoring Wushuang City's former glory

516
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,700
that important?

517
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,700
Is defeating Xueyue Sword Deity

518
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,940
that important?

519
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,260
What about me?

520
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,940
Am I not important?

521
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:50,780
Yes.

522
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,180
Sorry.

523
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,260
You deserve a beating.

524
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,020
You...

525
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,020
What?

526
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,860
I just want to hit you.

527
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,740
Rascal.

528
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,740
Do you know who I am?

529
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,740
Why should I care?

530
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,060
You bullied my master.

531
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:04,900
I swear

532
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,660
with my name

533
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,940
that you will leave this place bruised.

534
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:10,860
Master.

535
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,780
Once I have him,

536
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,940
I'll castrate him for you.

537
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,820
Come again

538
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,620
and I'll hit you again.

539
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,740
Master, you lost again.

540
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,420
Yeah.

541
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,740
I lost thoroughly.

542
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,860
Li Hanyi and I

543
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,580
are several leagues

544
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,380
apart.

545
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:45,940
From now on,

546
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,500
I won't spar with her in Xueyue City

547
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,860
anymore.

548
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:52,980
It's okay.

549
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,380
I'll win on your behalf.

550
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,380
I met someone this time.

551
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,740
His name is Lei Wujie.

552
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,140
I'm Lei Wujie of the Lei family

553
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,540
from Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect.

554
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,780
Never heard of you.

555
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,260
You will.

556
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,340
It's rare to see

557
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,540
that you actually

558
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,780
remember someone's name.

559
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,380
Because he's unique.

560
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,300
Just like everyone I met

561
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,820
on that day.

562
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,820
I remember their faces.

563
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,380
He is a disciple of Li Hanyi now.

564
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,980
I tested his skills.

565
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,580
He's still

566
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,380
quite inferior to you.

567
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,380
I told Li Hanyi

568
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,060
that you

569
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,300
would become a sword deity within five years.

570
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,060
But she said

571
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,580
Lei Wujie only needs three years.

572
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,140
It seems like she has high expectations

573
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,660
of her disciple.

574
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,620
You can command

575
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,540
ten swords now.

576
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,780
Good.

577
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,260
If Lei Wujie can become a sword deity
within three years,

578
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,020
then I'll do it within a year.

579
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,500
Go forth.

580
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:25,940
Withdraw!

581
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,780
I count on you to bring Wushuang City

582
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,580
back to its prime.

583
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,380
Master.

584
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,620
I don't want to be

585
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,900
the City Lord of Wushuang City.

586
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,780
I just enjoy training with my swords.

587
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,500
But if that's your wish,

588
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,580
I'll do it.

589
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,460
All right.

590
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,140
Come back to Wushuang City with me.

591
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,900
He is Song Yanhui?

592
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,380
I hit the City Lord of Wushuang City?

593
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,420
He is Song Yanhui?

594
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,020
I hit the City Lord of Wushuang City?

595
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,860
My goodness.

596
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,060
Oh no.

597
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,420
Oh no.

598
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,740
What should I do?

599
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,220
Where's your master?

600
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,180
Song Yanhui has left?

601
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,500
Last night, yes.

602
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,020
You still wear that mask

603
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,260
everywhere you go.

604
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,700
It's ugly.

605
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,380
Your beauty

606
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,060
hasn't faded after all these years.

607
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,100
Wearing a mask helps preserve one's beauty now?

608
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,580
That's amusing.

609
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,900
If you care about him,

610
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,460
why don't you return to Wushuang City with him?

611
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,100
I am not his priority.

612
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,620
It doesn't matter if I'm there or not.

613
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,380
Yesterday, I...

614
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,780
How is Lei Wujie?

615
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:30,900
Is he all right?

616
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,580
He is not gravely wounded.

617
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,620
He just needs a few days' rest.

618
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,660
When do you plan

619
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,340
to tell Lei Wujie

620
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
who you are to him?

621
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,140
I don't know how to broach the subject.

622
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,620
When I sent him to the Lei family,

623
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,540
he was just

624
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,540
three years old.

625
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,060
Who knows if he still remembers

626
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,740
that he has an older sister.

627
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,980
Besides, I have been

628
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,020
busy practicing my swordsmanship for years.

629
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,460
I have never visited him once in the Lei family.

630
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,100
I am not

631
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,300
a good sister.

632
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,020
But I'm happy

633
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,220
with the way it is now.

634
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,100
I mean it.

635
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,780
How is the current situation any good?

636
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,060
When I told you

637
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,100
to go to see Zhao Yuzhen,

638
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,580
you said the same thing.

639
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,580
That was different.

640
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,820
The Stillwater Sword I'm learning

641
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,140
requires me to have a still heart.

642
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,740
But he...

643
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,540
How is he feeling?

644
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,540
With the aid of our celestial masters,

645
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,860
he regained consciousness.

646
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,900
But it'll be a while

647
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,620
before he can make a full recovery.

648
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,140
Does that mean

649
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,380
he cannot see

650
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,460
any visitors for the next few days?

651
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,060
Master says

652
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,420
that if someone disturbs him,

653
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:00,700
he might

654
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,860
go rogue again.

655
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,900
[Mount Wangcheng]

656
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:08,860
All right then.

657
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,460
Please ask Master Lyu

658
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,740
to tell him

659
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,020
that I was here.

660
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,740
I guess it's good

661
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,780
for both of us.

662
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,180
You're just

663
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,260
like Song Yanhui.

664
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,100
I would hit you

665
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,460
if you weren't stronger than me.

666
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,300
Just unbelievable.

667
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,940
I can finally wield

668
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,700
Tingyu Sword now.

669
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,100
However...

670
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,060
No.

671
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,940
You don't unsheathe it with your strength.

672
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,620
Something feels off.

673
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,780
It's like something is missing.

674
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:13,980
Xiao Se!

675
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:14,900
Lian!

676
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,380
How do you know we will be here?

677
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,300
It seems like you have mastered

678
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,140
the First Level of Stillwater Sword.

679
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,780
Unlike someone I know

680
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,260
whose fleeing skill

681
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,580
just keeps improving.

682
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,900
Lian.

683
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,090
Will you

684
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,500
fight me?

685
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,460
Sure.

686
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,340
This sword

687
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,300
was given to me by Xueyue Sword Deity.

688
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,420
Beautiful Day!

689
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,060
That's your Beautiful Day?

690
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,740
Do you have Second Master's approval?

691
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,180
Lian.

692
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,380
Please don't tell my master.

693
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,180
I've been practicing with her

694
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,340
and if I ever make a mistake,

695
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,300
she hits me on my head.

696
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,500
(Wrong.)

697
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,260
Jie.

698
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,820
How many times have I told you?

699
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,580
When you thrust, the sword has to be horizontal.

700
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,580
That wasn't Sancai Sword Technique at all.

701
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:51,860
Jie.

702
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,180
Stop crying.

703
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,860
I'll buy you tanghulu,
(*sugar-coated hawthorn)

704
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,540
all right?

705
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,100
Lei Wujie?

706
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,900
Lei Wujie?

707
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,700
Snap back, dummy.

708
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,060
Sorry.

709
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,900
It's just

710
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,580
that when Master hits me,

711
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,940
it feels quite familiar.

712
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,900
You're indeed a dummy.

713
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,340
It hurt a lot when you were hit.

714
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,780
But now, you reminisce about the moment

715
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,700
when you were hit.

716
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,180
Oh, right.

717
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,580
Where is the Second Master?

718
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,340
She trains with her sword

719
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,100
in the mountain every day.

720
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,260
In the morning,

721
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,620
she'll supervise my training.

722
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,420
But after that, she's gone.

723
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,940
When it's time to eat,

724
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,660
she appears again. On time too.

725
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,780
Do I hear a complaint?

726
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,780
Of course not.

727
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,420
I'm just thinking

728
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,260
that if one day I quit martial arts,

729
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,460
I will leave the mountain and be a chef.

730
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:45,900
Anyway,

731
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,380
why are you two looking for me?

732
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,420
For

733
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,700
two things.

734
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,420
What is it?

735
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,660
One,

736
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,820
your martial uncle, Lei Yunhe,

737
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
visited Mount Wangcheng again.

738
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,340
He made a path with one strike again.

739
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,620
The second strike overturned the Qiankun Hall.

740
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,540
And the third strike

741
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,260
seized Zhao Yuzhen's Qingxiao Sword.

742
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,540
I heard they fought overnight

743
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,220
(and the entire Mount Wangcheng)

744
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,220
(was enveloped)

745
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,140
(by storm and thunder.)

746
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,260
(Other than the Six Saints)

747
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,500
(who stayed to spectate,)

748
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,740
others

749
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,380
left the mountain to avoid the crossfire.

750
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,380
And then, your martial uncle
rode his crane and left.

751
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,900
(Zhao Yuzhen also admitted)

752
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,860
(that this time,)

753
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,380
(Lei Yunhe did not lose.)

754
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,660
That's great.

755
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,900
What's the second thing then?

756
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,100
The second thing

757
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,380
is about a person.

758
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,540
Who?

759
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,020
Ye Ruoyi.

760
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,610
Who?

761
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,420
I don't know her.

762
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,220
No.

763
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,220
You know her.

764
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,260
Not only do you know her,

765
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,740
but she also offered your her handkerchief

766
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,020
(to wipe your nosebleed.)

767
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,660
Why did you bring her up?

768
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,980
I didn't ask about her.

769
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:49,780
Okay.

770
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:50,900
Bye.

771
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,060
Continue, please.

772
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:53,900
Continue, please.

773
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,780
Continue, please.

774
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,020
Continue, please.

775
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,660
Ye Ruoyi came to Xueyue City in the same year

776
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,660
as me.

777
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,700
She is the daughter of Ye Xiaoying,

778
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,780
the Defender-General.

779
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,740
Daughter of a general?

780
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,540
Why is she in Xueyue City?

781
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,740
To recuperate.

782
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,780
No one knows what sickness she has.

783
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,620
The Third Master is a masterful healer,

784
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,020
but her condition hasn't improved

785
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,460
after many years.

786
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,740
The experts from the Directorate of Astronomy

787
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,780
have offered their service too,

788
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,940
but to no avail.

789
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,620
It must be

790
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,220
something complicated.

791
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,140
Don't dwell on it.

792
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,500
Tell me.

793
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,780
Do you want to befriend her?

794
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,580
Befriend?

795
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,220
The annual Flora Spectacle of Xueyue City

796
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,460
will take place in three days.

797
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,740
All disciples

798
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,500
will attend it.

799
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,580
Including

800
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,460
the reclusive Ye Ruoyi.

801
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,260
Do you want to be there?

802
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,020
Flora Spectacle...

803
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,900
Will my master be there?

804
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,300
Do not

805
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,300
tell her about it.

806
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,580
Third Master said

807
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,780
anyone can come.

808
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,100
But not Li Hanyi.

809
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,180
Why?

810
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,020
Perhaps because

811
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,860
once she swings her sword...

812
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,020
Go!

813
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,380
All flowers from the Flora Spectacle

814
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,580
will be destroyed.

815
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,340
What do we do

816
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,180
during the spectacle?

817
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,140
Do we fight?

818
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,140
The Flora Spectacle is not about violence

819
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,220
but elegance.

820
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,980
Most participants

821
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,340
are from the younger generation.

822
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,500
They recite poems and drink.

823
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,060
It's one of our annual

824
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,820
grand events.

825
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,060
I can drink.

826
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,300
But reciting poems?

827
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,380
I can't do that.

828
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,380
Besides, we are martial artists.

829
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,060
Reciting poems

830
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,820
feels too...

831
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,140
pretentious to me.

832
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,020
Why?

833
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,500
In Yushi when Wuxin

834
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,780
taught you the fist technique,

835
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,740
he recited a poem too.

836
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,500
Was he being pretentious then?

837
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,380
Right.

838
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,940
Wuxin is a spectacular individual.

839
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,020
I wonder how he is doing now.

840
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,820
He is no easy foe.

841
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,500
He mastered the Six Higher Knowledge Arts

842
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,780
right away

843
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,140
and fought Wushuang from Wushuang City.

844
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,380
It's been a while now,

845
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,020
so he must have improved a lot.

846
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,300
Sir.

847
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,500
Duan Chenyi's cronies

848
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,260
and family have been captured.

849
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,580
How do we proceed now?

850
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,900
Expel them from Tianwaitian.

851
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,340
Noted.

852
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,380
When I traveled

853
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,740
with your father in Beili,

854
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,500
I came across this poem.

855
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,100
It reads,

856
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,100
the autumn is upon us,

857
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,980
but the moon from my hometown
will always shine the brightest.

858
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,700
The moon from my hometown
will always shine the brightest.

859
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,100
That's a fine poem.

860
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,820
Sir, what is a hometown

861
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,620
to you?

862
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,660
Tianwaitian

863
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,340
or Hanshui Temple?

864
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,180
Yuji.

865
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,380
Uncle Yuji,

866
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,420
do you know where my father

867
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,580
came from before he joined

868
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,420
Tianwaitian?

869
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,500
The Head was the son of a general
from the previous dynasty.

870
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,820
He was born in Tianqi City.

871
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,300
He was born there,

872
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,980
but what he regarded as his hometown

873
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,140
was Gusu.

874
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:15,940
He spent

875
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,900
a few blissful years

876
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,940
with my mother there.

877
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,980
They gave birth

878
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,180
to me too.

879
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,180
So my hometown

880
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,420
should be Gusu.

881
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,340
I have gone there before.

882
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,610
There is a lake.

883
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,460
And next to the lake is a weeping willow.

884
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,980
I was told that my mother

885
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,660
used to comb her hair

886
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,780
with the lake as her mirror.

887
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,140
But one morning,

888
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,180
people found

889
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,380
her comb there,

890
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,620
but not her person.

891
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,220
And then,

892
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,940
Father brought me here.

893
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,380
If I'm not mistaken,

894
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,100
Father died in Gusu.

895
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,020
Where your hometown is doesn't matter.

896
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,300
Your hometown is where the people

897
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,060
you hold dear reside.

898
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,020
All right.

899
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,210
We have eliminated all threats of Tianwaitian.

900
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,940
With you two here,

901
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,100
there will be

902
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,820
no problem for the foreseeable future.

903
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:21,780
Sir,

904
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,260
are you...

905
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,260
I want to train in solitude.

906
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,660
Until when, sir?

907
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,610
When I attain the Unbeatable Phase of Arcana.
