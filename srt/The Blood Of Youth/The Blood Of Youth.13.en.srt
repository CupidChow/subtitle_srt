[The Blood of Youth]

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,970
[Episode 13]

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,590
Your Highness, please have some tea.

26
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,790
Have a seat.

27
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,030
It's been a long time since I last saw you.

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,240
I didn't expect

29
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,910
to let you see this mess

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,590
when I met you again.

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,190
It's okay.

32
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,430
No matter how terrible the situation is,

33
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,590
I can't see it.

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,710
Sorry, I misspoke.

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,030
I was just

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,520
kidding with you.

37
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,120
The jokes you make

38
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,280
are never funny.

39
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,710
I remember

40
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,750
whenever I saw you as a kid,

41
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,630
you would always tell me

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,000
not to be too hard on myself.

43
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,470
You advised me to be happy,

44
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,840
to smile more.

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,680
I remember it

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,710
all these years,

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,960
but when I see you again,

48
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,960
you still think

49
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,030
I'm not humorous.

50
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,190
That's not true.

51
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,280
You're more humorous

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,800
than before.

53
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,470
Fine.

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,910
Compared to the other princes,

55
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,840
because of my eyes,

56
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,960
I am indeed somewhat more pathetic.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,030
Thank you

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,870
for your help today.

59
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,680
Even if I didn't take action,

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,000
you'd be able to take care of it

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
easily,

62
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,240
but just

63
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,560
a little slower.

64
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,310
I have an urgent matter today,

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,280
so I overstepped my authority.

66
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,750
But I wonder

67
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
what urgent matter

68
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,120
you are talking about.

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,750
I have a decree to pass on.

70
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,030
Don't worry.

71
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,360
This decree

72
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,630
is not meant for the Vermilion Bird.

73
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,430
I haven't been the Vermilion Bird

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,870
for years.

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,030
I'm just

76
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,240
a steward

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,430
of Xueyue City.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
Then, I'll call you

79
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
City Lord Sikong.

80
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,150
It sounds much better

81
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,240
this way.

82
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,870
This decree

83
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,310
is meant for that person.

84
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,750
In fact, before today,

85
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,160
I wasn't sure

86
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,870
if he was really here

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,680
until just now.

88
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,560
Although I couldn't see it,

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,750
his habit

90
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,510
of surprising

91
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
and scaring people

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,830
has not changed over the years.

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,510
This matter

94
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,870
is between you two.

95
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,480
This has nothing to do with Xueyue City.

96
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,950
I heard

97
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,720
he apprenticed to you.

98
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,680
I wanted to take him as my disciple.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,070
He neither agreed

100
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,510
nor refused.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,830
I get it now.

102
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,560
City Lord Sikong

103
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,430
is trying to make sure Xueyue City

104
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,950
stays out of

105
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,630
this matter.

106
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,160
There are very few people

107
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,480
in this world who dare refuse to accept

108
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,870
His Majesty's decrees,

109
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,950
and even fewer who accept them

110
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,510
and then disobey them.

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,630
But he happens to be one of them.

112
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,040
So what's wrong with me

113
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,950
wanting nothing to do

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,680
with this matter?

115
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,870
I see.

116
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,310
It's all your fault.

117
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,240
Why didn't you

118
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,430
fight longer?

119
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,750
You were in such a hurry to get down there

120
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,430
because you were afraid
that Qianluo would surrender

121
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,720
and you'd have to marry her, right?

122
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:44,720
Lei Wujie,

123
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,240
if you keep talking nonsense,

124
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,390
I'll rip your mouth off.

125
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,560
Who would want to surrender first?

126
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,800
Who would want to marry this guy?

127
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,190
Qianluo,

128
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,830
this time,

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,830
Xiao Se was of great help.

130
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,240
If it weren't for him,

131
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,870
things would have become
much more complicated today.

132
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,830
And for Luo Mingxuan,

133
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,190
you should go and visit him

134
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,190
when he's recovered.

135
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,120
He could have beaten Duan Xuanheng

136
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,190
for you

137
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,800
if he wasn't poisoned.

138
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,190
Xiao Se,

139
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,070
thanks.

140
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:12,720
You're welcome.

141
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,040
I will pay

142
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,430
what I owe.

143
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,560
If you

144
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,630
ever need me to fight for you,

145
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,390
I will not hesitate

146
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,950
to return the favor.

147
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,430
It's fine.

148
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,560
Aren't you

149
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
usually quite helpful?

150
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,680
Why are you

151
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,480
pulling a long face all day?

152
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,920
Who's helpful?

153
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,830
You.

154
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,680
Listen,

155
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,510
I didn't even ask him to go up today,

156
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,480
and he

157
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,720
rushed up.

158
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,040
Really?

159
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,240
Of course.

160
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,630
I did it

161
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,750
because that Duan fellow

162
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,750
was so annoying

163
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,830
and I just couldn't stand him.

164
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,190
That's fine.

165
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,040
Anyway,

166
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,830
I approve

167
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,950
of you today.

168
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,000
Do I need your approval?

169
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,600
But...

170
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,120
Enough.

171
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,270
Leave it at that.

172
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,160
The tournament

173
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,160
is finally over.

174
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,600
Lord Bai can also prove

175
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,870
the fairness of the tournament on the spot.

176
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,310
I don't think

177
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,630
they would dare
to say anything else in the future.

178
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
Yes, Lian.

179
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,830
That prince is so dashing.

180
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,480
Hundreds of people at the scene

181
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,920
fell to their knees at once.

182
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,430
But

183
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,750
why did the City Lord only do the half-kneeling?

184
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,000
Third Master was once the Vermilion Bird,

185
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,560
one of the Four Guardians of Tianqi City.

186
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,920
He could make a half salute
in front of the Emperor,

187
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,720
so naturally a prince

188
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,040
is not qualified to have him

189
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,680
make a full salute.

190
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,180
It turns out that the City Lord
was once the Vermilion Bird.

191
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,950
Wouldn't that make Qianluo

192
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,240
the heiress to the Vermilion Bird Token?

193
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,310
Father told me about it.

194
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
But I'm not interested.

195
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't know that person,

196
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,000
so why should I be a guardian?

197
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:44,870
Right,

198
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,120
my father can do the half-kneeling,

199
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,830
but why didn't you kneel, Xiao Se?

200
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,720
Yeah.

201
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,360
I...

202
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,600
have weak legs.

203
00:07:59,560 --> 00:07:59,920
What...

204
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,430
Lian,

205
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,600
look, he's making things up again.

206
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,390
I have some ancestral glory

207
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,270
that allows me to not kneel before the Emperor.

208
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Do you think this answer is okay?

209
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,120
Really?

210
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,680
You're so stingy,

211
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,430
but you actually come
from a distinguished family?

212
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,040
Right, Lian,

213
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,070
why did

214
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,950
a prince from Tianqi City

215
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,560
come to Xueyue City?

216
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,240
He should have

217
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,870
something important

218
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,160
to discuss with Third Master.

219
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,560
After all, Third Master

220
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,120
was once the Vermilion Bird.

221
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,000
Third Master was credited

222
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,840
with the ascension of His Majesty to the throne.

223
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,600
But the sudden arrival
of the Prince of Tianqi City

224
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,790
in Xueyue City

225
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,720
gives me a feeling of unease.

226
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,240
My father has long said

227
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,600
that he hates the people

228
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
in that city.

229
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,480
But I think

230
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,390
Lord Bai is a good man.

231
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,000
However,

232
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,630
there is something wrong with his eyes.

233
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,440
Because he can't see anything.

234
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,390
Can't see anything?

235
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,390
He took a piece of cake

236
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,150
from someone's plate

237
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,030
when he was little,

238
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,320
and he went blind after eating it.

239
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,080
All these years, Emperor Mingde

240
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,150
had searched all over the world
for competent physicians,

241
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,390
but he just couldn't be cured.

242
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,910
What a poor man.

243
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:16,720
Xiao Se.

244
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,000
Elder Yin.

245
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,390
Lord Bai is waiting for you in the backyard.

246
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,270
You go there first.

247
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,440
Elder Yin.

248
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,480
Well,

249
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,200
what does Lord Bai want with Xiao Se?

250
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,510
They should have studied together

251
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,200
at Tianqi Academy.

252
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,000
So they were classmates.

253
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,000
Classmates.

254
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,620
[Stay Simple, Stay True]

255
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
I am blind.

256
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,320
I can't see you,

257
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,960
but you can see me.

258
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,840
What's wrong?

259
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,870
Since you've seen me,

260
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,750
aren't you going to greet me?

261
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
Greetings, Your Highness, Lord Bai.

262
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,080
Is that the way you address me?

263
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,120
I am just a commoner.

264
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,200
What else can I address you

265
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,670
when I meet the Second Prince,

266
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,080
Lord Bai?

267
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,030
After all, addressing you incorrectly
will get me killed.

268
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,750
Do you know

269
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,200
that not kneeling before me
in the morning just now

270
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,390
is punishable by death?

271
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,240
My head is right here.

272
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,510
Take it if you like.

273
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,480
You don't speak as harshly

274
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,150
as you used to.

275
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,720
You sound a little bit weak.

276
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,840
But you're still

277
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,000
as cheeky as ever.

278
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,870
You might as well call me Chong.

279
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,240
I haven't heard that for years.

280
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,910
I'm Xiao Se.

281
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,320
I am just

282
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,430
the owner of an ordinary inn.

283
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,910
I have no right

284
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,750
to address Lord Bai as Chong.

285
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,270
All right.

286
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,480
Xiao Se of Snowfall Villa.

287
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,480
Yes, Your Highness.

288
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,670
Accept the decree.

289
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,390
Accept the decree?

290
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,480
Accept the decree.

291
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,000
By order of His Majesty,

292
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,150
the Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe,

293
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,840
is forgiven for all past sins

294
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,240
and restored to the status of a prince,

295
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,270
and the prince will be given
the title of Lord Yong'an,

296
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,240
with a reward of ten thousand taels of gold

297
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,550
and a hundred boxes of jewels.

298
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,630
You are

299
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,840
to return to Tianqi City at once.

300
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,630
Aren't you going to thank the Emperor?

301
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,550
I reject this decree.

302
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,670
How dare you reject it?

303
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,870
I reject it.

304
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,840
Why?

305
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,750
The Sixth Prince

306
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,720
is forgiven for all past sins.

307
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,790
What did I do wrong

308
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,790
in the past?

309
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,720
I can't see,

310
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,750
but I can guess

311
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,960
your look at this moment.

312
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,600
Now that you have guessed it,

313
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,360
please take this decree

314
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,030
back with you, Your Highness.

315
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,550
You still won't

316
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,480
call me Chong

317
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,550
even after hearing the decree.

318
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,150
It seems

319
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,240
you really don't want to go back.

320
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,720
Do you want me

321
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,360
to go back?

322
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,670
(When I left the city,)

323
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,750
(a man came with a sword.)

324
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,670
He's the Wrathful Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian,

325
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,240
one of the Five Sword Deities.

326
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
As far as I know,

327
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,840
he's also your teacher.

328
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,960
Believe it or not,

329
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,510
I didn't send him there.

330
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,240
You didn't send him there?

331
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,870
Did you know before he left?

332
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,080
Did you know

333
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,510
and pretend not to?

334
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,790
So you think

335
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,510
your injury

336
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,510
was caused by Master Zhantian?

337
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,480
Even if he hadn't made

338
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,320
the last move,

339
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,600
many things wouldn't have changed

340
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,790
if he hadn't been there.

341
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:58,870
Fine.

342
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,390
It is better

343
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,200
to talk about these back in Tianqi City.

344
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,550
I give you three days

345
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,840
to think about

346
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,200
whether you want to accept this decree

347
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,150
and come home with me.

348
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,320
Your Highness,

349
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,510
I heard it all outside.

350
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,510
Xiao Chuhe is so outrageous.

351
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
We should report it to His Majesty

352
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
and ask him to withdraw his order

353
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
and then punish him severely.

354
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,240
Zang Ming.

355
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,510
You can only say this

356
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,550
to me.

357
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,270
Why?

358
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,870
Remember this.

359
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,790
I hold

360
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,630
no grudge against him.

361
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,390
But the cake was his...

362
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,600
Back then,

363
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
we were only kids.

364
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,080
Xueyue City

365
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,030
has been really lively lately.

366
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,510
Yes.

367
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,270
First, someone made it to the top
of Dengtian Tower

368
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,120
and challenged Xueyue Sword Deity.

369
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,270
Then, there's Flora Spectacle.

370
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,080
Scholarly Sword Deity showed up in person
and gave away gifts.

371
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,960
In addition, the tournament of marriage

372
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,480
has attracted

373
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,320
the noble Lord Bai here.

374
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,630
But you know

375
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,910
that I am a person who doesn't like hilarity.

376
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,020
That's great.

377
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,480
Just kick Lord Bai

378
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,790
out of here right away on my behalf.

379
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,320
What's so difficult about it?

380
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,960
Back then, I could force his father

381
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,270
to make a deal with me just with my sword.

382
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,910
He's just a prince.

383
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,630
I'll be right back.

384
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,240
I was just kidding with you.

385
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,360
Don't take it seriously.

386
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,440
Why do you always have to involve

387
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,510
everyone in Xueyue City

388
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,870
in danger?

389
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,240
Lord Bai

390
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,840
just wants to

391
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
take one person away.

392
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,750
Words really travel fast.

393
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,550
Since the Emperor wants him to return,

394
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,670
his sins should have been forgiven.

395
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,270
This is a good thing.

396
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,790
In fact, Xiao Se does not want his sins

397
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,910
to be pardoned,

398
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,440
but Lord Langya's.

399
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,390
This is impossible.

400
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,030
The case of Lord Langya

401
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,360
was already a closed case back then.

402
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,020
Emperor Mingde

403
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,700
won't be willing to make any compromises.

404
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,380
Yes.

405
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,340
It's a...

406
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,620
dead end.

407
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:31,820
Miss Ye.

408
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,580
Miss Ye.

409
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,260
City Lord Sikong.

410
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,340
Second City Lord.

411
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,660
Miss Ye,

412
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,580
why are you so free

413
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,740
to come to my place today?

414
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,420
I am on my way to the medical hall
to pick up some herbs

415
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,260
and stopped by to see you.

416
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,220
It would be great

417
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,820
if my daughter was as sensible

418
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,740
as you are.

419
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,140
How are you, Miss Ye?

420
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,700
How's your recovery going?

421
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,580
I'm much better than when I arrived.

422
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,340
I guess I'm still a bit short

423
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,180
on medical skills.

424
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,580
Right,

425
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,260
I've heard that Old Master Tang

426
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,020
has a method

427
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,620
that may cure your illness.

428
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,540
How about this?

429
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,900
Ask Tang Lian

430
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,460
to take you to Tang Clan sometime.

431
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,500
I'm sorry to trouble you.

432
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:16,540
You may go now.

433
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,260
She'd been eavesdropping

434
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,940
for quite some time.

435
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,340
It's not something important anyway.

436
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,580
Let her be.

437
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,500
She is the daughter

438
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,420
of General Ye Xiaoying.

439
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,980
The more Ye Xiaoying knows,

440
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,900
the more complicated things become.

441
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:36,980
She used to be

442
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,180
a good friend to Xiao Se.

443
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,260
But I don't think the two of them have ever talked

444
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,100
to each other

445
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,100
since Xiao Se entered Xueyue City.

446
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,820
So,

447
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,220
she is the one who knows Xiao Se best.

448
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,980
What Xiao Se

449
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,340
is most reluctant

450
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,580
to talk about now is his past,

451
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,220
but Ye Ruoyi

452
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,140
is carrying

453
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,460
the past of Xiao Se.

454
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,780
The fragrance of the sunken light and valley.

455
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,900
Are you Miss Ruoyi?

456
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,820
It's been a long time since we last met,

457
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,500
Your Highness.

458
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,140
If I hadn't smelled

459
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,410
the unique sunken light

460
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,700
and valley fragrance of the Ye family,

461
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,300
would you

462
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,540
have intended

463
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,700
to just walk past?

464
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,260
I haven't seen you

465
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,300
in years.

466
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,260
I thought you looked familiar

467
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,380
but didn't dare to confirm it.

468
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,460
I hear

469
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,380
you've been recuperating in here.

470
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,220
Are you feeling better?

471
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,260
City Lord Sikong is very skilled in medicine,

472
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,500
my health

473
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,620
is much better than before.

474
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:54,980
That's good.

475
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,060
You and Chuhe have been friends
since childhood.

476
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,500
It must be a pleasure for you

477
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,540
to meet again in this city.

478
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,380
Hasn't Chuhe

479
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,340
been missing for a long time?

480
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,180
You haven't seen him?

481
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,700
I've always

482
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,820
lived alone in this house,

483
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,050
and I don't usually associate
with the people of the city.

484
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,980
I'm here to pick up some herbs today.

485
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,340
He has been in this city for quite some time.

486
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,580
I'm here

487
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,300
to find him.

488
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,260
You came

489
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,380
to catch him back?

490
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,020
Catch?

491
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,780
I'm taking him back to Tianqi.

492
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,500
Father has absolved him

493
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,820
of all his sins.

494
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,580
He will

495
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,620
still be the Sixth Prince of Beili,

496
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,060
Lord Yong'an, Xiao Chuhe.

497
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,420
Well,

498
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,420
that's great.

499
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,140
But he refused.

500
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,260
I've given him three days.

501
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,580
You've been friends with him since childhood.

502
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,420
Help me talk some sense into him.

503
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,620
With Chuhe's temperament,

504
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,340
it's hard for him

505
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,660
to change his mind.

506
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,820
But you are one

507
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,100
of the few people I know

508
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,460
who can persuade him.

509
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,220
I'll try then.

510
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,660
Thank you.

511
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,740
[Xiaoqing Pavilion]

512
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,180
You already know

513
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,940
that I sent someone to look for Chuhe?

514
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,900
Your Majesty, you deliberately

515
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,340
[Ye Xiaoying, General]
let me know about this, right?

516
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:03,780
Yes.

517
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,020
Chuhe was close to you.

518
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,940
I was thinking

519
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,620
that if you knew

520
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
the whereabouts of Chuhe,

521
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,100
you might be able

522
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,260
to help me.

523
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,700
After so many years,

524
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,380
now that he's willing to show himself,

525
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,500
maybe

526
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,580
he's willing to return to Tianqi.

527
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,900
Do you really think so?

528
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,540
If I were you,

529
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,420
I would not issue any decree.

530
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,580
I would just lead the army

531
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,140
and surround Xueyue City.

532
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,580
This is indeed

533
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,820
your style.

534
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,500
But I'm afraid

535
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,140
I'm pushing him too hard.

536
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,580
With that child's temperament,

537
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,180
he's going to fight against me again.

538
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,820
I can't help

539
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,140
but think about the past years,

540
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,340
and my guilt towards Chuhe

541
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,660
is growing.

542
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,620
And this child

543
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,700
is very stubborn.

544
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,780
When I didn't look for him,

545
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,340
he stayed untrackable

546
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,540
for four years.

547
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,100
I am afraid

548
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,420
of missing this opportunity.

549
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,900
I'm afraid I won't be able

550
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,460
to hide the fact that I want to bring Chuhe

551
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,940
back to the palace for long.

552
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,220
I need you

553
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,900
to take care of this for me.

554
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,060
Sure.

555
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,300
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

556
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,020
You may leave now.

557
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,620
[Hongqing Hall]

558
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,860
What brings you here?

559
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,820
His Majesty sent Lord Bai

560
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,620
to summon Xiao Chuhe back to Tianqi.

561
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,580
I already expected that.

562
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,580
[Jinyu, Director of Record]
Is that person really coming back?

563
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,500
Not really.

564
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,980
What is your choice?

565
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
My choice is the one

566
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,780
whose name is written

567
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,380
in the Dragon Seal Scroll

568
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,060
on the tablet of Tai'an Hall.

569
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,060
But there is nothing written

570
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,620
[Jinwei, Director of Sword]
on that scroll.

571
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,500
We can

572
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,260
ultimately influence

573
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,700
the name written

574
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,220
[Jinyan, Director of Seal]
on the scroll.

575
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,180
Let me remind you.

576
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,900
The Five Eunuchs are acting on orders,

577
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,900
so don't speak treacherously.

578
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,700
I only said influence,

579
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,420
not designation.

580
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,300
Jade Deity,
(*pronounce as Jinxian)

581
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,370
you're too sensitive, aren't you?

582
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,860
Jinyan is right.

583
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,580
In the past,

584
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,660
we could have waited for His Majesty
to make a decision.

585
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,020
But the Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe,

586
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,900
has shown up.

587
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,060
Everything has changed.

588
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,860
I know

589
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,090
that some of you

590
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,900
are teachers of Lord Bai,

591
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,300
and some of you

592
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,660
are loyal followers of Lord Chi.

593
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,060
Xiao Chuhe's presence

594
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,860
is the greatest threat

595
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,180
to you.

596
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,300
You

597
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,500
shouldn't have told

598
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,620
His Majesty the news

599
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,220
without discussing it with us,

600
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,460
and you shouldn't have reported it

601
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,700
without knowing

602
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,980
whether the man

603
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,980
is really Xiao Chuhe.

604
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:58,860
That's right.

605
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:00,980
Tell us

606
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,940
what happened in the Kingdom of Yushi.

607
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,300
What are the chances of that person

608
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,740
being Xiao Chuhe?

609
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,140
You are not qualified for this.

610
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,860
You are not permitted

611
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,380
to discuss

612
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,660
the affairs of the princes.

613
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,340
Sir.

614
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,260
Dozens of groups of people

615
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,900
have left

616
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,580
Tianqi City in the past year.

617
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,580
Where have they all gone?

618
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,420
They have gone to Xueyue City,

619
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,500
Wushuang City,

620
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,540
Muliang City,

621
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,940
the Lei family of Jiangnan,

622
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,140
the Tang Clan of Shu,

623
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,940
the Wen family of Lingnan,

624
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,780
Mount Wangcheng, Mount Wudang,

625
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,500
Shaolin Temple, Yunlin Temple,

626
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,940
as well as

627
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,660
the unreachable Tianwaitian,

628
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,060
and Dark River that is nowhere to be found.

629
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,220
Yes.

630
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,620
Both Lord Bai and Lord Chi

631
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,860
have sent men

632
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,380
to almost all the great martial arts sects.

633
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,020
Now that the disputes in the court

634
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,860
have not yet ended,

635
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
the rivalry in the martial arts world

636
00:25:59,180 --> 00:25:59,900
has already begun.

637
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,380
That's right.

638
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,860
You're right.

639
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,460
Jinyan,

640
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,820
did you just say you wanted to

641
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,620
influence the name on the scroll?

642
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,460
My dear sir.

643
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:19,940
Sir.

644
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,860
Sir.

645
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,900
I have made a slip of the tongue.

646
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,140
Good for you to know that.

647
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,860
I know

648
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,180
you each have

649
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,300
your own thoughts.

650
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,100
But the Five Eunuchs

651
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,660
shall be subject to His Majesty's will.

652
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,860
His Majesty's thoughts are unpredictable,

653
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,460
and we're like keeping a tiger company.

654
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,260
If you are satisfied, you won't be humiliated.
If you know moderation, you won't be in danger.

655
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,060
In this way, you can live a long life.

656
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,860
If anyone can't understand

657
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
this,

658
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,780
you should quit being the Five Eunuchs
before it's too late.

659
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,980
Yes, sir.

660
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,580
Although you have never made a choice,

661
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,620
I know

662
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,380
you have always liked

663
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,420
the Sixth Prince, Xiao Chuhe.

664
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,740
Why must we make a choice?

665
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,580
These princes

666
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,060
were all good friends

667
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,020
when they were little,

668
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,060
and it is only because of our own interests

669
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,100
that they have become

670
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
what they are today.

671
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,060
[Young Xiao Chuhe]

672
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,820
[Young Xiao Chong]

673
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,940
My book.

674
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,420
Chong, I will get it.

675
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,020
Chuhe,

676
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,340
be careful.

677
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:00,980
Chong,

678
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,620
you should stop reading.

679
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:03,980
Look,

680
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,300
the book is all wet.

681
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,980
Just play with me for a while.

682
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,300
Chuhe,

683
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,300
you've been scolded by the school teacher

684
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,500
every day,

685
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,500
but you want me to be scolded too?

686
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,580
Chong,

687
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,210
actually,

688
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,220
I can recite the content

689
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,420
of this book already.

690
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,900
I just want to piss off that old man.

691
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:24,740
Don't eat it.

692
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,020
Look, your hands are so dirty.

693
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,060
Go back and wash it before eating it.

694
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,060
All right.

695
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,420
Don't eat it!

696
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,380
Don't eat it.

697
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,660
What should not be eaten?

698
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,420
Why are you here?

699
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,780
I brought some snacks for you.

700
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,540
Here.

701
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,100
Someone who is unaccountably solicitous
is hiding evil intentions.

702
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,100
You have a favor to ask of me.

703
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:01,780
Say it.

704
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,660
Nothing, I just want to ask you something.

705
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,540
What does the Prince want from you?

706
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:07,980
Elder Yin said

707
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,140
you were classmates.

708
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,340
We just caught up on old times.

709
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,300
Nothing serious.

710
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,620
All right.

711
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,460
It's okay if you have secrets

712
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:14,940
to hide from us.

713
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,900
If you don't want to talk about it, I won't ask.

714
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:18,740
Well,

715
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,020
the tournament of marriage

716
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,100
is finally over for good.

717
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
A big problem is settled.

718
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,140
Why don't we

719
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,820
go for a stroll in the city to take a breather?

720
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:27,780
Get to the point.

721
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,100
I haven't seen Miss Ye for a long time.

722
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,660
I'd like you to come with me to visit her.

723
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,780
Coward.

724
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,260
Go and see her yourself.

725
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,820
I'm too shy to do that.

726
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,780
She is a good friend of Sikong Qianluo.

727
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,820
You should find Sikong Qianluo for help.

728
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,140
I went to find Qianluo,

729
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,900
but she was not around.

730
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:47,860
I get it now.

731
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,900
You came to me

732
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,100
when you were desperate, didn't you?

733
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:51,660
No.

734
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:52,980
Xiao Se,

735
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,340
why don't you accompany me there?

736
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,540
Where's your sassiness

737
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,180
from yesterday?

738
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,660
We'll talk

739
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,460
after you've finished these.

740
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:10,700
Xiao Se.

741
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,060
The best taste of this Hongshan Zhuyan

742
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,820
will be lost

743
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,700
if it is cooked

744
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,580
a moment longer.

745
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,140
Greetings, Your Highness.

746
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,300
Zang Ming and I are taking a walk in the city

747
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,460
and we suddenly smelled this tea scent.

748
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:45,860
I was wondering

749
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,700
who in this Xueyue City

750
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,100
would like

751
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,780
to drink the tea of Tianqi City.

752
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,780
I didn't expect

753
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,060
it would be you again.

754
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,060
I hadn't been home for a long time,

755
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,940
so I wanted to have a taste of home.

756
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,340
Your Highness, I'm sorry to have distracted you.

757
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,140
Aren't you going to invite me for some tea?

758
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,460
Your Highness, please have a seat.

759
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,900
Xiao Se.

760
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,300
Have you thought of a reason

761
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,340
for dragging me to see Miss Ye

762
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,580
in such a hurry?

763
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,940
What reason do I need?

764
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,060
We're just passing by

765
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,420
and we're thirsty,

766
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,940
so we want a drink.

767
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,140
If you just want a drink,

768
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,660
then you're in luck.

769
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,220
What do you mean?

770
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,820
The finest Hongshan Zhuyan

771
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
brewed with melted snow

772
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,420
from Mount Cang,

773
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:39,980
the taste...

774
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,380
I don't understand.

775
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:43,780
Right,

776
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,420
it's like cast pearls before swine.

777
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,420
Great tea indeed.

778
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,020
Right, Miss Ruoyi,

779
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,820
did you see Chuhe yesterday?

780
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,500
I did.

781
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,820
But he seemed

782
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,020
a bit different than before.

783
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,180
How so?

784
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,660
He used to speak

785
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,780
in a loud voice,

786
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,220
beaming with joy,

787
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,820
as if he had

788
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:16,740
absolute confidence

789
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,180
in everything in this world.

790
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,180
But now,

791
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,180
he has become much quieter and slacker.

792
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,020
Yes.

793
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,540
Chuhe has changed a lot.

794
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,860
Did he tell you

795
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,580
where he'd been

796
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,420
all these years?

797
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,900
He said he opened an inn

798
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,220
in a place with green hills at the back

799
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,820
and clear water at the front.

800
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,980
Miss Ruoyi,

801
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,300
Xiao Se and I are passing by

802
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,540
and have come to ask you

803
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,700
for a cup of tea.

804
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,820
Miss... Miss Ruoyi,

805
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,900
I'm sorry to bother you.

806
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,100
Well,

807
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,420
spare the formalities.

808
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,220
Sit down.

809
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,140
May I

810
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,340
know your name?

811
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,180
I am from

812
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,940
Jiangnan Thunderbolt Sect,

813
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,460
and I have just been accepted
as a disciple of Xueyue Sword Deity.

814
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,420
So you're from the Lei Clan.

815
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,700
Why don't you just tell him

816
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,700
your date of birth?

817
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,740
You're here too?

818
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,100
I'm just passing by

819
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,220
and would like to have a cup of tea with him.

820
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,460
No problem.

821
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,500
But

822
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,740
I'm a bit unskilled

823
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,620
at brewing tea,

824
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,220
so I'm afraid I'm wasting

825
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,500
this fine Hongshan Zhuyan.

826
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,620
It's all right.

827
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,180
I can't taste the difference anyway.

828
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,220
Mr. Lei,

829
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,060
aren't you afraid of getting burned?

830
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,900
I practice a technique called Fire Infusion.

831
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,980
The heat of this tea is nothing.

832
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,380
Miss Ruoyi,

833
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,100
one more.

834
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,100
I should pour you a cup of hot water then,

835
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,660
so as not to waste this Hongshan Zhuyan.

836
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,540
Xiao Se.

837
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,900
I finished it at once

838
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,980
because I was thirsty.

839
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,260
I know

840
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,820
about tasting tea too.

841
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,580
Miss Ruoyi told me

842
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,900
that she went to see you yesterday.

843
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,860
Miss Ruoyi went to see you yesterday?

844
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,060
Me?

845
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,420
Yesterday, Miss Ruoyi

846
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,820
also passed by my courtyard

847
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,060
and came in to have a cup of tea.

848
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,940
She asked me

849
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,220
about Tianqi.

850
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,100
That's good then.

851
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:51,860
Miss Ruoyi

852
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,980
is alone in Xueyue City.

853
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,900
As a fellow from Tianqi City,

854
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,060
you should take care of her.

855
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,460
(But...)

856
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,940
[Vermilion Bird]
(Why should I be the Vermilion Bird?)

857
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,580
(It sounds so girly.)

858
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,780
(I want to be the Azure Dragon.)

859
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,340
(No,)

860
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,620
(Azure Dragon is mine.)

861
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,580
(All right.)

862
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,900
(It's just a code name.)

863
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:16,820
(What's wrong with Vermilion Bird?)

864
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,820
(Changfeng, look.)

865
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,380
(Lianyue got a tortoise,)

866
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,060
(and he doesn't complain.)

867
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,860
(I want to beat you up.)

868
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,380
Father.

869
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,060
Father.

870
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:26,740
Qianluo.

871
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,140
You asked for me?

872
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,260
Come on, sit down.

873
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,780
Xiao Se was of great help

874
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,540
this time,

875
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,410
did you thank him?

876
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,940
I did.

877
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,140
As your daughter,

878
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,500
I know what to do.

879
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,780
Good girl.

880
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:38,900
Qianluo,

881
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,820
look,

882
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,700
Xiao Se

883
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,300
is usually against you all the time,

884
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,500
but this time, in the tournament of marriage,

885
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,220
he's been so busy

886
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,780
helping you with so much.

887
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
So I wonder

888
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,780
if he's up to something.

889
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,820
What do you think

890
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,780
of Xiao Se?

891
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,780
What do you mean?

892
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,060
You're blushing.

893
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,540
You're blushing.

894
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,460
Father, what are you thinking about?

895
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,660
Qianluo,

896
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,260
I'm your father.

897
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,580
Tell me

898
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,460
what's on your mind,

899
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,060
okay?

900
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,420
What an exquisite token.

901
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:18,940
[Tianqi, protecting the land]

902
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,620
Father, where did you get this?

903
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,740
Is it for me?

904
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:25,900
Of course

905
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,140
you can have it.

906
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,380
Anyway,

907
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,220
once you hold this token,

908
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,580
you will have to take on

909
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,060
a great responsibility.

910
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,660
What responsibility?

911
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,780
It's a long story.

912
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,580
Miss Ruoyi,

913
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,700
please help me

914
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,460
with my request.

915
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,060
Sure.

916
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,420
I'll leave you all

917
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,180
to catch up then.

918
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:53,740
Farewell.

919
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:01,860
Zang Ming,

920
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,340
let's go.

921
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,460
Xiao Se.

922
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,460
Lord Bai's subordinate

923
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,940
doesn't seem to like you.

924
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,500
Who knows?

925
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,700
Maybe we just don't get along.

926
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,060
Are you done?

927
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,060
Let's go if you're done.

928
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,140
Why don't you stay a little longer?

929
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,420
Yes.

930
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,900
Since Miss Ruoyi has said so,

931
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,340
let's stay for a while.

932
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,500
Right,

933
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,260
I went to pick up my medicine
from the medical hall yesterday

934
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,660
and heard them talking

935
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,660
about ascending the tower.

936
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,660
Why don't you tell me about it?

937
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,940
Speaking of Dengtian Tower,

938
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,140
I went straight to the 16th floor

939
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,100
to challenge Xueyue Sword Deity.

940
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,340
That's a pretty interesting story, indeed.

941
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,820
(The tower keeper of the 13th floor,)

942
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,660
(Luo Mingxuan,)

943
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,260
didn't want to compete with me
in a martial arts match,

944
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,780
(but he wanted to)

945
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,860
(have a bet with me.)

946
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,020
And when I met my martial uncle,

947
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,420
(I used all the skills of the Lei Clan,)

948
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,340
as well as the sword,

949
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,260
Shabu,

950
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,940
that my master gave me.

951
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,460
When I reached the 16th floor,

952
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,300
I roared,

953
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,700
"Lei Wujie of Thunderbolt Sect

954
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,820
would like to challenge Xueyue Sword Deity!"

955
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,060
Wait a minute.

956
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,660
Is this

957
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,500
the story of you alone?

958
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,940
What about Xiao Se?

959
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:29,860
What was he doing?

960
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,540
He?

961
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,940
He's playing hide-and-seek

962
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,820
with Qianluo.

963
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,420
He also had his fortune told.

964
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,060
Yes.

965
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:37,940
Fortune-telling?

966
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,540
What fortune was told?

967
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,460
Right, Xiao Se.

968
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,980
What did the fortune-teller tell you?

969
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,980
I asked about one thing.

970
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,380
What's it?

971
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:50,580
Return.

972
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:51,540
Return?

973
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,180
What was the result?

974
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,500
No result.

975
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,580
Because I regretted it

976
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,460
halfway.

977
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,100
Since you went there,

978
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,620
why didn't you ask for the result?

979
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,140
Because then I realized

980
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,660
that I never cared

981
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,020
about the thing I asked.

982
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,420
So what do you care?

983
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,580
He must care about money.

984
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,050
It's expensive to have
a fortune told by the disciple

985
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,420
of Mount Wangcheng's Master.

986
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,660
You're right.

987
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,540
It's really about the money?

988
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,100
You've finished your story

989
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,540
on Dengtian Tower.

990
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,020
Let's go.

991
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,180
Seriously.

992
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,780
You keep urging me to leave.

993
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:35,700
All right.

994
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:36,980
Miss Ruoyi,

995
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,180
we'll come and visit you

996
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,780
another time.

997
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,500
You can come every day.

998
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,100
I'm lonely here,

999
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,100
so you can come

1000
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,220
and talk to me.

1001
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:44,980
All right.

1002
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,260
I'll come again tomorrow.

1003
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,420
No, I'll come again tomorrow morning.

1004
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,540
Let's go.

1005
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:55,820
See you.

1006
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:01,820
Return?

1007
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,500
Back then, when the princes of Beili

1008
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,460
were competing with each other,

1009
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,820
the whole of Tianqi City was in chaos.

1010
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,740
Lord Langya has gathered

1011
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,660
four great masters

1012
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,980
to form the Four Guardians of Tianqi

1013
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,180
to restore peace to the city.

1014
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,380
And I

1015
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,820
was the Vermilion Bird.

1016
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,820
Eventually, we made it.

1017
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,340
I get it now.

1018
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,780
It means

1019
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,780
that when you got this token,

1020
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,140
you took on

1021
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,220
the responsibility of guarding Tianqi.

1022
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,740
And now that Tianqi is at peace

1023
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,060
and the dynasties have changed.

1024
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,860
All the guardians

1025
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,300
will have to find new successors.

1026
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,140
And the new successors

1027
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,780
are going to protect

1028
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,540
the Sixth Prince,

1029
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,820
Xiao Chuhe.

1030
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,140
Qianluo,

1031
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,140
can you take on

1032
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,860
this responsibility?

1033
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,140
My daughter is so smart.

1034
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,460
You could understand it

1035
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,980
with just a brief explanation.

1036
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,220
Now, I decide

1037
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,300
that this token...

1038
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,740
No.

1039
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,860
I don't think you've been to Tianqi City

1040
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,500
since I was born.

1041
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:10,780
No, I have not.

1042
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,380
Then, naturally, you don't know

1043
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,060
Xiao Chuhe.

1044
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,900
But Xiao Chuhe is a man

1045
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,140
that Lord Langya values.

1046
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:17,700
He...

1047
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,220
I don't care who he values.

1048
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,780
I, Sikong Qianluo,

1049
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,340
will only

1050
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,420
protect someone I like.

1051
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,220
You...

1052
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,660
(I don't want to be a Medicine King.)

1053
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,580
(I want to be the one and only Spear Deity
in the world.)

1054
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,700
Father,

1055
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,020
I remember a statement

1056
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,140
made to me by a master.

1057
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:51,740
Youths

1058
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,820
