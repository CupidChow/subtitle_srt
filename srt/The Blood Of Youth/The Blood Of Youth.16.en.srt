43
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,690
I have seldom left Xueyue City

since I was young.

45
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,530
I haven't met many people

46
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,020

47
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,810

00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,650
What should we do then?

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:50,850
I've got an idea.

Before Father left,

53

This is the distress signal of Xueyue City.

But this beacon

63
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,940
is only visible within a hundred lis.

64
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,250

outside Sword Heart Tomb.

You're dumb.

100
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,300
It's certainly the head

102
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,060
The head?

103
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,540
There are so many swords here.

104
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,420
This is more imposing

105
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,620

106
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,860
By the way, Mingxuan,

107
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,100
why

108
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:55,980
would you be here?

109
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,660
I'm here to work on something.

110
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,890

explode in the sky

112
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,620
as soon as I got here.

113
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,060
Not many people are eligible

115
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,740
So I rushed over.

116
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,300
It turned out to be you.

This is Qilin Fang Sword.

120
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,300
It's the sword

121

of Qilin's head swordsman, Li Xiuxi.

122
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,300

She's well.

135
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,210
Is she as pretty

137
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,210
Well,

the swords you requested.

The heavy sword is Desperate,
the light one is Separate,

the long one is Phoenix,

142

and the three-foot swords are Wisdom and One-Eye.

144

There are seven swords in total.

145
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,330
Seven swords? That's generous.

Tingyu, Guanxue, Wanghua, and Wenfeng.

158
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,100
I certainly recognize it.

Weren't you already dead?

164

165
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,370
Nonsense.

169

the master of Sword Heart Tomb

is your brother,

173
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,370
The rumor

174
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,180
is not trustworthy.

175
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,420
Grandfather?

176
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,250
I'm such an unfilial grandson,

177

178
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,420
Get up, get up.

179
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,010
You're good at swordsmanship.

180
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,540
Then you're not unfilial at all.

181
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,020
Since you got Tingyu Sword,

182
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,850
you must've met your sister.

183
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,850
Good.

184
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,650
Your sister

185
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,650
is the unfilial one.

186
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,460
She knew I was

187
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,890
at Sword Heart Tomb

188
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,650
all alone,

189
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,940
but she didn't come and see me.

190
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,130
It's not like

191
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,250
I'd force her

192
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,220
to be the master

193
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,460
of Sword Heart Tomb.

194
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,180
Why is she afraid of me?

195
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,650
Tingyu Sword

196
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,460
is a punishment for her.

197
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,980
I confiscate it.

198
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:03,980
But...

199
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,940
Don't worry.

200
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,460
Come to the Sword Pavilion tonight.

201
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,420
I'll give you

202
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,300
a more powerful sword.

203
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,220
There's no wound.

204
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,460
But he's got an irregular pulse.

205
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,370
It's really rare.

206
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,680
[Hua Jin, Medicine Valley]

207
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,340
Let's go.

208
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,770
Miss Ye, are you okay?

209
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,340
I'm fine.

210
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,250
I'm just a bit tired.

211
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,340
Why is your pulse so irregular?

212
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,650
They're coming.

213
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,650
Keep on moving.

214
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,530
Okay.

215
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,530
We're already here.

216
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,460
Martial Uncle?

217
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,490
Go back with me.

218
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,850
Are you going to betray the clan?

219
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,340
But I'm with two clans.

220
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,700
But your surname is Tang.

221
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,370
Why must you do this?

222
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,530
Does Tang Clan really

223
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,770
have to do such a treacherous thing?

224
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,490
This is not your concern.

225
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,180
As a disciple of Tang Clan,

226
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,010
all you need to do is obey orders.

227
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,530
But Master Baili told me

228
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,130
we got to do things in all conscience.

229
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,060
That's enough, Tang Lian.

230
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,420
Don't you forget your surname, Tang.

231
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,580
Back then,

232
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,060
it was you who sent him to Xueyue City.

233
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,250
Now you want to cut ties

234
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,530
between him and Xueyue City.

235
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,220
Tang Clan is a century-old great family.

236
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,490
Is this how the clan treats

237
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,420
their disciples?

238
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,730
Tang Lian,

239
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,010
I'll give you one last chance.

240
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,300
You're the best disciple

241
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,580
of Tang Clan among your peers.

242
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
I hope you won't make

243
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,490
the wrong choice.

244
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,010
Tang Lian.

245
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,420
Miss Ye,

246
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,730
leave.

247
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,530
Find the nearest troop.

248
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,650
Go!

249
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,850
Watch out, Miss Ye!

250
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,340
It's been so long since I used this.

251
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,300
I almost forgot its name.

252
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,100
Mind Peace Bell Technique.

253
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,730
Yes, that's the name.

254
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,580
Wu...

255
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,060
Ye Anshi.

256
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,010
I was Ye Anshi at Tianwaitian.

257
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,490
Now that I've returned to Central Plains.

258
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,820
It's better to call me Wuxin.

259
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,250
Thanks for your help.

260
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,250
Oh, it's you.

261
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,300
I let you go back to Tianwaitian last time.

262
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,370
How dare you

263
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,420
return to Central Plains?

264
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:03,980
Let me go back?

265
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,130
You?

266
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,100
Let's go.

267
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,250
Have you stopped Jingxia?

268
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,820
I got the information today

269
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,010
that Su Muyu, the head of Su family from Dark River,

270
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,490
and Xie Qidao, the head of Xie family,

271
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,420
joined forces to stop Li Hanyi
from heading North.

272
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,180
But Li Hanyi saw through the ambush

273
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,650
and eventually broke through.

274
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,890
Her whereabouts are still unknown.

275
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,010
It seems like

276
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,340
Dark River is making a move.

277
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,530
Jingxia is too assertive.

278
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,300
What about the three old masters of Tang Clan?

279
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,940
They didn't want

280
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,100
to come forward.

281
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,530
But Li Hanyi already

282
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,530
broke through that time.

283
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,650
They got no choice but to come out.

284
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,060
They still failed to get her.

285
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:49,730
As for the reason

286
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,220
why Tang Clan would work with Dark River,

287
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,580
I guess it's because

288
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,530
Ninth Prince had known about Tang Clan

289
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,580
before he went there.

290
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,610
They knew

291
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,340
about your relationship with Ninth Prince.

292
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,770
So they thought

293
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,890
it was your order.

294
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,610
How could Jingxia be so certain

295
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,250
that Dark River would work with him?

296
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,420
Because

297
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,940
Ninth Prince impersonated a person.

298
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,460
Who?

299
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,180
Xiao Chuhe.

300
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,100
Grandfather, I'm here.

301
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,650
You're here.

302
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,730
What sword do you want to give me?

303
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,060
It's certainly one

304
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,850
of the best swords in the world.

305
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,180
One of the best swords in the world?

306
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,770
Is it on the Records of Famous Swords?

307
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,700
Come.

308
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,460
Look at the Records of Swords on both sides.

309
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,460
The top ten famous swords

310
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,220
are the best

311
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,940
in the world.

312
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,700
Look.

313
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,460
The tenth sword in the Record of Swords,

314
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,770
Worry-Free.

315
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,490
It is as shiny as jade.

316
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,100
Its sword body is stunning.

317
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,130
Unlike the swords in the human world.

318
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,370
It's with an aura of a deity.

319
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,890
The current owner is still unknown.

320
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,220
The ninth is a duo

321
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,940
called Frost and Snow.

322
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,370
They are a couple.

323
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,100
The frost in autumn, the snow in winter.

324
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,580
It's ordinary when they are separated.

325
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,340
But when they join together as a duo,

326
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,730
it'll bring magical power.

327
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,220
The current owner is still unknown.

328
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,850
The eighth sword

329
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,370
is Haoque.

330
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,100
It qualifies as the first sword

331
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,530
of righteousness in the human world.

332
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,130
It's so righteous that it can slaughter
thousands of demons.

333
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,890
It used to belong to Beili's Protector-in-Chief.

334
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,460
It's stored at Heavenly Sword Pavilion
in Tianqi City now.

335
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,850
The Sword Slave is watching over it.

336
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,530
The seventh sword

337
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,420
is Mountains Mover.

338
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,820
Its qi of sword is extremely strong.

339
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,580
Once it's lifted, it can move
thousands of mountains and make waves.

340
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,460
Among these top ten famous swords,

341
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,010
it's the only one forged

342
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,340
by a sword forger of the present age.

343
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,770
The current owner is still unknown.

344
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,940
The sixth sword

345
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,130
is Qingxiao.

346
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,770
This is the treasure

347
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,010
of Mount Wangcheng,

348
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,130
the sword of the successive masters.

349
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,130
The current owner

350
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,300
is Zhao Yuzhen, the master of Mount Wangcheng,

351
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,770
the Tao Sword Deity
who's among the five Sword Deities.

352
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,210
Take a look at this side.

353
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,250
The fifth sword

354
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,530
is Pojun.

355
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,530
It's blunt and heavy.

356
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,180
The regular people can't lift it up.

357
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,650
It's called the Sword of Dominion.

358
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,820
Its current holder is Yan Zhantian,
the Wrathful Sword Deity.

359
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,610
The fourth sword is...

360
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,300
There are four characters,

361
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,610
three characters,

362
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,220
and mostly two characters

363
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,610
in the names of the swords in the world.

364
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,010
But this sword,

365
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,820
it

366
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,060
only has a character.

367
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,220
Heart.

368
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,490
Yes.

369
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,180
The fourth sword in the Sword Records

370
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,100
is Heart.

371
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,980
It's the only sword

372
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,060
with a single-character name.

373
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,370
It has a psychic ability

374
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,050
which allows it to connect with the sword owner.

375
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,340
It's got pure thought.

376
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,610
It can break the thoughts of regular swords.

377
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,220
It's passed down to the successors

378
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,130
of Sword Heart Tomb.

379
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,940
Now, it's passed down to Lei Wujie.

380
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,370
Grandfather,

381
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,730
you're going to pass this sword to me?

382
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,420
Your mother

383
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,370
used to be

384
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,250
the sword holder.

385
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,820
You deserve

386
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,770
to inherit it.

387
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,330
But,

388
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,980
some people reckon

389
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,940
swords and humans are two different things.

390
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,770
Like your sister,

391
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,010
she refused to accept this Heart Sword.

392
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,180
But she went to Mount Kunlun

393
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,180
to seek for the Iron Glacier.

394
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,330
But someone thinks

395
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,980
that the sword is the heart,
and the heart can be used as a sword.

396
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,900
Like your mother.

397
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,290
Grandfather, can you

398
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,330
tell me about Mother?

399
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,860
Your mother

400
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,290
was a nice person.

401
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,660
She was kind and smart

402
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,290
with a gentle personality,

403
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:48,620
and

404
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
she was one of the very rare geniuses.

405
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,460
If it wasn't

406
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,220
for that darned Lei Mengsha,

407
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,620
she would've been the successor of the Sword Tomb.

408
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,220
How did Mother

409
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,290
meet Father?

410
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,660
Lei Mengsha came

411
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,050
to visit Sword Heart Tomb

412
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,050
with his best buddy,

413
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,530
Baili Dongjun.

414
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,660
He didn't stay at the Sword Pavilion,

415
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,730
but went

416
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,490
to Sword Heart Cliff.

417
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,090
It was okay.

418
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,860
But he insisted on competing with Xinyue.

419
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,140
It was all right, too.

420
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,770
Yet, he coincidentally won.

421
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,380
OK. Never mind.

422
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,490
But he...

423
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:31,980
Grandfather,

424
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,980
why do you sound

425
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,700
a little jealous?

426
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,050
Since then,

427
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,810
your mother had been clamoring

428
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,940
to see the world

429
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,290
with Lei Mengsha.

430
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,090
I thought

431
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,980
I'd just let her do it.

432
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,730
As she was young,

433
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,220
she couldn't just stay

434
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,700
in the valley for her entire life.

435
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,730
Moreover, Lei Mengsha

436
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,570
was an outstanding man

437
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,220
and he came from a great family.

438
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,660
So I agreed.

439
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,620
Over years,

440
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,860
I've regretted it.

441
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,810
I asked myself

442
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,140
why I would agree to it.

443
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,460
I should've kept her here.

444
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,380
Kid,

445
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,770
tell me,

446
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,250
if I had kept her here back then,

447
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,940
would things have turned out

448
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,900
differently?

449
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,250
You're right, but I wouldn't have existed then.

450
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,090
You brat.

451
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,810
How could you share

452
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,770
the same personality

453
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,250
with your father?

454
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,290
You look simple-minded.

455
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,660
Grandfather,

456
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,530
don't you still have me and Sister?

457
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,050
We'll often come to see you.

458
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,250
You can come see me.

459
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,380
But don't try to get any swords from me.

460
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:46,980
Grandfather,

461
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,380
you said you'd pass the Heart Sword

462
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,010
to me.

463
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,180
You can't regret it.

464
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
You silly brat.

465
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,260
This

466
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,500
is not an ordinary sword.

467
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,330
Even if I want to give it to you,

468
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,180
it still depends on

469
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,050
whether or not it acknowledges you.

470
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,020
Lift.

471
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:19,980
Lift again.

472
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,740
Kid,

473
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,980
don't always try

474
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,370
to control the sword.

475
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,460
You've got

476
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,660
to communicate with it wholeheartedly.

477
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,180
Only then will it respond to you.

478
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,090
Try it again.

479
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:51,770
Jie,

480
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,330
long time no see.

481
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,530
Mother.

482
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,500
Is that you, Mother?

483
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,980
I'm just your imagination.

484
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,500
The resonance between the Heart Sword and you

485
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,330
has transformed into me.

486
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,020
Mother,

487
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,810
I miss you so much, Mother.

488
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,530
Sister, Grandfather,

489
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,660
and I have reunited.

490
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,370
If you and Father were still alive,

491
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,420
we could

492
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:16,980
live together

493
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,900
like we used to.

494
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,220
Silly kid, it's all right.

495
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,850
As long as

496
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,050
you've kept us in your mind,

497
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,500
our family

498
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,050
will always be together.

499
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,530
By the way, Mother,

500
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,940
I'm the Guardian

501
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,740
Azure Dragon now.

502
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,260
But,

503
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,180
I don't know

504
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,810
what I should do

505
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,850
as a real guardian.

506
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,020
Before I answer your question,

507
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,460
you need to tell me

508
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,290
why you hold a sword.

509
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,330
Because there's someone I want to protect.

510
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,570
To a guardian,

511
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,220
holding a sword

512
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,610
is to protect

513
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,980
the people they want to protect.

514
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,610
The people I want to protect?

515
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,810
Protect those who I want to protect.

516
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,180
Protect those who I want to protect.

517
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,420
Protect those who I want to protect.

518
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,530
Very well.

519
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
After ten years,

520
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,570
this Heart Sword

521
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,020
has finally got

522
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,500
its own master.

523
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,850
(Protect those who I want to protect.)

524
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,610
(Mother,)

525
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,770
(don't worry.)

526
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,090
(I won't let you down.)

527
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,330
Kid,

528
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,460
I heard that you'd been trying
to avoid the chase all night.

529
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,050
Go back and get some rest.

530
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,420
Try the power

531
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,420
of this Heart Sword tomorrow morning.

532
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,050
Grandfather, you haven't told me

533
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,370
about the remaining swords.

534
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,130
I've heard about the top three

535
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,610
many times,

536
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,500
but

537
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,610
it sounds different to hear

538
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,660
the best sword forger in the world

539
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,500
talk about it.

540
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,420
Fine.

541
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,050
As you wish.

542
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,020
Come.

543
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,220
The third sword

544
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,130
is Iron Glacier.

545
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,740
This is the coldest sword in the world.

546
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
It was sealed on the summit of Mount Kunlun.

547
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,220
It once belonged
to the Greatest Kunlun Sword Deity.

548
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,460
Now, its master is Li Hanyi,

549
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,220
Xueyue Sword Deity.

550
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,090
Sister is amazing.

551
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,700
She doesn't inherit Heart Sword,

552
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,090
but pursues a better one.

553
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,370
Hey, brat,

554
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,980
since you got Heart Sword,

555
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,260
you should say

556
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,500
Heart Sword is the best one.

557
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,330
We can lose to Sister. It's not embarrassing.

558
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,180
The second sword

559
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,050
is the Vermilion.

560
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,050
It is the treasure of Wushuang City.

561
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,220
It's kept in Wushuang's Sword Box now.

562
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,740
The sword is sharp.

563
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,220
Once it's sent out, it'll be sure to hurt someone.

564
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,050
Wushuang, the City Lord of Wushuang City,

565
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,740
owns it now.

566
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,980
I wonder when Wushuang

567
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,260
could draw the sword.

568
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,940
Being able to draw the Vermilion

569
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,050
proves that he's already a sword deity.

570
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,090
This is the last one...

571
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:32,980
This...

572
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,700
Grandfather,

573
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,260
why is the drawing

574
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,180
of the first sword blank?

575
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,660
I'll tell you why.

576
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,980
The first sword of the Swords Records

577
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,610
is Tianzhan.

578
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,420
The world's number one sword.

579
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,460
The sword of heaven's will

580
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,530
can only be held by the chosen one.

581
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,770
It's stored in the Directorate of Astronomy

582
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,850
and guarded by Qi Tianchen, the State Preceptor.

583
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,420
Tianzhan

584
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,050
is the deity sword

585
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,700
that was left by the first Emperor.

586
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,530
It hasn't appeared in the world

587
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,740
for centuries.

588
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,260
Although I'm the master of Sword Heart Tomb,

589
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,050
I've never seen this sword before.

590
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,250
Of course I couldn't paint it.

591
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,700
It hasn't appeared in the world for centuries?

592
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,740
Won't it rust?

593
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,980
It won't.

594
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,290
A chosen one

595
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,740
like our first Emperor

596
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,530
won't show up

597
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,610
easily.

598
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,810
Kid,

599
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,500
how is the young man's

600
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,290
condition?

601
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,370
He's got

602
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,220
a big problem.

603
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,940
His hidden pulse is severely injured.

604
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,740
Everyone knows that the significant pulses

605
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,130
include the Eight Extra Meridians,

606
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,260
the Twelve Regular Meridians,

607
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,370
and the Fifteen Collaterals.

608
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,770
In fact, each person has a hidden pulse.

609
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,460
Because one's internal power

610
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,090
is kept in the hidden pulse.

611
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,570
He can't practice martial arts
as his hidden pulse is injured.

612
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,850
But I can sense

613
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,940
a scary power

614
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,130
in his hidden pulse.

615
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,370
If this power backfires on him,

616
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,330
it'll put him

617
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,460
in great danger.

618
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,530
I guess it has backfired on him

619
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,260
once before.

620
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,530
But it was not serious

621
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,260
that time.

622
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,020
So he only suffers qi deficiency.

623
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,940
We just have to nourish his body.

624
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,610
But in the future...

625
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:02,770
What's the matter?

626
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,570
There's a disease

627
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,850
that you can't cure?

628
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,260
Not to mention me,

629
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,530
even if my master comes,

630
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
I guess it'll still be incurable.

631
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,610
As for the fickle

632
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,700
martial brother of mine,

633
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,900
I'm afraid he couldn't cure him either.

634
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,660
You're talking about Sikong Changfeng,

635
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,900
the Spear Deity?

636
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,530
My master said

637
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,180
if Changfeng had only studied medical skills,

638
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,420
there wouldn't be any disease

639
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,570
in the world that he couldn't cure.

640
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
But he chose to learn medical skills
and spear at the same time.

641
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,330
He even became a City Lord.

642
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,660
How can he master

643
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,770
medical skills like this?

644
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,900
Well, you focus on studying medical skills.

645
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,900
You came to the Sword Heart Tomb

646
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,330
and spent a year here picking herbs.

647
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,290
I've asked you to learn

648
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,020
sword skills from me many times but you refused.

649
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,610
Why can't you

650
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,530
cure him then?

651
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,900
I'm still young.

652
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,460
Still young?

653
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,700
Nonsense.

654
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,330
You're awake.

655
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,090
Are you feeling better?

656
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:08,940
Much better.

657
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,050
Don't worry.

658
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,570
I won't let you

659
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,610
get hurt again.

660
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,610
Drink the medicine.

661
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,290
Here.

662
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,050
It's already been three days.

663
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,050
You finally can get off the bed.

664
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,700
Thank you, Divine Healer.

665
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,370
Don't thank me.

666
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,180
I only did you a little favor.

667
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
I can't heal

668
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,130
your injured hidden pulse.

669
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,180
I hear this

670
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,050
all the time.

671
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,460
I've read an ancient book

672
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,770
at the Medicine Valley before.

673
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,660
There's a medical skill recorded in it.

674
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,900
It's called Soul-Amending Skill.

675
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,810
It can bring death back

676
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,420
to life.

677
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,090
It can also reconnect the broken soul and pulse.

678
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,050
It's just that it didn't mention

679
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,610
the right way to use it.

680
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,370
Maybe it's a long-lost skill.

681
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,980
After all, even my master,

682
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,090
the world's top physician,

683
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,700
doesn't know about this skill.

684
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:40,850
So,

685
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,740
you're Xin Baicao's disciple.

686
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,330
Yes.

687
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,900
In the past few days,

688
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,530
Qianluo told me

689
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,810
that you're Changfeng's disciple.

690
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:51,980
So,

691
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,130
you should call me

692
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,940
Martial Uncle.

693
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,220
How old are you?

694
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,180
I'm young.

695
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,460
But I'm ambitious.

696
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,370
What is your ambition?

697
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,330
Like healing your injury?

698
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,570
I'm serious.

699
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,220
I believe you.

700
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,610
By the way, they said

701
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,570
you lent them

702
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,610
your inner force

703
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,770
through the so-called Circulation Formation.

704
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,020
What book is that?

705
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,370
Can you show it to me?

706
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:22,530
Sure.

707
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,740
This book is written by Xie Xuan,

708
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,770
Scholarly Sword Deity.

709
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,570
The technique in it

710
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,370
can slowly heal my hidden pulse.

711
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,220
What a peculiar book.

712
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,260
If you want,

713
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,530
I can lend it to you for a few more days.

714
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,500
Never mind.

715
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,660
I've memorized it.

716
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,180
I didn't expect you

717
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,980
to be gifted with such a great memory.

718
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,500
But that Lei buddy

719
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,420
of yours

720
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,420
can't wait any longer.

721
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,220
He's eager to leave the tomb

722
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
and go to Lei Fortress.

723
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,130
He said his sister would kill him

724
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,740
if he was late.

725
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,180
What kind of a sister is that? She's ferocious.

726
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,220
She's one of the world's top five Sword Deities.

727
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,330
What do you think?

728
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,420
But since he's in a hurry,

729
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,020
I shall pay Master Li

730
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,850
a visit first.

731
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,260
Greeting to Master Li.

732
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,660
How are you feeling?

733
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,660
Much better. Thanks for your help, Master Li.

734
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,850
Hua Jin deserves credit for that.

735
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,220
I didn't do anything.

736
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,740
It's just that I didn't expect

737
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,610
to be able to meet you here.

738
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:31,530
By the way,

739
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,020
what do you think

740
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,980
about Dark River's pursuit?

741
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,260
Dark River never stops until they die.

742
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,810
If their purpose was to kill us,

743
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,260
they should've sent

744
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,610
the stronger killers over.

745
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,020
What?

746
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,570
Isn't Su Changli strong enough?

747
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,610
Among us,

748
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,020
I'm most likely the target.

749
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,180
If they asked for Dark River's help
to ensure I get killed,

750
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,980
they should've sent an expert like Su Muyu,

751
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,020
the Umbrella-Holding Demon.

752
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,700
So I guess

753
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,370
there's something else behind this.

754
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:09,980
Maybe

755
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,810
it's related

756
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,810
to our destination.

757
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,260
Lei Fortress.

758
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,980
Hero banquet.

759
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,330
These

760
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,370
are just my guesses.

761
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:27,850
The top priority

762
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,460
is that we have to rush

763
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,460
to Lei Fortress now.

764
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,610
Before the enemy starts the plot,

765
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,130
we still have room for maneuver.

766
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,700
You said

767
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,740
you're Xiao Se.

768
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,050
Yes.

769
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,020
Whatever my name was back then,

770
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,900
that is the only name I'll use in the future.

771
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,020
Those people from Dark River

772
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,610
are afraid of Sword Heart Tomb
so they dare not break in.

773
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,290
But they won't necessarily leave.

774
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:04,900
I'll repel them

775
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,570
tonight.

776
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:07,810
You shall leave

777
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,290
tomorrow morning.

778
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,500
We shall not bother you to do this.

779
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,900
My grandson cares about you.

780
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,500
And I care about my grandson.

781
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,420
It's a perfect night to kill someone.

782
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,940
Are you worried

783
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,660
that Sword Heart Tomb will help them?

784
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,130
We've seen He Qu and He Cong,

785
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:38,900
the two Sword Guardians.

786
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,570
Their sword techniques

787
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,180
are far behind yours.

788
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,260
There's nothing to fear.

789
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,500
Besides them,

790
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,090
there's another expert in Sword Heart Tomb.

791
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,260
Another expert? Who is it?

792
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,980
Sword Heart with the moon on it

793
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,130
kills someone in a dream.

794
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,460
Li Xinyue?

795
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
She has been dead for years.

796
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,130
Li Xinyue is dead.

797
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,610
But Heart Sword is not.

798
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,530
The person who taught her sword technique

799
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,610
is still alive.

800
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,090
Who is that person?

801
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,700
The world's best sword forger,

802
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,690
Li Suwang.

803
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,980
Tengkong, a greatsword.

804
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,020
It's an imitation sword

805
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,500
of the world's fifth most famous sword, Pojun.

806
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,690
I forged it when I was young.

807
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,020
It's been a long time since I last saw it.

808
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:28,980
It's a good sword.

809
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,130
Unfortunately,

810
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,730
it's in the wrong man's hand.

811
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,690
Your strong killing aura

812
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,090
has ruined the nice sword.

813
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,250
A sword

814
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,570
is intended to be a weapon.

815
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,900
How dare you judge the swords in front of me?

816
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,900
Grandfather!

817
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,090
Grandfather,

818
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,090
I'll fix this on my own.

819
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,250
You don't have to do this for me.

820
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,460
It's hard to deal with that man.

821
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,340
I've met

822
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,500
many of them before.

823
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,250
I'm still well and alive.

824
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,570
Let's fight with swords again.

825
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,380
I've learned

826
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,900
a technique from Li Hanyi, the Sword Deity.

827
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:22,860
It's called

828
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,940
Unpredictable Cloud and Mist.

829
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,530
Heart Sword? Okay.

830
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,130
A sword is not a weapon.

831
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,860
But a friend.

832
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,050
It doesn't matter to be killed

833
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,300
by such a sword.

834
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,820
Indeed, I struck you just now.

835
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,500
But it didn't hurt you.

836
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,730
To a killer,

837
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:11,980
to lose

838
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,690
is to die.

839
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,610
It's a puppet again.

840
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,530
Let him go.

841
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,020
This is how he gets away.

842
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,420
Mu Ying is nothing to be worry about.

843
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,730
Kid,

844
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,340
are you all right?

845
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,090
Lei Wujie!

846
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,290
Sir, it was you who tampered

847
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,900
with Su Changli's move, wasn't it?

848
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,570
It was.

849
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,730
Just now

850
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,980
when I fought him,

851
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,500
I disrupted

852
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,860
his zhenqi.

853
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,860
But he didn't sense it.

854
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,460
So

855
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,380
when he fought Jie,

856
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,900
he thought

857
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,250
that he dodged the sword.

858
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,610
In the end,

859
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,250
with an inch off,

860
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,020
his heart meridian was shattered.

861
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,420
Why did you do this?

862
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,770
Jie is talented,

863
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,060
but

864
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,770
he's soft-hearted.

865
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,980
I can feel

866
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,690
that he's going to be a gentleman in fighting.

867
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,340
However, a gentleman's sword

868
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,650
needs a killing aura too.

869
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,060
His sword seeks victory,

870
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,090
instead of survival.

871
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,340
It's a wicked martial arts world.

872
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,980
A sword like this

873
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,650
won't last long.

874
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,650
I don't want to kill people,

875
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,420
but they tend to kill me.

876
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,170
Whether it's the martial arts world or not,

877
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,210
it's always been like this.

878
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,130
I understand your concern.

879
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,940
Please entrust

880
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,170
Lei Wujie to me.

881
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,340
If it wasn't for you,

882
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,730
I wouldn't have made Jie

883
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,500
do something like this.

884
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,650
What do you mean?

885
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,690
Four years ago,

886
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,290
my daughter died.

887
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:39,730
Now,

888
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,290
I hope that my grandson

889
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,770
can return safely.

890
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,380
Noted.

891
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,500
I'll never forget

892
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,420
that you saved my life.

893
00:38:59,250 --> 00:38:59,820
I'll see you again

894
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,570
if there's a chance.

895
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,900
Wait,

896
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,380
this is for you.

897
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,570
What is this?

898
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,020
I know you're rich

899
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,940
that you carry around
the precious Penglai Pills

900
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,770
as candy.

901
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,250
But this is different.

902
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,940
A dying man

903
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,770
could last three more days after taking it.

904
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,690
If something happens to you again,

905
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,570
take it and come to me in three days.

906
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,650
I'll rescue you.

907
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,420
Okay.

908
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,170
Who is that Xiao Se?

909
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,460
Why did you bow to him?

910
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,770
He said he was Xiao Se

911
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,290
and that he was no longer the man he used to be.

912
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,170
But there's one thing that won't change.

913
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,820
Which is his surname.

914
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,540
As long as his surname is Xiao,

915
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,650
then, everything does

916
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,290
will

917
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,130
never end.

918
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:35,980
Should I go there?

919
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,060
But Master didn't teach me

920
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,340
how to comfort a man.

921
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,250
Luo Mingxuan.

922
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:51,980
Don't worry about me.

923
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:54,820
Actually,

924
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,940
I knew that there will be such a day.

925
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,290
In the martial arts world,

926
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,980
sometimes, you don't want to kill people,

927
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,820
but they try to kill you.

928
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,210
I understand.

929
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,540
It's not

930
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,610
up to you.

931
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,650
But this is wrong!

932
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,500
The fighting will grow hatred among people

933
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,020
and it's never going to end.

934
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,500
This is not

935
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,500
the martial arts world I want.

936
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,090
I know.

937
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,340
What you want is a peaceful world

938
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,540
where you can enjoy life.

939
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,290
Am I being simple-minded?

940
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,500
Do you know

941
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,380
what kind of martial arts world I want?

942
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,940
I once thought

943
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,380
the martial arts world
was like the imperial court.

944
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,570
There would only be unlimited ambitions.

945
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,170
Until I met you,

946
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,770
Wuxin,

947
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,690
Tianwaitian,

948
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,020
Xueyue City,

949
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:52,730
and Dark River.

950
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,210
Now, I think

951
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,980
