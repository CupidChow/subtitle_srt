00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,910
I have one question.

194
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,590
Go on.

195
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,790
Why do you

196
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,640
bring me along?

197
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,080
Isn't my life

198
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,080
as precious as theirs?

199
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,640
Well...

200
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,640
I got it.

201
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,350
It is because

202
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,790
I'm robust.

203
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,640
Rightfully so, Hero Lei.

204
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,560
All right.

205
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,200
I get what you mean.

206
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,520
Rest assured.

207
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,960
I will protect all of them

208
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,560
with you.

209
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,230
Deal.

210
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,200
Deal.

211
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,350
Why is it you?

212
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,880
We meet again.

213
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,230
Calm down.

214
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,590
I invite him over.

215
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,080
The one we're meeting today

216
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,960
is him?

217
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,590
But he's from Dark River.

218
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,680
That's the reason

219
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
why we meet him here.

220
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,830
He was one of those

221
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,280
who tried to kill my sister.

222
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,750
I wrote to your sister

223
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,280
before this.

224
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,400
In fact, Mr. Su, the head of the Su family,

225
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,230
and your sister go way back.

226
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,750
What did she say?

227
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,680
According to her letter, she said

228
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,920
that even though Mr. Su

229
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,200
belongs to Dark River,

230
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,470
however, he is different

231
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,560
from the vermin of Dark River.

232
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,870
He's an assassin,

233
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,590
but with a kind heart within.

234
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,960
Therefore, your sister isn't against

235
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,200
of our meeting with him.

236
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,440
I didn't mean to kill City Lord Li.

237
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,870
I was summoned

238
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,320
to halt her.

239
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,080
Since she isn't against this,

240
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,110
I won't say much.

241
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,870
Mr. Su has his own set of principles,

242
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,040
which I'm clear about this.

243
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,560
However, news came out

244
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,040
that many assassins of Dark River

245
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,320
have already left Tianqi,

246
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,590
including the head of the Mu family,

247
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,920
Mu Yumo.

248
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,710
Besides,

249
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,160
the drugged testers contrived by Xiao Yu

250
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
appeared at Lord Bai's Residence

251
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,160
that day.

252
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,870
Only a few assassins

253
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,830
of Dark River

254
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,470
were able to paint the Director of Sword

255
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,110
and the successor of Heart Sword into a corner.

256
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,830
Mr. Su, you

257
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,320
just sat by

258
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,990
and did nothing there.

259
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,040
Instead, you took away one of the testers.

260
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,320
Master, help me.

261
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,160
Therefore, I presume

262
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,710
that you don't know

263
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,920
about the drugged tester.

264
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,320
The scheme was plotted

265
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,440
by Xiao Yu and the Leader.

266
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,750
Afterwards, assassins from Su and Mu families

267
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,440
left Tianqi.

268
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,960
Only assassins from the Xie family

269
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,560
who have lost their head stay.

270
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,920
And that proved I was right.

271
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,990
The drugged testers incident

272
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,470
has caused Su and Mu families

273
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,350
to not be on the same page as the Leader.

274
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,920
You're indeed intelligent, Your Highness.

275
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,280
You could actually restore the whole story

276
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,040
by piecing

277
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,870
fragments of information together.

278
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,870
You're right.

279
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,440
Leader didn't tell Yumo and me

280
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,110
about that.

281
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,160
He has Ghost Physician Night Crow

282
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,350
to turn a large number of Dark River assassins

283
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,280
into drugged testers.

284
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,400
Upon knowing this,

285
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,350
we had several negotiations

286
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,470
with Leader,

287
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,080
but to no avail.

288
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,400
You used to make a perfect team.

289
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,080
But now, the decision

290
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,040
of Su Changhe

291
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,400
is leading Dark River to its downfall.

292
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,960
Did you invite me here

293
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,960
just to prove your guess, Your Highness?

294
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,680
No.

295
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,470
I'm here to persuade you

296
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,350
to team up with me instead.

297
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,440
Team up with you?

298
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,560
Currently, the majority
of the Dark River members

299
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,630
are under the control of the Leader.

300
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,440
It's impossible for you alone

301
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,800
to rescue them.

302
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,710
If you turn down my proposition,

303
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,990
I would ask Xueyue City

304
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,510
to launch carnage against those

305
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,400
who are about to return to Dark River

306
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,160
and none of them

307
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,350
will be left alive.

308
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,040
You're threatening me, aren't you?

309
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,230
I will try fair means before resorting to force.

310
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,750
What if I say yes?

311
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,110
We collaborate to get rid of the Leader.

312
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,510
When you and Dark River members

313
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,830
return to the martial arts world afterwards,

314
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,500
I will forgo the grieves between us.

315
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,110
But still and all,

316
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,590
Dark River is only allowed to exist

317
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,800
as a common clan,

318
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,870
not the assassin syndicate.

319
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,710
There is no one

320
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,400
born to kill.

321
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,200
Xiao Se.

322
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,350
Did he agree?

323
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,320
He has no reason to say no.

324
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,350
[Lord Chi's Residence]

325
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,630
Your Highness.

326
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Ao Yu, the Crowd Prince of Nanjue

327
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,630
has sent a message.

328
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,800
Their envoys

329
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,920
have entered Tianqi.

330
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,630
They request to meet you tonight.

331
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,110
This devious fox

332
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,680
is getting impatience

333
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,680
after seeing

334
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,160
the situation of Tianqi.

335
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,750
Fine.

336
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,470
I will meet them tonight.

337
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,750
Where are they?

338
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,350
Liuxian Parlor, in the south of the capital.

339
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,590
How come they pick

340
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,990
a remote place like such?

341
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,420
[Jingxue Pavilion]

342
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,440
You're here too, Miss Ruoyi.

343
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,990
Qianluo is upset

344
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,920
as you have been

345
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,320
going out without her recently.

346
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,750
We didn't go somewhere special though.

347
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,230
It has been peaceful

348
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,110
in Tianqi recently,

349
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,800
so I asked him

350
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,710
to bring me somewhere fun.

351
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,400
What fun places

352
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,750
have you been to?

353
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,630
We went to

354
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
the...

355
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,080
I guess Xiao Se

356
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,560
took you to Full Bloom Parlor, right?

357
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,510
It's an amusing place.

358
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,200
Yes.

359
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,080
This is it.

360
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,200
The flowers

361
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,920
are fragrant and beautiful.

362
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,230
They are soft and warm to hold.

363
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,350
Certainly.

364
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,470
Soft and warm.

365
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,990
You little airhead.

366
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,870
Full Blossom Parlor

367
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,920
is the biggest brothel in Tianqi City.

368
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,040
I didn't go there.

369
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
I mean it.

370
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,830
I swear to heaven.

371
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,560
I swear on the century-old reputation
of the Lei Fortress.

372
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,800
I have never been there.

373
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,630
I have never even heard of it.

374
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,350
Why?

375
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,830
There's no harm admit it.

376
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,800
It's not your first time though.

377
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,680
Full Bloom Parlor

378
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,080
can never be better

379
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,590
than Belle's Manor.

380
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,680
You're right, Fairy Rui.

381
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,800
No, you're not.

382
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,750
I've never been to such a place.

383
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,680
Gosh, you made me confused.

384
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,630
Enough.

385
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,680
You may leave here.

386
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,110
I have something

387
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,160
to speak to her alone.

388
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,400
Sure.

389
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,350
I... Well...

390
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,630
Please be seated.

391
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,200
After we met at Qianjin Gambling House,

392
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,040
you asked me to wait there.

393
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,750
I have been waiting

394
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,160
for one whole month.

395
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,830
What awaited me is Langya Army
entering the capital

396
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,440
but not

397
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,470
your next plan.

398
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,750
Very soon.

399
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,080
How soon?

400
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,080
Within these few days.

401
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,590
I will send someone

402
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,680
to relay the message to you.

403
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,800
Why so long?

404
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,110
It's better to err on the side of caution.

405
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,320
Also, I don't want

406
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,560
to put you in danger.

407
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,510
If you were to be hurt

408
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,320
because of this,

409
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,080
I would disappoint Lian.

410
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,350
Miss Ruoyi.

411
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,160
I didn't go to the brothel.

412
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,400
I have never even heard of it.

413
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,510
Xiao Se and I just

414
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:56,990
simply went to Diaolou Parlor

415
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,920
and took Qiulubai brew.

416
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,870
It tastes worse than the brew in Xueyue City.

417
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,830
Enough, Lei Wujie.

418
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,160
Concerning your intelligence,
you won't go to the brothel.

419
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,230
Perhaps those ladies

420
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,230
would peg you as an idiot

421
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,280
and throw you out.

422
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,040
Stop explaining.

423
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,350
You were lying just now.

424
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,750
You're so right, Qianluo.

425
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,960
Very good, you've admitted that you were lying.

426
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,590
So, where did you go just now?

427
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,990
Wait. It's a trap again.

428
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,160
I...

429
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,350
We're going somewhere interesting tonight.

430
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,280
Lei Wujie, do you want to join us?

431
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
I will surely go if you go, Miss Ruoyi.

432
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,990
What about Xiao Se?

433
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
He's a bit tied up.

434
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,400
He and his father

435
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,710
have grown closer now.

436
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,680
Today, he's asked to have dinner

437
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,440
in the palace.

438
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,680
I don't think he can join us tonight.

439
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,350
Fine.

440
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,320
I will have a blast too

441
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,040
without him.

442
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,670
[Lord Bai's Residence]

443
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,280
Ever since the Langya Army left,

444
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,350
Tianqi City

445
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,080
has returned to its calmness.

446
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,560
Especially when Father

447
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,710
burnt the letter,

448
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,750
I became more at ease now.

449
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,990
Is the wind that blows within Tianqi

450
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,200
going to stop now?

451
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,710
Many things seem

452
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,110
to have come to an end,

453
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,750
but somehow,

454
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,560
I'm getting restless.

455
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,280
By the way, Your Highness.

456
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,160
Today's the Lantern Festival.

457
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,160
Lantern Festival?

458
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,320
It's a new festival

459
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,750
celebrated in Tianqi.

460
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,830
Every year on this date,

461
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,920
colorful lanterns

462
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,960
would be hung

463
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,280
all over Yanyu Street in the south of the city.

464
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,710
The colorful lanterns look splendid.

465
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:32,870
Your Highness.

466
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,110
If you have time tonight,

467
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,920
make sure that you go take a look.

468
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,200
Sure, I will.

469
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,470
Sir.

470
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,830
This, this,

471
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,990
and this one.

472
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,470
I will have all of them.

473
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,200
Miss, isn't it too many?

474
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,870
No, not at all.

475
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,750
I will buy all of them.

476
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,800
Sure.

477
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,560
This one.

478
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,840
I will claim the money

479
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,990
from that jerk later

480
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,030
to piss him off.

481
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,750
Ruoyi.

482
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,030
Please pack all of them.

483
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,470
Miss Sikong.

484
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,680
You have underestimated me though.

485
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,160
I wouldn't get pissed off

486
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,680
even if you buy all of them.

487
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,710
Well, I will buy the entire store

488
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,880
and send it to Snowfall Villa.

489
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,750
Sure.

490
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,310
Do what she said.

491
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,790
Sure thing.

492
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,790
Are you really Xiao Se?

493
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,510
Lei Wujie,

494
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,310
did you pretend to be him?

495
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Just tell me.

496
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,840
Do you want it or not?

497
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,880
So you're a bossy prince now.

498
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,070
I'm just joking.

499
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,270
I will take this one.

500
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,440
It's a gift for you.

501
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,070
Hanghao?

502
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,920
It's said that this is the mascot of Tianqi

503
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,880
that protects one from danger.

504
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,990
You must keep it with you.

505
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,790
Sure.

506
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,600
Sir.

507
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,270
I will have this.

508
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,440
I thought

509
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,070
you were attending a feast in the palace tonight.

510
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,230
The feast

511
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
didn't take much time.

512
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
Do you like the lantern festival?

513
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,710
Sometimes, I like coming here,

514
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,310
but sometimes, I don't.

515
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,880
You sound mysterious again.

516
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,070
You always claim

517
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,640
that Tianqi is a huge city

518
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,750
which is fun

519
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
and prosperous.

520
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,440
But ever since I have come here,

521
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,440
I could only spend time with my spear.

522
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,030
Tonight

523
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,470
is my first time

524
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,230
hanging out on the street here.

525
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,920
I'm sorry.

526
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,790
From now on,

527
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,680
you should take me out more often,

528
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,360
all right?

529
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,600
Is there anything fun

530
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,070
in Tianqi?

531
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,840
There is Mount Wuwang in the suburbs

532
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,200
with magnificent scenery.

533
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,400
Xulan Street at the night market,

534
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
you can find a lot of delicious food over there.

535
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,990
If you fancy a snifter,

536
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:27,920
you may visit Diaoluo Parlor...

537
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,840
All right.

538
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,120
Tomorrow,

539
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,470
list out all the places

540
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,710
and bring me to one place

541
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,600
every day.

542
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,030
Sure, Young Lady.

543
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,270
Good boy.

544
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,270
I didn't know

545
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,400
there would be

546
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,960
such an atmospheric street in Tianqi.

547
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,230
In this Lantern Festival,

548
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,400
talented gentlemen,

549
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,790
nonchalant swordsmen,

550
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,120
and unparalleled beauties

551
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,880
have all gathered here.

552
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,920
Xiao Se would be the gentleman,

553
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,510
I'm the swordsman,

554
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,120
while Qianluo and you

555
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,270
are unparalleled beauties.

556
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,790
You're right.

557
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,230
It seems your visit to Full Bloom Parlor

558
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,440
has turned you into a smooth talker.

559
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,920
Miss Ruoyi.

560
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,030
I shouldn't have lied to you.

561
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,270
But please quit saying that.

562
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,470
Lei Wujie.

563
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,070
Your task in Tianqi City

564
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,510
is almost done, right?

565
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,550
I think so.

566
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,200
The case of Langya Mutiny is put right

567
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,200
and things Xiao Se has planned to do

568
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,920
are already done.

569
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,400
I can't possibly

570
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,510
keep staying in Tianqi.

571
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,550
Then,

572
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,160
where do you plan to go?

573
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,840
Going back to Lei Fortress

574
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,120
or Xueyue City?

575
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,710
No.

576
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,360
I want to begin

577
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,710
a real adventure this time.

578
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,660
I haven't been to those places

579
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,770
mentioned in the book.

580
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,140
For instance, Jiuxiao City

581
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,290
where the best swordsman,

582
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,090
Poetic Sword Deity, stayed a century ago.

583
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,290
Also, Muliang City

584
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,570
where Lone Sword Deity used to live alone.

585
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,180
Chaisang City, the biggest city in the southwest

586
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,860
and the world's first academy,

587
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,330
Shili Langdang of Qiantang.

588
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,900
I must visit all of them.

589
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,700
Can I tag along?

590
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,010
Previously, I had to stay at home

591
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,330
due to my poor health.

592
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,290
Before I met you,

593
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,620
I have only been to Tianqi

594
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,770
and Xueyue City.

595
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,490
Now that I'm in tip-top shape

596
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,980
and I can travel around.

597
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,290
Honestly, I have dreamed of roaming the world

598
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,090
like a swordsman too.

599
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,730
Why don't we go to Sword Heart Tomb

600
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,090
to ask for a sword?

601
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,620
Sure, of course.

602
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,620
Silly chap.

603
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,180
Qianluo.

604
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,220
You had asked me a question before.

605
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,730
What was it?

606
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,090
You asked,

607
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,050
after everything is settled,

608
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,220
where will I...

609
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,980
Look!

610
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,730
It's beautiful.

611
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,330
This is so beautiful.

612
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:50,980
Look.

613
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,660
Over there.

614
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,810
This is so beautiful.

615
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:54,700
This is so beautiful.

616
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,860
Let's enjoy the firework first.

617
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,900
We may talk about it later.

618
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,660
You're deliberately mystifying things again.

619
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,330
There are more fireworks.

620
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,380
Look.

621
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,050
Over there.

622
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,420
This is astonishing.

623
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,050
There are fireworks displays

624
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,290
at Xueyue City every year too.

625
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
However, it can never be compared

626
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,380
with this magnificent scene tonight here.

627
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,900
Indeed, it's mesmerizing.

628
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,250
It would be great

629
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,620
to have such a wonderful scene

630
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
every day here.

631
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,180
Tianqi City

632
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,660
claimed to be

633
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,810
the most beautiful city

634
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,610
where the strongest liquor, the fastest steed,

635
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,180
the prettiest women,

636
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,050
and the most talented youths

637
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,660
to be found here.

638
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,460
It's a place where carefree swordsmen

639
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,700
see their bright future

640
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,050
and poor scholars

641
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,420
find their career.

642
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,050
Nevertheless,

643
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,140
it's also the worst city.

644
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,290
Underneath the glitz and glamour,

645
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,090
this place is shrouded with conspiracy.

646
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,860
Xiao Se once said something about this.

647
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,460
He said

648
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,330
if you are a simple person,

649
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,940
you can see the most beautiful side

650
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,700
of this city.

651
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,460
I doubt

652
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,250
that he said this.

653
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,620
You know what,

654
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,090
back then, Xiao Se

655
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,770
was just like Lei Wujie.

656
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,010
I

657
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,420
looked nothing like this silly chap.

658
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,050
Despite all the appealing sides,

659
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,700
it is

660
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,810
merely a city.

661
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,980
Exactly.

662
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,380
Despite all the appealing sides,

663
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,810
it is merely a city and nothing more.

664
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,330
Let's solve all the problems here

665
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,570
as soon as possible.

666
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,770
I'm returning to the martial arts world.

667
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,330
Why?

668
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,490
Needless to say, I'm going
to cultivate my swordsmanship

669
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,140
and become a sword deity.

670
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,570
If so,

671
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,620
let's go to Jiuxiao City.

672
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,380
The place where Poetic Sword Deity once dwelled.

673
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:43,810
It's now

674
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,730
the only place that deserves

675
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,860
to be called the City of Sword in Beili.

676
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,860
Jiuxiao City.

677
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,420
Qianluo.

678
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,420
Let's launch the boat lantern.

679
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,900
Can I join you too?

680
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,250
No, you can't.

681
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,180
It's a secret

682
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,330
between girls.

683
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,330
I want to go too.

684
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,090
Let's go.

685
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,860
I'm off.

686
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,330
Lei Wujie.

687
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,090
We should move now.

688
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,090
Just leave it here.

689
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,860
Sir, two boat lanterns, please.

690
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:24,660
Sure thing.

691
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:27,940
Thank you.

692
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:29,700
Qianluo.

693
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,940
This is the boat lantern.

694
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,010
Legend has it that if you write the name

695
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,250
of someone you like on the lantern,

696
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,290
it will encounter

697
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,250
with that person's lantern

698
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,090
if he or she launches one too.

699
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,730
Here you go, miss.

700
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:40,810
Please write

701
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,810
your beloved one's name on it.

702
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,850
[Lei]

703
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,170
[Xiao Se]

704
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,380
I forgot to tell you

705
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,420
not to write his full name.

706
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,980
Has Lord Chi left his residence?

707
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,700
Yes, he's heading south.

708
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,090
Disciples of Baixiao Sect

709
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,220
will take action soon.

710
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,730
Let's put everything

711
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,250
to an end tonight.

712
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,140
(I heard that many lantern festivals will be held)

713
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,730
in Tianqi every year.

714
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,050
I wonder

715
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,700
if you can take me there.

716
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,660
I'm willing to

717
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,420
if there is a chance.

718
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,460
Do you know what it means

719
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,250
when you made that promise to a woman?

720
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,940
Have you

721
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,860
fallen in love with me too?

722
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:09,980
Miss Rui.

723
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
We are on a mission now.

724
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,220
Our enemies might show up anytime.

725
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,460
Please stay focused.

726
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,700
And stop making

727
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,770
ridiculous jokes.

728
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,660
Ridiculous?

729
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,980
Jokes?

730
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:22,980
Mr. Lian.

731
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,330
Do you know

732
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,290
that many men in Belle's Manor

733
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,810
want to share this joke with me?

734
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,420
What a killjoy.

735
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,460
After you complete the mission,

736
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,980
you're returning to Xueyue City

737
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,860
and I'm going back to Belle's Manor.

738
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,770
I doubt

739
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,380
we can meet again.

740
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,290
Yet, all you think about is only the task.

741
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,090
I must accomplish

742
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,140
the task entrusted to me by my master.

743
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:48,620
Miss Rui.

744
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,730
I will surely entertain you

745
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,770
when you come to Xueyue City.

746
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,420
The lantern festival in Xueyue City

747
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,490
might not be as splendid as in Tianqi,

748
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,220
however, you will enjoy

749
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,050
the Flora Spectacle very much.

750
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,620
Silly.

751
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,730
I'm a spy

752
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,050
sent from Xueyue City.

753
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,810
My identity will be exposed

754
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,570
if I go back.

755
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,330
Back then, Third Lord City saved my life.

756
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,570
I joined Xueyue City to repay his kindness.

757
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,700
I once asked him

758
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,330
when I could renounce

759
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,420
this identity

760
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,660
and blend in with the people

761
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,420
without hiding.

762
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,420
He said...

763
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,290
What did he say?

764
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,570
When I meet

765
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,620
someone I like

766
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,530
and the man also treats me sincerely,

767
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,770
the moment we tie the knot

768
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:36,980
is when

769
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,250
I'm set free.

770
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,140
Mr. Lian, you said

771
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,900
you would show me around Xueyue City,

772
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,730
did you mean...

773
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,180
I'm sorry.

774
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,620
[Xiao Yu has left for the south of the city]

775
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,250
Longxie.

776
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,220
Are we almost there?

777
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,900
Your Highness.

778
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:26,940
Almost there.

779
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,770
To not attract attention,

780
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:29,810
they chose

781
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,810
somewhere less obvious to meet up.

782
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,380
Ao Yu

783
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,490
is always arrogant.

784
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,180
I didn't expect this from him.

785
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,460
Your Highness.

786
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,810
Someone stops us on the road.

787
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
Crap! We're outfoxed.

788
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,490
To my surprise,

789
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,660
someone dares to assassinate a prince in public.

790
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,380
It's the men sent by Lord Yong'an, I suppose.

791
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,460
Lord Chi

792
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,010
needs your help right now.

793
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,220
Otherwise, he will be in danger.

794
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,700
Lord Yong'an?

795
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,530
I seem to have

796
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,380
walked into the trap you set up.

797
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,730
You lured me here

798
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,220
to kill me.

799
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,220
My eldest martial brother was killed
because of you.

800
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,050
Lei Qianhu, the Fort Leader of Lei Fortress, died

801
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:39,900
because of you.

802
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,330
Zhao Yuzhen, Tao Sword Deity died

803
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,530
because of you too.

804
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,330
So, you must die.

805
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,460
I will end your life.

806
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,810
Just you alone?

807
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,290
I know you are a hard nut to crack.

808
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,010
So, I didn't come here alone.

809
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,380
Muyu.

810
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,330
The two of you joined hands?

811
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,770
Leader.

812
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,810
Please stop doing the wrong thing.

813
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,050
I never want to

814
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,250
confront you.

815
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,860
The moment

816
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,010
you made the decision,

817
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,210
you should know

818
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,180
that we will

819
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,420
turn against each other one day.

820
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,770
We are people

821
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,860
who live in darkness.

822
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,290
I thought you wouldn't mind that.

823
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:25,980
You said

824
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,770
that although we act in darkness,

825
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,180
you will lead us into the light.

826
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,250
But what I saw is

827
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,140
that you sacrificed the lives

828
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,140
of the clan

829
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,660
for the sake of your greed.

830
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,460
Well.

831
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,220
If so,

832
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,570
you can walk your own path,

833
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,860
and I walk on my own.

834
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:35,980
I can tell

835
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,380
that you have regained your power

836
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,940
and have improved quite a lot

837
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,980
after the duel in Lei Fortress.

838
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,900
It's enough to eliminate you.

839
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,010
Infinite Sword from Zhao Yuzhen.

840
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,460
I'm Li Fansong,

841
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,810
the disciple of Zhao Yuzhen.

842
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,330
I'm here to avenge my master.

843
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,180
You shall meet your end now.

844
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,700
And me, Feixuan of Mount Wangcheng.

845
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,900
You shall meet your end now.

846
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,290
Xiao Se.

847
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,570
Go ahead.

848
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,700
Just leave it to us.

849
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,380
I'm counting on you.

850
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,490
It's Zhao Yuzhen's Taiyi Lion Secret Arts.

851
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,490
Charge.

852
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,620
Charge.

853
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,900
Qianluo.

854
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,220
There's no sign of them.

855
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,660
Maybe they have

856
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:11,700
returned to Snowfall Villa?

857
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,380
Let's go back and check it out.

858
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,330
No way.

859
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,700
They wouldn't just leave

860
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,220
without informing us.

861
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,700
I know now.

862
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,140
Perhaps they go to rescue Wuxin.

863
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,980
Why would you say so?

864
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,330
They've been acting weird

865
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,330
these days.

866
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,090
And now, they just disappeared out of a sudden.

867
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,140
I guess they must have gone to rescue Wuxin.

868
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,490
But they didn't take me along.

869
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,490
Is it because they don't think I can be of help?

870
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:36,860
Qianluo.

871
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,330
You're the first disciple

872
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,490
amongst all in this generation

873
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,460
of Xueyue City

874
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,530
to reach the Insouciant Phase.

875
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,010
How could you not be helpful?

876
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,180
Even if they did

877
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,290
go to rescue Wuxin without you,

878
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,810
that'd be because they don't wish you
to be in danger.

879
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,940
Not to mention

880
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,380
that this is only a guess.

881
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,330
Isn't that Xiao Se's second brother?

882
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,220
Your Highness.

883
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,050
It's already started.

884
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,810
What has happened?

885
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,380
A fight broke out in Lord Chi's Residence.

886
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,940
Chuhe is there too.

887
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:27,820
Yueji.

888
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,340
You have become a drugged tester too.

889
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,380
I will take you out later.

890
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,050
Wuxin.

891
00:34:59,090 --> 00:34:59,650
Wuxin.

892
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,490
Can you hear me?

893
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,340
I'm Xiao Se.

894
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,130
I'm here to save you.

895
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,780
Eat this and you will be fine.

896
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,460
You want to

897
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,170
avenge your master,

898
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,740
however, concerning your strength,

899
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,740
you can barely touch me.

900
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,210
Come on, Feixuan.

901
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,900
Supreme Dragon Elephant Skill!

902
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,260
This can't be true.

903
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,980
None of the needles

904
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,860
could hurt him?

905
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,730
No.

906
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,210
There is one.

907
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,650
I asked Tang Lianyue of the Tang Clan

908
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,500
to give me this

909
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,170
before I came to Tianqi.

910
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,420
It's your retribution

911
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,860
to be killed

912
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,900
by the Pear Blossom Needle Cloudburst.

913
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,460
No!

914
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:22,650
We can't let him get rid

915
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,860
of the Pear Blossom Needle Cloudburst.

916
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
Changhe.

917
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,780
Muyu.

918
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,210
Am I wrong?

919
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,170
There's no absolute right or wrong in this world.

920
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,820
It's just

921
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,380
that we are protecting different things.

922
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,900
Someone wants to protect the world,

923
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,420
but as for me,

924
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,730
I want to protect the members of Dark River.

925
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,900
Fine then.

926
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,570
Please

927
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,300
send me to my demise.

928
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,820
In the extreme land of inferno,

929
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,780
light can be seen.

930
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,730
When cloud and fog dissipated,

931
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,900
the moon becomes visible.

932
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:54,980
Wuxin.

933
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,130
Wuxin.

934
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:04,650
Are you insane?

935
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,820
I'm going to rip your lips off.

936
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,340
(There is no Young Head)

937
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,130
(of Tianwaitian here)

938
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,570
(nor Xiao Chuhe.)

939
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,650
(I'm just Wuxin from Hanshui Temple.)

940
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,050
(What's wrong with him?)

941
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,090
(He shouldn't)

942
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,340
(possess consciousness now.)

943
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,940
♪How pitiful of mortals
as they have to go through all the hardships♪

944
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,500
Wuxin.

945
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,500
♪Benevolence exists everywhere
and compassion presents in silence♪

946
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,340
♪Affection emerges and perishes

947
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:26,980
Wake up.

948
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,980
You're Wuxin.

949
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,130
Wuxin, if you intend to stay,

950
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:32,860
I will help you.

951
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,690
You're Ye Anshi of Tianwaitian,

952
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,170
my best friend.

953
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,170
You shouldn't be in this place

954
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,210

955
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,020

(isn't yours alone.)

958
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,380
(But ours too.)

959
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,610
We will embark on this journey with you.

♪No wish left unfulfilled
and no regret left unsettled♪

961
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,860
Xiao Chuhe.

962
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,380
I knew it was you.

963
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,090
Trying to distract me?

964
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,300
Never think that you can leave here alive.

965
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,250
Kill him.

966
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,540
Why are you here?

967
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,140
Why didn't you ask me to come?

968
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:35,950
I...

969
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,140
It's great that you're all here.

970
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,180
All of you can meet your end here.

971
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,060
Yu.

972
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,830
Do you really want to hurt your siblings?

973
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:44,910
This is hilarious.

974
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,660
He stormed into my place.

975
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,810
You, on the other hand,

976
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,020
seem

977
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,350
to have taken

978
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,870
Xiao Chuhe's side now.

979
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,830
Previously, he saved my life

980
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,100
in my residence.

981
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,350
So today, I will save him

982
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,180
in your residence.

983
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,790
My sword skill may not be that ferocious,

984
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,750
but it would still

985
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,700
cause quite a scene here.

986
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,180
Are you sure you can bear the consequence

987
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,620
of killing two princes in your residence?

988
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,350
If yes,

989
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,060
your men can do it now.

990
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,470
You're threatening me.

991
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,500
Chuhe.

992
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,990
Let's go.

993
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,800
[Snowfall Villa]

994
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,220
He's fine.

995
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,500
It's just some small injuries.

996
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,870
What a relief.

997
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,390
Where is Miss Sikong?

998
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,430
It's rare to not see her around.

999
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,350
Don't mention it.

1000
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,220
She went straight to her room
after returning yesterday.

1001
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,350
Probably she was sulking all night.

1002
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,580
No, I'm not sulking.

1003
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,470
I will express my anger.

1004
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,470
Xiao Se, what were you thinking?

1005
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,990
We witnessed how powerful Wuxin is

1006
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,470
when we were at Lord Bai's Residence

1007
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,620
that day.

1008
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,100
Yet you sneaked into
Lord Chi's Residence yesterday.

1009
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,140
You can't possibly beat him.

1010
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,300
I was so close.

1011
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,730
Don't make it sound like

1012
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,500
I can't do anything right.

1013
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,980
Do you know why you fail

1014
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,820
at the last step?

1015
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,050
Why?

1016
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,020
I'm the last step to success.

1017
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,050
You only sent Baixiao Sect

1018
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:35,940
to intercept Lord Chi.

1019
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:36,780
That's not enough.

1020
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,050
Therefore, he came back way earlier

1021
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,130
than you expected.

1022
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,820
Had you sent me,

1023
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:43,940
they wouldn't have

1024
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,380
