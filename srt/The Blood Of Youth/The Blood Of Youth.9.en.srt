[Episode 9]

25
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,420
This is called Beautiful Day!

26
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,940
Look! So many flowers.

27
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,020
Look at all the petals!

28
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,540
They're so beautiful!

29
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,020
-How beautiful.
-You're right.

30
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,940
One strike from the Sword Deity

31
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,580
lasts forever.

32
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,940
We still can't beat her.

33
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,340
That's Xueyue Sword Deity we're talking about.

34
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,660
How can we beat her?

35
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,220
It'd be weird if we did.

36
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,540
What's the name of this sword?

37
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,420
Xueyue Sword Deity,

38
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,660
I carved

39
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,860
this sword from peach wood.

40
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,420
I haven't named it yet.

41
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,100
Why don't you name it for me, Sword Deity?

42
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,420
I can't be bothered to name it.

43
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,940
Why did you come to see me?

44
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,700
My master talked a lot

45
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,660
about Xueyue Sword Deity.

46
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,140
So I was fascinated.

47
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,380
I descended the mountain under Master's order.

48
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,380
So...

49
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,620
So I wanted to meet you so much.

50
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,220
So you've seen me.

51
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,860
Yes, I've finally met you.

52
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,260
As expected from Xueyue Sword Deity.

53
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,940
Since you've already met me,

54
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,700
why aren't you leaving now?

55
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,860
Martial Uncle!

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,300
Lift!

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,180
That's the Supreme Dragon Elephant Skill.

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,300
Greetings, Third City Lord.

60
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,620
Feixuan of Mount Wangcheng.

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,860
Greetings, Third City Lord.

62
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,620
Since you've already met

63
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,420
the person you want,

64
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,820
you can leave now.

65
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,140
Let's go.

66
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,780
Mount Wangcheng did a great job

67
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,140
in dividing its teaching of martial arts skills
and the way of heaven

68
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,020
for this generation.

69
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,940
It looks like Mount Wangcheng

70
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,060
will snatch half of the martial world

71
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,940
from Xueyue City.

72
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,580
I don't care.

73
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:28,980
What about you?

74
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,260
Why did you want to see me?

75
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,580
Watch closely.
Things will get interesting from here.

76
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,660
I, Lei Wujie,

77
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,180
greet Xueyue Sword Deity.

78
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,220
I earnestly invite Xueyue Sword Deity

79
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,100
to travel to Lei Fortress

80
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,700
to see my master.

81
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,380
Third Master,

82
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
is this what you mean by interesting?

83
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,980
(Don't tell me)

84
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,540
(this lad doesn't know)

85
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,380
(Hanyi's identity.)

86
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,020
(I can't believe Lei Hong)

87
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,980
(didn't tell him anything.)

88
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,580
Lei Hong?

89
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,220
He wants to see me?

90
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,460
Master once told me

91
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,220
he practiced swordsmanship

92
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,580
because he had witnessed

93
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,580
your sword technique.

94
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,460
Since then, he talks

95
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,140
about it frequently.

96
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,980
He hopes he can meet you again.

97
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,580
At present,

98
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,340
my master is being hindered.

99
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,660
So he can't leave the Lei family.

100
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,100
If I, Lei Wujie, may be bold

101
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,780
to earnestly invite Xueyue Sword Deity

102
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,580
to travel to Lei Fortress

103
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,100
to see my master.

104
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,700
Sure.

105
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,540
I'll go with you.

106
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,140
But with one condition.

107
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,020
I can't be bothered to name it.

108
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,380
Sword Deity, please don't break it!

109

[Dengtian Tower]

110
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,020
It's easy.

111
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,100
I want you to be my disciple.

112
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,460
When you manage to block my move three times

113
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,580
and take back this Shabu,

114
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,580
I'll follow you back and meet Lei Hong.

115
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,220
Are you rejecting me?

116
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,420
Your skills are extraordinary,

117
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,500
which I've long been fascinated by.

118
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:17,860
But

119
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
this is a serious matter.

120
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,420
I still need to notify my master about this.

121
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,260
Are you saying we must first meet Lei Hong

122
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,940
before acknowledging me as your master?

123
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,340
Do you know what this is called?

124
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,740
Getting something for nothing.

125
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,140
Lei Wujie,

126
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,540
being the disciple of the Sword Deity

127
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,180
isn't anything you can ask.

128
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,460
Stop hesitating already.

129
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,900
I, Lei Wujie,

130
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,980
pay my respects to my master, Xueyue Sword Deity.

131
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,820
If Master Lei Hong rebukes me in the future,

132
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,340
I shall die

133
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,500
as gratitude for your teachings.

134
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,900
What a fool.

135
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,900
Come and see me behind the mountain tomorrow.

136
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,780
Life is unpredictable

137
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,220
like travelers who come and go in a hurry.

138
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,180
You talk too much.

139
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,780
We've made a deal.

140
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,500
Nothing shall prevent me from fulfilling it!

141
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,820
Lei Wujie,

142
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,020
get up.

143
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,980
Lei Wujie,

144
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,380
don't faint.

145
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,660
You haven't paid up.

146
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,220
Lei Wujie.

147
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,180
He has exhausted himself in this fight.

148
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,660
He's worn out now.

149
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,700
I can't say anything since you put it that way.

150
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,140
So you're now officially

151
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,220
his martial brother.

152
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,700
Your younger martial brother
owes me 800 silver taels.

153
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,180
As his martial brother,

154
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,380
maybe you can help him pay off the debt.

155
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,700
So I can return to Snowfall Villa.

156
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,020
I have no money.

157
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,060
Then who has money?

158
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,740
Come with me.

159
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,460
That's right.

160
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,620
I'm responsible

161
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,980
for all expenditures

162
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,940
in Xueyue City.

163
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,740
The problem is solved, then.

164
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,780
It's 800 silver taels.

165
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,300
Tang Lian said

166
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,940
you're Xiao Se.

167
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,860
So what?

168
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,660
It's a good name.

169
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,900
Stop flattering me.

170
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,020
Just pay up.

171
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,780
I need to continue my journey.

172
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,220
Xiao Se, you...

173
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,060
Of course, a debt must be paid.

174
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,540
But I'd like to invite you

175
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,380
to stay in Xueyue City for several days.

176
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,180
I do have some questions

177
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,500
that I need to ask you.

178
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,460
What if I refuse?

179
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,820
Are you going to force me to stay?

180
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,420
Of course not.

181
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,940
I have a selfish reason

182
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,180
for wanting you to stay.

183
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,540
What reason?

184
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,420
I, Changfeng,

185
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,500
would like to take you as my disciple.

186
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,740
Father, what are you saying?

187
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,260
I, Changfeng,

188
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,290
would like

189
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,700
to take you as my disciple.

190
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,900
You want to take me as your disciple.

191
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,140
Why should I agree?

192
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,740
My martial arts skills

193
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,580
in the martial arts world

194
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,220
are considered decent.

195
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,780
I don't even practice martial arts.

196
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,340
Other than martial arts,
my skill in playing weiqi

197
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,060
is unparalleled in the world.

198
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,420
So do you

199
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,740
like playing weiqi?

200
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,460
I can't say that I like it.

201
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,820
But I've never lost.

202
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,780
Great.

203
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,020
How about we play one round?

204
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,620
If you win,

205
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,300
I won't force you.

206
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,540
What do you say?

207
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,580
Xueyue City, huh?

208
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,580
So is this how

209
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,180
you tricked Fairy Luoxia into staying here?

210
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,060
Well, a bet is a bet.

211
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,540
How is it a trick? Shall we begin?

212
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,780
Weiqi is a game of trickery,

213
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,700
not of the right path.

214
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,300
I didn't expect the dignified Third City Lord

215
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,260
to be so immersed in such trickeries.

216
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,500
If the four cities are the pawns

217
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,260
and the world is the board,

218
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,860
is it regarded as the right path?

219
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,700
Third City Lord, you're sure ambitious.

220
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,300
But I don't have such ambition.

221
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,020
In my opinion,

222
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,380
any plot can't be compared to money.

223
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,380
You don't have such ambition,

224
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,020
but you want money.

225
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,740
That I don't understand.

226
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,860
Of course I have uses for it.

227
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,500
Forget it if you don't want to pay.

228
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,340
How about this?

229
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,220
If you accept me as your master,

230
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,380
I'll let you

231
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,780
manage the finance of Xueyue City.

232
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,260
What do you think?

233
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,500
Third City Lord, is it worth it

234
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,020
for you to do this?

235
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,260
This is Xueyue City's choice.

236
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,540
Monthly salary.

237
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,540
It'll be 800 silver taels.

238
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,860
Not enough.

239
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,140
How much do you want?

240
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,020
A total of eight million silver taels.

241
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,100
You can pay me after I leave the city.

242
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,620
Did you say eight million silver taels?

243
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,980
Why don't you just say

244
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,140
you want to be the City Lord?

245
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,380
It's a deal.

246
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,980
Since you don't want to stay,

247
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,780
the four cities as the pawns

248
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,260
with the world as the board

249
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,140
has been laid out.

250
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,380
Every one of us here is its pawn.

251
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,220
You and I are no exception.

252
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,260
That's what you think.

253
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,340
[Tianwaitian]

254
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,500
(The plum blossoms in Huaxue Villa)

255
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,860
(always wither)

256
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
(in a moment.)

257
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,860
(Often at this time,)

258
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,380
(the snow flurries.)

259
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,580
(When Father was still alive,)

260
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,620
(he would wait to view)

261
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,180
(this beautiful withering scenery.)

262
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,780
He called such scenery the death of snow.

263
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,980
He thought when the plum blossoms withered,

264
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,900
the snow would also die with them.

265
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,060
I've waited so long

266
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,300
to witness this death of snow.

267
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,260
Yet, you cut them off

268
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,500
with your blade.

269
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,620
Take her away.

270
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,780
Once she wakes up,

271
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,420
she'll forget what happened.

272
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,060
Since the 12 Lin Blades

273
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,220
have been "broken",

274
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,700
I'll leave the rest

275
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,940
for all of you to handle.

276
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,500
Sir,

277
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,290
we received

278
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,500
some news

279
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,220
about your friends just now.

280
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,300
How are they doing?

281
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,900
After Tang Lian left Yushi,

282
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,340
he returned to the Tang Clan

283
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,020
to meet his master of the Tang Clan,

284
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,900
Tang Lianyue.

285
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,660
Xiao Se and Lei Wujie

286
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,980
spent three months

287
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,410
wandering in detours

288
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,980
before reaching Xueyue City.

289
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,500
Lei Wujie went to Dengtian Tower

290
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,740
and reached the top.

291
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,180
He and the disciple
of Zhao Yuzhen the Tao Sword Deity

292
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,300
challenged Xueyue Sword Deity,

293
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,380
Li Hanyi, at the same time.

294
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,380
He lost

295
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,140
after Li Hanyi's one strike,

296
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,540
but Li Hanyi

297
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,620
took him

298
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,860
as her first disciple.

299
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,020
This lad

300
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,980
sure has the good luck

301
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,180
to be accepted as Xueyue Sword Deity's disciple.

302
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,380
But I heard

303
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,740
his other master, Lei Hong,

304
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,300
and Li Hanyi

305
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,260
go way back.

306
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,860
What about the other one?

307
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,020
The stingy innkeeper.

308
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,300
Did he return to his Snowfall Villa?

309
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,100
Xiao Se also stays in Xueyue City.

310
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,420
Also, he became

311
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,940
a disciple of the Spear Deity, Sikong Changfeng.

312
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,140
I thought

313
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,380
it'd be Liquor Deity, Baili Dongjun.

314
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,420
I'm sure

315
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,500
my friends

316
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,820
will be famous in the martial arts world soon.

317
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,100
I can't wait

318
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,140
for us to meet again.

319
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,740
Xiao Se.

320
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,300
You're finally up?

321
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,580
How long did I sleep?

322
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,100
One day and one night.

323
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,580
That long?

324
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,020
Then, are you waiting for me

325
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,820
to bid farewell to me?

326
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,420
Do you really want me to go that bad?

327
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,900
Are you trying to run from your debt

328
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,900
after knowing you can't afford

329
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,020
to pay me the 800 silver taels?

330
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,220
No.

331
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,860
Then...

332
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,740
I'll go and ask for the money
from my eldest martial brother.

333
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,620
Go.

334
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,020
Wait here.

335
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,020
Don't ask me.

336
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,050
Third Master already gave him money.

337
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,020
Don't let him fool you.

338
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,980
Eldest Martial Brother.

339
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,340
It's finally justifiable

340
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,900
to address me that now.

341
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,340
Oh, let me introduce someone to you.

342
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,100
The one sitting next to you

343
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,610
is your third martial brother.

344
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,180
Third martial brother?

345
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,140
After you paid respect
to Second Master as your master,

346
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,540
Xiao Se

347
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,700
was also taken in as a disciple by Third Master.

348
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,900
Everyone in Xueyue City

349
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,100
may be martial brothers.

350
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,820
But we're the only three disciples

351
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,380
of the three city lords.

352
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,780
No matter

353
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,580
who joined as a disciple first

354
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,820
or the masters' seniority,

355
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,180
that's how it should be arranged.

356
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,380
Am I right,

357
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,420
Third Martial Brother?

358
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,940
I'm surprised

359
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,380
that I'll be in the same sect

360
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,540
as Xiao Se.

361
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,620
I thought

362
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,980
I'd feel sad

363
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,180
to part ways with you

364
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,380
since we've gotten along really well.

365
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,500
It's all good now.

366
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,540
We can always be together now.

367
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,740
Who wants to be with you?

368
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,660
Get lost.

369
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,460
Lei, you sure have the enthusiasm
of a young man.

370
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,020
Listen to me.

371
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,140
The three of us

372
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
should journey the martial arts world

373
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,580
just like what the three city lords did

374
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,740
when they were young.

375
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,100
We should impress the world too.

376
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,500
That's not a bad idea.

377
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,860
Lei Wujie,

378
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,660
Li Hanyi told you

379
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,780
to meet her the next day.

380
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,260
But it looks like

381
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,140
it's going to get dark soon.

382
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,860
The dignified Second City Lord

383
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,500
always keeps her word.

384
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,620
If you're late,

385
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,860
I guess what you said
about nothing that can stop you from going

386
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,380
won't count anymore.

387
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,660
Farewell!

388
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
What an airhead.

389
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,620
Isn't that what a young man

390
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,340
of his age is like?

391
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,260
He'd go all the way forward

392
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,820
and care about nothing else.

393
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,260
That's why I called him an airhead.

394
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,020
Is it really

395
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
because of the 800 silver taels

396
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,940
that made you stay in Xueyue City?

397
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,260
No,

398
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,460
it's eight million silver taels.

399
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,220
Xiao Se,

400
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,740
I do have one question to ask you.

401
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,020
When Master Lianyue

402
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,700
sent me to Xueyue City that year,

403
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,660
he told me to wait for someone
on behalf of the Tang Clan.

404
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,180
Is this person

405
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,540
you?

406
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,260
Of course not.

407
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,660
You answered without thinking.

408
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,260
You're pretty

409
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,260
strange.

410
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,540
Even if you want to wait,

411
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,460
you should be waiting

412
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,500
for a beautiful woman.

413
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,980
Why would you wait

414
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,580
for a man like me?

415
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,860
You look like

416
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,300
you've experienced the world.

417
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,500
But you're not that old.

418
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,260
You're just several years old

419
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,060
than Lei Wujie, right?

420
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,340
Why do you care?

421
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,780
I don't care.

422
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,100
But someone does.

423
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,300
Well said.

424
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,460
Third Master.

425
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,500
It looks like

426
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,060
I have a lot of guests
in this small courtyard today.

427
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:14,820
Xiao Se,

428
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,020
why aren't you greeting

429
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,180
Third Master?

430
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,260
It's all right.

431
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,740
I wanted to accept you as my disciple,

432
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,020
but you never agreed to it.

433
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,340
Tang Lian, Qianluo,

434
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,740
please wait outside.

435
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,460
I have something important

436
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,900
to discuss with Xiao.

437
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,340
-Yes, Father.
-Yes, Third Master.

438
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,940
I noticed

439
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,980
you don't like me.

440
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,740
Why should I like you?

441
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,260
Is it

442
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,500
because you're the one and only Spear Deity?

443
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,540
Are you blaming me for that incident?

444
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,260
I don't blame you.

445
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,100
It's everyone's choice

446
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,180
to avoid what's unfavorable to them.

447
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,060
I'm just not like those

448
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,100
who think highly of you.

449
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,100
So what if you're the one and only Spear Deity?

450
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,700
You want to take me as your disciple?

451
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,500
You're still not qualified enough.

452
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,020
When your uncle was imprisoned,

453
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,060
I was already planning

454
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,460
to leave Xueyue City and head to Tianqi City

455
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
with my long spear.

456
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:32,940
But at the time,

457
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,980
I received a letter.

458
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,940
This letter

459
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,460
was written by your uncle himself.

460
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,220
What did my uncle write in the letter?

461
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,180
He wanted me

462
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,420
to stay in Xueyue City

463
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,060
no matter what happened next.

464
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,020
Are you sure it was written by my uncle?

465
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,380
I'm sure

466
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,300
you recognize your uncle's handwriting.

467
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,940
Nobody in the world can imitate

468
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,260
such beautiful penmanship.

469
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,820
I didn't intend to do as he said.

470
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,900
But back then,

471
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,620
he was known

472
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,780
as an official
who never miscalculated in his plans.

473
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,220
I thought this might be

474
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,620
a part of his plan.

475
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,140
If I had gone,

476
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,980
I might have ruined his plan.

477
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,180
But I didn't know

478
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,500
that he would end up dead.

479
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,660
No one would have expected this.

480
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,900
I really regretted it.

481
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,140
At that time,

482
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,660
I should've torn his letter into pieces

483
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
and rushed to Tianqi

484
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,060
to rescue him.

485
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,740
But today,

486
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,900
I'll never do anything

487
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,420
that would make me regret it anymore.

488
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,780
What are you doing?

489
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,500
Qianluo,

490
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,460
don't worry.

491
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,740
Third Master will not make things difficult

492
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,540
for Xiao Se.

493
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,460
So you weren't pretending.

494
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,460
Your martial arts skills are indeed crippled.

495
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,620
You should mind your own business.

496
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,580
I, Sikong Changfeng,

497
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,140
can be considered Medicine King

498
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,980
Xin Baicao's disciple.

499
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,740
In terms of medical skills,

500
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,740
I can at least rank

501
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,340
in the top five in the world.

502
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,340
So...

503
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,460
You can help?

504
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,580
You have poor blood circulation.

505
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,340
It'll bring serious consequences

506
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,860
to your hidden meridians.

507
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,540
What does that mean?

508
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,620
You should exercise more.

509
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,820
Father,

510
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,420
you didn't beat him up, right?

511
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,540
Well, what do you think?

512
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,660
Qianluo,

513
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,100
didn't you say you feel less passionate

514
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,020
because you have no opponent

515
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,420
to spar with you?

516
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,420
Father,

517
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,580
why are you talking about this out of a sudden?

518
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,180
Xiao Se's

519
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,460
qinggong skills are good.

520
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,700
If your spear can outrun him,

521
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,740
that means you've improved.

522
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,380
I've told him.

523
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,260
Next time,

524
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,660
both of you will practice together.

525
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,500
When did I

526
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,740
agree?

527
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,340
I shall follow your order, Father.

528
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,900
Master!

529
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,660
-Master!
-Stop.

530
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,380
Why are you so late?

531
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,860
I was too tired

532
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,140
and overslept.

533
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,980
Kneel!

534
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,100
You're truly a simpleton.

535
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,700
Why aren't you greeting me formally?

536
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,900
I, Lei Wujie, pay my respect to Master.

537
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,060
Why did I take in

538
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,260
such a disciple?

539
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:36,980
Get up.

540
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,860
Lei Wujie.

541
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,260
Yes, Master.

542
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,820
As a swordsman,

543
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,260
do you know

544
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,220
why you draw your sword?

545
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,220
Why I draw my sword?

546
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,060
Some people draw their swords

547
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,300
because they want to be heroes.

548
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,220
They want to use the power of their swords

549
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,860
to fight injustice in the world.

550
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,260
Some people draw their swords

551
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,980
because they are scared.

552
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,660
If they don't draw their swords,

553
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,580
others will draw their swords.

554
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,460
If they don't want to die,

555
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,420
they can only draw their swords.

556
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,140
So let me ask you this,

557
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,900
why do you draw your sword?

558
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,620
Master,

559
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,300
I've never thought about this.

560
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,020
Then why did you choose
to practice swordsmanship?

561
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
The other day, I saw my master

562
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,700
waving his sleeves

563
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,780
and soaring into the sky

564
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,740
with a fiery red long sword.

565
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,380
That red light

566
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,340
even made the clouds look red.

567
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,180
I've never seen

568
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,540
such profound swordsmanship in my life.

569
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,220
At that time, Master asked

570
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,380
if I wanted to learn it.

571
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,780
I didn't even hesitate

572
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,540
because I was amazed

573
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,820
by the beauty of the sword at that moment.

574
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,300
That's right.

575
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,620
The sword
is the most beautiful thing in the world.

576
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,340
If your master had not seen

577
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,140
the beauty of a sword,

578
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,980
he wouldn't have ended up

579
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,020
like this.

580
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,780
But you were talking
about practicing swordsmanship.

581
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,700
I'm asking about drawing your sword.

582
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,660
These are two different things.

583
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,860
You can romanticize swordsmanship.

584
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,340
But drawing the sword

585
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,700
can only mean life and death.

586
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,220
Life and death?

587
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,460
Yes,

588
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,100
life and death

589
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,300
in the martial arts world

590
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
are very simple things.

591
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,300
It seems people draw their swords

592
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,380
when they don't agree with each other.

593
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,500
When the sword slits their necks,

594
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,100
they'll just die.

595
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,540
But I don't approve

596
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,780
of such a martial arts world.

597
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,220
Winning and losing
in the martial arts world are common.

598
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,140
Is there a need to involve life and death?

599
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,220
So,

600
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,100
we can discuss the way of the sword,
not life and death

601
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,300
when we draw our swords.

602
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,540
You don't want to talk about life and death?

603
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,540
But what if others draw their swords

604
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,260
and want you to die,

605
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,900
are you going to die just like that?

606
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,060
Then I'll...

607
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,180
This sword is called Tingyu Sword.
(*listen to the rain)

608
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,460
It was forged by the Head of the Sword Heart Tomb.

609
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
It's one of the Elegant Four Swords.

610
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,700
I shall give it to you

611
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,340
as a gift for being my disciple.

612
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,940
Tingyu Sword?

613
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:32,940
Master,

614
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,420
something is wrong with this sword.

615
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,780
Tingyu Sword is a spiritual sword.

616
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,140
It recognizes its master.

617
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,540
You don't have the will to draw your sword.

618
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,220
That's why you can't draw it.

619
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,820
Tingyu Sword?

620
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,660
That was the first sword you got

621
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,220
when you first entered the world of martial arts.

622
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,340
It looks like you're pretty generous

623
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,540
with your disciple.

624
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
But no matter how I forced him

625
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,900
for the past few days,

626
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,940
he still couldn't draw that sword.

627
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,060
Do you really hope

628
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,380
he'll be able to draw the sword

629
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,340
when fighting with you?

630
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,300
If he draws his sword
in the face of life and death,

631
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,780
this will be the best way.

632
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,420
I'm just worried

633
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,460
that he doesn't draw his sword for himself

634
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,980
but for others.

635
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,460
Well, let's not talk about this anymore.

636
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,060
Are you revising medical skills lately?

637
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,340
Why are you looking at these meridian charts?

638
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,220
I also took in a disciple.

639
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
But his hidden meridians are damaged.

640
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,660
So he can't use his martial arts anymore.

641
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,500
It's that serious?

642
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,740
Yes.

643
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,540
I wrote a letter to Xie Xuan

644
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,380
to see

645
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,300
if he has a better solution.

646
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,580
That stupid scholar.

647
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,660
If he comes,

648
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,540
you must not

649
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,580
ask him to spar with you.

650
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,940
Your disciple can't draw the sword.

651
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,140
Instead of guiding him,

652
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,700
why did you let him descend the mountain?

653
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,420
I told him to go.

654
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,740
I want him to understand

655
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,660
the true meaning of drawing the sword.

656
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,260
Lei Wujie?

657
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,220
It's you, Martial Brother Luo Mingxuan.

658
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,580
You've been cultivating

659
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,460
with Second City Lord

660
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,820
in the mountain for ten days.

661
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,820
It was so hard to find you.

662
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,780
So when are you paying

663
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,580
the 300 silver taels you owe me?

664
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,220
Master.

665
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,820
Do you think a loser
has the right to ask for money?

666
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,100
Stop embarrassing me here.

667
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,340
Are you Lei Wujie?

668
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,540
[Yin Luoxia, Xueyue City]
I'm Yin Luoxia.

669
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,140
I've heard so much about you, Fairy Luoxia.

670
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,940
Why did you leave the mountain?

671
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,020
Where's your master?

672
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,140
My master went into seclusion to cultivate.

673
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,820
So she asked me to come back down here

674
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,980
and not disturb her.

675
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,780
Seclusion?

676
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,380
Don't tell me he's coming again.

677
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,260
What did you say?

678
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,220
Nothing.

679
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,140
Mingxuan,

680
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,820
why are you swaying back and forth?

681
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,060
Can't you stand still?

682
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,380
Tingyu Sword?

683
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,900
I didn't expect

684
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,460
your master would pass it down to you.

685
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,460
Do you know its origin?

686
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,300
Master said

687
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,100
this was the sword she used in her early years.

688
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,820
But I can't seem to draw it.

689
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,220
Do you know

690
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,420
the reason for drawing a sword?

691
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,660
Don't run!

692
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,060
They're getting faster every day.

693
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,460
Xiao Se!

694
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,220
Walking on Clouds

695
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,620
is indeed the world's top qinggong.

696
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,380
Xiao Se has no inner force at all.

697
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,500
Yet his qinggong skills

698
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,500
are at the level possessed by experts

699
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,820
of the Insouciant Phase.

700
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,380
Watch where you swing that thing.

701
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,380
Do you know what you're trying to swing at?

702
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,460
This is Yunyan fine cotton.

703
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,140
It costs 1,000 silver taels a bolt.

704
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,900
I don't care what it is.

705
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,300
Lei Wujie!

706
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,260
I'm coming!

707
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,420
Is there anything I can help you with,
Younger Martial Brother Xiao?

708
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,140
Get lost.

709
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,940
I'm older.

710
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,740
I dare you to call me
Younger Martial Brother again.

711
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,900
Qianluo,

712
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,420
why are you chasing after my brother, Xiao?

713
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,540
Can't you just address me

714
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,420
as an older brother?

715
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,380
Lei Wujie,

716
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,020
this doesn't concern you, so let go.

717
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,780
Xiao...

718
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,020
Are you going to say

719
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,420
I have to get your permission first

720
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,380
before trying to beat Xiao?

721
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,420
All right.

722
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,180
I won't beat your brother, Xiao, today.

723
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,620
I'll beat you instead.

724
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,260
I'd like to see

725
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,580
how special you are

726
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,580
to make Xueyue Sword Deity

727
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,060
take you as her disciple!

728
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,220
Xiao Se, I can't beat her.

729
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,580
If you manage to make her fall flat on the ground,

730
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,900
I'll give you 800 silver taels.

731
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,980
How about 8,000 silver taels?

732
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,860
I...

733
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,060
Make me fall flat on the ground?

734
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,220
Neither of you

735
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,100
can get away today.

736
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,460
Xiao Se,

737
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,940
what did you do to provoke her?

738
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,820
Who'd provoke someone like her for no reason?

739
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,100
Xiao Se, what did you say?

740
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,100
What do you mean by someone like me?

741
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,100
Someone

742
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,300
who goes after men all day

743
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,220
without shame.

744
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,220
You...

745
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,060
Lei Wujie!

746
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,060
You can't even keep them here.

747
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,980
I feel sorry for this Yinyue Spear.

748
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,100
I would've kept them here

749
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,540
with that shot just now.

750
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,740
Stop kidding around.

751

I'm fine.

762
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,980
This is Yunyan fine cotton.

763
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,660
It must be expensive, right?

764
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,380
Well, not that expensive.

765
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,780
The main thing is, this doesn't absorb blood.

778

No, it's all right.

779

I can do it myself.

780
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,420
This is Luo brocade.

781
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,980
It costs at least 80 silver taels.

782
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,020
It's all right.

783
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,580

These two rascals

785

786
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,740
Oh no.

787
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,220
She already caught us up?

788

Wait.

Why don't you go inside my room?

What do the two rascals look like?

797
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,260
One of them wears red with a sword in his hand.

798
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,420
The other one is in green.

799

In any case,

they don't look like decent people.

801

I didn't see them.

Why did you drag me away?

820
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,780
If I hadn't dragged you away,

821
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,380
you'd have

822
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,540
asked her age

823

and if she is married, wouldn't you?

824
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,020
I wasn't going to ask that.

825
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,420
She didn't answer

She clearly

828
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,420
didn't want to talk to you.

829
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,260
Why would you want to stay there, then?

all over the city all day.

840
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,220
Can't you just stop?

841
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,460
How is that my fault?

842
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,380
I'm now in charge

843

of Xueyue City's finance.

844
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,380
Yet, she keeps bothering me,

845
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,860
saying she wants to spar with me.

846
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,260
I don't even know martial arts.

847
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,060
Insulting her that gently
is already being nice to her.

848
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,300
Yesterday, you imitated her

849
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,860
by pinching your nose as you talked

850
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,860
when you were trying to rob the Golden Coffin.

851
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,940
So what did you do to upset her today?

852
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,580
Today,

853
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,820
he said Qianluo

854
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,220
is a lady

855
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,060

856
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,060
I can't believe you laughed.

857
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,340
You can't even defeat Qianluo.

858
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,380
I really don't want to

859
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,100
be your eldest martial brother anymore.

860
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:31,940
Who says I can't defeat her?

861
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,540
If I have my Shabu,

862
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,100
it could at least be a draw.

863
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,500
But what's wrong with Tingyu Sword?

864
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,060
My master said...

865
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:48,980
Wrong.

866
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,060
I told you it's not about
using your strength to draw it.

867
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,700
You can't draw it

868
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,780
because you don't have the will to draw the sword.

869
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,820
The will to draw?

870
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,380
What is that?

871
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,260
You need to find a reason to draw your sword.

872
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:04,940
(That's right.)

873
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,620
The sword forged by Sword Heart Tomb

874
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,740
is indeed different.

875
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,980
It's said that the last step

876
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,900
of their sword forging

877
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,900
was to make their palm bleed
and feed the sword with blood.

878
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,660
So the swords that were forged in the end

879
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,300
were said to have souls.

880
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,780
But with your talent,

881
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,860
drawing the sword is only a matter of time.

882
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,940
Since it's rare for you to be here,

883
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,180
why don't we go and have a drink?

884
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,180

00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,940
I heard you're the youngest celestial master

937
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,940
in the history of Mount Wangcheng.

938
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,740
I'm here to ask you to show your swordsmanship.

939
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,700
Xueyue City?

940
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,860
Li Hanyi?

941
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,620
These words sound pretty cold

942
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,860
when they are put together.

943
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,340
It mustn't stop

944
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,220
my peaches from growing.

945
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,900
Stop talking nonsense. Eat this!

946
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,020
Taiyi Lion Secret Arts?

947
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,740
I'm here to test your swordsmanship.

948
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,420
So don't fight me with such a spell.

949
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,180
Can't you be reasonable?

950
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,500
I can't fight right now.

951
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,620
Why not?

952
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,380
My sword is under the tree.

953
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,660
If I pull it out,
I won't have peaches to eat anymore.

954
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,300
Eat peaches?

955
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,220
Yes, eat peaches.

956
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,740
You can forget about eating it!

957
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,460
Come forth!

958
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,540
What's wrong with my Tingyu Sword?

959
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:36,940
You...

960
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,060
I knew you were a wo...

961
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,260
woman.

962
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,180
But that doesn't do you justice.

963
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,900
You're like a fairy.
