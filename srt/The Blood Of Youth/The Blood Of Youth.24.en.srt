I have a question for you.

27

Ask away.

at Snowfall Villa,

30
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,700
was it just a coincidence?

31
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,140
It was indeed a coincidence

32
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,530
as if it was arranged in advance.

And he looks pale.

41
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,860
I forgot that you can't see things.

42
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,180

The first edict

89
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,290
is to assign Marquis Lanyue

prevent disorder, and keep the people calm.

Since it's a secret decree,

Now that His Majesty gave me this secret decree,

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,060
it's to tell those officials

that he has given me

185

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,530
to you.

191
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,810
Noted.

192
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,530
Lately,

193
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,500
Baixiao Sect has been very active

194
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,980
in the martial arts world.

195
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,770
What happened? Did Ji Ruofeng

196
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,650
return to manage

197
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,770
Baixiao Sect again?

198
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,410
Our head did say

199
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,690
that he'll lead us, Baixiao Sect,

200
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,140
to the restoration of our former glory.

201
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,900
But it wasn't Head Ji who said it.

202
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,810
So it's your new head.

203
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,380
Who is it, then?

204
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,930
Our head said

205
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,290
it won't be long until we meet

206
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,140
City Lord Sikong.

207
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,740
You'll know when you meet him.

208
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,980
It's interesting.

209
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,050
This means Baixiao Sect

210
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,810
has something important to tell us.

211
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,100
There's something Baixiao Sect would like

212
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,020
to ask Xueyue City.

213
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,810
Go ahead.

214
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,530
Our head asked

215
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,690
why Baili Dongjun and Mo Yi

216
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,530
didn't come back.

217
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,450
It seems like there are many things

218
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,740
Baixiao Sect knows

219
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,170
and wants to know.

220
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,290
Mr. Mo Yi has entered his dreamland
for self-reflection.

221
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,050
He won't wake up in ten years.

222
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,500
Eldest Martial Uncle Baili
is there to protect him.

223
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,770
He won't leave Penglai Island

224
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,340
until Mo Yi

225
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,050
wakes up.

226
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,050
I see.

227
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,220
You're an interesting person.

228
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,570
You told us it was urgent.

229
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,740
Yet, you kept asking us questions.

230
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,100
After wasting a lot of our time,

231
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,500
you still haven't told us about it.

232
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,740
Calm down, Young Lady.

233
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,980
Because I didn't come here

234
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,980
alone today.

235
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,100
Another friend of mine

236
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,290
has found the person who really needs

237
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,170
the information.

238
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,650
Xiao Se?

239
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,020
Why do you look for Xiao Se?

240
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,930
What is the information?

241
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,220
A big event has happened

242
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,290
in Tianqi City lately.

243
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,500
His Majesty

244
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,290
fainted at the annual ceremony.

245
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
With the help of Qi Tianchen,
the Supervisor of Astronomy,

246
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,930
he managed to regain consciousness.

247
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,050
Nonsense!

248
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,570
Father, please accede

249
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,570
to my request.

250
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,220
You're a prince,

251
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,570
the most outstanding prince I've got.

252
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,500
The officials and people are saying

253
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,530
that you'll inherit the kingdom in the future.

254
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,500
But I can't believe you tell me

255
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,450
that you want to travel in the martial arts world.

256
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,380
What else could it be if it isn't nonsense?

257
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,770
But Uncle Langya did

258
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,260
the same thing as well.

259
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:58,620
I...

260
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,450
Langya again?

261
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,410
Who is your father? Me or him?

262
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,900
Of course you are.

263
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,620
But I was taught

264
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,340
by Uncle Langya.

265
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,860
You say I'm talking nonsense.

266
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,980
So just punish Uncle Langya for that.

267
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,220
This is absurd!

268
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,860
(Didn't you say)

269
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,620
(that you wanted to travel the world?)

270
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,570
(Very well.)

271
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,690
(I'll dethrone you)

272
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,900
(and take the identity from you.)

273
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,170
(Just go to the mountain,)

274
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,530
(to the uncultivated land,)

275
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,500
(and don't ever come back again!)

276
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,260
Xiao Se.

277
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,050
You already knew it?

278
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,100
So,

279
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,260
are you going back?

280
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,620
Can I come with you?

281
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,260
To the Tianqi you mentioned.

282
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,220
I suppose Tianqi City

283
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,140
will send people here at a time like this.

284
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:12,740
Third City Lord

285
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,020
is the world-renowned heir of Medicine King.

286
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,930
If the Imperial Medical Academy

287
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,450
couldn't solve this problem,

288
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,530
maybe Third City Lord has a way

289
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,500
to solve it.

290
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,450
That's not the answer I want.

291
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,980
I'm asking you

292
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,500
if I can go

293
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,530
to Tianqi with you.

294
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,930
Xiao Chuhe, Xiao Chuhe,

295
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,220
the lady has already put it this way.

296
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,260
Yet, you remain silent.

297
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,500
[Xiao Lingchen, Lord Langya Junior]
You're such a killjoy.

298
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,340
Who are you?

299
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,810
Me?

300
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,500
I'm Lord Langya.

301
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,140
This is absurd.

302
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,260
I really am Lord Langya.

303
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,810
Uncle Langya was granted

304
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,410
to pass on his title through generations.

305
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,740
His descendants can inherit his title.

306
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,810
This is Uncle Langya's only son,

307
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,860
Xiao Lingchen.

308
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,020
He indeed can claim himself

309
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:05,690
as Lord Langya.

310
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,860
Long time no see, Lingchen.

311
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:12,900
Qianluo,

312
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,900
I've got something...

313
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,090
I understand.

314
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,100
Is she the daughter of City Lord Sikong?

315
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,530
I think she's out of your league.

316
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,690
It's been four years.

317
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,650
Did you

318
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,810
show up just to tell me this?

319
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,860
Of course not.

320
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,740
Where have you been all these years?

321
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,260
I've tried to look for you many times,

322
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,260
but I couldn't find you.

323
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,500
That day when the rebellion
happened in Tianqi City,

324
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,690
my father took me

325
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,860
to the North Gate

326
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,410
with a wagon.

327
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,650
We were stopped by White Tiger on the road.

328
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,340
My father stayed there alone

329
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,450
without resisting.

330
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,290
So White Tiger let me leave the city.

331
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,140
Then, I met the Three Devine Warriors from Beili

332
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,050
in my escape.

333
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,860
After that, the former soldiers
of the Langya Army and I

334
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,690
concealed our identities

335
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,530
and lived among the citizens.

336
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,450
Why would Uncle Langya suddenly leave

337
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,020
the city on that day?

338
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,740
I have no idea.

339
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,570
It all happened very fast.

340
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,650
Before I met the Three Devine Warriors,

341
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,410
I didn't know

342
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,620
why I was being chased.

343
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:27,530
And I didn't know

344
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,810
why my father

345
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,100
would be stopped by White Tiger.

346
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,050
As

347
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,930
the Ministry of Justice said,

348
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,570
Lord Langya plotted treason

349
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,810
and deliberately created chaos that day.

350
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,900
If my father did try to revolt,

351
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,500
half of Beili would've been destroyed.

352
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,690
A small tumult

353
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,380
in Tianqi City like this

354
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,980
was portrayed

355
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,530
as the treason of Lord Langya.

356
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,450
It was an insult to my father.

357
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,570
Indeed.

358
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,650
The Emperor didn't say anything.

359
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,530
So did Uncle Langya.

360
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,410
You mean

361
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,050
it was like they'd reached a common ground.

362
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,340
It's just my guess.

363
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,620
Then, you should return to Tianqi

364
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,690
and get to the bottom of it.

365
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,380
What about you?

366
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,020
You and I

367
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,650
will eventually

368
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,410
return to Tianqi.

369
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,620
But we'll do it

370
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,980
at different times.

371
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,340
Your time has come.

372
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,170
But it's not the right time for me.

373
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,770
I need

374
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,220
a fire.

375
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,810
I'll light the fire for you

376
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,290
when I find out

377
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
the truth.

378
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,220
Who do you want me to save?

379
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,270
I don't provide outpatient service.

380
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,220
You may not know this.

381
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,550
That there are requests

382
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,030
that you can't reject.

383
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,500
Just like my request.

384
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,670
Why is that?

385
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,150
Why?

386
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,340
Because I'm Golden Marquis Lanyue,

387
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,390
the Director of Nation in Beili.

388
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,700
Now that Beili

389
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,950
is under my control.

390
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,150
Let alone you.

391
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,340
Save me, old man.

392
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,220
He's right.

393
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,580
He holds

394
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,310
the greatest power in Beili now.

395
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,430
Even I can't stop him.

396
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,310
But, Marquis,

397
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,580
why bother

398
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,670
making fun of a kid?

399
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,270
Very well.

400
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,860
I allow you to ask me a question.

401
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,340
Who do you want me to save?

402
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,070
What symptoms does he have?

403
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,910
The person you've got to save is Xiao

404
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:37,950
Ruojin.

405
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,390
He's the Emperor of Beili.

406
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,740
The Emperor?

407
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:42,740
Yes.

408
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,790
He's suffering from heart disease.

409
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,790
A while ago, he suddenly fainted

410
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,070
during the annual ceremony.

411
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,390
He's been in a coma since then.

412
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,430
Okay.

413
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,390
I'll go with you.

414
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,860
You're having guests over?

415
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,550
Yes.

416
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,670
Both of my grandsons

417
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,390
came back for a short stay.

418
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,740
No wonder there's a strong sword qi here.

419
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,670
Did Li Hanyi come back?

420
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:13,700
No.

421
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,060
This sword qi is different

422
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,950
from Li Hanyi's.

423
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,500
Instead...

424
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,300
It's more like Xinyue's.

425
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,910
Does it belong to the kid

426
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,910
in the red shirt?

427
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,590
Yes, it's his.

428
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,060
Good, very good.

429
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,020
Sword Heart with the moon on it

430
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,460
kills someone in a dream.

431
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,220
Guardian Azure Dragon

432
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,780
finally has her real heir.

433
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,430
Qianluo

434
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,670
looked upset.

435
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,830
She said she asked you a question.

436
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,630
But you didn't give her an answer.

437
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,910
Because I don't know

438
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,780
the answer either.

439
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,110
Your father

440
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,590
is a nice parent.

441
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,980
You think so too?

442
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,780
He's also

443
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,870
a nice emperor.

444
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,980
I thought you hated him.

445
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,260
Of course I hate him.

446
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,630
No matter if it was

447
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,830
about Ye Dingzhi

448
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,740
or the matter of Lord Langya,

449
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,910
I hate him for that.

450
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,220
I even despise him,

451
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,350
and I want to kill him.

452
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,350
But as a father,

453
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,870
he gave you everything

454
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,670
back then.

455
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,260
Then, he tried

456
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,980
his best to fix everything.

457
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,190
But as an emperor,

458
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,020
Beili has prospered and the people

459
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,300
have been at peace lately.

460
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,950
Lord Langya is the only person

461
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,460
he has wronged.

462
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,700
To him,

463
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,300
I'm just an unfilial son.

464
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,980
The wanderers will eventually return

465
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,060
to their homes.

466
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,830
I met Xiao Lingchen today.

467
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,500
Did you arrange this?

468
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,910
In fact, I have no idea

469
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,110
of the whereabouts of the old unit
of the Langya Army.

470
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,110
But Lingchen came

471
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,430
to me several days ago.

472
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,150
He said he knew that you were here.

473
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,190
And he knew

474
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,460
that you'd been hesitating.

475
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,670
He said

476
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,060
he'd like to give you some encouragement.

477
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,950
He didn't say much.

478
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,020
He said his appearance

479
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,430
would be the biggest encouragement to you.

480
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,830
He's awfully confident.

481
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,060
Your Highness,

482
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,220
something big happened in Tang Clan.

483
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,190
Say it.

484
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,300
Tang Lian returned to Tang Clan

485
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,190
from Xueyue City.

486
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,980
Tang Clan is going to punish him severely.

487
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,590
They want to take away his martial arts

488
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,630
and evict him from Tang Clan.

489
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,870
But Tang Lianyue

490
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,430
suddenly broke through them

491
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,020
and defeated Tang Huang, Tang Xuan, Tang Qisha.

492
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,060
The three of them

493
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,260
couldn't even fight back.

494
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,260
The sectors

495
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:05,980
in Tang Clan that support

496
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,430
Xueyue City and who have been suppressed

497
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,500
also take the chance to resist them.

498
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,700
So,

499
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,740
Tang Clan has got

500
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,590
their long-anticipated new old master.

501
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,350
Tang Lianyue has become

502
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,980
their new old master.

503
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,740
Now that he's the ruler of the Tang Clan,

504
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,460
he surely won't

505
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,590
work with us.

506
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,390
Actually, this is not

507
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,390
necessarily a bad thing.

508
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,980
Based on the way Tang Lianyue does things,

509
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,910
I suppose he'll keep Tang Clan

510
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,630
away from this dispute.

511
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,780
One less friend

512
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,700
is better than having another enemy.

513
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,590
Besides, the matter of Tang Lian

514
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,830
has sent us another message.

515
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,830
What is it?

516
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,150
He's back

517
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,700
(and he has recovered.)

518
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,300
Your Highness,

519
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,540
we all await your words.

520
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,540
Okay.

521
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,630
I command you to do it!

522
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,430
Noted!

523
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,500
[Lianyue Pavilion]

524
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,060
Master,

525
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,670
I've stayed at Tang Clan

526
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,430
for over a month.

527
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,950
Yet, you haven't given me

528
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,830
the answer I want.

529
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,910
Does Tang Clan

530
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,870
take Xueyue City's side now

531
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,430
or continue to support

532
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,150
Lord Bai in Tianqi City?

533
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,190
Tang Clan won't get involved
in partisan politics.

534
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,110
It's our rule.

535
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,910
Old Master refused to obey it.

536
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,780
In order to overthrow Lei Fortress,

537
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,740
he secretly broke

538
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,700
his covenant with Xueyue City

539
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,190
and joined hands with Lord Bai.

540
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,670
He was bewitched by Dark River
during the operation.

541
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,350
That was how things turned out like this.

542
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,910
Lei Fortress has feuded with us,

543
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,630
and it's impossible for us to realign

544
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,110
with Xueyue City for now.

545
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,500
As for supporting Lord Bai,

546
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,740
Lian,

547
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,910
do you think

548
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,220
I'll make such a choice?

549
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,590
I've thought too much.

550
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,110
So, Master, your choice

551
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,740
is to remain neutral.

552
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,590
The present Tang Clan

553
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,870
is ineligible to make choices.

554
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,190
I understand.

555
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,910
What about you?

556
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,950
Tang Clan is ineligible to make choices.

557
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,060
But you're eligible.

558
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,500
I've made a choice.

559
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,190
This is quite surprising.

560
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,950
I thought you came

561
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,780
to ask me for some advice.

562
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,830
Tell me.

563
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,630
What are you going to do?

564
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,190
I'll follow my heart.

565
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,150
Act with my heart.

566
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,460
This is something

567
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,540
that Baili Dongjun would say.

568
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,300
Not bad, you're making progress.

569
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,190
Maybe I've started

570
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,460
to study the art of making liquor lately.

571
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,220
That's why my character has become

572
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,220
more like Master Baili.

573
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,300
The art of making liquor?

574
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,390
Yes.

575
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,190
I've been studying this book recently.

576
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,590
It's said that it's not

577
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,980
an ordinary liquor-making book.

578
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,220
The Book of Liquor

579
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,300
originally recorded a kind

580
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,110
of strange skill which was cultivated by liquor.

581
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,020
Baili Dongjun combined

582
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,150
his peerless art of making liquor

583
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,630
with this skill after getting it

584
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,780
and wrote the latter half of it.

585
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,390
You must've heard of the story

586
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,780
about Baili Dongjun

587
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,780
climbing Diaolou Parlor

588
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,020
with Seven Starry Nights.

589
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,870
I've heard of it many times.

590
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,390
But people don't know

591
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,110
that Lord Langya, Xiao Ruofeng,

592
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,190
was one of the liquor tasters.

593
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,110
After drinking Seven Starry Nights,

594
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,500
he made a breakthrough.

595
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,830
Made a breakthrough?

596
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,190
He suddenly entered

597
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,500
the Insouciant Phase from the Carefree Phase.

598
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,020
And before that,

599
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,060
it's been years since Xiao Ruofeng's martial arts

600
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,950
reached another phase.

601
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,590
The Book of Liquor

602
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,740
is really mysterious.

603
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,740
Why didn't Master Baili

604
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,060
let me drink

605
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,540
the amazing Starry Nights?

606
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,780
I've asked him before.

607
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,740
He said the liquor alone

608
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,300
can't increase the power.

609
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,350
It's also related to the person's state of mind.

610
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,390
I'm not sure about the specific details.

611
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,300
[The Book of Liquor]
Anyway, the Book of Liquor

612
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,870
is well worth studying.

613
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,350
Yes, Master.

614
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,350
How is he doing, Divine Healer?

615
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,220
It's indeed a heart disease.

616
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,150
Can you cure him?

617
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,190
Yes.

618
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,220
But...

619
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,740
There's no but.

620
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,500
Don't keep us guessing at a time like this.

621
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,260
You interrupted me first.

622
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,740
But it'll take time.

623
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,540
How long?

624
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,390
One month.

625
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,150
Okay.

626
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,220
Well, in this month,

627
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,220
the imperial physicians

628
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,190
will be at your disposal.

629
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,430
-We're willing to help you, Divine Healer.
-We're willing to help you, Divine Healer.

630
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,780
You've flattered me, sirs.

631
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,150
I'm not a divine healer.

632
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:34,740
By the way,

633
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
I've got a question for you.

634
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,590
Go ahead.

635
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,190
When will the meal be served?

636
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:38,910
I'm hungry.

637
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,830
Li Changqing,

638
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,670
you're the captain of Tiger Soldiers,

639
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,980
the leader of the Imperial Guards.

640
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,590
How could you allow

641
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,430
an assassin to sneak into the palace?

642
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,870
What were you doing?

643
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,460
It was remiss of me.

644
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,220
Who was the assassin?

645
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,390
When did he enter the palace?

646
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,060
It was the night when you left.

647
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,630
(I didn't notice it at first.)

648
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,460
But he ran into the Director.

649
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,910
The assassin was very agile.

650
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,590
After being attacked by the Director,

651
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,190
he was still able to leave the palace.

652
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,980
His Majesty has just collapsed.

653
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,830
It seems like someone

654
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,980
in Tianqi City can't hold it any longer.

655
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,260
Something was suspicious.

656
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,390
The Director found the assassin

657
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,350
at an abandoned cold palace.

658
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,300
I guess

659
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,060
the person wasn't trying

660
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,910
to assassinate His Majesty.

661
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,220
Stop guessing.

662
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,670
Lead the Tiger Soldiers

663
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,300
and guard Tai'an Hall well.

664
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,780
If anything happens,

665
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,700
I'll have you beheaded.

666
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:40,910
Yes.

667
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,630
[Hongfu Inn]

668
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,350
Sir,

669
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,740
why do you enter the palace

670
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,060
at this late hour?

671
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,870
How did you find me?

672
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,630
Even if there is

673
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,220
an ant entering the palace,

674
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,740
I'll know it as well.

675
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,540
It seems like this ant

676
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,190
can't leave here today.

677
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,740
This is where the Emperor stays.

678
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,300
How can I allow an outsider to stay here?

679
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,190
Xiao Se.

680
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,430
When will you get back?

681
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,540
I've helped you many times.

682
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,540
You should come and help the poor Wuxin.

683
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,500
I've witnessed the Beauty of Four Seasons.

684
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,910
It's time to go back.

685
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,780
He has left.

686
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,830
Just as you predicted.

687
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,350
Emperor Mingde is severely ill.

688
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,190
And with the one-year promise,

689
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,740
he's finally made up his mind.

690
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,630
Besides, he left with his horse

691
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,910
just like this,

692
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:18,980
without saying a word.

693
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,220
He was taught by Xiao Ruofeng

694
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,190
and Ji Ruofeng.

695
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,150
I know him.

696
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,590
It's just

697
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,780
that since the day

698
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,700
Xiao Se returned to Xueyue City,

699
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,830
there have been

700
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,350
many people guarding there.

701
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,110
Now that he has left,

702
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,220
this news will soon spread

703
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,910
throughout the entire Beili.

704
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,220
Explicitly or implicitly,

705
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,540
there are many people trying to kill him.

706
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,190
I wonder how he's supposed to go back alone.

707
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,830
I don't know.

708
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,540
But Xueyue City is known

709
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,350
as the First City in the World.

710
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,390
We don't like fighting

711
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,260
with others.

712
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,150
But

713
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,870
we'll never be a sitting duck.

714
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,390
Cheng Luoying's army is on the north side.

715
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,150
[Cheng Luoying's army]

716
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,950
[Tianqi City]
Over the years,

717
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,190
he's been silently supporting Lord Chi.

718
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,630
No one knows about it.

719
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:12,740
But in order

720
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,220
to stop Xiao Se from returning to Tianqi,

721
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,190
he'll take risks and reveal this.

722
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,540
Luckily, I've been staying in Luo City

723
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,460
instead of returning to Tianqi.

724
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,830
That's how I avoided the lockdown of the city.

725
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,220
Otherwise,

726
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,220
[Cheng Luoying, Generalissimo]
I'd be bored to death.

727
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,910
But His Highness Lord Chi

728
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,190
doesn't make it easy for me.

729
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,460
Is he sure he wants to take such a risk?

730
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:42,980
His Highness

731
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:43,830
has written everything

732
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,190
he wanted to say in the letter.

733
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,740
It's a serious crime

734
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,740
to kill a prince.

735
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,220
Besides,

736
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,390
he is His Majesty's favorite prince.

737
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,830

738
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,110
of the Sixteen Guardians of Nanjue

739
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,670
will show up at the place
where they're supposed to be.

740
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,430
Exterminating the enemy's patrols

741
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,460
is the duty of the general.

742
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,150
When it's done,

743
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,460
you'll be greatly rewarded

744
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,060
by the Imperial Court.

745
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,630
[Wushuang City]
Wushuang City is on the northeast side.

746
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,950
Lord Bai is not as brutal

747
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,700
as Lord Chi,

748
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,300
but if Xiao Se returns to Tianqi,

749
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,700
it'll affect his interests too.

750
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,260
He'll take action as well.

751
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,980
Are you frustrated

752
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,950
as we didn't let you leave the city?

753
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,430
I'm the hole card here.

754
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,020
How can I show up easily?

755
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,590
I understand this logic.

756
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,300
It's not that.

757
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,830
We didn't let you go

758
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,500
because we were afraid

759
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,540
you might get the wrong person.

760
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,110
I remember his look.

761
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,390
We've met before.

762
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,190
His Highness Lord Bai expects it

763
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,060
to be infallible.

764
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,830
But I'm not very confident about it.

765
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,020
We heard

766
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,060
that he travels alone.

767
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,630
But Xueyue City
has well-established capabilities.

768
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,670
They might've kept a card up their sleeves.

769
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,220
You're scared even before departing.

770
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,430
Just give up, then.

771
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,190
You brat!

772
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,060
You're putting on the airs of a city lord.

773
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:06,740
Yuzhai,

774
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,670
you're wrong.

775
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,350
I'm the City Lord, to begin with.

776
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,980
Okay, City Lord.

777
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,700
I'll get going.

778
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,500
[Dark River]
Dark River will rush over from the southwest.

779
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,430
They'll send

780
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,670
the most elite killers over.

781
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,670
And the little dots on it,

782
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,670
they're the forces that Lord Bai

783
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,390
and Lord Chi

784
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,870
have spread in Beili over years.

785
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,910
Half of these forces

786
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,630
will participate

787
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,390
in this assassination.

788
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:50,980
You have

789
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,540
gathered up the other half?

790
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,670
Since the day Xiao Se came

791
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,350
to Xueyue City,

792
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,700
I've started to plan for this.

793
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,430
It's time for them to know

794
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,300
why Xueyue City claims to be

795
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,020
the First City in the World.

796
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,740
Luoxia,

797
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,780
issue Qiancheng Token,

798
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,220
the Crimson Red Emergency Token.

799
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,220
Noted.

800
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,830
It's also time

801
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,150
to show the two princes

802
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,110
of Tianqi City

803
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:18,980
why Xueyue City

804
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,110
doesn't fear

805
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,260
to reject them.

806
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,830
Father.

807
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,350
Go on.

808
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,670
I once said

809
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,190
you'll stay

810
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,700
by his side

811
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,110
when he returns to Tianqi on his own.

812
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,830
But from this day forward,

813
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,190
you have to say

814
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,190
that title loud and clear.

815
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,500
Vermilion Bird, Sikong Qianluo.

816
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,700
The title of Vermilion Bird

817
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,700
really fits you.

818
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,300
Go on, kid.

819
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,460
I know

820
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,100
it's very dangerous.

821
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,390
But I'm also aware

822
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,350
that I can't stop you.

823
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,110
Father.

824
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,060
Father,

825
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,390
I'm leaving.

826
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,350
Do you feel lonely too

827
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,060
as you haven't fought

828
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,780
for years?

829
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:03,670
Changfeng,

830
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,830
what do you need me to do this time?

831
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,180
I'm afraid the youngsters

832
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,350
might be in danger.

833
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,060
You and all the elders stay

834
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,350
in Xueyue City.

835
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,260
I'll be the only elder

836
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,350
who goes there.

837
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,140
You...

838
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,710
Where are you going?

839
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,270
There will be a person on the west side.

840
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,020
He's the martial brother

841
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,060
of the consort in the palace,

842
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,910
the foster father of Lord Chi.

843
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,580
Luo Qingyang?

844
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:32,540
He hasn't left

845
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,980
Muliang City for years.

846
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,980
Will he intervene in this matter?

847
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,710
I don't know.

848
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,350
But I've got to try it.

849
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,020
I know

850
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,500
there are very few people in this world

851
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,500
who can stop him.

852
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,140
I have no confidence either.

853
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,910
It's Qiancheng Token of Xueyue City.

854
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,060
Yes.

855
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,470
I didn't expect this

856
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,140
to come so soon.

857
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,470
Are you ready?

858
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,270
I'm ready.

859
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,660
Right on time.

860
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,270
Go on.

861
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,950
Tang Clan and I will wait for your return.

862
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,310
Master,

863
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,700
take care.

864
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,910
It's such a big firework.

865
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,140
Why does it come so soon?

866
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,950
What do you mean?

867
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,220
Leave the tomb.

868
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,270
Hanyi,

869
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,350
didn't you say

870
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,470
I can only leave the tomb

871
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,430
after becoming a sword deity?

872
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,990
Why are you asking me to leave now?

873
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,220
I don't want you to leave either.

874
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,380
But if you don't leave now,

875
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,060
I'm afraid the best buddy of yours

876
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,390
will die.

877
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,380
Xiao Se?

878
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,530
Actually, I lied to you.

879
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,900
Staying at Sword Heart Tomb

880
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,910
won't help you

881
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,140
become a sword deity.

882
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,060
If you want to reach a higher phase,

883
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,660
you must go through life and death.

884
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:13,990
Go now.

885
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:25,820
Two!

886
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,690
His Majesty has decreed

887
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,730
that the second-rank officers and above

888
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,530
can't leave their residences.

889
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,900
The General is trapped

890
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,570
in Tianqi City as well.

891
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,020
[Li Wei, Battalion Commander]

892
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,580
Well, we can only hold our positions.

893
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,900
Gather up, Ye Battalion!

894
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,460
It's Young Lady.

895
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,020
Hurry and gather Ye Battalion.

896
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:43,780
Yes.

897
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,210
Now that Xiao Chuhe, Lord Yong'an, is in trouble.

898
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,140
As we work for the imperial family,

899
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,300
we should help them out.

900
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,700
Here's the order from General Ye Xiaoying,

901
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,270
save Lord Yong'an from danger.

902
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,390
Soldiers,

903
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,140
will you join me in this?

904
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,980
Yes, we will!

905
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,580
We will, we will!

906
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,530
Marquis, you might need to make a run again.

907
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,380
State Preceptor,

908
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,830
I'm His Majesty's anointed Director of Nation.

909
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,940
I should stay in Tianqi City
and manage the national affairs.

910
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,350
Why must I run errands all the time?

911
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,380
Besides,

912
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,380
I just brought the Divine Healer back.

913
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,690
Just let me take a break.

914
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,250
That person just left Xueyue City.

915
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,420
What?

916
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,950
He might have left

917
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,180
without companions.

918
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,900
The people from Xueyue City didn't come with him.

919
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,060
Whether it's the martial arts world
or the Imperial Court,

920
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,140
there are many people taking action in secret.

921
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,420
Li Changqing.

922
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,140
Your Highness.

923
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,570
Let me ask you this.

924
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,730
How many people are there in Tiger Soldiers?

925
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,020
There are

926
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,700
112 elite guardians

927
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,180
and 1,300 soldiers.

928
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,020
Okay.

929
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,730
I'll give you 3,000 imperial guards.

930
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,390
You lend me 800 Tiger Soldiers.

931
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,730
I need to go out of the city.

932
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,250
800 Tiger Soldiers?

933
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:21,990
Your Highness,

934
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,020
do you know what you're saying?

935
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,220
Of course I know

936
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,380
what I'm saying.

937
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:30,940
Don't worry.

938
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,610
His Majesty won't blame you

939
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,610
for lending me

940
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,270
800 Tiger Soldiers when he wakes up.

941
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,700
He'll even give you a promotion.

942
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,250
But...

943
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,220
Rest assured, Captain Li.

944
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,500
Golden Marquis Lanyue keeps his word.

945
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,170
He won't lie to you.

946
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,460
Your Highness,

947
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,430
go to Tiger Camp and select the soldiers.

948
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,430
Your Highness,

949
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,460
choose only 800 Tiger Soldiers as we agreed.

950
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,460
You must leave the other 500 soldiers to me.

951
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,530
Look how petty you are.

952
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:07,820
Don't worry.

953
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,380
I won't take more than that.

954
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,460
State Preceptor,

955
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,940
is Marquis Lanyue

956
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,780
going out of the city again?

957
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,870
Director, do you know

958
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,350
why all the princes

959
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,500
were granted titles

960
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,780
and sent to the fiefs?

961
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,060
Yet, His Majesty
only allowed his youngest brother

962
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,690
to stay here?

963
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,660
He has been His Majesty's favorite brother

964
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,460
since childhood,

965
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,270
and everyone knows it.

966
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,950
And why does His Majesty like him so much?

967
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,180
What do you mean by this?

968
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,700
Because Marquis Lanyue doesn't want

969
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,310
to be the Emperor at all.

970
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,990
Twenty-three years ago,

971
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,350
your ancestors escorted

972
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,470
His Majesty to Tai'an Hall.

973
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,350
Many people died

974
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,990
in that bloodbath.

975
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,870
But their glory remains

976
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:19,580
in the world.

977
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,660
This kind of glory runs

978
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,910
in your vein.

979
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:24,910
Let me ask you this.

980
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,830
Will you make a way

981
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,910
for Lord Yong'an who returns

982
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,470
to the city alone?

983
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,620
We will!
