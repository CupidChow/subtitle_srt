[The Blood of Youth]

24
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,930
[Episode 31]

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,680
How about this?

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,990
Instead of fighting,

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,790
let's make a bet today.

28
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,040
I bet that Chong's eyes

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,150
can be healed today.

30
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,320
And that the Divine Healer will be fine too.

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,710
Sure.

32
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,440
What do you want to bet on?

33
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,280
Let's bet on Tianqi City then.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,600
That's too much of a major bet.

35
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,320
Xiao Chong's eyes are not as worthy

36
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,040
as Tianqi City.

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
It's still too early to bet on Tianqi City.

38
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,920
How about we bet on
something smaller for starters?

39
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,350
If I win,

40
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,920
your Snowfall Villa

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,480
will be mine.

42
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,920
You like to take things from me
since we were young.

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,000
It's just a villa.

44
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,950
But you are still so obsessed about it.

45
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,510
As I said back then,

46
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,550
I would take it back one day.

47
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,000
I would take back everything.

48
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,350
What if I win?

49
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,630
Go ahead and tell me what you want.

50
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,550
If I win,

51
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,600
give me the information about my friend.

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,600
Chuhe.

53
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,390
You are still as smart as ever.

54
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,920
Let me ask you again.

55
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,280
Are you going

56
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,830
to take the bet or not?

57
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,550
Fine.

58
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,200
I'll play with you.

59
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,110
Who are they?

60
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,310
They don't feel any pain,

61
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,310
and they can't get tired.

62
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,790
I can't fight anymore.

63
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,960
And they are getting stronger and stronger.

64
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,280
You should be grateful

65
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,230
that the head of the Su family has chosen to stop.

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,160
Otherwise,

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,430
we'll be defeated.

68
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,430
(Su Changhe.)

69
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,920
(What did he do to the disciples)

70
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,790
(of Dark River?)

71
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:34,920
Let's go!

72
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:40,960
This...

73
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,670
Are they ghosts?

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,190
Are we fighting with ghosts tonight?

75
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,720
Master, save me.

76
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,280
If we look at the time,

77
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,990
the Divine Healer is going to be done

78
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,600
with her treatment soon.

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,160
(According to Night Crow,)

80
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,870
(these imperfect drugged assassins)

81
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,640
(can only fight)

82
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,110
(for around one hour.)

83
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,670
Looks like

84
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,840
something interesting

85
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,600
is bound to happen tonight.

86
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:23,870
Go

87
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,550
and end this interesting show

88
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,870
at Lord Bai's Residence.

89
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,990
(Why does that person)

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,960
(look so similar to Wuxin?)

91
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,480
I almost got killed

92
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,750
by these nameless assassins.

93
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,480
This is embarrassing.

94
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,310
You are Wu...

95
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:04,960
You...

96
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,350
Master!

97
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,190
Run!

98
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,480
Wuxin!

99
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,400
Look at who's in front of you.

100
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,310
He's Xiao Se.

101
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,480
Your friend!

102
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,400
It's pointless.

103
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,400
He has lost consciousness
like the five assassins

104
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,480
just now.

105
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,480
It's one against four.

106
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,990
He's even more powerful than a sword deity.

107
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,600
Wuxin!

108
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,280
Wuxin?

109
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,640
Why are you here?

110
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,160
What happened to you?

111
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:13,960
What did you

112
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,040
call me just now?

113
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,920
Wuxin.

114
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,520
I should've listened to Ghost Physician.

115
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,640
It's still too early

116
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,160
to put him to use.

117
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,790
Wuxin.

118
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:45,990
Back off.

119
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,600
Xiao Yu.

120
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,110
Is this your doing?

121
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,230
I don't have to

122
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,350
answer your question.

123
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,350
Although I'm the one

124
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,840
who won this bet,

125
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,160
you already know

126
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,640
the answer to your question just now.

127
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,400
You should be grateful.

128
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,720
But

129
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,960
your Snowfall Villa

130
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,310
is mine now.

131
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,520
Oh, really?

132
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,870
How are you so sure that you've won?

133
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,040
Chong is totally unharmed.

134
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,350
Is that so?

135
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,190
(What a pity.)

136
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,240
He was

137
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,550
my best-hidden pawn.

138
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,470
At first, I wanted to use him
at the last possible moment.

139
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,160
What?

140
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,520
Chong is a smart person.

141
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,310
But he has a weakness.

142
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,790
He trusts others too easily.

143
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,790
(The person he trusts the most)

144
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,120
(is going to be his downfall.)

145
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Xiao Jingxia.

146
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't move.

147
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,710
Xiao Jingxia has always been
cruel and vicious since he was young.

148
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,310
None of the princes like him.

149
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Only the compassionate Chong

150
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,550
is willing to talk to him.

151
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,160
All these years,

152
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,830
everyone thinks that Xiao Jingxia

153
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,240
has changed because of Xiao Chong.

154
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,280
But actually,

155
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm the one who sent

156
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,360
this poisonous scorpion to Chong.

157
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,470
Xiao Chuhe.

158
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,710
You've lost.

159
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,640
Yu.

160
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,400
Save me.

161
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,040
Did I lose?

162
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,760
Let's go.

163
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,670
Are we going to chase after them?

164
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,430
We should look at the bigger picture.

165
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,040
Let's check on Chong.

166
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,590
Divine Healer.

167
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,950
Divine Healer.

168
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,400
How are you feeling?

169
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,470
What is that?

170
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,280
The hidden weapon of the Tang Clan.

171
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,430
The robe of golden threads.

172
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:30,950
Is this

173
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,230
what Lian gave you

174
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,590
when he left Xueyue City?

175
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,830
This is called the Three-Cun Territory.

176
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,550
It's a rare defensive hidden weapon
of the Tang Clan.

177
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,040
When you are attacked

178
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,590
in your sleep,

179
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,310
the mechanism of this weapon will be triggered,

180
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,790
and it can kill your enemy in the blink of an eye.

181
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,280
Back then,

182
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,920
when he secretly contacted Dark River,

183
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,430
I sent a message to Chong'er

184
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,710
to warn him to stay vigilant.

185
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,190
But he told me that his brother
would never do that.

186
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,710
He treated his brother so kindly.

187
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,830
But he never thought

188
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,830
that his brother would betray him.

189
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,830
So, he was the one who colluded with Dark River.

190
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,280
Now, he's killed

191
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,430
by Lian's hidden weapon.

192
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,670
He deserves it.

193
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,590
Mu Chunfeng will be fine.

194
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,040
What about the Divine Healer?

195
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,670
I can't save her.

196
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,310
She needs to be treated by a physician at once.

197
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,920
Take her back to Snowfall Villa first.

198
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,710
We better send her
to the Imperial Medical Academy.

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,310
No.

200
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,710
We can't let Tianqi know

201
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,640
that the Divine Healer
has been seriously wounded.

202
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,390
What about Wuxin?

203
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,670
Let's go back to Snowfall Villa first.

204
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,950
Even if we can get him back now,

205
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,400
we can't save him.

206
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,430
Why couldn't I

207
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,280
kill Xiao Chong?

208
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:41,920
Why?

209
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,400
I had planned it for so long.

210
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,070
It was supposed to be a perfect plan.

211
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,880
But Xiao Chuhe

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
still managed to find a way

213
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,190
to ruin my plan.

214
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,830
Calm down, Your Highness.

215
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,280
Lord Bai's Residence

216
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,190
is the only residence right now

217
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,120
that is protected

218
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,070
by two sword deities.

219
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,550
If he can

220
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,640
see now...

221
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,310
But those two sword deities

222
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,470
are not as powerful

223
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,190
as the best swordsman in the world.

224
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,400
How about we...

225
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,520
It's not the right time yet.

226
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,590
But we can't wait anymore.

227
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,240
Send a message to that person in the palace.

228
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,040
Tell him to come to me at once.

229
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,020
Why did you part with your martial arts world

230
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,330
to visit me at Qingyun Hall,

231
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,140
Scholarly Sword Deity?

232
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,090
I'm tired of traveling
around the martial arts world.

233
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,420
So, I'm here at Qingyun Hall to take a rest.

234
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,420
But a guest can't be here empty-handed.

235
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,610
Of course.

236
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,570
I do have some information

237
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,780
that I'll like to share with you.

238
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,180
I've run into a super-talented

239
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,260
young man

240
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,570
in the martial arts world.

241
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:44,900
That young man

242
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,180
was raised by Abbot Wangyou

243
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,090
of Hanshui Temple.

244
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,380
The last time

245
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,380
I saw him,

246
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,210
he told me

247
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,450
that he is coming to Tianqi City.

248
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,570
I'm thinking

249
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,940
that if he's really here,

250
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,540
the whole city

251
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,210
will know his name.

252
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,810
With his personality,

253
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,900
no matter where he goes,

254
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,540
he'll cook up a storm.

255
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,450
I noticed him at once

256
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,330
when he entered the city.

257
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,490
And I used the Supreme Dragon Elephant Skill
to spy on him.

258
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,690
But he saw through it right away.

259
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,540
Then, he disappeared.

260
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,180
Master.

261
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,180
Mr. Xiao Se has requested to see you.

262
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,940
He's here.

263
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,730
What a coincidence.

264
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:29,610
Invite him in.

265
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,380
Your Highness.

266
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,810
You are here too, Mr. Xie Xuan.

267
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,140
This is great.

268
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,730
Do you need me to treat

269
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,940
someone who's injured again?

270
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,690
It's Divine Healer Hua Jin.

271
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,020
The Divine Healer?

272
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,380
She was seriously wounded by someone yesterday.

273
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,780
And she's still unconscious.

274
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,450
What should we do then?

275
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,900
She's the only one right now
who's stopping His Majesty's disease

276
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,020
from getting out of hand.

277
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,380
Where is she right now?

278
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,210
She's in my residence, Snowfall Villa.

279
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,570
Are there any other things

280
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,660
that you need from the State Preceptor?

281
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,970
There's one more thing.

282
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:06,570
Okay then.

283
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,060
Both of you can talk then.

284
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,300
I'll check on the Divine Healer first.

285
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,730
I'll take my leave now.

286
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,020
Please take a seat, Your Highness.

287
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,180
I know that the Directorate of Astronomy

288
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,210
only conveys the divine message
and does not take part in political affairs.

289
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,730
That's why I didn't pay you a visit.

290
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,810
But lately, I've encountered something

291
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,420
that I have to trouble you with.

292
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,940
Go ahead.

293
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,690
I have a friend

294
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,850
who is said to be a genius.

295
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,420
But lately, he has lost consciousness.

296
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,690
And he has become even more powerful.

297
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,780
Even when we fought him together,

298
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,940
we couldn't defeat him.

299
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,300
Are you

300
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,780
talking about Wuxin?

301
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,730
Yes.

302
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,810
Where is he now?

303
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,660
He's with Lord Chi, Xiao Yu.

304
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,900
We all think

305
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,300
that Lord Chi is controlling him.

306
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,780
Controlling him?

307
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,780
I've heard something like this

308
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,900
from my master before this.

309
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,540
I suspect that it is the Art of Drugs
from Western Chu.

310
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,180
But a rare and evil technique like this

311
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,300
is unknown even to the Baixiao Sect.

312
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,180
That's why I'm here
at the Directorate of Astronomy

313
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,140
to seek the answer to it.

314
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,330
After the Western Chu was destroyed,

315
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,690
I think only the Medicine Valley kept

316
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,780
a secret record of how to make that drug.

317
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,660
Xin Baicao won't do it.

318
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,180
And Miss Bian has passed away.

319
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,690
Could it be

320
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,660
that the Night Crow is still alive?

321
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,450
I knew it.

322
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,180
But even if she knows the Art of Drugs,

323
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,020
it's not necessary

324
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,810
that she's the master of the drugged subject.

325
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,090
What do you mean by that?

326
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,970
All the drugged subjects have a master.

327
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,260
The person who makes the drug
needs to use blood as a medium.

328
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,690
And that drop of blood

329
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,610
needs to be the blood of the subject's family.

330
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,690
The most perfect way is to use the blood

331
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,690
of the subject's biological parents.

332
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,540
Without this medium,

333
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,210
the drugged subjects

334
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,260
will be killed by that drug instead.

335
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,420
No wonder those people died.

336
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,020
But Wuxin seemed different

337
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,940
from them.

338
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,570
He didn't look dead.

339
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,180
But whose blood can be used as a medium

340
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,850
to make that drug for him?

341
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,450
Consort Xuan.

342
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,780
Consort Xuan is Wuxin's mother.

343
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,140
If they need to use the blood
of a family member as the medium,

344
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,900
then, Consort Xuan is the only possible choice.

345
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,610
If you want to break this Art of Drugs,

346
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,180
you need to get that same drop of blood

347
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,850
from his family members.

348
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,570
So, if we want to save Wuxin,

349
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,330
we just need to find Consort Xuan.

350
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,570
We need Consort Xuan's blood.

351
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,540
Do we just need a drop of blood?

352
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,300
After you get the blood,

353
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,610
just give it to the Divine Healer.

354
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,660
And it'll be a walk in the park.

355
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,810
Thank you for answering my question.

356
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,180
Let's go.

357
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,420
Fansong.

358
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,660
Feixuan.

359
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,970
Why are you in Tianqi?

360
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:55,780
Lei...

361
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,210
Feixuan.

362
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,210
He's the younger brother of our master's wife.

363
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,900
How should we address him?

364
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,780
By seniority,

365
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,450
you need to call him Uncle.

366
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,940
And I need to call him Granduncle.

367
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,450
Hello, Uncle Lei.

368
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,860
Don't call me that.

369
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,140
It makes me sound old.

370
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,250
Forget it.

371
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,820
I'm quite happy to meet someone I know

372
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,010
in Tianqi City.

373
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,340
By the way,

374
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,900
why are you here at the Directorate of Astronomy?

375
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,490
I'm the one who asked them to come.

376
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:23,970
So,

377
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,730
when can I see him?

378
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,250
Who?

379
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,180
Dark River's leader.

380
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,180
Su Changhe.

381
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,970
He showed up yesterday.

382
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,210
He's working under Lord Chi, Xiao Yu, now.

383
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:35,690
What?

384
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,380
Besides, with your swordsmanship now,

385
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,900
you are not his match.

386
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,620
We need to plan this out.

387
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,210
Don't worry.

388
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,050
My master has passed down
his Scholarly Sword Technique to me.

389
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,250
And I've been practicing it all day long.

390
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,860
I'm no longer the same person.

391
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,660
The Scholarly Sword Technique?

392
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,970
He's learning

393
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,340
the Scholarly Sword Technique

394
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,490
from Mr. Xie Xuan now.

395
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,290
I see.

396
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,490
You've been taught by two sword deities.

397
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,580
You'll grow up to be a great swordsman
in the future.

398
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,010
Why choose the future when I can be great now?

399
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,250
Okay.

400
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,580
When the time comes,

401
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,290
I'll inform you.

402
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,690
Farewell for now.

403
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:11,380
Okay.

404
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,180
Where is Divine Healer Hua?

405
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,730
Your Majesty.

406
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,010
Divine Healer Hua caught a cold yesterday.

407
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,580
She doesn't want to infect you

408
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,420
and worsen your illness.

409
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,730
So, she sent her disciple, Mu Chunfeng,

410
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,660
to check on you.

411
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,180
Then, he'll report it to the Divine Healer

412
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,690
to plan for the next step of treatment.

413
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,660
Is it serious?

414
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,530
Your Majesty.

415
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,450
It was quite serious yesterday.

416
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,730
But a physician came today

417
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,660
to check on her.

418
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,290
According to him, she'll be fine.

419
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:50,820
She'll be able to enter the palace

420
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,250
in a few more days.

421
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,420
That's good.

422
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,730
What about Chong'er's eyes?

423
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,660
His eyes have recovered.

424
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,730
His Highness just needs to rest
for a few more days,

425
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,690
and he'll be able

426
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,970
to see again.

427
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,250
Does Divine Healer Hua's illness

428
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,770
have anything to do with this?

429
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,450
Your Majesty.

430
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,690
I didn't want you

431
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,690
to worry about it.

432
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,450
That's why I lied to you.

433
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,180
Who did it?

434
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,380
The Ninth Prince.

435
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,290
After he injured Divine Healer Hua Jin,

436
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,010
he tried to kill the Second Prince too.

437
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,250
But in the end, he was killed by a trap

438
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,450
in Lord Bai's Residence.

439
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,140
Jingxia?

440
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,420
He had always

441
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,730
been close to Chong, no?

442
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,380
We don't know why he did that either.

443
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:42,900
Your Majesty.

444
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,580
My deepest condolences to you.

445
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,340
Jingxia.

446
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,510
[Lord Bai's Residence]

447
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,820
Your Highness.

448
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,660
Zang Ming.

449
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,100
You should've told me that beforehand.

450
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,050
If I had told you about it,

451
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,490
you would have said no.

452
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,010
I've been with you

453
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,770
for so many years.

454
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,450
Do you think

455
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,490
I don't know you well?

456
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,250
But even if I can regain my eyesight,

457
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,250
by losing you,

458
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,290
I'll lose another person

459
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,340
who I can trust.

460
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,010
Now that you've regained your eyesight,

461
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,940
it's like you've regained your wings.

462
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,420
No one can stop you now.

463
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,970
It doesn't matter for you to lose

464
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,250
a useless guard like me.

465
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,180
So,

466
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,820
what happened that day?

467
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,180
That day,

468
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,660
I was stuck at Jingtai Palace and couldn't leave

469
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,660
because of a decree.

470
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,900
Obviously,

471
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,690
it was Lord Chi's doing.

472
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,820
After that, the assassins of Dark River

473
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,730
sneaked into Lord Bai's Residence.

474
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,900
Luckily, Lord Yong'an managed

475
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,820
to send his men here on time.

476
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,010
They managed to foil Lord Chi's plan.

477
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,620
The Ninth Prince betrayed you.

478
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,050
And he even attacked Divine Healer Hua Jin.

479
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:07,940
Luckily,

480
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,940
your eyes have recovered now.

481
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,100
And those who wanted to kill you

482
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,100
were defeated by Lord Yong'an and his men.

483
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,690
Jingxia?

484
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,140
Why did he do that?

485
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,380
Second Master.

486
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,770
Where is Jingxia?

487
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,250
He was killed by the trap

488
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,660
set by Lord Yong'an

489
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,180
and his men.

490
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,940
Jingxia.

491
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,970
Jingxia is dead.

492
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,940
Before coming here,

493
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,820
I met Lord Yong'an.

494
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,210
He told me

495
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,380
about what happened that night.

496
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,250
I'm curious.

497
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,820
Why did Lord Yong'an help you?

498
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,140
He treats me as his brother.

499
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,940
Although we both fight
for the crown prince position,

500
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,620
he doesn't see me as his enemy.

501
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,620
The crown prince is just a position.

502
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,180
But we are brothers.

503
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,340
When it comes to this,

504
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,900
none of the other princes

505
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,580
is as good as him.

506
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,250
His body has been sent to the Court of Judicature.

507
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,180
His Majesty has appointed

508
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,450
Marquis Lanyue to investigate the matter.

509
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,820
Second Master.

510
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,250
Tell Marquis Lanyue

511
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,770
that Xiao Jingxia died

512
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,340
because he accidentally

513
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,770
activated the trap.

514
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,820
Your Highness.

515
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,530
Say no more.

516
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,210
[Jingxue Pavilion]
Thank you

517
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,530
for treating Hua Jin.

518
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,940
You are welcome.

519
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,100
Before she got hurt,

520
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,490
she inserted a line

521
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,730
of silver needles into her body.

522
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,580
That is the secret skill of the Medicine Valley.

523
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,900
The Seven Soul-Preserving Needles.

524
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,580
Mr. Xie Xuan.

525
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,900
How is Divine Healer Hua?

526
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,420
She's fine now.

527
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,530
You've saved us

528
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,860
multiple times.

529
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,050
We are very grateful to you.

530
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,420
I didn't do anything much.

531
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,820
You are too kind.

532
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,380
If it wasn't

533
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,380
for the Nameless Book from you,

534
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,820
all of us

535
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,490
would have been killed by the Dark River.

536
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,730
Normal people won't be able to understand

537
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,100
the essence of a book.

538
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,250
But you can

539
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,050
because you have that capability.

540
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,180
How is going with the book

541
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,210
that I gave you last time?

542
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:33,970
Sir.

543
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,620
The Late Snow that you gave me

544
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,100
can be bought at three wen on the street.

545
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,380
They are not the same.

546
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,140
The one that I gave you

547
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,420
is the uncut version.

548
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,010
There's only one copy of it.

549
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,100
I've added a lot of extra scenes to it.

550
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,180
It'll be interesting.

551
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,450
Sir,

552
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,340
if there's only one copy of it,

553
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,620
why will you have it?

554
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:56,900
Well...

555
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,620
Who's the author of Late Snow?

556
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,660
The talented woman of Jiangnan, Xie Feixuan.

557
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,940
What's my name?

558
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,290
Your name is Xie...

559
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,420
Xie Xuan?

560
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:11,820
Then...

561
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,690
Then, the legendary woman of Jiangnan

562
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,450
with both beauty and talent is you?

563
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,580
Yes.

564
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,050
It's a little bit disgusting.

565
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,730
You want to pay a visit
to Consort Xuan in the harem?

566
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,100
Do you know

567
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,940
what kind of a person she is?

568
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,900
I only know

569
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,620
that she is Father's most beloved woman.

570
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,450
Your father has loved only two women

571
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,490
in his entire life.

572
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,860
One of them is your mother.

573
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,050
But unfortunately, she passed away

574
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,140
shortly after giving birth to you.

575
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,970
The other woman is Consort Xuan.

576
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,620
But Consort Xuan

577
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,100
is not just a beautiful woman.

578
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,450
Besides your father,

579
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,250
there are two more powerful men

580
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,530
who will be willing to die for her.

581
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,420
One of them

582
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,730
is the previous head of Tianwaitian,

583
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,860
Ye Dingzhi.

584
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,100
And the other man

585
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,770
is Luo Qingyang,
who won first place on the Top-Rank List.

586
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,580
Consort Xuan has lived in the palace alone
for so many years.

587
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,820
Finally, she gets to see Wuxin.

588
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,820
How are you going to tell her

589
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,820
that he has turned into a drugged subject?

590
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,620
But I need her blood.

591
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,250
Wuxin is her child.

592
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,820
And he's my friend.

593
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,250
I knew it.

594
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:26,940
Once you've made your decision,

595
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:27,970
no one can change your mind.

596
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,050
You know me well.

597
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,380
I've looked into it.

598
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,420
It was a drug from Lord Chi.

599
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,010
He agreed.

600
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,340
But was it really the Art of Drugs?

601
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,010
It had gone extinct

602
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,770
for many years, right?

603
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:47,940
The Art of Drugs.

604
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,210
Back then, we all saw the effect of it.

605
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,970
I saw the same thing

606
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,490
at Lord Bai's Residence.

607
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,620
And I'm sure you know

608
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,180
how a drugged subject will end up.

609
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,970
He once said

610
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:02,900
that he would lead us

611
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,660
into the light

612
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,210
so that we would never be seen as assassins.

613
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,210
But why has he

614
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,100
turned into a monster now?

615
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,140
His desire is too strong.

616
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,690
Sometimes,

617
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,690
our desire can push us to improve ourselves.

618
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:16,690
But sometimes,

619
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,250
it can lead us to our demise.

620
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,010
Back then, you said

621
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,380
that you wouldn't let Dark River
get involved in this.

622
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,100
But now,

623
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,380
there's no turning back for us.

624
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,820
I can only send you in.

625
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,180
I can't take you out.

626
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,970
But I'll prepare a carriage for you

627
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,860
at the east corner of the city.

628
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,660
Remember.

629
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,050
You have to leave

630
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,010
within two hours.

631
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,620
Otherwise, your ride will be gone.

632
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,580
Okay.

633
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,860
These are the outfits that I've prepared for you.

634
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,730
Change into them later.

635
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,580
Why do we have to get changed?

636
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,620
Xiao Se is a prince, right?

637
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,250
I can just follow him in.

638
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,530
You don't have to get changed during the day.

639
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,820
But it's nighttime now.

640
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,250
After the curfew,

641
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,530
no one is allowed to enter.

642
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,490
Moreover, you are going into the harem.

643
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,900
And he's a prince.

644
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,900
He needs to be even more careful.

645
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:08,380
Okay.

646
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,340
These are women's clothes.

647
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,140
I told you just now, right?

648
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,530
You are going into the harem.

649
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:19,970
You need to dress up as the palace maids

650
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,900
so that you won't draw
any attention to yourselves.

651
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,290
But won't it be even more obvious

652
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,420
for two men to dress up

653
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,250
as palace maids?

654
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:32,940
Xiao Se.

655
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,620
Why do you look like

656
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,860
you are looking forward to it

657
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,820
instead of dreading it?

658
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,380
Why are you so noisy?

659
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,250
By talking so much,

660
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,530
it means that you are excited.

661
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:42,860
Is wearing women's clothes

662
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,490
making you so excited?

663
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,140
If I had known,

664
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,660
I would've asked Qianluo to come with you.

665
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:53,900
Xiao Se.

666
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,730
You look good in this.

667
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,050
Shut up, you idiot.

668
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,970
Don't you tell anyone about this.

669
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:23,970
This is bad.

670
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,690
Xiao Se.

671
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,770
What's wrong?

672
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,860
Look at her.

673
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,050
She's not that much older than we are.

674
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,620
How can she be Lord Chi's mother?

675
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,730
She is his mother.

676
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,100
She just looks young.

677
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,210
But she's almost 40 already.

678
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,970
I didn't ask for you.

679
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,530
Why did you come in?

680
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,050
Let's go in.

681
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,690
Are you the new palace maids from Jingtai Palace?

682
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,490
Why haven't I seen you before?

683
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,420
Both of you are quite pretty.

684
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,690
But you are quite big.

685
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,250
Like a man.

686
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,100
What a pity.

687
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,690
Consort Xuan.

688
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,250
Are you going to drop the act now?

689
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,620
Xiao Se.

690
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,340
She sees through us right away.

691
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,580
She is Luo Qingyang's martial sister.

692
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,250
And she's the daughter
of the head of the Shadow Sect.

693
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,970
The Shadow Sect is the master of disguise.

694
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,730
Even if we can fool others,

695
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,770
we can't fool her.

696
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,250
You look like your father

697
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,970
and your mother.

698
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,860
Lord Yong'an.

699
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,490
Sorry for this.

700
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,250
Greetings, Consort Xuan.

701
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,340
Lord Yong'an.

702
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,210
You sneaked into the harem at night.

703
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,340
And you've brought

704
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,180
a fighter with you.

705
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,290
Are you here

706
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,820
to kill someone?

707
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,820
-No.
-No...

708
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,450
We just want a drop of blood from you.

709
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,380
A drop of blood?

710
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,210
Why?

711
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,660
I have a friend

712
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,420
who was poisoned lately.

713
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,660
And he was poisoned

714
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,380
because of a drop of your blood.

715
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,860
For the same reason,

716
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,180
if I want to cure him,

717
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,010
I'll need a drop of blood from you too.

718
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,690
Before this, Yu'er came

719
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,620
to get a drop of blood from me too.

720
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:24,690
Is that

721
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,860
related to this matter?

722
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,580
I wonder why

723
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,050
my blood can be made into poison

724
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,580
and an antidote.

725
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,900
That drop of blood that Yu got from you

726
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,820
is the poison that I'm talking about.

727
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,490
As for why your blood

728
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,580
can be made into poison and an antidote,

729
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,380
it's because that person who was poisoned

730
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,340
has the same blood

731
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,580
as you.

732
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,050
What is the name of your friend?

733
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,340
He's the son of the previous head

734
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,420
of Tianwaitian,

735
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,690
Ye Anshi.

736
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,940
Is he back?

737
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,140
You don't know that?

738
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,530
I haven't left this place

739
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,970
for a long time.

740
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,770
No one tells me

741
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,820
about what happened outside the palace.

742
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,100
And I don't want to know.

743
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,050
To this world,

744
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,900
I'm just a dead person.

745
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:22,660
Your Highness.

746
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,730
I have no right

747
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,100
to know about what happened

748
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,900
between you, Ye Dingzhi, and my father.

749
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,660
But in this world,

750
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,140
someone will remember you

751
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,820
and miss you.

752
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,450
A person will only be considered dead

753
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,140
when no one in this world

754
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,580
remembers that person.

755
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,820
But this friend of mine

756
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,620
thinks of you all the time

757
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,530
and even visited you.

758
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,420
His eyebrows

759
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,050
are as nice as yours.

760
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,210
What is the name

761
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,340
of your child?

762
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:57,860
His name is

763
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,940
Ye Anshi.

764
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,690
That's a nice name.

765
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,010
Was that him?

766
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:12,690
Well...

767
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,210
Your Highness.

768
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,010
Your Highness, we don't have much time.

769
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,900
Please, Your Highness.

770
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,940
Thank you, Your Highness.

771
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,420
Hold on.

772
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,770
If you see him again,

773
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,660
ask him not to visit me anymore.

774
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,900
I understand.

775
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:09,900
Yu'er.

776
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:14,530
Mother.

777
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,420
That day, you said that you wanted to pray for me

778
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,940
at the Directorate of Astronomy.

779
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,250
And you wanted to use my blood for the talisman.

780
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,180
I knew that you were not telling the truth.

781
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,690
But I gave you my blood anyway.

782
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,620
However, I never thought

783
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,580
that you would use it

784
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,730
to harm your own brother.

785
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,180
You already know.

786
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,770
But I don't have a brother.

787
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,580
He's just

788
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,770
another child of yours.

789
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,820
We don't have the same blood

790
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,900
running inside us.

791
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,770
Why do you have to harm him, then?

792
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,580
If I don't do that,

793
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,290
he'll help

794
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,100
those two just now to harm me.

795
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,050
Do you want to kill your child

796
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,450
to save another child of yours?

797
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,380
Move aside.

798
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,210
Please don't step out of this room!

799
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,570
I just want to live.

800
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,090
And I promise you

801
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,010
that your other child

802
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:13,970
will live too.

803
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,530
But it has to wait

804
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,490
until everything has ended.

805
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:25,780
Look.

806
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:26,970
We've changed back into our outfits.

807
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:27,820
And the rain has stopped.

808
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,010
Let's hurry up and leave now.

809
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,610
There'll be more people

810
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,570
in the palace soon.

811
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,820
Why did we

812
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,650
get changed then?

813
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,380
We'll stand out

814
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,260
even more now.

815
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,820
Since

816
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,970
we've gotten what we want,

817
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,090
if we were to be found,

818
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,700
I wouldn't want to be found in those outfits.

819
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,380
If someone sees us,

820
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,610
you can stop them

821
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,650
while I run away.

822
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:48,900
No.

823
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,700
You are a prince.

824
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,610
You should be the one
to stop them while I run away.

825
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,130
It shouldn't be the other way around.

826
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,420
I am a prince.

827
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,860
If someone finds me in the harem,

828
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,860
it'll ruin my reputation.

829
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,300
But you are not afraid of that, right?

830
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:01,820
What about me?

831
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:02,700
What will happen to me

832
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,530
if they find me here?

833
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,610
You are a commoner.

834
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,220
You'll be killed for sneaking into the harem.

835
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,420
You don't even have to go through a trial.

836
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,970
You'll just be killed.

837
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,820
You are really a good friend.

838
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:19,970
Xiao Se.

839
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,940
Someone has really found us.

840
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,570
Who are you?

841
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,490
I'm here to kill you.

842
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,300
It's you.

843
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,300
Why are you in the palace?

844
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,130
Xiao Se.

845
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,010
Xiao Se.

846
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,450
This kind of technique.

847
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,380
And this kind of power.

848
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,260
I'm not wrong.

849
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,010
Eunuch Jinyu?

850
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:55,570
Now,

851
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,130
I've returned the favor on behalf of Chong'er.

852
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,170
Go now.

853
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:00,570
Let's go.

854
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,450
Who are you?

855
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,130
The Art of Detachment.

856
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,900
But my master is dead.

857
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,300
I did the autopsy on his body.

858
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,490
Who are you?

859
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,260
Why do you have to insist on knowing?

860
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:37,820
When we

861
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,860
fought for the first time,

862
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,530
I already knew

863
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,860
that I am no match for you.

864
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,130
But you took down my mask.

865
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,380
Now, I can't spare your life

866
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,940
even if I want to.

867
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,490
Is he really worth your sacrifice?

868
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,900
He will be a good emperor.

869
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,610
You

870
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,260
read too much.

871
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,490
There's no such thing

872
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,530
as a good emperor.

873
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,860
There will always be good men in this world.

874
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,700
Only the villains won't believe that.

875
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,050
Then, let this villain

876
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,650
take the life of this gentleman.

877
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:35,780
Chong'er.

878
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,130
I won't live

879
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,260
to see the day when you become

880
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,340
the Emperor.

881
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:51,970
Xiao Se.

882
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,610
Who is that person just now?

883
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,380
He is the one who destroyed
my ability to practice martial arts back then.

884
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,170
So it's someone from the palace?

885
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,900
I will never forget

886
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,130
that creepy internal energy of this.

887
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,090
Who is he?

888
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:10,970
For him to be there

889
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,780
with such a powerful internal energy

890
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,820
that has the characteristics of yin,

891
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,570
I'm sure he's one of the Five Eunuchs.

892
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,180
[In memory of the deceased]

893
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,380
There's no wound on his body.

894
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,700
And his face is in a resting state.

895
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,820
He's not killed by anyone.

896
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,490
He's taken by natural death.

897
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,420
This is the conclusion

898
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,820
from the Imperial Medical Academy.

899
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,010
No one knows about Jinyu's martial art skills

900
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,900
better than us.

901
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,780
I'm afraid the murderer's internal energy

902
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,420
is more powerful than the three of us.

903
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,690
Who was it

904
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,490
that shattered his veins?

905
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,210
Or maybe

906
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,260
that person

907
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,300
practices

908
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,740
the art of gentle internal energy.

909
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:02,650
The Art of Detachment.

910
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,210
But our master is dead.

911
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,820
The Art of Detachment

912
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:08,900
no longer exists.

913
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:10,900
Really?

914
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,570
I don't think so.

915
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,690
All these years,

916
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,610
we haven't given up

917
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,740
on learning this technique.

918
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,940
Our master left behind the incomplete book.

919
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,490
Except for Jinyu,

920
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,130
none of us have stopped practicing it.

921
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,050
But as for how much

922
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,010
we've learned from it,

923
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,380
we are the only ones who know.

924
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,690
Are you saying

925
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,050
that it was one of us

926
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,010
who killed Jinyu?

927
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,260
You can't say that.

928
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,130
I'm not Director Zhuoqing's disciple.

929
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,260
I don't know anything about the Art of Detachment.

930
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,130
If you don't believe me,

931
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,900
you can test me out.

932
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,740
But your master is not dead.

933
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,170
He is Zhuoqing's martial brother.
